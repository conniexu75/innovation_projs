https://openalex.org/W3154372950,"The emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the urgent need for an in-depth understanding of molecular functions of viral proteins and their interactions with the host proteome. Several individual omics studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology1-10. Integration of such datasets to obtain a holistic view of virus-host interactions and to define the pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 is limited by the heterogeneity of the experimental systems. Here we report a concurrent multi-omics study of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Using state-of-the-art proteomics, we profiled the interactomes of both viruses, as well as their influence on the transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed crosstalk between the perturbations taking place upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at different levels and enabled identification of distinct and common molecular mechanisms of these closely related coronaviruses. The TGF-β pathway, known for its involvement in tissue fibrosis, was specifically dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and autophagy was specifically dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3. The extensive dataset (available at https://covinet.innatelab.org ) highlights many hotspots that could be targeted by existing drugs and may be used to guide rational design of virus- and host-directed therapies, which we exemplify by identifying inhibitors of kinases and matrix metalloproteases with potent antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3155280715,"Genome editing has therapeutic potential for treating genetic diseases and cancer. However, the currently most practicable approaches rely on the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can give rise to a poorly characterized spectrum of chromosome structural abnormalities. Here, using model cells and single-cell whole-genome sequencing, as well as by editing at a clinically relevant locus in clinically relevant cells, we show that CRISPR-Cas9 editing generates structural defects of the nucleus, micronuclei and chromosome bridges, which initiate a mutational process called chromothripsis. Chromothripsis is extensive chromosome rearrangement restricted to one or a few chromosomes that can cause human congenital disease and cancer. These results demonstrate that chromothripsis is a previously unappreciated on-target consequence of CRISPR-Cas9-generated DSBs. As genome editing is implemented in the clinic, the potential for extensive chromosomal rearrangements should be considered and monitored."
https://openalex.org/W3156830838,"In contrast to single-cell approaches for measuring gene expression and DNA accessibility, single-cell methods for analyzing histone modifications are limited by low sensitivity and throughput. Here, we combine the CUT&Tag technology, developed to measure bulk histone modifications, with droplet-based single-cell library preparation to produce high-quality single-cell data on chromatin modifications. We apply single-cell CUT&Tag (scCUT&Tag) to tens of thousands of cells of the mouse central nervous system and probe histone modifications characteristic of active promoters, enhancers and gene bodies (H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K36me3) and inactive regions (H3K27me3). These scCUT&Tag profiles were sufficient to determine cell identity and deconvolute regulatory principles such as promoter bivalency, spreading of H3K4me3 and promoter-enhancer connectivity. We also used scCUT&Tag to investigate the single-cell chromatin occupancy of transcription factor OLIG2 and the cohesin complex component RAD21. Our results indicate that analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy at single-cell resolution provides unique insights into epigenomic landscapes in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3152171186,"By following up the gut microbiome, 51 human phenotypes and plasma levels of 1,183 metabolites in 338 individuals after 4 years, we characterize microbial stability and variation in relation to host physiology. Using these individual-specific and temporally stable microbial profiles, including bacterial SNPs and structural variations, we develop a microbial fingerprinting method that shows up to 85% accuracy in classifying metagenomic samples taken 4 years apart. Application of our fingerprinting method to the independent HMP cohort results in 95% accuracy for samples taken 1 year apart. We further observe temporal changes in the abundance of multiple bacterial species, metabolic pathways, and structural variation, as well as strain replacement. We report 190 longitudinal microbial associations with host phenotypes and 519 associations with plasma metabolites. These associations are enriched for cardiometabolic traits, vitamin B, and uremic toxins. Finally, mediation analysis suggests that the gut microbiome may influence cardiometabolic health through its metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W3156542847,"Depression is a common condition, but current treatments are only effective in a subset of individuals. To identify new treatment targets, we integrated depression genome-wide association study (GWAS) results (N = 500,199) with human brain proteomes (N = 376) to perform a proteome-wide association study of depression followed by Mendelian randomization. We identified 19 genes that were consistent with being causal in depression, acting via their respective cis-regulated brain protein abundance. We replicated nine of these genes using an independent depression GWAS (N = 307,353) and another human brain proteomic dataset (N = 152). Eleven of the 19 genes also had cis-regulated mRNA levels that were associated with depression, based on integration of the depression GWAS with human brain transcriptomes (N = 888). Meta-analysis of the discovery and replication proteome-wide association study analyses identified 25 brain proteins consistent with being causal in depression, 20 of which were not previously implicated in depression by GWAS. Together, these findings provide promising brain protein targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies."
https://openalex.org/W3153403308,"A bispecific antibody (BsAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor (MET) pathways represents a novel approach to overcome resistance to targeted therapies in patients with non–small cell lung cancer. In this study, we sequentially screened a panel of BsAbs in a combinatorial approach to select the optimal bispecific molecule. The BsAbs were derived from different EGFR and MET parental monoclonal antibodies. Initially, molecules were screened for EGFR and MET binding on tumor cell lines and lack of agonistic activity toward MET. Hits were identified and further screened based on their potential to induce untoward cell proliferation and cross-phosphorylation of EGFR by MET via receptor colocalization in the absence of ligand. After the final step, we selected the EGFR and MET arms for the lead BsAb and added low fucose Fc engineering to generate amivantamab (JNJ-61186372). The crystal structure of the anti-MET Fab of amivantamab bound to MET was solved, and the interaction between the two molecules in atomic details was elucidated. Amivantamab antagonized the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced signaling by binding to MET Sema domain and thereby blocking HGF β-chain—Sema engagement. The amivantamab EGFR epitope was mapped to EGFR domain III and residues K443, K465, I467, and S468. Furthermore, amivantamab showed superior antitumor activity over small molecule EGFR and MET inhibitors in the HCC827-HGF in vivo model. Based on its unique mode of action, amivantamab may provide benefit to patients with malignancies associated with aberrant EGFR and MET signaling.

Treatment strategies targeting both receptors using a combination of single-agent EGFR and MET inhibitors do not cover the wide range of resistance mechanisms (13Scagliotti G.V. Moro-Sibilot D.

Simultaneous engagement of both EGFR and MET, through a bispecific antibody (BsAb), is a potential strategy to overcome resistance and achieve greater efficacy (15Puri N. Salgia R. Synergism of EGFR and c-Met pathways, cross-talk and inhibition, in non-small cell lung cancer.J. Carcinog. 2008; 7: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Identification of an antagonist antibody targeting MET can be challenging as the mechanism of action depends on the valency of the antibody for the tumor target antigen. Such antibodies are referred to as anti-MET, which modulate the activity of c-Met, also called tyrosine-protein kinase Met or hepatocyte growth factor receptor, which is a protein encoded by the MET gene. Upon ligand binding, MET dimerizes and initiates signaling pathway activation (16Luraghi P. Schelter F. Kruger A. Boccaccio C. The MET oncogene as a therapeutical target in cancer invasive growth.Front. Pharmacol. 2012; 3: 164Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, antibodies that induce dimerization of MET may have agonistic activity (17Husain B. Ellerman D. Expanding the boundaries of biotherapeutics with bispecific antibodies.BioDrugs. 2018; 32: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although antagonistic bivalent MET monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been reported (18Liu L.

Thus, we embarked on discovering a molecule with a different molecular format and distinct epitope to improve efficacy. BsAbs that target EGFR and MET through distinct epitopes and architecture have had varying clinical results (25Lee B.S. Kim H.J. Hwang J.W. Cheong K.H. Kim K.A. Cha H.Y. Lee J.M. Kim C.H.

To maximize inhibition of EGFR and MET pathways, we aimed at discovering a novel BsAb that combines all the previously described mechanisms of action for EGFR and MET antibodies but without inducing receptor dimerization and activation. The BsAb would have two binding arms: one monovalent arm that engages EGFR and the other monovalent arm that engages MET. To enable the selection of the optimal bispecific molecule, we screened a panel of BsAbs in an empirical approach that led to the selection of amivantamab (JNJ-61186372), an EGFR × MET BsAb that has activity in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC models (29Moores S.L.

Here, we describe a versatile selection strategy, provide structural insights in the binding of amivantamab, and present novel functional in vivo antitumor data. The controlled Fab-arm exchange (cFAE) platform was used to generate a panel of 40 (5 MET parental mAbs with 8 EGFR parental mAbs) MET × EGFR BsAbs in the DuoBody format (30Labrijn A.F. Meesters J.I. de Goeij B.E. van den Bremer E.T. Neijssen J. van Kampen M.D. Strumane K. Verploegen S. Kundu A. Gramer M.J. van Berkel P.H. van de Winkel J.G. Schuurman J. Parren P.W. Efficient generation of stable bispecific IgG1 by controlled Fab-arm exchange.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 5145-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The BsAb quality was confirmed as being monodisperse by size-exclusion chromatography and purity by SDS-PAGE. The anti-gp120 antibody b12 was included as a nonbinding arm of control BsAbs that had either an EGFR or MET binding arm to generate monovalent control antibodies. The parental antibodies were chosen to cover a broad epitope space for both MET and EGFR mAbs from different cross-block groups, sequence diversity (unique heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 [CDR-H3] sequence clusters), binding affinity (human–cynomolgus monkey cross-reactivity for EGFR mAbs; human–rhesus monkey cross-reactivity for MET mAbs), and ligand-blocking ability (Table S1). Since residual parental MET homodimer mAbs can result in an agonistic response, an excess of EGFR homodimer mAb was used in the cFAE reaction to minimize the levels of residual MET homodimer mAbs. The cFAE preparations were analyzed by cation exchange chromatography to confirm the generation of BsAb species and to determine the percentage of residual homodimer in the batches. The homodimer materials were included as reference in the same run. The cation exchange chromatography showed successful generation of a BsAb species was observed after the exchange process when there was a peak located in between the elution peaks of the two-originating parental mAb homodimer peaks. The percentage of residual homodimers are listed in Table S2. We used an elimination strategy to discard BsAb molecules with unwanted properties at predefined decision points: sufficient monovalent binding affinity (EC50 <1 μg/ml, which is within the range of serum concentration of a therapeutic mAb (31Lobo E.D. Hansen R.J. Balthasar J.P. Antibody pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.J. Pharm. Sci. 2004; 93: 2645-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar)), minimal induction of EGFR and MET phosphorylation, and minimal cell proliferation via direct or cross talk activation of EGFR and MET. The first phase of the selection process focused on the binding properties of the antibodies (Fig. 1B). A key requirement of the BsAb was the ability to bind both targets in a monovalent format with affinity EC50 <1 μg/ml. Molecules with EC50 >1 μg/ml were considered low or poor binders and discarded (Fig. 2A). Functionally monovalent MET×b12 BsAbs bound well to all cell lines tested, whereas the reactivity of the EGFR panel was more diverse with monovalent EGFR C, EGFR D, EGFR F, and EGFR G BsAbs binding poorly (EC50 >1 μg/ml). Binding for monovalent EGFR BsAbs was ranked EGFR H > EGFR E > EGFR B > EGFR A; for monovalent MET BsAbs, binding was ranked MET B > MET A > MET C > MET D > MET E. None of the MET×EGFR BsAb combinations had enhanced binding as compared with their respective monovalent controls (data not shown). In A549 cells, MET was not phosphorylated under steady-state conditions in the absence of HGF. An agonistic bivalent antibody MET 5D5 IgG1 and a functionally monovalent bispecific version of MET 5D5 (MET 5D5×b12) were used as positive and negative controls for MET phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 2B; Western blots quantified agonistic activity of antibodies Fig. S1). BsAbs with a score ≥3 and 4 were deselected (Fig. 2C). None of the tested bivalent EGFR parental mAbs induced MET phosphorylation. Although all bivalent MET parental mAbs induced MET phosphorylation, no agonistic activity of the METxb12 BsAb combinations was observed, confirming the hypothesis that MET agonistic antibodies can be converted to antagonistic molecules by using (functionally) monovalent formats (20Merchant M. Ma X. Maun H.R. Zheng Z. Peng J. Romero M. Huang A. Yang N.Y. Nishimura M. Greve J. Santell L. Zhang Y.W. Su Y. Kaufman D.W. Billeci K.L. et al.Monovalent antibody design and mechanism of action of onartuzumab, a MET antagonist with anti-tumor activity as a therapeutic agent.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: E2987-E2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Some bispecific MET×EGFR molecules induced MET phosphorylation, suggesting that binding of EGFR and MET on the same cell could result in MET dimerization and activation or phosphorylation of MET in trans. BsAbs containing the MET C arm that were identified as MET agonists, as with variants with MET arms B, D, and E with scores of 3 to 4, were excluded from further analysis (Fig. 2C). No combinations containing EGFR H were agonistic, even when combined with MET C, which induced medium to high phosphorylation with other EGFR binders. Furthermore, molecules containing MET A did not induce MET phosphorylation. We excluded BsAbs containing the EGFR A, C, D, F, and G arms since they failed the required specifications for affinity and/or induced MET phosphorylation in the A549 phosphorylation assay. We examined the impact of receptor phosphorylation via proliferation assays of cell lines with differing levels of EGFR and MET. The remaining EGFR×MET BsAb panel was further tested for (1) inhibition of HGF-driven KP4 cell proliferation expressing an autocrine HGF–MET loop and (2) inhibition of H1975 cell proliferation driven by the EGFR signaling pathway. The percentage of cell proliferation relative to the isotype (negative) control b12 IgG1 in KP4 cells was evaluated at 0.014, 0.37, and 10 μg/ml BsAb concentrations. All BsAbs showed a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation, except molecules containing the MET D and MET E arms (Fig. 3A). This was expected as the parental MET mAbs were unable to block HGF binding to MET in vitro (data not shown). Molecules containing the MET A, MET B, and MET C arms had the strongest inhibition of proliferation compared with cells treated with the isotype control. The percentage of cell proliferation relative to 10 μg/ml b12 IgG1 negative control and bivalent EGFR-H positive control in H1975 cells was evaluated. The bivalent anti-MET 5D5 IgG1 was included as a control agonistic mAb. Except for the positive control and EGFR H BsAb combinations, none of the BsAbs inhibited proliferation of H1975 (Fig. 3B). A third proliferation assay was conducted using NCI-H441 cell lines with equivalent levels of EGFR and MET (Table S3). The NCI-H441 proliferation assay identified agonistic MET×EGFR BsAb. BsAbs MET A×EGFR B, MET A×EGFR E, MET A×EGFR H, MET D×EGFR B and MET D×EGFR H induced mild proliferation of NCI-H441 cells, albeit less pronounced than the agonist MET 5D5 IgG1 control (Fig. 3C). Based on these proliferation assays, we deselected BsAb combinations containing MET A, MET D, and MET E crossed with EGFR B arms. BsAbs with the MET B and C arms in combination with EGFR H were selected for further characterization. The identified molecules did not induce MET phosphorylation in A549 cells, yet some induced proliferation of NCI-H441 cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that another signaling pathway could be activated due to induction of EGFR phosphorylation via cross-linking of MET and EGFR (32Agarwal S.

A. 2008; 105: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To identify agonistic BsAbs that induced EGFR activation in the absence of EGFR ligand and inhibited ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation, we lysed cell lines treated with the antibodies and determined EGFR Tyr1068 phosphorylation. In A549 cells, which have low MET and moderate EGFR expression, no EGFR phosphorylation was observed in unstimulated cells. Clear EGFR phosphorylation was observed by treating the cells with EGF and effectively blocked by BsAbs containing EGFR H, partially by BsAb MET C×EGFR E, and not by the MET A×b12 BsAb control (Fig. 3D). In contrast to EGFR H, the EGFR E epitope was located outside the EGF binding site and did not block EGF binding to EGFR (not shown). No EGFR phosphorylation was observed by any of the tested MET×EGFR BsAbs in the absence of EGF, confirming the lack of MET-induced EGFR cross-phosphorylation in A549 cells. Only BsAbs containing the EGFR H arm inhibited H1975 cell proliferation and EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation in A549 cells. Hence, BsAbs with any other EGFR arm were rejected. BsAbs containing the MET C arm were also discarded as all combinations containing this arm and an EGFR arm with affinity EC50 values <1 μg/ml also induced MET phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). BsAbs containing the MET D and E arms poorly inhibited KP4 cell proliferation, rendering them unsuitable (Fig. 3A). BsAbs containing MET A and D arms were slightly agonistic in the NCI-H441 proliferation assay, although the effect was small compared with the positive control MET 5D5 IgG1 (Fig. 3C). Altogether, the MET B×EGFR H BsAb showed the most optimal properties and with growth in a proprietary cell line for production of parental mAbs with low fucose Fc production, the BsAb became amivantamab. The crystal structure of the MET B Fab arm of amivantamab bound to human MET Sema-PSI region was solved to better understand the potent inhibition of MET signaling. The structure of the Fab–Sema-PSI complex was determined to 3.1-Å resolution with one complex in the P43212 asymmetric unit (Table S4). The structure contained MET residues 40 to 564 with glycans N-linked to residues N45, N106, N149, N202, and N405, Fab heavy chain residues 1 to 222, and Fab light chain residues 1 to 213. The Fab–Sema-PSI combining site was well defined by the electron density, which allowed reliable positioning of the binding residues. The amivantamab Fab bound to the MET Sema domain using all CDRs except CDR-H1 (Fig. 4A). The Sema domain had a seven-bladed β-propeller with four antiparallel β-strands per blade. The Fab bound to the outside wall of the propeller via interactions predominantly with the long loops connecting propeller blades 1 to 2 (loop 1–2; epitope residues D94, F96-D100, and S103-N106) and blades 2 to 3 (loop 2–3; epitope residues F162-P164, I166, and E167). The Fab also had interactions with intra-blade 3 loop C2D3 (epitope residues T222 and D224) and the disulfide-bonded pair (C98-C160) that bridged β-strand D2 with the mid-region of loop 1 to 2. The Fab CDR-H2, -H3, -L2, and -L3 (paratope residues W50H, N55H, Y57H, N59H, L100H -Y105H, D107H, Y49L, A50L, S52L, L55L, S56L, and A91L -F94L) were positioned along the folded mid-section of loop 1 to 2, stabilizing this long loop in a folded down conformation. CDR-L1 (paratope residues S30-W32) interacted exclusively with loops 2 to 3 and C2D3 (Fig. 4, A and B). The large 1000 Å2 interface between the Fab and Sema was dominated by polar interactions (Fig. 4B). Of the 18 epitope residues, 11 had hydrogen bond interactions with the Fab—the paratope counterpart had 10 of the 23 residues having hydrogen bonds with Sema. The tightly packed interface between the Fab and Sema domains involve hydrogen bond interactions between both protein backbone atoms. Epitope residues D94, Q99, K104, P164, and I166 of MET were buried into the Sema–Fab combining site and had extensive interactions with the Fab (Fig. 4, B and C). The side chain of D94 had a hydrogen bond contact with the side chain of R101 (CDR-H3), but these residues could adopt different conformations in solution and form a stronger salt bridge interaction. Q99 and K104 had hydrogen bond contacts with the carbonyl group of G102 (CDR-H3), a glycine strategically located in a crowded region of the combining site (Fig. 4B). P164, F96, P97, F162, and P164 constituted the lining of a shallow cavity on Sema. F96 and F162 formed a cluster of aromatic residues with Fab residues W32 (CDR-L1), Y49 (CDR-L2), and Y105 (CDR-H3). I166 was buried by a portion of this aromatic cluster and the side chain of residues L100, D107 (CDR-H3), and L55 (CDR-L2). Taken together, these paratope–epitope interactions mediated a high level of specificity to amivantamab binding to MET. Amivantamab Fab binding to MET stabilized the Sema loop 1 to 2 in a conformation slightly different from other MET structures (Protein Data Bank [PDB] codes 1SHY, 4K3J, 2UZX, and 2UZY) (20Merchant M.

https://openalex.org/W3154183236,"Most eukaryotes harbor two distinct pre-mRNA splicing machineries: the major spliceosome, which removes >99% of introns, and the minor spliceosome, which removes rare, evolutionarily conserved introns. Although hypothesized to serve important regulatory functions, physiologic roles of the minor spliceosome are not well understood. For example, the minor spliceosome component ZRSR2 is subject to recurrent, leukemia-associated mutations, yet functional connections among minor introns, hematopoiesis and cancers are unclear. Here, we identify that impaired minor intron excision via ZRSR2 loss enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. CRISPR screens mimicking nonsense-mediated decay of minor intron-containing mRNA species converged on LZTR1, a regulator of RAS-related GTPases. LZTR1 minor intron retention was also discovered in the RASopathy Noonan syndrome, due to intronic mutations disrupting splicing and diverse solid tumors. These data uncover minor intron recognition as a regulator of hematopoiesis, noncoding mutations within minor introns as potential cancer drivers and links among ZRSR2 mutations, LZTR1 regulation and leukemias."

Yang et al. analyzed blood samples from young children and adults, as well as tissues from deceased organ donors, characterizing the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires specific to six common pathogens and two viruses that they had not seen before: Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Children had higher frequencies of B cells with convergent BCR heavy chains against previously encountered pathogens and higher frequencies of class-switched convergent B cell clones against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. These findings suggest that encounters with coronaviruses in early life may produce cross-reactive memory B cell populations that contribute to divergent COVID-19 susceptibilities.

https://openalex.org/W3115804594,"Flavonoids are a class of specialized metabolites with subclasses including flavonols and anthocyanins, which have unique properties as antioxidants. Flavonoids modulate plant development, but whether and how they impact lateral root development is unclear. We examined potential roles for flavonols in this process using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in genes encoding key enzymes in flavonoid biosynthesis. We observed the tt4 and fls1 mutants, which produce no flavonols, have increased lateral root emergence. The tt4 root phenotype was reversed by genetic and chemical complementation. To more specifically define the flavonoids involved, we tested an array of flavonoid biosynthetic mutants, eliminating roles for anthocyanins and the flavonols quercetin and isorhamnetin in modulating lateral root development. Instead, two tt7 mutant alleles, with defects in a branchpoint enzyme blocking quercetin biosynthesis, formed reduced numbers of lateral roots and tt7-2 had elevated levels of kaempferol. Using a flavonol-specific dye, we observed that in the tt7-2 mutant, kaempferol accumulated within lateral root primordia at higher levels than wild-type. These data are consistent with kaempferol, or downstream derivatives, acting as a negative regulator of lateral root emergence. We examined ROS accumulation using ROS-responsive probes and found reduced fluorescence of a superoxide-selective probe within the primordia of tt7-2 compared with wild-type, but not in the tt4 mutant, consistent with opposite effects of these mutants on lateral root emergence. These results support a model in which increased level of kaempferol in the lateral root primordia of tt7-2 reduces superoxide concentration and ROS-stimulated lateral root emergence.

Flavonoids are a class of plant specialized metabolites with important functions in modulating development and stress responses (1Chapman J.M. Muhlemann J.K. Gayomba S.R. Muday G.K.

Recent Advances in Polyphenol Research. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, 2017: 143-170Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There are multiple subclasses of flavonoids including chalcones, flavones, isoflavonoids, flavanones, flavonols, and anthocyanins (3Winkel-Shirley B. Flavonoid biosynthesis. A colorful model for genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and biotechnology.Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). The pathway begins with the conversion of 4-Coumaroyl CoA and Malonyl CoA to naringenin chalcone. Further downstream, dihydroflavonols are produced and can be converted to either flavonols or anthocyanins. Flavonols and anthocyanins are two of the best studied flavonoid subclasses due to their ubiquitous presence in multiple species, their diverse functionality (4Panche A.N. Diwan A.D. Chandra S.R. Flavonoids: an overview.J. Nutr. Sci. 2016; 5: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar), and antioxidant capacity (5Agati G. Azzarello E. Pollastri S. Tattini M.

Flavonoid antioxidants: chemistry, metabolism and structure-activity relationships.J. Nutr. Biochem. 2002; 13: 572-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana synthesizes three flavonols: kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin, which differ by the presence of a hydroxyl or methoxy group on their ring. The flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is well characterized in Arabidopsis with mutants isolated in the genes encoding each of the enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway (3Winkel-Shirley B. Flavonoid biosynthesis. A colorful model for genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and biotechnology.Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Flavonoid biosynthetic mutants have been used to better understand the role of flavonols as signaling molecules that modulate development. The Arabidopsis transparent testa 4 (tt4) mutant produces no flavonoids due to a mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, chalcone synthase (CHS). Previous studies showed that tt4 has increased root hair formation (9Gayomba S.R. Muday G.K. Flavonols regulate root hair development by modulating accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the root epidermis.Development. 2020; 147dev185819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ABA-induced stomatal closure (10Watkins J.M.

Additional pathway mutants have been used to reveal which flavonols function in development, including identification of specific kaempferol derivatives that regulate leaf shape (13Ringli C.

Using mutants impaired in flavonol biosynthesis in crop species, such as tomato, has also highlighted the role of flavonol metabolites in modulating environmentally responsive signaling pathways, such as ABA-dependent guard cell signaling that induces stomatal closure (14Watkins J.M. Chapman J.M. Muday G.K. Abscisic acid-induced reactive oxygen species are modulated by flavonols to control stomata aperture.Plant Physiol. 2017; 175: 1807-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and temperature-impaired pollen viability and pollen tube growth (15Muhlemann J.K.

The primary root forms within the embryo and emerges from the seedling. Lateral roots form post embryonically to increase root branching for stability and to maximize nutrient and water uptake (47Lynch J.

Flavonoids have been suggested to regulate lateral root development, based on an increased number of lateral roots in plants with mutations in the gene encoding the first committed step of flavonoid biosynthesis catalyzed by chalcone synthase. Although both tt4(2YY6) (18Brown D.E. Rashotte A.M. Murphy A.S. Normanly J. Tague B.W. Peer W.A. Taiz L. Muday G.K.

Djordjevic M.A. Architectural phenotypes in the transparent testa mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana.J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) mutants form more lateral roots than wild-type, the specific flavonoids that modulate this process have not been examined, and it is not clear whether this function is through flavonoid antioxidant activity. This contrasts with root hairs, whose synthesis is also repressed by flavonols, with a specific role for one flavonol, quercetin in controlling root hair formation via modulating ROS levels (9Gayomba S.R. Muday G.K. Flavonols regulate root hair development by modulating accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the root epidermis.Development. 2020; 147dev185819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study examined the role of flavonols in modulating lateral root development and tested the hypothesis that flavonoids regulate this developmental process by scavenging ROS within the LRP. We quantified primordia and emerged lateral roots in a suite of flavonoid biosynthetic mutants, revealing that mutants that produce no flavonols had increased lateral root emergence. In contrast, a mutant that produces kaempferol at higher than wild-type levels and produces no other flavonols had fewer emerged lateral roots than wild-type, suggesting that kaempferol or downstream derivatives of this flavonol negatively regulate lateral root emergence. Consistent with an inhibitory effect of kaempferol, there is a negative correlation between the amount of kaempferol and the number of emerged lateral roots across multiple mutant lines. Using confocal microscopy and dyes that fluoresce upon binding flavonols or in response to oxidation by ROS, we find that in regions of roots with high levels of flavonols, there is decreased ROS abundance and in areas of high ROS, there are low concentrations of flavonols. These experiments support the model that flavonol-modulated root development is orchestrated by the scavenging of ROS within the lateral root primordia. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is well characterized in Arabidopsis, with mutations mapped to the genes encoding each biosynthetic enzyme. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the enzymes defective in these mutants are shown in Figure 1. We verified the metabolite profiles in the roots of the mutant alleles used in this study and under our specific growth conditions using liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Flavonols underwent acid hydrolysis to remove any glycosylation prior to MS1 analysis to determine their concentration with standard curves and the aglycone flavonols were verified by MS2 (Table S1). Flavonol levels were quantified in Col-0 and six mutants with defects in genes encoding enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. The flavonol"

However, these algorithms require disparate forms of sampling dynamics for optimal performance. We theorize how the brain should adapt internally generated sequences for particular cognitive functions and propose a neural mechanism by which this may be accomplished within the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. Specifically, we demonstrate that the systematic modulation along the medial entorhinal cortex dorsoventral axis of grid population input into the hippocampus facilitates a flexible generative process that can interpolate between qualitatively distinct regimes of sequential hippocampal reactivations. By relating the emergent hippocampal activity patterns drawn from our model to empirical data, we explain and reconcile a diversity of recently observed, but apparently unrelated, phenomena such as generative cycling, diffusive hippocampal reactivations and jumping trajectory events."
https://openalex.org/W3152624099,"On 1 August 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared its tenth Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak. To aid the epidemiologic response, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) implemented an end-to-end genomic surveillance system, including sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and dissemination of genomic epidemiologic results to frontline public health workers. We report 744 new genomes sampled between 27 July 2018 and 27 April 2020 generated by this surveillance effort. Together with previously available sequence data (n = 48 genomes), these data represent almost 24% of all laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus (EBOV) infections in DRC in the period analyzed. We inferred spatiotemporal transmission dynamics from the genomic data as new sequences were generated, and disseminated the results to support epidemiologic response efforts. Here we provide an overview of how this genomic surveillance system functioned, present a full phylodynamic analysis of 792 Ebola genomes from the Nord Kivu outbreak and discuss how the genomic surveillance data informed response efforts and public health decision making."

https://openalex.org/W3118995215,"A long-standing hypothesis is that complement receptors (CRs), especially CR3, mediate sinking phagocytosis, but evidence is lacking. Alternatively, CRs have been reported to induce membrane ruffles or phagocytic cups, akin to those induced by Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), but the details of these events are unclear. Here we used real-time 3D imaging and KO mouse models to clarify how particles (human red blood cells) are internalized by resident peritoneal F4/80+ cells (macrophages) via CRs and/or FcγRs. We first show that FcγRs mediate highly efficient, rapid (2–3 min) phagocytic cup formation, which is completely abolished by deletion or mutation of the FcR γ chain or conditional deletion of the signal transducer Syk. FcγR-mediated phagocytic cups robustly arise from any point of cell-particle contact, including filopodia. In the absence of CR3, FcγR-mediated phagocytic cups exhibit delayed closure and become aberrantly elongated. Independent of FcγRs, CR3 mediates sporadic ingestion of complement-opsonized particles by rapid phagocytic cup-like structures, typically emanating from membrane ruffles and largely prevented by deletion of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) adaptors FcR γ chain and DAP12 or Syk. Deletion of ITAM adaptors or Syk clearly revealed that there is a slow (10–25 min) sinking mode of phagocytosis via a restricted orifice. In summary, we show that (1) CR3 indeed mediates a slow sinking mode of phagocytosis, which is accentuated by deletion of ITAM adaptors or Syk, (2) CR3 induces phagocytic cup-like structures, driven by ITAM adaptors and Syk, and (3) CR3 is involved in forming and closing FcγR-mediated phagocytic cups.

Phagocytosis, receptor-mediated ingestion of particles larger than 0.5 μm in diameter, is the major effector function of macrophages (big eaters) and neutrophils, previously known as microphages (small eaters) (1Metschnikoff E. Lecture on phagocytosis and immunity.Br. Med. J. 1891; 1: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, more than 100 years after Metschnikoff developed his theory of phagocytosis (2Tauber A.I. Metchnikoff and the phagocytosis theory.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the mechanisms of ingestion are not well understood (3Flannagan R.S. Jaumouille V. Grinstein S. The cell biology of phagocytosis.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2012; 7: 61-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In a pioneering study, Munthe-Kaas et al. (4Munthe-Kaas A.C. Kaplan G. Seljelid R. On the mechanism of internalization of opsonized particles by rat Kupffer cells in vitro.Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 103: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Kaplan (5Kaplan G. Differences in the mode of phagocytosis with Fc and C3 receptors in macrophages.Scand. J. Immunol. 1977; 6: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) described two distinctive modes of phagocytosis based on high-resolution snapshots obtained by scanning electron microscopy. Specifically, Kaplan deduced that mouse peritoneal macrophages engulfed immunoglobulin G (IgG)-opsonized sheep red blood cells “by means of thin membrane extensions rising from the macrophage surface and enclosing the opsonized particles tightly in a cup-like structure protruding from the macrophage surface” (5Kaplan G. Differences in the mode of phagocytosis with Fc and C3 receptors in macrophages.Scand. J. Immunol. 1977; 6: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), in accord with the zipper model of phagocytosis (6Griffin Jr., F.M. Griffin J.A. Leider J.E. Silverstein S.C.

Med. 1975; 142: 1263-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In contrast, complement-opsonized sheep red blood cells appeared to directly sink into macrophages without the involvement of membrane protrusions (4Munthe-Kaas A.C. Kaplan G. Seljelid R.

The two modes of phagocytosis, phagocytic cup formation and sinking phagocytosis, have become well established in the literature (7Swanson J.A. Shaping cups into phagosomes and macropinosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 8Dupuy A.G. Caron E. Integrin-dependent phagocytosis: Spreading from microadhesion to new concepts.J.

Int. 2017; 2017: 9042851Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, at variance with the notion of two morphologically distinct modes, transmission electron micrographs revealed membrane extensions during both Fcγ receptor (FcγR)- and CR-mediated phagocytosis (12Hall A.B. Gakidis M.A. Glogauer M. Wilsbacher J.L. Gao S. Swat W. Brugge J.S. Requirements for Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factors and Rho GTPases in FcgammaR- and complement-mediated phagocytosis.Immunity. 2006; 24: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and high-resolution surface imaging showed prominent local membrane ruffles around complement-opsonized sheep red blood cells attached to RAW264.7 cells (13Patel P.C. Harrison R.E. Membrane ruffles capture C3bi-opsonized particles in activated macrophages.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4628-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a macrophage cell line. Furthermore, time-lapse 2D confocal microscopy of RAW264.7 macrophages expressing fluorescently labeled actin indicated that thin, actin-rich membrane extensions envelop complement-opsonized sheep red blood cells (14Bohdanowicz M. Cosio G. Backer J.M. Grinstein S. Class I and class III phosphoinositide 3-kinases are required for actin polymerization that propels phagosomes.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 999-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, Jaumouillé et al. (15Jaumouille V. Cartagena-Rivera A.X. Waterman C.M. Coupling of beta2 integrins to actin by a mechanosensitive molecular clutch drives complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) recently observed phagocytic cup formation during the phagocytosis of iC3b-coated polystyrene beads by RAW264.7 and bone marrow–derived Lifeact-EGFP macrophages. Thus, it remains to be established whether complement receptor–mediated phagocytosis involves sinking in, reaching up (of the membrane), or both. Here we used RNA-sequence analysis, genetic experiments, and real-time 3D imaging to explore the roles of FcγRs and complement receptors in phagocytosis. We systematically analyzed how resident macrophages, isolated from WT or KO mice, engage and internalize variously opsonized human red blood cells (hRBCs) using time-lapse spinning disk confocal microscopy. Using RNA-sequence analysis, we first determined the expression profile of FcγR and upstream signaling molecules in mouse resident peritoneal F4/80+ cells (macrophages), which had been purified by cell sorting (Fig. S1A). All four FcγRs (FcγRI, FcγRIIb, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV) and the Fc receptor γ chain (encoded by Fcer1g) could be detected, as well as transcripts encoding key signal transducers, the tyrosine kinase Syk (Syk), also known as spleen (S) tyrosine (Y) kinase, and the tyrosine phosphatases Shp1 (Ptpn6) and Shp2 (Ptpn11). Three of the four FcγRs (FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV) bind noncovalently to the Fc receptor γ chain, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), whereas FcγRIIb contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytosolic tail (Fig. S1B). Among the three FcγRs associated with the Fc receptor γ chain, FcγRIII (Fcgr3) was the most strongly expressed. FcγR-mediated phagocytosis has commonly been investigated using IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells. Here we used IgG-opsonized hRBCs, freshly isolated on the day of experiments. hRBCs were opsonized with monoclonal mouse anti-human CD235a (subclass IgG2b) antibodies, which should be recognized by all mouse FcγRs with moderate to high affinity (16Bruhns P. Properties of mouse and human IgG receptors and their contribution to disease models.Blood. 2012; 119: 5640-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Incubation of IgG-opsonized hRBCs with mouse WT serum should trigger the classical complement cascade, leading to deposition of complement C3b and hemolysis upon formation of the membrane attack complex (Fig. S1C). We developed real-time hemolysis assays to confirm that opsonization with mouse IgG antibodies was sufficient to induce hemolysis, indexed as loss of cytosolic calcein fluorescence, whereas the red fluorescent probe CellMask Orange (CMO) served as a plasma membrane marker (Fig. S1, D and E). Indeed, the introduction of WT serum to IgG-opsonized hRBCs induced hemolysis, such that more than 95% of cells were lyzed between 3 and 6 min (Fig. S1F). At least five CRs (CR1, CR2, CR3, CR4, and CRIg) are implicated in the binding of immune cells to complement C3b and its proteolytic fragment iC3b (Fig. S2A). RNA-sequence analysis indicated that CR3 and CRIg (encoded by Vsig4) are expressed in mouse peritoneal F4/80+ cells (macrophages) (Fig. S2B), whereas expression of CR1 and CR2 (both encoded by Cr2) and CR4 could not be detected, consistent with previous work (17Martin B.K. Weis J.H. Murine macrophages lack expression of the Cr2-145 (CR2) and Cr2-190 (CR1) gene products.Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3037-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CR3 and CR4 are integrins, cell-extracellular matrix adhesion molecules, which share the same β2-chain (CD18), encoded by Itgb2, but have different α-chains. The α-chain of CR3 (also known as CD11b) is encoded by Itgam, whereas the α-chain of CR4 (also known as CD11c), a dendritic cell marker, is encoded by Itgax. CRIg binds C3b and iC3b (18Helmy K.Y.

Notably, isolated resident peritoneal cells predominantly consist of F4/80+ cells (macrophages) and CD19+ cells (B cells), although low levels (less than 5% of total population) of CD19–/CD3+ cells (T cells) and F4/80–/CD11c+ cells (dendritic cells) can be detected. In our phagocytosis assays, Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti-F4/80 antibodies served as both an unambiguous macrophage marker and a fluorescent membrane probe. We developed assays to study complement C3b/iC3b-mediated phagocytosis using either IgG (Fig. S1C) or IgM (Fig. S2C) to trigger activation of the classical complement cascade. To test the efficacy of IgM opsonization, we loaded the cytosol of hRBCs with the pH-sensitive probe pHrodo Red using its cell-permeable acetoxymethyl (AM) ester form (Fig. S2D) and incubated either unopsonized or IgM-opsonized hRBCs with WT mouse serum (Fig. S2E). Loss of pHrodo Red fluorescence was used as a readout of hemolysis (Fig. S2F). Importantly, real-time hemolysis assays using pHrodo Red–loaded hRBCs were performed after opsonizing cells with IgM at room temperature (RT) and slowly increasing the temperature to ∼30 °C (Fig. S2G). This empirical protocol was a compromise taking into account that, on the one hand, IgM has weak affinity for antigens at 37 °C and, on the other hand, the activity of the complement cascade decreases at lower temperatures. More than 50% of IgM-opsonized hRBCs lyzed within 8 min after application of WT mouse serum (Fig. S2G). In summary, we measured the expression profile of phagocytic receptor–related genes in the cells used in this study (resident peritoneal F4/80+ cells), and we showed using real-time hemolysis assays that the IgG- and IgM-opsonization protocols robustly induced hemolysis upon application of WT serum. Control experiments confirmed that mouse peritoneal macrophages did not ingest unopsonized hRBCs, providing a means to study FcγR-mediated phagocytosis with negligible background phagocytic activity. hRBCs were opsonized with mouse monoclonal anti-human CD235a IgG antibodies and introduced to mouse macrophages labeled with green fluorescent (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated) anti-F4/80 antibodies (Fig. 1A). Time-lapse spinning disk confocal microscopy was performed to visualize single FcγR-mediated phagocytic events (Fig. 1A; Videos S1 and S2). Macrophages ingested IgG-conjugated hRBCs via phagocytic cup formation, irrespective of whether the hRBC was engaged by a morphologically spread out (Fig. 1A; Video S1) or spherical macrophage (Fig. 1B; Video S2). The tip of hRBCs, engulfed and squeezed by phagocytic cups, was frequently pinched off, suggesting that forceful cup closure may serve to lyse cells (Fig. 1B). Phagocytic cup formation was not observed in macrophages isolated from No ITAM (NOTAM) mice (Fig. 1C, two frames on the left), which have a nonsignaling ITAM in the Fc receptor γ chain, or Fccer1g−/− (Fc receptor γ chain KO) mice (Fig. 1C, two frames on the right). Sinking phagocytosis was not observed in either NOTAM or Fcer1g−/− macrophages presented with IgG-opsonized hRBCs. Cumulative plots of phagocytic events (y-axis) by individual macrophages (x-axis) clearly show that WT macrophages efficiently ingest IgG-opsonized hRBCs by phagocytic cup formation and few targets remain uningested, whereas IgG-opsonized hRBCs in contact with NOTAM or Fcer1g−/− macrophages are not ingested (Fig. 1D). In summary, these data show that the ingestion of IgG-opsonized hRBCs is mediated by phagocytic cup formation and requires the Fc receptor γ chain and a functional ITAM (Fig. 1, D and E), and sinking phagocytosis does not prevail in either Fcer1g−/− or NOTAM macrophages. Interestingly, phagocytic cup closure may pinch off the tip, and presumably induce lysis, of ingested cells. hRBCs were dual-opsonized with IgG and complement C3b/iC3b by incubating IgG–hRBCs with complement C5-deficient (C5 null) serum (Fig. 2A) and introduced to NOTAM or Fcer1g−/− macrophages, the latter of which do not exhibit surface expression of the α-chains of FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV (Fig. 2B). NOTAM macrophages ingested dual IgG- and complement C3b/iC3b-opsonized hRBCs by phagocytic cup formation or, to a lesser extent, by partial or complete sinking phagocytosis (Fig. 2C). Typically, phagocytic cup-like structures were generated by the extension of membrane protrusions (ruffles), which rolled over the particle (Fig. 2C). These protrusions were highly dynamic and susceptible to retraction. Phagocytic cup formation was seldom observed by Fcer1g−/− macrophages, which predominantly ingested dual IgG- and complement C3b/iC3b-opsonized hRBCs via partial or complete sinking phagocytosis (Fig. 2D). This discrepancy can be gleaned from cumulative plots of phagocytic events by individual NOTAM and Fcer1g−/− macrophages (Fig. 2E), which additionally indicate higher phagocytic efficiency in NOTAM macrophages than in Fcer1g−/− macrophages (summarized in Fig. 2F). The lower phagocytic efficiency and lack of phagocytic cups in Fcer1g−/− macrophages, compared with NOTAM macrophages, may be explained by relative differences in FcγRIIb activity (20Lin S.Y. Kinet J.P. Immunology. Giving inhibitory receptors a boost.Science. 2001; 291: 445-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). NOTAM macrophages express FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV, each of which associates with a mutated (non-signaling ITAM) Fc receptor γ chain (21de Haij S. Jansen J.H. Boross P. Beurskens F.J. Bakema J.E. Bos D.L. Martens A. Verbeek J.S. Parren P.W. van de Winkel J.G. Leusen J.H. In vivo cytotoxicity of type I CD20 antibodies critically depends on Fc receptor ITAM signaling.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and competes with the inhibitory Fc receptor FcγRIIb for binding to the Fc region of opsonic IgG, whereas this competitive binding is missing in Fcer1g−/− macrophages because the other three Fcγ receptors (I, III, and IV) require the Fc receptor γ chain for surface expression (21de Haij S. Jansen J.H. Boross P. Beurskens F.J. Bakema J.E. Bos D.L. Martens A. Verbeek J.S. Parren P.W. van de Winkel J.G. Leusen J.H.

A single amino acid in the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol attachment domain determines the membrane topology of Fc gamma RIII.Nature. 1989; 342: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In summary, these data indicate that complement receptors mediate both sinking phagocytosis and phagocytic cups (typically emanating from extended membrane ruffles), the latter of which are susceptible to inhibition by ITIM-containing FcγRIIb, suggesting that complement receptor–mediated phagocytic cup formation may involve the activation of Syk. We used an alternative approach to confirm that complement receptors ingest complement C3b/iC3b-opsonized hRBCs via phagocytic cup formation and sinking phagocytosis. hRBCs were opsonized with IgM and incubated with complement C5 null serum to produce dual IgM– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs (Fig. 3A). Notably, IgM, which forms pentamers in human and mouse, is not recognized by Fcγ receptors. Introduction of dual-opsonized hRBCs to WT (Fig. 3A; Video S3) or Fcer1g−/− macrophages (Fig. 3B) sporadically induced phagocytosis via phagocytic cups, typically formed by the extension and rolling over of membrane protrusions (ruffles). Note that the hRBCs were loaded with the red fluorescent probe pHrodo Red, which is less susceptible to photobleaching than CMO. Ingestion of dual IgM– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs by WT macrophages was considerably less efficient than the ingestion of IgG-opsonized hRBCs (compare Fig. 1D and Fig. 3C). There was no difference in the efficiency of phagocytosis (particle internalization) between WT and Fcer1g−/− macrophages (Fig. 3D). In summary, these experiments, which circumvented all four Fcγ receptors, confirm that complement receptors ingest particles via phagocytic cup formation or sinking phagocytosis. In contrast to WT macrophages (Fig. 4A; Videos S4–S6), macrophages isolated from myeloid-restricted Syk conditional KO (cKO) mice did not ingest IgG-opsonized hRBCs (Fig. 4B; Video S7). Notably, Video S4 and the 3D reconstruction in Video S5 show a nice example of the tip of an hRBC being pinched off by cup closure. Neither phagocytic cup formation nor partial sinking phagocytosis was observed in Syk cKO macrophages (Fig. 4B). This suggests that Zap70 (encoded by Zap70), which was not expressed in WT peritoneal F4/80+ cells, does not compensate for loss of Syk. Consistent with this interpretation, Mócsai et al. (24Mócsai A. Zhang H. Jakus Z. Kitaura J. Kawakami T. Lowell C.A. G-protein-coupled receptor signaling in Syk-deficient neutrophils and mast cells.Blood. 2003; 101: 4155-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) did not detect Zap70 protein in either WT or Syk KO neutrophils. In contrast to singly IgG-opsonized hRBCs, dual IgG- and complement C3b/iC3b-opsonized hRBCs, stained with CMO, appeared to slowly sink into Syk cKO macrophages (Fig. 4C). Moreover, Syk cKO macrophages exhibited less cell spreading, indexed as projected 2D area, than WT macrophages (Fig. 4D). Cell spreading was assessed after overnight incubation on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Cumulative plots of phagocytic events by individual Syk cKO macrophages (Fig. 4E) highlight, on the one hand, the complete loss of the ability to ingest IgG-opsonized hRBCs, and, on the other, persistent partial or complete ingestion of complement-opsonized hRBCs via sinking phagocytosis in the absence of the tyrosine kinase Syk. Consistent with the above observations, we found that dual IgM– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs, loaded with pHrodo Red, were partially or fully ingested by Syk cKO macrophages via sinking phagocytosis (Fig. 5, A and B; Videos S8 and S9). During sinking phagocytosis, the hRBCs were typically squeezed through a narrow orifice, giving rise to intermediary hourglass-shaped hRBCs (lower panel in Fig. 5A; Video S8). After passage through the restricted point of entry, the phagosome adopted a rounded morphology. Cumulative plots indicate that dual IgM–opsonized and C3b/iC3b-opsonized hRBCs were often uningested in both WT and Syk cKO macrophages (Fig. 5C). In the case of ingested particles, individual WT macrophages frequently internalized complement-opsonized hRBCs via phagocytic cup formation (Fig. 5C, left plot), whereas complement-opsonized particles were predominantly internalized by sinking phagocytosis in Syk cKO macrophages (Fig. 5C, right plot). Thus, loss of phagocytic cup formation by Syk cKO macrophages was compensated by increased sinking phagocytosis, and there was no significant difference in the median phagocytic efficiency (Fig. 5D). In summary, the data shown in Figures 4 and 5 indicate that Syk is required for both FcγR-mediated and complement receptor–mediated phagocytic cup formation, and, in the absence of Syk, the distinctive complement receptor–mediated sinking mode of phagocytosis prevails. We next asked how complement receptors induce Syk-dependent phagocytic cup formation. We hypothesized that CR3, a β2 integrin, associates with the Fc receptor γ chain and/or DAP12 to induce Syk-dependent phagocytic cup formation because integrin signaling was previously reported by Mocsai et al. (25Mocsai A. Abram C.L. Jakus Z. Hu Y. Lanier L.L. Lowell C.A. Integrin signaling in neutrophils and macrophages uses adaptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) to involve these ITAM-containing adaptor proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, macrophages lacking both Fcer1g (Fc receptor γ chain) and Tyrobp (DAP12) slowly ingested dual IgG– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs by sinking phagocytosis, with a paucity of membrane protrusive activity (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, similar to Syk cKO macrophages, Fcer1g/Tyrobp double KO (dKO) macrophages exhibited cell spreading defects. Cumulative plots of the response of individual macrophages to dual IgG- and C3b/iC3b-opsonized hRBCs show that WT macrophages ingested particles exclusively by phagocytic cup formation, whereas phagocytic cup formation was negligible in Fcer1g/Tyrobp dKO macrophages. Instead, Fcer1g/Tyrobp dKO macrophages partially or fully ingested dual IgG- and complement-opsonized hRBCs via sinking phagocytosis. Using hRBCs dual opsonized with IgM and complement C3b/iC3b, we confirmed that Fcer1g/Tyrobp dKO macrophages have impaired lamellipodial cell spreading and phagocytic cup formation, but slowly ingest complement-opsonized particles by sinking phagocytosis (Fig. 7; Videos S10–S12). Similar to the case with Syk cKO macrophages, dual-opsonized hRBCs were internalized into Fcer1g/Tyrobp dKO macrophages by squeezing through a narrow orifice, producing hourglass-like deformities (Fig. 7; Videos S10–S12). In summary, the data shown in Figures 6 and 7 indicate that phagocytic complement receptors use ITAM adaptors to generate phagocytic cups, and in the absence of these adaptors, slow sinking phagocytosis persists. We speculated that CR3 may preferentially recruit DAP12 rather than the Fc receptor γ chain. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that both components of CR3, the α-chain (CD11b) and the β-chain (CD18; not shown), are expressed in Tyrobp−/− (DAP12 KO) macrophages, counterstained with anti-F4/80 antibodies (Fig. 8A). Similar to Syk cKO and Fcer1g/Tyropb dKO macrophages, Tyrobp−/− macrophages presented with dual IgM– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs exhibited impaired lamellipodial cell spreading, whereas sinking phagocytosis prevailed (Fig. 8A; Videos S13 and S14). However, phagocytic cup formation by Tyrobp−/− macrophages was less impaired than dKO mutants (Fig. 8B). As observed in macrophages isolated from Syk cKO and Fcer1g/Tyrobp dKO mice, Tyrobp−/− macrophages exhibited slow sinking phagocytosis with varying degrees of membrane protrusive activity. The bottom panel in Figure 8A (Videos S14) shows an example in which particle internalization is achieved by a combination of sinking phagocytosis and an enfolding membrane extension. In summary, these data indicate that complement receptor–mediated phagocytic cup formation requires recruitment of Syk by either of the two ITAM adaptors, DAP12 and Fc receptor γ chain. Up to this point, we have not elucidated whether one or both of the complement receptors expressed in peritoneal F4/80+ cells (macrophages), CR3 and CRIg, mediate complement C3b/iC3b-induced phagocytic cup formation and sinking phagocytosis. We challenged Itgb2−/− macrophages, which lack the β2-chain (also known as CD18) and surface expression of CR3, with dual IgM– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs (Fig. 9, A and B). Neither phagocytic cup formation nor sinking phagocytosis was observed in either spread out (Fig. 9A) or unspread (Fig. 9B) Itgb2−/− (CR3 KO) macrophages. Cumulative plots show that Itgb2−/− macrophages largely fail to ingest dual IgM– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs, and, importantly, sinking phagocytosis is not observed, whereas IgG-opsonized hRBCs were ingested by phagocytic cup formation (Fig. 9C). The phagocytic (complete internalization) efficiencies of WT and Itgb2−/− macrophages are compared in Figure 9D. In summary, these data indicate that CR3 is essential for complement-induced phagocytic cup formation and sinking phagocytosis. CRIg may be involved in particle tethering (26Gorgani N.N. He J.Q. Katschke Jr., K.J. Helmy K.Y. Xi H. Steffek M. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M.

Immunol. 2008; 181: 7902-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but it cannot compensate for loss of CR3-mediated phagocytic activity. Although the β2-integrin CR3 has been variously implicated in FcγR-mediated functions (27Tang T. Rosenkranz A. Assmann K.J. Goodman M.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Carroll M.C. Cotran R.S. Mayadas T.N.

Understanding how and by whom the virus is transmitted can help implement better disease control strategies. Here we have described the use of a noninvasive mask sampling method to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory particles expelled by COVID-19 patients and discussed its relationship to transmission risk. Respiratory particles of 31 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 31 asymptomatic healthy volunteers were captured on N-95 masks layered with a gelatin membrane in a 30-minute process that involved talking/reading, coughing, and tidal breathing. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified using rRT-PCR in the mask and in concomitantly collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The data were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and clinical presentation. Thirteen of 31(41.9%) patients showed SARS-COV-2 positivity in both the mask and NPS samples, while 16 patients were mask negative but NPS positive. Two patients were both mask and NPS negative. All healthy volunteers except one were mask and NPS negative. The mask positive patients had significantly lower NPS Ct value (26) compared to mask negative patients (30.5) and were more likely to be rapid antigen test positive. The mask positive patients could be further grouped into low emitters (expelling &lt;100 viral copies) and high emitters (expelling &gt;1000 viral copies). The study presents evidence for variation in emission of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles by COVID-19 patients reflecting differences in infectivity and transmission risk among individuals. The results conform to reported secondary infection rates and transmission and also suggest that mask sampling could be explored as an effective tool to assess individual transmission risks, at different time points and during different activities."

Strategies to inactivate STAT3 are being pursued as potential anticancer therapies and have led to the identification of Stattic (6-nitrobenzo[b]thiophene-1,1-dioxide) as a “specific” STAT3 inhibitor that is often used to interrogate STAT3-mediated gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that Stattic exerts many STAT3-independent effects on cancer cells, calling for reassessment of results previously ascribed to STAT3 functions. Studies of the STAT3-deficient prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (PC3) along with STAT3-proficient breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SUM149) revealed that Stattic attenuated histone acetylation and neutralized effects of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor romidepsin. In PC3 cells, Stattic alone inhibited gene expression of CCL20 and CCL2, but activated expression of TNFA, CEBPD, SOX2, and MYC. In addition, we found that Stattic promoted autophagy and caused cell death. These data point to profound epigenetic effects of Stattic that are independent of its function as a STAT3 inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that Stattic directly or indirectly reduces histone acetylation and suggest reevaluation of Stattic and related compounds as polypharmacological agents through multipronged cytotoxic effects on cancer cells.

Our results demonstrate that Stattic directly or indirectly reduces histone acetylation and suggest reevaluation of Stattic and related compounds as polypharmacological agents through multipronged cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Gene expression is regulated by a complex intersection of DNA-binding transcription factors and their cofactors as well as the three-dimensional genome organization, which is in part determined by protein modifications on histones. Lysine/histone acetylases (KATs/HATs) belong to the “writers” of histone codes and contribute to the opening of chromatin and activation of gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) in turn are “erasers” and remove these modifications and typically cause chromatin compaction. In the case of cancer cells, HDACs can be responsible for the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which is one rationale for the development of many different HDAC inhibitors as potential cancer therapeutics (1Olzscha H. Sheikh S. La Thangue N.B. Deacetylation of chromatin and gene expression regulation: a new target for epigenetic therapy.Crit. Rev. Oncog. 2015; 20: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Romidepsin is one such agent and is approved for the treatment of T-ALL and in clinical trials for combination therapies in solid cancers (2Petrich A. Nabhan C. Use of class I histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin in combination regimens.Leuk. Lymphoma. 2016; 57: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transcription factors that regulate gene promoters by DNA sequence-specific binding have proven difficult to target pharmacologically. Nevertheless, many agents have been explored for inhibition of STAT3, which is activated in many types of cancer (3Wake M.S. Watson C.J. STAT3 the oncogene - still eluding therapy?.FEBS J. 2015; 282: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Shih P.C. Revisiting the development of small molecular inhibitors that directly target the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) domains.Life Sci. 2020; 242: 117241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). STAT3 is a latent transcription factor, which resides in the cytoplasm as a monomer. Upon activation by upstream kinases in response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT3 is phosphorylated at Y705 within its SH2 domain, dimerizes, and translocates into the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (5Banerjee K. Resat H. Constitutive activation of STAT3 in breast cancer cells: a review.Int. J. Cancer. 2016; 138: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Stattic is a small molecule that emerged from a functional screen and inhibits the STAT3 SH2 domain regardless of its phosphorylation status (6Schust J. Sperl B. Hollis A. Mayer T.U. Berg T. Stattic: a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activation and dimerization.Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1235-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Because Stattic was initially shown to selectively inhibit STAT3, but not the related factors STAT1 and STAT5, Stattic has enjoyed popularity as a “specific” STAT3 inhibitor in mechanistic investigations of STAT3. We and others have previously shown that STAT3 induces expression of the transcription factor C/EBPδ (encoded by the CEBPD gene) in response to cytokine and inflammatory signaling (7Balamurugan K. Sterneck E. The many faces of C/EBPdelta and their relevance for inflammation and cancer.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2013; 9: 917-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, HDAC inhibitors, which activate the expression of many genes, suppressed CEBPD expression (this study, and Balamurugan et al., unpublished). Our investigations into the mechanisms by which romidepsin inhibits expression of CEBPD led to the observation that Stattic can attenuate HDAC inhibitor-mediated CEBPD suppression and reduce histone acetylation independent of the presence or absence of STAT3. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of results obtained with Stattic as a STAT3 inhibitor but also raise the possibility for applications of Stattic beyond inhibition of STAT3. The triple-negative inflammatory breast cancer cell line SUM149 is highly sensitive to the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin (8Robertson F.M. Chu K. Boley K.M. Ye Z. Liu H. Wright M.C. Moraes R. Zhang X. Green T.L. Barsky S.H. Heise C. Cristofanilli M. The class I HDAC inhibitor Romidepsin targets inflammatory breast cancer tumor emboli and synergizes with paclitaxel to inhibit metastasis.J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2013; 10: 219-233PubMed Google Scholar). Like many breast cancers, these cells also exhibit activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (9Ibrahim S.A. Gadalla R. El-Ghonaimy E.A. Samir O.

As expected, romidepsin increased the mRNA expression levels of several genes such as those of the pluripotency factor SOX2 and the chemokines CCL2 and CCL20. However, expression of the transcription factor CEBPD, which is implicated in promoting cancer cell stemness (11Balamurugan K. Mendoza-Villanueva D. Sharan S. Summers G.H. Dobrolecki L.E. Lewis M.T. Sterneck E. C/EBPdelta links IL-6 and HIF-1 signaling to promote breast cancer stem cell-associated phenotypes.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 3765-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was inhibited (Fig. 1A). Stattic alone had modest effects on the expression of CEBPD, CCL2, and CCL20 but neutralized their response to romidepsin. Like romidepsin, Stattic induced SOX2 expression and so did the combination treatment. At the protein level, we confirmed the respective effects of romidepsin and/or Stattic on C/EBPδ expression (Fig. 1B). In contrast to inducing SOX2 mRNA, Stattic did not, however, induce SOX2 protein expression. This observation is in agreement with a prior report on Stattic inducing SOX2 mRNA but decreasing SOX2 protein expression in MCF-7 cells (12Yang C.M. Chiba T. Groner B. Expression of reprogramming factors in breast cancer cell lines and the regulation by activated Stat3.Horm. Mol. Biol. Clin. Investig. 2012; 10: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Stattic prevented accumulation of SOX2 protein in romidepsin-treated SUM149 cells. With respect to acetylation, romidepsin, as expected, significantly increased polyacetylation of lysine in the amino-terminal region of histone 4 (H4Ac) and did not significantly affect STAT3 expression or phosphorylation at Y705, while Stattic completely inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, however, Stattic alone reduced the basal level of H4 acetylation and attenuated the accumulation of H4 acetylation caused by the HDAC inhibitor (Fig. 1B). To assess an alternate triple-negative breast cancer cell line, we analyzed the combination of romidepsin and Stattic in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C) and observed similar effects on C/EBPδ protein expression and H4 acetylation. Taken together, these data show that Stattic has a profound effect on histone H4 acetylation and counters several of romidepsin's effects on gene and protein expression. Thus, we hypothesized that Stattic can regulate gene expression by epigenic mechanisms that involve inhibition of histone acetylation. To assess if Stattic's effect on histone acetylation was indirectly mediated by inhibition of STAT3, we first silenced STAT3 in SUM149 cells, which had, however, no effect on romidepsin-mediated H4 or H3 acetylation (Fig. 2A). In addition, Stattic similarly reduced basal and romidepsin-induced acetylation of H4 and/or H3 in siControl and siSTAT3 transfected cells. Because siSTAT3 had no measurable effect on the regulation of acetylation, although STAT3 was significantly depleted, off-target effects are not of concern in this experiment (Fig. 2A). However, because transient silencing of gene expression rarely eliminates its target completely, we next compared genetically STAT3-deficient PC3 prostate cancer cells and the STAT3-proficient MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In both cell lines, we observed similar dose-dependent inhibition of histone H3 and H4 acetylation (Fig. 2B). STAT3 expression and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by Stattic could only be observed in MDA-MB-231 cells as STAT3 is deleted in PC3 cells (13Clark J. Edwards S. Feber A. Flohr P. John M.

When combined with romidepsin, Stattic could avert the HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation of H4 and H3 as well as H3K27 acetylation (Fig. 2, C–D). As expected, Stattic inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells also in the presence of romidepsin. Efficient inhibition of STAT3 was seen with 10 μM of Stattic, which is the concentration that has been used in many studies for STAT3 inhibition. At this dose, Stattic significantly attenuated basal acetylation as well as hyperacetylation of histones by romidepsin even in STAT3-deficient cells. These data raised the hypothesis that Stattic may directly or indirectly inhibit histone acetylation but independent of its effect on STAT3. Treatment with A485, an inhibitor of the CBP/p300 family of HATs, significantly reduced specifically acetylation of its target H3K27 (15Lasko L.M. Jakob C.G. Edalji R.P. Qiu W. Montgomery D. Digiammarino E.L. Hansen T.M. Risi R.M. Frey R. Manaves V. Shaw B. Algire M. Hessler P. Lam L.T.

These data suggest that Stattic—if acting as a HAT inhibitor—is not selective for the CBP/p300 family. Changes in epigenetic marks on chromatin, such as histone acetylation, alter gene expression. Thus, we assessed the effect of Stattic on the expression levels of several other known STAT3 target genes such as the chemokines CCL20 and CCL2 (16Meares G.P. Liu Y. Rajbhandari R. Qin H. Nozell S.E. Mobley J.A. Corbett J.A. Benveniste E.N. PERK-dependent activation of JAK1 and STAT3 contributes to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced inflammation.Mol.

Sustained NF-kappaB-STAT3 signaling promotes resistance to Smac mimetics in Glioma stem-like cells but creates a vulnerability to EZH2 inhibition.Cell Death Discov. 2019; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in PC3 cells. Stattic treatment inhibited gene expression of CCL20 and CCL2 but induced mRNA expression of TNFA, CEBPD, SOX2, as well as MYC in PC3 cells (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Stattic decreases histone modification by acetylation similarly in the presence and absence of STAT3 and alters gene expression patterns independent of its activity as STAT3 inhibitor. STAT3 promotes cell proliferation and survival in many types of cancer cells. Thus, we compared the effect of Stattic on cell survival/proliferation in MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells by MTT assay (Fig. 3A). As expected (6Schust J. Sperl B. Hollis A. Mayer T.U. Berg T. Stattic: a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activation and dimerization.Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1235-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), Stattic exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity on MDA-MB-231 cells. However, STAT3-deficient PC3 cells were even more sensitive to Stattic treatment with an EC50 of 1.7 μM compared with 5.5 μM for MDA-MB-231 cells. Quantification of live and dead/dying cells based on exclusion of propidium iodide confirmed that PC3 cells were more sensitive than MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3, B–C), while also showing that the metabolic MTT assay overestimated the cytotoxicity of Stattic. In comparison, the CBP/p300 inhibitor A485 was relatively well tolerated by PC3 cells (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of Stattic can be due to not only inhibition of STAT3 but also STAT3 -independent effects, which may be related to interference with histone acetylation. STAT3 has been shown to repress autophagy and consequently several STAT3 inhibitors including Stattic promote autophagy (18Shen S. Niso-Santano M. Adjemian S. Takehara T. Malik S.A. Minoux H. Souquere S. Marino G. Lachkar S. Senovilla L. Galluzzi L. Kepp O. Pierron G. Maiuri M.C. Hikita H. et al.Cytoplasmic STAT3 represses autophagy by inhibiting PKR activity.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 667-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Autophagy can be assessed by the ratio of LC3-I and LC3-II isoforms with the latter representing the lipidated form that is required for fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (19Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H. Acevedo Arozena A. Adachi H. Adams C.M. Adams P.D. Adeli K. Adhihetty P.J. Adler S.G. Agam G. Agarwal R. Aghi M.K. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition).Autophagy. 2016; 12: 1-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3432) Google Scholar). Treatment with Stattic increased LC3 expression and lipidation (LC3-II) in MDA-MB-231 as well as PC3 cells along with inhibition of H4Ac as described above (Fig. 4, A–B). Accumulation of LC3-II can be due to increased autophagy or inhibition of the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (19Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H. Acevedo Arozena A. Adachi H. Adams C.M. Adams P.D. Adeli K. Adhihetty P.J. Adler S.G. Agam G. Agarwal R. Aghi M.K. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition).Autophagy. 2016; 12: 1-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3432) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach to assess autophagy, we expressed an LC3B reporter fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and mCherry, which marks autophagosomes yellow and autophago-lysosomes red due to interference of the acidic environment with EGFP fluorescence (19Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H. Acevedo Arozena A. Adachi H. Adams C.M. Adams P.D. Adeli K. Adhihetty P.J. Adler S.G. Agam G. Agarwal R. Aghi M.K. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition).Autophagy. 2016; 12: 1-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3432) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with Stattic for 8 h, the LC3B fusion protein became localized to puncta that were either yellow or red (Fig. 4C). This result shows that Stattic increased autophagic vesicle formation in MDA-MB-231, as reported previously (18Shen S. Niso-Santano M. Adjemian S. Takehara T. Malik S.A. Minoux H. Souquere S. Marino G. Lachkar S. Senovilla L. Galluzzi L. Kepp O. Pierron G. Maiuri M.C. Hikita H. et al.Cytoplasmic STAT3 represses autophagy by inhibiting PKR activity.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 667-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the same response was observed in STAT3-null PC3 cells, indicating that STAT3 is not necessary for the induction of autophagic vesicle formation in these cells. Taken together, analysis of cytotoxicity and autophagy indicates that several of the cellular effects of Stattic that have previously been attributed to inhibition of STAT3 can occur similarly in STAT3-deficient cells.Figure 5Model illustrating that Stattic can affect gene expression, autophagy, and survival through STAT3-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Not depicted, these two mechanisms may result in complex intersections in cells with activated STAT3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The quest for pharmacological inhibitors of oncogenic proteins and signaling pathways has yielded a plethora of compounds as research tools. However, few compounds are highly specific and/or become useful clinical therapeutics. Thus, similar to other STAT3 inhibitors, Stattic is expected to exert nonspecific effects (3Wake M.S. Watson C.J. STAT3 the oncogene - still eluding therapy?.FEBS J. 2015; 282: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Debnath B. Xu S. Neamati N. Small molecule inhibitors of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) protein.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 6645-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although initially proclaimed as specific for STAT3, Stattic was later shown to also inhibit phosphorylation of other STAT family members (20Debnath B. Xu S. Neamati N. Small molecule inhibitors of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) protein.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 6645-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Sanseverino I.

Biol. 2012; 19 (author reply 1215-1216): 1213-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Possibly, the discrepancy in results could be due to differences between cell types and also raise the possibility for indirect mechanisms of inhibition. Indeed, while Stattic was shown to directly alkylate STAT3 (22Heidelberger S. Zinzalla G. Antonow D. Essex S. Basu B.P. Palmer J. Husby J. Jackson P.J. Rahman K.M. Wilderspin A.F. Zloh M. Thurston D.E. Investigation of the protein alkylation sites of the STAT3:STAT3 inhibitor Stattic by mass spectrometry.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2013; 23: 4719-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indirect inactivation of STAT3 via irreversible inhibition of the oxidoreductase TrxR1 (TXNRD1) was reported as a mechanism of several STAT3 inhibitors including Stattic (23Busker S. Qian W. Haraldsson M. Espinosa B. Johansson L. Attarha S. Kolosenko I. Liu J. Dagnell M. Grander D. Arner E.S.J. Tamm K.P. Page B.D.G. Irreversible TrxR1 inhibitors block STAT3 activity and induce cancer cell death.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaax7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our study revealed that Stattic treatment reduces the levels of histone acetylation independent of STAT3 activity. While HAT and HDAC protein families were named based on histones as prominent targets, many if not all cellular proteins can be modified by lysine acetylation, and the effects of inhibitors of either family will have profound effects on protein functions beyond genome organization. Intriguingly, TrxR1 is activated through acetylation (24Wright D.E. Altaany Z. Bi Y. Alperstein Z. O'Donoghue P. Acetylation regulates thioredoxin reductase oligomerization and activity.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2018; 29: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggesting that Stattic inhibition of TrxR1 could be due to inhibition of its acetylation. STAT3 itself is a target of acetylation including by the HAT CBP/p300, which promotes STAT3 dimerization and activity without affecting its phosphorylation (25Zhuang S. Regulation of STAT signaling by acetylation.Cell Signal. 2013; 25: 1924-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Yuan Z.L. Guan Y.J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E.

Shulman G.I. Horvath T.L. Gao Q. STAT3 inhibition of gluconeogenesis is downregulated by SirT1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Kimura K. Yamada T. Matsumoto M. Kido Y. Hosooka T. Asahara S. Matsuda T. Ota T. Watanabe H. Sai Y. Miyamoto K. Kaneko S. Kasuga M. Inoue H. Endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibits STAT3-dependent suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis via dephosphorylation and deacetylation.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HDACs are involved in termination of STAT3 activation (25Zhuang S. Regulation of STAT signaling by acetylation.Cell Signal. 2013; 25: 1924-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which may explain the accumulation of pSTAT3Y705 occasionally observed in our experiments after romidepsin treatment (e.g., Figs. 1C and 2C). In light of the reduction of histone acetylation by Stattic, the potential effect of Stattic on reducing STAT3 acetylation cannot be ruled out as part of its mechanism as a STAT3 inhibitor. Our results could lead to the speculation that Stattic inhibits histone acetylation. There has been considerable interest in targeting epigenetic regulators in cancer and other diseases. However, while several HDAC inhibitors are currently used in the clinic, development of HAT inhibitors has proven significantly more challenging (29Simon R.P. Robaa D. Alhalabi Z. Sippl W. Jung M. KATching-up on small molecule modulators of lysine acetyltransferases.J. Med. Chem. 2016; 59: 1249-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Baell J.B. Miao W. Histone acetyltransferase inhibitors: where art thou?.Future Med. Chem. 2016; 8: 1525-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Many HAT inhibitors were shown to be unspecific thiol-reactive compounds (31Dahlin J.L. Nelson K.M. Strasser J.M. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Szewczyk M.M. Organ S. Cuellar M. Singh G. Shrimp J.H. Nguyen N. Meier J.L. Arrowsmith C.H. Brown P.J. Baell J.B. Walters M.A. Assay interference and off-target liabilities of reported histone acetyltransferase inhibitors.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such concerns do not, however, negate their activity as inhibitors of histone acetylation. In turn, Stattic may also be classified as a “thiol-reactive” compound, and it is therefore conceivable that Stattic's effect on histone acetylation is mechanistically similar to that of compounds that were initially identified or characterized as HAT inhibitors. Conversely, curcumin is a natural compound that can inhibit p300/CBP besides other enzymes (29Simon R.P. Robaa D. Alhalabi Z. Sippl W. Jung M. KATching-up on small molecule modulators of lysine acetyltransferases.J. Med. Chem. 2016; 59: 1249-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and inhibits STAT3 through interaction with cysteine (32Hahn Y.I. Kim S.J. Choi B.Y. Cho K.C. Bandu R. Kim K.P. Kim D.H. Kim W. Park J.S. Han B.W. Lee J. Na H.K. Cha Y.N. Surh Y.J. Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-Ras transformed human mammary epithelial cells.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Reducing agents such as DTT and N-acetylcysteine neutralize the STAT3 inhibitory function of Stattic as well as that of thiol-reactive HAT inhibitors (31Dahlin J.L. Nelson K.M. Strasser J.M. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Szewczyk M.M. Organ S. Cuellar M. Singh G. Shrimp J.H. Nguyen N. Meier J.L. Arrowsmith C.H. Brown P.J. Baell J.B. Walters M.A. Assay interference and off-target liabilities of reported histone acetyltransferase inhibitors.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Hahn Y.I. Kim S.J. Choi B.Y. Cho K.C. Bandu R. Kim K.P. Kim D.H. Kim W. Park J.S. Han B.W. Lee J. Na H.K. Cha Y.N. Surh Y.J. Curcumin interacts directly with the Cysteine 259 residue of STAT3 and induces apoptosis in H-Ras transformed human mammary epithelial cells.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, though, N-acetylcysteine's ability to counteract Stattic may not always depend on its antioxidant property (33Uchihara Y. Ohe T. Mashino T. Kidokoro T. Tago K. Tamura H. Funakoshi-Tago M. N-Acetyl cysteine prevents activities of STAT3 inhibitors, Stattic and BP-1-102 independently of its antioxidant properties.Pharmacol. Rep. 2019; 71: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Lastly, because histone acetylation depends also on the availability of acetyl-CoA, compounds that perturb metabolism may similarly result in reduced histone acetylation. To conclude, while the mechanism by which Stattic reduces histone acetylation remains to be determined, we have demonstrated that it does so at the same concentrations at which STAT3 is efficiently inhibited. This activity is independent of STAT3 and, therefore, needs to be considered in the interpretation of results obtained with this drug as indicated in Figure 5. As it was done in many but not all reports on functional studies of STAT3, results obtained with Stattic as a STAT3 inhibitor will need to be validated with alternative approaches such as RNA interference or genetic deletion of STAT3. Lastly, advanced prostate cancer, including the PC3 line used here, has comparatively low HAT activity (34Cang S. Feng J. Konno S. Han L. Liu K. Sharma S.C. Choudhury M. Chiao J.W. Deficient histone acetylation and excessive deacetylase activity as epigenomic marks of prostate cancer cells.Int. J. Oncol. 2009; 35: 1417-1422PubMed Google Scholar). This may be a reason for the high sensitivity of PC3 to inhibition of histone acetylation. Despite the controversies surrounding HAT inhibitors, our data suggest that this pathway could be further explored as potentially targetable in advanced prostate cancer. MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC. The PC3 cell line originated from the NCI Cell Line Repository and SUM149 cells from Asterand Bioscience. Cell lines were last authenticated in 2020 (PC3) and 2017 (SUM149, MDA-MB-231). Cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and ambient oxygen levels. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), PC3 cells in RPMI-1640 media, and SUM149 cells in Ham's F-12 media with 5 μg/ml hydrocortisone and 1 μg/ml Insulin. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The SUM149 data in Figure 1 were obtained from suspension sphere cultures in human MammoCult medium (Stem Cell Tech #05621) supplemented with 1% proliferation supplement (Stem Cell Tech #05622) in ultralow attachment culture dishes for 3 days before drug treatments. Cells were treated with indicated doses of Stattic, romidepsin, or A485 for indicated times in the corresponding culture media. DMSO was used as vehicle control in all the treatments. Reagents used in cell culture were from Selleck Chemicals (Stattic, #S7014; romidepsin, #S3020) Thermo Fisher Scientific (MTT, #M-6494; DPBS, #14190-144; DMEM, #11965-092; F12/GlutaMax media, #31765-035, Pen/Strep, #15140122; L-Glutamine, #25030081), MilliporeSigma (Hydrocortisone, #H4001; Insulin, #10516; DMSO, #D-2650; Propidium Iodide, #P4170), and Quality Biologicals (RPMI-1640, #112-024-101). To assess cell viability by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and the next day triplicate wells were treated with different doses of Stattic, A485, or vehicle for 24 h followed by incubation with 5 mg/ml MTT reagent for 30 min. Formazan crystals formed inside the cells were lysed and dissolved by DMSO. Absorption was measured at 570 nm using a plate reader and represented as percent of DMSO control. Total cell counts and propidium iodide (PI) positive cell counts were assessed with Celigo imaging cytometer (Nexcelom Biosciences) after staining with 0.5 ug/ml propidium iodide (PI). Live cells (PI negative) are presented as % of DMSO control, and dead cells (PI positive) are presented as percent of the total cell number. SUM149 cells were nucleofected with siRNA (pool of three siSTAT3 sequences, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, sc-29493; siControl, 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAUUdTdT-3′) using AMAXA nucleofector program #O-005. Two days later, cells were passaged, and the following day treated as indicated. Whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysis with 2X Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad, Cat# 1610737) followed by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations were measured by Pierce 660 nm protein assay reagent (Thermo Fisher, cat#1861426) in the presence of IDCR reagent (Thermo Fisher, cat#22663) according to manufacturer's protocol. About 20 μg of proteins was loaded onto 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels and Western analyses were carried out using standard procedures. Antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (pSTAT3Y705, #9145; STAT3, #4904; SOX2, #3579; Acetyl-Histone H3 (K27), #8173; Histone H3, #3638; Histone H4, #2935; Anti-mouse IgG, HRP linked, #7076; Anti-Rabbit IgG, HRP linked, #7074), MilliporeSigma (Acetyl-Histone H3, #06-599; Acetyl-Histone H4, #06-866), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CEBPD, #sc-135733; GAPDH, #sc-47724), MBL International Corp (LC3, #PM036), DSHB (α−tubulin, #12G10), and Abcam (Actin, #ab6276). Total RNA was purified by GeneJET RNA purification kit (Thermo Scientific, #K0732), and cDNA was synthesized using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase III (RT) according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, #18080044). PCR was carried out with Fast SYBR Green master mix (#4385612, Applied Biosystems) using the QuantStudio 5 (Applied Biosystems) or 7500 Fast (Applied Biosystems) Real-Time PCR instrument. Relative expression levels were measured using ΔΔCt method. Gene-specific primers were designed as follows for “Gene Name – Forward primer (5′-3′) – Reverse primer (5′-3′)”: CEBPD – CTGTCGGCTGAGAACGAGAA – TGAGGTATGGGTCGTTGCTG; CCL20 – CGAATCAGAAGCAGCAAGCAA – TTGCGCACACAGACAACTTT; CCL2 – CCGAGAGGCTGAGACTAACC – GGGGCATTGATTGCATCTGG; TNFA – TGTTGTAGCAAACCCTCAAGC – CTTGGTCTGGTAGGAGACGG; SOX2 – CCATCCACACTCACGCAAAA – TATACAAGGTCCATTCCCCCG; MYC – AAACACAAACTTGAACAGCTA – ATTTGAGGCAGTTTACATTATG; GAPDH - AAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTG – CCATGGGTGGAATCATATTGGAA; RPLP0 – GCAATGTTGCCAGTGTCTGTC – GCCTTGACCTTTTCAGCAAGT. Autophagic vesicle formation was visualized by the mCherry-EGFP-LC3B reporter, which was a kind gift from Dr. Wei-Xing Zong (Rutgers University, School of Pharmacy). The plasmid was transiently transfected into cells. About 40 h post transfections, the cells were treated with 10 μM Stattic or vehicle control for 8 h followed by live cell imaging of the EGFP and mCherry fluorescence using an LSM710 confocal microscope. NucBlue live cell stain (Invitrogen #R37605) was used for nuclear staining.

Mutations in ABCD4 or LMBRD1, which encode the ABC transporter ABCD4 and lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1, respectively, lead to errors in cobalamin metabolism, with the phenotype of a failure to release cobalamin from lysosomes. However, the mechanism of transport of cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane remains unknown. We previously demonstrated that LMBD1 is required for the translocation of ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes. This suggests that ABCD4 performs an important function in lysosomal membrane cobalamin transport. In this study, we expressed human ABCD4 and LMBD1 in methylotrophic yeast and purified them. We prepared ABCD4 and/or LMBD1 containing liposomes loaded with cobalamin and then quantified the release of cobalamin from the liposomes by reverse-phase HPLC. We observed that ABCD4 was able to transport cobalamin from the inside to the outside of liposomes dependent on its ATPase activity and that LMBD1 exhibited no cobalamin transport activity. These results suggest that ABCD4 may be capable of transporting cobalamin from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. Furthermore, we examined a series of ABCD4 missense mutations to understand how these alterations impair cobalamin transport. Our findings give insight into the molecular mechanism of cobalamin transport by which ABCD4 involves and its importance in cobalamin deficiency.

The ABC transporters comprise a superfamily of membrane-bound proteins that exist in almost all organisms from eubacteria to mammals. In humans, there are 48 members classified into the seven subfamilies A to G, based on structural organization and amino acid homology. These proteins catalyze the ATP-dependent transmembrane transport of a wide variety of substrates in order to sustain cellular homeostasis. Defect in their functions results in various inherited metabolic diseases (1Dassa E. Bouige P. The ABC of ABCs: A phylogenetic and functional classification of ABC systems in living organisms.Res.

ABCD1‒3 are known to be peroxisomal proteins and involved in the transport of CoA derivatives of long, very long, or branched-chain fatty acids (8Morita M. Imanaka T.

Int. 2016; 2016: 6786245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ABCD4 is located on lysosomal membrane (10Coelho D. Kim J.C. Miousse I.R. Fung S. du Moulin M. Buers I. Suormala T. Burda P. Frapolli M. Stucki M. Nurnberg P. Thiele H. Robenek H. Hohne W. Longo N. et al.Mutations in ABCD4 cause a new inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). ABCD4 only slightly interacts with peroxisomal biogenesis factor Pex19p because of lack of the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region responsible for peroxisomal targeting. As a result, ABCD4 is recognized by signal recognition particles and integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (11Kashiwayama Y. Seki M. Yasui A. Murasaki Y. Morita M. Yamashita Y. Sakaguchi M. Tanaka Y. Imanaka T. 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein related protein (P70R/ABCD4) localizes to endoplasmic reticulum not peroxisomes, and NH2-terminal hydrophobic property determines the subcellular localization of ABC subfamily D proteins.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 190-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ABCD4 dimer then forms a complex with lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1, and this complex is translocated from the ER to lysosomes (12Kawaguchi K. Okamoto T. Morita M. Imanaka T. Translocation of the ABC transporter ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes requires the escort protein LMBD1.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 30183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ABCD4 is reportedly involved in the transport of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol, since the dysfunction of ABCD4 results in the failure of lysosomal cobalamin efflux (10Coelho D. Kim J.C. Miousse I.R. Fung S. du Moulin M. Buers I. Suormala T. Burda P. Frapolli M. Stucki M. Nurnberg P. Thiele H. Robenek H. Hohne W. Longo N. et al.Mutations in ABCD4 cause a new inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In humans, cobalamin binds with transcobalamin in the blood stream, and this complex is taken up into lysosomes by transcobalamin receptor–mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, cobalamin is released into the cytosol and converted into two active cofactors: methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, which are required by the cytosolic enzyme methionine synthase and the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, respectively. These cofactors are indispensable for the homeostasis of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (13Hunt A. Harrington D. Robinson S. Vitamin B12 deficiency.BMJ. 2014; 349g5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, mutations of ABCD4 result in the failure of the release of cobalamin from lysosomes into the cytosol. A similar phenotype is caused by mutations of LMBRD1, which encodes the lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1 (14Rutsch F. Gailus S. Miousse I.R. Suormala T. Sagne C. Toliat M.R. Nurnberg G. Wittkampf T. Buers I. Sharifi A. Stucki M. Becker C. Baumgartner M. Robenek H.

Genet. 2009; 41: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). LMBD1 shares a high degree of homology with the limb region protein (15Clark R.M. Marker P.C. Kingsley D.M. A novel candidate gene for mouse and human preaxial polydactyly with altered expression in limbs of hemimelic extra-toes mutant mice.Genomics. 2000; 67: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and lipocalin-1 interacting membrane receptor (16Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. Molecular cloning of a novel lipocalin-1 interacting human cell membrane receptor using phage display.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is reported that a small portion of LMBD1 exists on plasma membranes and is involved in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the insulin receptor as a specific adaptor (17Tseng L.T. Lin C.L. Tzen K.Y. Chang S.C. Chang M.F. LMBD1 protein serves as a specific adaptor for insulin receptor internalization.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 32424-32432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since mutations of ABCD4 and LMBD1 result in a quite similar phenotype, these two proteins are thought to function as a complex during cobalamin metabolism. We previously demonstrated that ABCD4 and LMBD1 form a complex on the ER membrane, and then this complex is translocated from the ER to lysosomes. In addition, this targeting ability of LMBD1 is indispensable for the targeting of ABCD4 to lysosomes (12Kawaguchi K. Okamoto T. Morita M. Imanaka T. Translocation of the ABC transporter ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes requires the escort protein LMBD1.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 30183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, LMBD1 seems necessary to translocate ABCD4 to lysosomes from the ER, and ABCD4 plays a key role in the transport of cobalamin from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. Almost all mammalian ABC transporters, with some notable exception, localized on plasma and organelle membranes, transport the substrate from the cytosolic side to the extracellular space or the organelle lumen, which is considered to be the outside domain of cells; that is, they function as exporters (18Thomas C. Tampé R. Structural and mechanistic principles of ABC transporters.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2020; 89: 605-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If ABCD4 actually transports cobalamin in this direction, ABCD4 would be the first example of a mammalian ABC importer that transports a soluble compound from the outside of cells. In this study, to clarify the role of ABCD4 and LMBD1 in the transport of cobalamin, we expressed human ABCD4 and LMBD1 using the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (formerly called Pichia pastoris) and reconstituted purified ABCD4 and/or LMBD1 in liposomes, as reported previously (19Okamoto T. Kawaguchi K. Watanabe S. Agustina R. Ikejima T. Ikeda K. Nakano M. Morita M. Imanaka T. Characterization of human ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily D reconstituted into proteoliposomes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2018; 496: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we established a cobalamin transport assay employing ABCD4- and/or LMBD1-containing liposomes and characterized the transport mechanism. These results show that ABCD4 by itself transports cobalamin from the inside to the outside of liposomes and that LMBD1 is not required for the transport of cobalamin. These results indicate that ABCD4 functions as an importer on lysosomal membranes. Moreover, insights into the molecular mechanisms of the effect of mutant ABCD4 reported in cobalamin deficiency are provided. ABCD4 and LMBD1 form a complex on lysosomal membranes and are involved in the transport of cobalamin transport across the lysosomal membrane (10Coelho D. Kim J.C. Miousse I.R. Fung S. du Moulin M. Buers I. Suormala T. Burda P. Frapolli M. Stucki M. Nurnberg P. Thiele H. Robenek H. Hohne W. Longo N. et al.Mutations in ABCD4 cause a new inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism.Nat.

Genet. 2009; 41: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). ABCD4 is deduced to be involved in the transport of cobalamin, since LMBD1 assists translocation of ABCD4 from the ER to lysosomes (12Kawaguchi K. Okamoto T. Morita M. Imanaka T. Translocation of the ABC transporter ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes requires the escort protein LMBD1.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 30183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test whether ABCD4 by itself is sufficient to transport cobalamin, we purified His-tagged human ABCD4 expressed in K. phaffii and reconstituted it in liposomes according to the procedure we previously established (19Okamoto T. Kawaguchi K. Watanabe S. Agustina R. Ikejima T. Ikeda K. Nakano M. Morita M. Imanaka T. Characterization of human ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily D reconstituted into proteoliposomes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2018; 496: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). His-ABCD4 expressed under the control of the strong methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter in K. phaffii was solubilized by n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DDM) and then purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. S1A). Since ABCD4 functions as a homodimer in mammalian cells (9Kawaguchi K. Morita M. ABC transporter subfamily D: Distinct differences in behavior between ABCD1-3 and ABCD4 in subcellular localization, function, and human disease.Biomed. Res. Int. 2016; 2016: 6786245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Deme J.C. Hancock M.A. Xia X. Shintre C.A. Plesa M. Kim J.C. Carpenter E.P. Rosenblatt D.S. Coulton J.W. Purification and interaction analyses of two human lysosomal vitamin B12 transporters: LMBD1 and ABCD4.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we examined whether ABCD4 heterologously expressed in the yeast forms dimer or not by size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. S1B, ABCD4 showed a polydisperse profile and ∼360 kDa major peak. The molecular weight of dimeric ABCD4 deduced from amino acid sequence is around 140 kDa, but ∼360 kDa major peak corresponds to dimeric ABCD4 as reported previously (20Deme J.C. Hancock M.A. Xia X. Shintre C.A. Plesa M. Kim J.C. Carpenter E.P. Rosenblatt D.S. Coulton J.W. Purification and interaction analyses of two human lysosomal vitamin B12 transporters: LMBD1 and ABCD4.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequently, purified His-ABCD4 was reconstituted in liposomes (Fig. 1A). To examine proper insertion of ABCD4 on liposomes, we evaluated the proportion of the right-side-out orientation. ABCD4-liposomes were treated with trypsin and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-ABCD4 antibody recognizing C-terminal 149 amino acid of ABCD4. As shown in Fig. S2A, approximately 40 kDa band emerged. This band seems to be derived from ABCD4 existing in inside-out orientation. Approximately 70% of ABCD4 reconstituted into liposomes existed in right-side-out orientation calculated from the signal intensities (Fig. S2B). The 110 kDa band is a nonspecific protein derived from the yeast cells during His-tag affinity chromatography. This protein is not an ABCD4-associated protein because it was not coimmunoprecipitated with ABCD4 (Fig. S3A). Since this protein is also reconstituted in liposomes, the liposomes containing only this protein were used as a negative control (Fig. S3B). As mentioned previously, ABCD4 functions as a homodimer in mammalian cells (9Kawaguchi K. Morita M. ABC transporter subfamily D: Distinct differences in behavior between ABCD1-3 and ABCD4 in subcellular localization, function, and human disease.Biomed. Res. Int. 2016; 2016: 6786245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Deme J.C. Hancock M.A. Xia X. Shintre C.A. Plesa M. Kim J.C. Carpenter E.P. Rosenblatt D.S. Coulton J.W. Purification and interaction analyses of two human lysosomal vitamin B12 transporters: LMBD1 and ABCD4.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We examined whether ABCD4 is reconstituted in liposomes as a dimer or not. ABCD4-liposomes were incubated with succinimidyl 4,4'-azipentanoate (SDA), a cross-linking reagent. As shown in Figure 1B, ABCD4 displayed a ∼140 kDa band consistent in mass with dimeric ABCD4 when SDA was photoactivated by UV irradiation. Subsequently, the ATPase activity of liposome-reconstituted ABCD4 was assayed based on the release of organic phosphate from ATP. The reconstituted ABCD4 exhibited ATPase activity, and the activity was increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that ABCD4 was successfully reconstituted in liposomes in the active form. As is well known, the ATPase activity of most ABC transporters is stimulated in the presence of transport substrate. We examined whether cobalamin stimulates the ATPase activity of ABCD4. As ABCD4 exits liposomes in both an inside-out and right-side-out orientation, we initially prepared ABCD4-liposomes with cobalamin and measured ATPase activities by the addition of ATP from outside the liposomes. The ATPase activity of ABCD4 was stimulated when cobalamin was present inside of the ABCD4-liposomes (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, we prepared ABCD4-liposomes without cobalamin and then measured the ATPase activity with cobalamin and ATP in the reaction mixture. As shown in Figure 2A, the addition of cobalamin did not stimulate the ATPase activity of ABCD4. Subsequently, we evaluated the ATPase activities of ABCD4-liposomes containing various concentrations of cobalamin. The stimulation of ABCD4 ATPase activity was increased in proportion to the concentration of cobalamin inside of the ABCD4-liposomes (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the cobalamin inside liposomes is recognized by ABCD4 as substrate and stimulates the ATP hydrolysis of ABCD4. Next, we performed a cobalamin transport assay using ABCD4-liposomes loaded with cobalamin. After incubation with ATP for 30 min, cobalamin was released from ABCD4-liposomes but not negative control liposomes (Fig. S4). Subsequently, the ABCD4-liposomes were incubated with ATP, and aliquots were removed at various time points. The cobalamin released from the ABCD4-liposomes was calculated as described in Experimental procedures section. As shown in Figure 3A, cobalamin was transported in a time-dependent manner by ABCD4. Kinetic properties were determined using ABCD4 containing liposomes loaded with various concentrations of cobalamin. Lineweaver–Burk plot was used to calculate the Km and Vmax values, which came out as 426 μM and 667 pmol/min/mg, respectively (Fig. S5). Since the lysosome lumen is maintained in an acidic condition, we next examined the effect of a low pH inside the liposomes on the transport activities of ABCD4. ABCD4-liposomes were prepared in an acidic pH, and the transport assay was performed at a neural pH to mimic the physiological conditions. However, the low pH condition did not exert any influence on either the ATPase or the cobalamin transport activities (Fig. 3B and Fig. S6), suggesting that cobalamin transport by ABCD4 is not dependent on proton-motive force. Next, to test whether cobalamin transport depends on ATPase activity, we prepared ABCD4 (K427A), a Walker A lysine mutant deficient in ATPase activity. We also expressed His-ABCD4 (K427A) under the control of the AOX1 promoter in K. phaffii. His-ABCD4 (K427A) was purified and reconstituted in liposomes using the same procedure as used for His-ABCD4 (Fig. S7A). It was confirmed that this mutant had lost ATPase activity (Fig. S7B). In the transport assay, cobalamin was not released from ABCD4 (K427A)-liposomes loaded with cobalamin at any time point (Fig. 3A). This indicates that ABCD4 (K427A) had lost transport activity in addition to ATPase activity. These results demonstrated that ABCD4 transports cobalamin from the inside to the outside of liposomes in a manner that is dependent on ATPase activity. As described previously, mutations in LMBRD1, which encodes the lysosomal membrane protein LMBD1, result in the failure of cobalamin release from lysosomes, which is the same phenotype as seen in ABCD4 dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that LMBD1 interacts with ABCD4 and regulates the translocation of ABCD4 from the ER to lysosomes in mammalian cells (12Kawaguchi K. Okamoto T. Morita M. Imanaka T. Translocation of the ABC transporter ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes requires the escort protein LMBD1.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 30183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that mutation of LMBD1 affects this translocation of ABCD4. We examined whether LMBD1 has any other effect on ABCD4 function in addition to its localization. We first prepared a K. phaffii strain expressing glutathione-S-transferase (GST)–tagged LMBD1. The expressed LMBD1–GST was solubilized with β-DDM and then purified by GST-tag affinity chromatography (Fig. S8). Then we examined whether purified ABCD4 and LMBD1 interact with each other. His-ABCD4 and LMBD1–GST were mixed and then subjected to pull-down assay using His-tag affinity resin. As shown in Figure 4A, LMBD1–GST was coprecipitated with His-ABCD4. Likewise, His-ABCD4 was coprecipitated with LMBD1–GST by pull-down assay using GST-tag affinity agarose (Fig. S9A). In addition, LMBD1 was not coprecipitated with His-ABCD1 unlike ABCD4 (Fig. S9B), suggesting that interaction of ABCD4 with LMBD1 is specific, and it is not nonspecific interactions between two misfolded membrane proteins. Furthermore, the binding stoichiometry between purified ABCD4 and LMBD1 was analyzed by crosslinking. As shown in Fig. S9C, ∼300 kDa band consistent in mass with one dimeric His-ABCD4 plus one dimeric LMBD1–GST was detected in addition to dimeric His-ABCD4 or dimeric LMBD1–GST when cross-linking reagents were photoactivated by UV irradiation. These results indicate that purified ABCD4 and LMBD1 interact each other with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Subsequently, we prepared ABCD4/LMBD1-liposomes. It was confirmed that ABCD4 and LMBD1 maintained the same binding stoichiometry in ABCD4/LMBD1-liposomes (Fig. S9C). ABCD4/LMBD1-liposomes also exhibited both ATPase and cobalamin transport activity. There was no difference in either the ATPase or the cobalamin transport activities compared with the ABCD4-liposomes (Fig. 4, B and C). LMBD1 itself had neither ATPase nor cobalamin transport activities (Fig. 4, B and C). To date, eight clinical mutations in the ABCD4 gene that result in cobalamin deficiency have been reported (21Fettelschoss V. Burda P. Sagne C. Coelho D. De Laet C. Lutz S. Suormala T. Fowler B. Pietrancosta N. Gasnier B. Bornhauser B. Froese D.S. Baumgartner M.R. Clinical or ATPase domain mutations in ABCD4 disrupt the interaction between the vitamin B12-trafficking proteins ABCD4 and LMBD1.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 11980-11991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, there are three missense mutations, N141K, Y319C, and R432Q. Arg432 is located on or very close to the Walker A motif, which is indispensable for ATPase activity, and it is reported that the R432Q mutant exhibits much lower ATPase activity (22Xu D. Feng Z. Hou W.T. Jiang Y.L. Wang L. Sun L. Zhou C.Z. Chen Y. Cryo-EM structure of human lysosomal cobalamin exporter ABCD4.Cell Res. 2019; 29: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is also reported that Asn141 and Tyr319 are located on the cytosolic side of transmembrane helix 3 (TM3) and the lysosomal side of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), respectively, as shown by cryo-EM (22Xu D. Feng Z. Hou W.T. Jiang Y.L. Wang L. Sun L. Zhou C.Z. Chen Y. Cryo-EM structure of human lysosomal cobalamin exporter ABCD4.Cell Res. 2019; 29: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We focused on the role of these amino acid residues during the transport of cobalamin mediated by ABCD4. We initially examined the subcellular localization of ABCD4 (N141K) and ABCD4 (Y319C) in mammalian cells. We previously established CHO cells stably expressing LMBD1–GFP and demonstrated that the ABCD4–hemagglutinin (HA) transiently expressed in these cells is localized to lysosomes (12Kawaguchi K. Okamoto T. Morita M. Imanaka T. Translocation of the ABC transporter ABCD4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes requires the escort protein LMBD1.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 30183Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ABCD4 (N141K)–HA or ABCD4 (Y319C)–HA was also transiently expressed in these CHO cells. The distribution of ABCD4 (N141K)–HA or ABCD4 (Y319C)–HA partially coincided with that of LMBD1–GFP (Fig. S10), indicating that a portion of both ABCD4 (N141K) and ABCD4 (Y319C) is localized in lysosomes, as in the case of wildtype ABCD4. Next, to evaluate the function of ABCD4 (N141K) and ABCD4 (Y319C), we prepared a K. phaffii strain expressing His-ABCD4 (N141K) or His-ABCD4 (Y319C). Both types of mutant ABCD4 were purified and reconstituted in liposomes using the same procedure as used for His-ABCD4 (Fig. S11A). Moreover, it was confirmed that these mutants were reconstituted in liposomes as a dimer (Fig. S11B). Subsequently, the ATPase and transport activities of these mutants were examined. As shown in Figure 5, A and B, ABCD4 (N141K) exhibited ATPase activity corresponding with the wildtype but lost cobalamin transport activity. On the other hand, ABCD4 (Y319C) lost both the ATPase and transport activities. Asn141 is located on the cytosolic side of TM3 and faces the transmembrane cavity and is deduced to form a hydrogen bond with Asp221, which is located on the cytosolic side of TM4 (22Xu D. Feng Z. Hou W.T. Jiang Y.L. Wang L. Sun L. Zhou C.Z. Chen Y. Cryo-EM structure of human lysosomal cobalamin exporter ABCD4.Cell Res. 2019; 29: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic or ionic environment of this area might be important for the transport of cobalamin through the conformational change of the TMs associated with the ATP binding and hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). We changed the mutated Lys141 to Ala141 or Asp141 and measured the ATPase and cobalamin transport activities. As shown in Figure 5A, ABCD4 (N141A) and ABCD4 (N141D) also exhibited ATPase activity equal to that of the wildtype. Interestingly, the cobalamin transport activity was recovered to the same level as the wildtype in both ABCD4 (N141A) and ABCD4 (N141D) (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that an increase in the anionic charge in this area by substitution of Asn141 to Lys141 might disturb the cobalamin transport of ABCD4. In the case of Tyr319, substitution to Cys resulted in the loss of the ATPase activity as well as cobalamin transport activity. Surprisingly, Tyr319 is located on the lumen side of TM6 far away from the NBD that is indispensable for ATPase activity (22Xu D. Feng Z. Hou W.T. Jiang Y.L. Wang L. Sun L. Zhou C.Z. Chen Y. Cryo-EM structure of human lysosomal cobalamin exporter ABCD4.Cell Res. 2019; 29: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of Tyr319, we first tested whether ATP can access the NBD in ABCD4 (Y319C) using an ATP probe for photoaffinity labeling (Fig. S12A), since ABCD4 (Y319C) lacks ATPase activity. As a result, ABCD4 (Y319C) was labeled by the ATP probe under UV irradiation, and this labeling was inhibited by the presence of adenylyl imidodiphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S12B). These results suggest that the conformational change coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP was disturbed in the Y319C mutant. Recently, in Cyanidioschyzon merolae ABCB1, the van der Waals contacts and hydrogen-bonding network in the cluster of aromatic hydrophobic side chains in the upper part of the transmembrane helices were shown to play an important role in the interactions among the transmembrane helices (23Kodan A.

Endolysins in Gram-positive phages come in a variety of multimodular forms that combine different catalytic and cell wall binding domains. However, the reason why phages adopt endolysins with such complex multidomain architecture is not well understood. In this study, we used the Streptococcus dysgalactiae phage endolysin PlySK1249 as a model to investigate the role of multidomain architecture in phage-induced bacterial lysis and lysis regulation. PlySK1249 consists of an amidase (Ami) domain that lyses bacterial cells, a nonbacteriolytic endopeptidase (CHAP) domain that acts as a dechaining enzyme, and a central LysM cell wall binding domain. We observed that the Ami and CHAP domains synergized for peptidoglycan digestion and bacteriolysis in the native enzyme or when expressed individually and reunified. The CHAP endopeptidase resolved complex polymers of stem-peptides to dimers and helped the Ami domain to digest peptidoglycan to completion. We also found that PlySK1249 was subject to proteolytic cleavage by host cell wall proteases both in vitro and after phage induction. Cleavage disconnected the different domains by hydrolyzing their linker regions, thus hindering their bacteriolytic cooperation and possibly modulating the lytic activity of the enzyme. PlySK1249 cleavage by cell-wall-associated proteases may represent another example of phage adaptation toward the use of existing bacterial regulation mechanism for their own advantage. In addition, understanding more thoroughly the multidomain interplay of PlySK1249 broadens our knowledge on the ideal architecture of therapeutic antibacterial endolysins.

Cleavage disconnected the different domains by hydrolyzing their linker regions, thus hindering their bacteriolytic cooperation and possibly modulating the lytic activity of the enzyme. PlySK1249 cleavage by cell-wall-associated proteases may represent another example of phage adaptation toward the use of existing bacterial regulation mechanism for their own advantage. In addition, understanding more thoroughly the multidomain interplay of PlySK1249 broadens our knowledge on the ideal architecture of therapeutic antibacterial endolysins. Phage endolysins represent a fascinating family of peptidoglycan hydrolases that are critical for bacterial lysis and release of phage progeny at the end of the phage life cycle (1Young R. Phage lysis: Three steps, three choices, one outcome.J. Microbiol. 2014; 52: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). They have gained recent interest in biomedical development as potential antibacterial agents (2Nelson D.C. Schmelcher M. Rodriguez-Rubio L. Klumpp J. Pritchard D.G. Dong S. Donovan D.M.

Microbiol. 2010; 300: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Phage endolysins target the bacterial peptidoglycan, an essential structure made of a complex meshwork of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)–N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) glycan strands cross-linked by short stem peptides attached to MurNAc residues (5Schleifer K.H.

They can cleave various bonds between sugars or peptide chains and come in a variety of uni- or multimodular forms. Endolysins encoded by phages infecting Gram-positive bacteria are usually composed of several functional domains including glucosaminidases, amidases, and endopeptidases (referred to as catalytic domains or CDs) and cell-wall-binding domains (referred to as CBDs) (7Horgan M. O'Flynn G. Garry J. Cooney J. Coffey A. Fitzgerald G.F. Ross R.P. McAuliffe O.

For instance, the well-characterized staphylococcal endolysins Lysk, Ф11, and MV-L, as well as streptococcal endolysins B30 and lambdaSa2 contain two CDs and one CBD (10O'Flaherty S. Coffey A.

However, when individually tested in truncated constructs, only one of these CDs conferred bacterial lysis in a “lysis from without” scenario. For this reason, the functional role of nonbacteriolytic CDs is not entirely clear. It has also been hypothesized that their lytic activities were progressively lost through evolution and/or that they might be involved in reinforcing cell wall binding (15Donovan D.M. Foster-Frey J.

However, CBDs are not always required for bacterial lysis since deleting them has even improved the lytic activity of some endolysins even without loss of specificity, as shown for endolysin B30, (7Horgan M.

LysK CHAP endopeptidase domain is required for lysis of live staphylococcal cells.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 294: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Hence, nonbacteriolytic CDs or CBDs may have additional or alternative roles in the endolysin physiology. In this work, we attempted to clarify the functional roles of the CDs and the CBD of the Streptococcus dysgalactiae phage endolysin PlySK1249 (25Oechslin F. Daraspe J. Giddey M. Moreillon P. Resch G. In vitro characterization of PlySK1249, a novel phage lysin, and assessment of its antibacterial activity in a mouse model of Streptococcus agalactiae bacteremia.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2013; 57: 6276-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and their implication in the physiology of phage-induced bacterial lysis. This endolysin has a complex structure with a central LysM CBD, an N-terminal amidase (Ami) domain, and a C-terminal Cysteine Histidine-dependent Amidohydrolase Peptidase (CHAP) domain. While amidases (or N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases) are enzymes known to hydrolyze the amide bond between the N-acetylmuramoyl glycan moiety and the first L-ala of the stem peptides (26Herbold D.R. Glaser L. Interaction of N-acetylmuramic acid L-alanine amidase with cell wall polymers.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7231-7238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CHAP domains are primarily endopeptidases, sometimes with amidase activities (27Rigden D.J. Jedrzejas M.J. Galperin M.Y. Amidase domains from bacterial and phage autolysins define a family of gamma-D,L-glutamate-specific amidohydrolases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 230-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We could observe that the Ami domain was a bacteriolytic amidase, whereas CHAP was a nonbacteriolytic endopeptidase that could synergize for efficient bacterial lysis. The CHAP domain also acted as a dechaining enzyme and shared high functional and structural analogies with dechaining autolysins present in lactococci or streptococci (28Fan D.P. Autolysin(s) of Bacillus subtilis as dechaining enzyme.J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Layec S. Gerard J. Legue V. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Courtin P. Borges F.

Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We finally notice that PlySK1249 was subject to proteolytic cleavage by cell wall proteases both ex vivo and after phage induction in vivo. Cleavage dismantled the CDs by hydrolyzing their linker regions, thus hindering their bacteriolytic cooperation and possibly modulating the lytic activity of the enzyme. Like for proteolytic regulation of certain autolysins (30Steen A. Palumbo E. Deghorain M. Cocconcelli P.S. Delcour J. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. Buist G. Hols P. Autolysis of Lactococcus lactis is increased upon d-alanine depletion of peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acids.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Buist G.

Functional analysis of AtlA, the major N-acetylglucosaminidase of Enterococcus faecalis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), PlySK1249 cleavage could represent a new mechanism of dual phage-bacterial regulation of endolysin-induced lysis. In addition, understanding more thoroughly the interdomain interplay of PlySK1249 may be useful in the design of novel therapeutic lysins. To assess the specific roles of each of the predicted domains, various truncated forms of PlySK1249 were generated (Fig. 1A). After being overexpressed in Escherichia coli, the protein constructs were purified by affinity chromatography using a 6xHis tag at the C-terminal position. The purity and the correct molecular weight were verified on 4 to 12% BisTris gels (Fig. 1B) (∼54 kDa for PlySK1249, ∼19 kDa for Ami, ∼37 kDa for Ami_LysM, ∼26 kDa for LysM_CHAP). Of note, the CHAP domain could not be overexpressed alone, it always required attachment to the LysM domain. The relative contribution of the two CDs and the CBD to bacterial lysis was compared with the relative contribution of the parent enzyme. The constructs were first tested against an array of different Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 1C). Parent PlySK1249 was more lytic against Streptococcus spp. than against more distantly related species, such as enterococci. Moreover, and apart from a few exceptions, the PlySK1249 truncated forms were less active than the parent enzyme, with Ami_LysM being generally more active than Ami alone and LysM_CHAP showing no lytic activity even when incubated for 2 h (Fig. 1C and data not shown). We further tested the possibility of a cooperative activity between the Ami and CHAP catalytic domains by following the loss of turbidity and cell viability when used alone or mixed together against S. dysgalactiae 1249 cells (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively). The results confirmed the decrease of intrinsic lytic activity of the subdomains observed in Figure 1C (Fig. 1D). Indeed, while PlySK1249 caused a rapid 50% drop in turbidity within 5 min, Ami_LysM showed intermediate lysis (50% drop in turbidity in 1 h) and LysM_CHAP was not lytic at all. However, adding equimolar amounts of nonlytic LysM_CHAP to Ami_LysM gradually increased lysis while a 1/10 Ami_LysM/LysM_CHAP ratio almost completely restoring lysis efficiency at 1 h, as compared with the parent PlySK1249. This interdomain cooperation was formally synergistic (i.e., the effect of the domain combination was superior than the sum of their individual effects) and was also observed between Ami and LysM_CHAP (data not presented). These results correlated with the viable cell counts obtained in time-kill assays (Fig. 1E). A closer look at the LysM_CHAP activity using optical and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed subtle nonlytic effects (Fig. 2). Phase-contrast optical microscopy of exponential phase cultures (OD600nm 0.5) of S. dysgalactiae SK1249 showed that they were composed of 90% of chains ranging from 6 to 37 cells (Fig. 2A). However, 1 h of incubation with LysM_CHAP resulted in chain disruption with the majority (60%) of chains harboring only 1 to 5 bacteria, the rest of them being distributed over longer structures (Fig. 2B). This nonlytic activity was further supported by TEM imaging. Control cells incubated in PBS alone showed a typical Gram-positive bacterial shape (Fig. 2C, Buffer control). Cells treated with PlySK1249 or Ami_LysM were lysed as assessed by the presence of a majority of ghost cells (15 min incubation, Fig. 2C, PlySK1249 and Ami_LysM). Treatment with LysM_CHAP alone resulted in round swelling cells with surface alterations but absence of lysis even after 1 h exposure (Fig. 2C, LysM_CHAP). To better understand the contribution of each CD domains to the overall activity of the enzyme, we further looked at their specific peptidoglycan cleavage sites. Glycosidase or peptidase activity was first assed for PlySK1249 and its truncated constructs using purified S. dysgalactiae cell wall. Compared with the N-acetylmuramidase mutanolysin, none of the constructs had glycosidase activities according to Park–Johnson assay (Table S2). In contrast, using a modified Ghuysen assay, free amino groups release was measured after peptidoglycan hydrolysis by PlyKS1249 and all the PlySK1249-derived constructs, therefore identifying an amidase and/or endopeptidase activity. To discriminate between amidase and endopeptidase activities for the Ami and CHAP catalytic domains, digested peptidoglycan was further analyzed RP-HPLC and LC-MS for the presence of precursor masses containing the stem peptide motif AQKAAA and polymers of it. After digestion with PlySK1249, two major peaks with relatively short retention times were identified by RP-HPLC (at approximately 35 and 42 min, Fig. 3A.I). These were mainly identified as stem peptides dimers by LC-MS, also presence of monomers and trimers was detected (Fig. 3B). After digestion with Ami_LysM or Ami alone, the two major peaks became marginal and were replaced by an array of smaller peaks eluting later in the RP-HPLC profile (between 55 and 90 min, Fig. 3A.II and Fig. S1A, respectively). LC-MS analysis showed that these peaks covered an array from trimers to heptamers that eluted later in RP-HPLC profiles (Fig. 3B and Figs. S2 and S3). Moreover, identical profiles were obtained for Ami and Ami_LysM, indicating that the LysM CBD was not responsible for altering the hydrolytic profile (Fig. S1A). The digestion with LysM_CHAP did not yield any major peak pattern, although two small peaks could be observed at 36 and 42 min. These peaks were not observed with the Ami domain alone but were present in the PlySK1249 digestion (Fig. S1, B and C). This indicates that the LysM_CHAP construct is able to solubilize peptidoglycan to a very small extend, which can be attributed to its endopeptidase activity. Indeed, internal hydrolysis of the peptide cross bridges does not disconnect stem peptides from the glycan fraction, which is lost during the sequential glycan precipitation. Importantly, combining LysM_CHAP with Ami_LysM restored the complete digestion pattern of the whole PlySK1249 enzyme (Fig. 3A.IV). The fact that the digestion product of the native enzyme is mainly composed of dimers also indicates that LysM_CHAP could resolve stem-peptide multimers mainly to dimers, but rarely to monomers. Since glycan strands can remain connected through dimer crosslinks, which are sufficient to maintain a loose polymer structure and thus prevent bacterial lysis, this might explain why the CHAP domain is not directly lytic on its own. Finally, the digestion products summarized in Fig. S2 confirmed an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine activity for the Ami domain and most probably an L-Ala-D-Ala endopeptidase activity for the CHAP domain according to the predicted structure of the dimer (Fig. 3C). The complex nature of PlySK1249 may be a source of instability as previous authors observed degradation of multidomain autolysins by cell-wall-associated proteases (30Steen A. Palumbo E. Deghorain M. Cocconcelli P.S. Delcour J. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. Buist G. Hols P. Autolysis of Lactococcus lactis is increased upon d-alanine depletion of peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acids.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Buist G. Venema G. Kok J. Autolysis of Lactococcus lactis is influenced by proteolysis.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5947-5953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. Functional analysis of AtlA, the major N-acetylglucosaminidase of Enterococcus faecalis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For this reason, we tested the resistance of PlySK1249 to protease-induced cleavage first by trypsin and second by bacterial-wall-associated proteases. Proteolytic cleavage of PlySK1249 was observed to be restricted to the two linkers connecting the different enzyme active domains, while the active domains themselves were left intact. Two bands having a lower molecular mass could be observed after overnight incubation of the endolysin with 1 μg/ml of trypsin (Fig. 4A). Amino acid sequencing of extracted bands confirmed the presence of two peptides corresponding to the CHAP (aa 318–489) and Ami (aa 1–204) CD domains in the upper band 1 and the Ami (aa 1–175) domain only in the lower band 2 (Table S3). These results were also confirmed by western blotting using Anti-6xHis tag antibodies. Similar results were finally observed when the Ami_LysM or the LysM_CHAP constructs were exposed to trypsin degradation, which also resulted with the cleavage of the connecting linkers (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, PlySK1249 was composed of different trypsin-resistant cores corresponding to the CD and CBD domains and trypsin-susceptible linker regions. Extracts of S. dysgalactiae SK1249 cell-wall-associated proteins were also prepared and incubated with either the native enzyme or the Ami_LysM and LysM_CHAP constructs (Fig. 4D). Due to the large number of proteins in the cell wall extract, it was not possible to visualize the degradation products by Coomassie-blue staining. Therefore, western blotting with an Anti-6xHis tag antibody was used as for trypsin digestion. After overnight incubation, two bands were generated for PlySK1249 at approximately 30 and 20 kDa, which were absent in the control with the endolysin alone, as well as in the wall protein extract (result not shown) (Fig. 4D.I). Degradation was also observed for the LysM-CHAP construct with an additional band at 20 kDa (Fig. 4D.II). Due to the position of the 6xHis tag in the C-terminal part of the enzyme, the Ami domain alone was not observed (Fig. 4D.III). Importantly, these results are similar to the one observed using trypsin and confirmed that PlySK1249 was cleaved between its two linkers, by both trypsin and cell-wall proteases. We used a bioactivity-guided fractionation protocol to identify the host cell-wall-associated proteases that are responsible for PlySK1249 degradation (Fig. 5). Ammonium sulfate was used for a first round of sorting and fractions were tested on the LysM_CHAP construct. LysM_CHAP proteolytic degradation was observed for fractions precipitated at 60% to 75% sulfate ammonium (Fig. 5A). A second purification step was performed by size-exclusion chromatography using a 55% to 80% ammonium sulfate fraction, and the output was again tested for proteolytic activity on the LysM_CHAP construct (Fig. 5B). Four different fractions (B4, B6, B8, and B10) were further analyzed by LC-MS and a total of ten different host-associated proteases could be detected (Fig. 5C, Table S4, and Supplemental Data 1). Five of them (namely pepF, pepN, pepO, pepS, pepT) were observed only in the two proteolytic active fractions B8 and B10, which indicate that PlySK1249 can be cleaved by a specific subset of host associated proteases. As a proof of concept, we further tested whether endolysin-specific cleavage products could also be generated during phage induction in vivo. Unfortunately, we could not induce the prophage carrying PlySK1249 from its natural Streptococcus dysgaactiae host. Therefore, we took advantage of Streptococcus agalactiae strain FSL S3-026, for which full genome is available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AEXT00000000.1) and which contains a single LambdaSa04-like prophage that is inducible with mitomycin C. This prophage carries an endolysin closely related to PlySK1249 (further named PlySK1249∗; see Experimental procedures section and Fig. S4A), including the same domain architecture and 80% aa homology with the PlySK1249 endolysin (Fig. S4B). Cultures of S. agalactiae FSL-S3 were either induced with mitomycin C or left uninduced as negative controls (Fig. 6A). Supernatants were then collected after 6 h and loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 6B). The gel was split into five different fragments covering a range of molecular weights from 75 to 10 kDa and further analyzed by LC-MS for the presence of prophage proteins. A total of 11 prophage-related proteins were identified in the supernatant of the induced culture and, to a much lesser extent, in the noninduced fractions, suggesting basal induction of the prophage (Table S5 and Supplemental Data 2). A closer look at the peptides that were detected in the different gel fragments indicated that PlySK1249∗ was present in the supernatant in its original form, but also in specific cleavage products (Fig. 6C). Peptides covering the total lengths of the enzyme were detected in band A (ranging from approximately 75–40 kDa) mainly in induced cultures and somewhat in noninduced samples. Peptides covering the Ami_LysM and Ami catalytic sites were also observed in the lower part of the gel at two different positions, indicating cleavage in the linkers on both sides of LysM. This fulfilled the concept that linker-domain-specific cleavage of PlySK1249∗ endolysin did occur in vivo as observed with its PlySK1249 homologue in vitro. Finally, specific degradation was also confirmed when compared with the degradation patterns of the other phage proteins, for which only unspecific degradation was observed (Fig. S5). These results further support the specificity of the endolysin cleavage sites. The effect of proteolytic cleavage on the activity and diffusion of PlySK1249 was finally investigated (Fig. 7). Incubation of PlySK1249 with trypsin for half an hour resulted in a reduced lytic activity on S. dysgalactiae SK1249 cells. Indeed, a turbidity decrease of only 40% was observed after 30 min compared with an 80% decrease after 10 min without trypsin (Fig. 7A). Because proteolytic cleavage also resulted in the separation of the LysM-binding domain from the catalytic sites, we measured the diffusion of PlySK1249, Ami, and Ami_LysM across a layer of soft agar containing heat-inactivated S. dysgalactiae SK1249 cells. Due to the lytic activity of the amidase domain, we evaluated the diffusion of the different constructs by measuring the diameters of the clear halos produced by bacterial lysis (Fig. 7B). LysM prevented diffusion of the Ami domain when tested against three different streptococci (average diameter decreased from ∼2.5 cm for Ami compared with ∼1 cm for Ami_LysM, Fig. 7, D and E). The diffusion of PlySK1249 was similar to that of Ami_LysM, indicating that the phenomenon was independent of the protein molecular weight (Fig. 7, D and E). In addition, diffusion of Ami was concentration-dependent, whereas LysM prevented diffusion over a >100-fold range of concentrations (Fig. 7F). In the present study, we aimed at understanding the individual and cooperative roles of the PlySK1249 functional domains, as well as their potential involvement in endolysin lysis regulation. Using the parent enzyme and truncated constructs, we found that the three domains cooperated to increase the overall lytic activity of the enzyme. Although CHAP was not bacteriolytic, it did have a substantial cooperative effect (which was in fact synergistic since the activity of combined domains was greater than the sum of the activities of individual domains) when combined with Ami as in the context of native PlySK1249. We further investigated the functions of the three domains and demonstrated"

These interactions depend on the arrangement of sulfated sugars in the HS chains generated by well-characterized biosynthetic enzymes; however, the regulation of these enzymes is largely unknown. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens with a small-molecule ligand that binds to HS. Screening of A375 melanoma cells uncovered additional genes and pathways impacting HS formation. The top hit was the epigenetic factor KDM2B, a histone demethylase. KDM2B inactivation suppressed multiple HS sulfotransferases and upregulated the sulfatase SULF1. These changes differentially affected the interaction of HS-binding proteins. KDM2B-deficient cells displayed decreased growth rates, which was rescued by SULF1 inactivation. In addition, KDM2B deficiency altered the expression of many extracellular matrix genes. Thus, KDM2B controls proliferation of A375 cells through the regulation of HS structure and serves as a master regulator of the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W3113528198,"Numerous diseases are linked to mutations in the actin-binding domains (ABDs) of conserved cytoskeletal proteins, including β-III-spectrin, α-actinin, filamin, and dystrophin. A β-III-spectrin ABD mutation (L253P) linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5) causes a dramatic increase in actin binding. Reducing actin binding of L253P is thus a potential therapeutic approach for SCA5 pathogenesis. Here, we validate a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to discover potential disrupters of the interaction between the mutant β-III-spectrin ABD and actin in live cells. This assay monitors FRET between fluorescent proteins fused to the mutant ABD and the actin-binding peptide Lifeact, in HEK293-6E cells. Using a specific and high-affinity actin-binding tool compound, swinholide A, we demonstrate HTS compatibility with an excellent Z'-factor of 0.67 ± 0.03. Screening a library of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds in 1536-well plates to determine assay robustness, we demonstrate high reproducibility across plates and across days. We identified nine Hits that reduced FRET between Lifeact and ABD. Four of those Hits were found to reduce Lifeact cosedimentation with actin, thus establishing the potential of our assay for detection of actin-binding modulators. Concurrent to our primary FRET assay, we also developed a high-throughput compatible counter screen to remove undesirable FRET Hits. Using the FRET Hits, we show that our counter screen is sensitive to undesirable compounds that cause cell toxicity or ABD aggregation. Overall, our FRET-based HTS platform sets the stage to screen large compound libraries for modulators of β-III-spectrin, or disease-linked spectrin-related proteins, for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W3143327342,"Dysregulated glucagon secretion deteriorates glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although insulin is known to regulate glucagon secretion via its cognate receptor (insulin receptor, INSR) in pancreatic alpha cells, the role of downstream proteins and signaling pathways underlying insulin's activities are not fully defined. Using in vivo (knockout) and in vitro (knockdown) studies targeting insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, we compared the relative roles of IRS1 and IRS2 in regulating alpha cell function. Alpha cell-specific IRS1-knockout mice exhibited glucose intolerance and inappropriate glucagon suppression during glucose tolerance tests. In contrast, alpha cell-specific IRS2-knockout animals manifested normal glucose tolerance and suppression of glucagon secretion after glucose administration. Alpha cell lines with stable IRS1 knockdown could not repress glucagon mRNA expression and exhibited a reduction in phosphorylation of AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT, at Ser-473 and Thr-308). AlphaIRS1KD cells also displayed suppressed global protein translation, including reduced glucagon expression, impaired cytoplasmic Ca2+ response, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This was supported by the identification of novel IRS1-specific downstream target genes, Trpc3 and Cartpt, that are associated with glucagon regulation in alpha cells. These results provide evidence that IRS1, rather than IRS2, is a dominant regulator of pancreatic alpha cell function."
https://openalex.org/W3150040340,"Carbohydrate active enzymes, such as those involved in plant cell wall and storage polysaccharide biosynthesis and deconstruction, often contain repeating noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) to compensate for low-affinity binding typical of protein–carbohydrate interactions. The bacterium Saccharophagus degradans produces an endo-β-mannanase of glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 8 with three phylogenetically distinct family 10 CBMs located C-terminally from the catalytic domain (SdGH5_8-CBM10x3). However, the functional roles and cooperativity of these CBM domains in polysaccharide binding are not clear. To learn more, we studied the full-length enzyme, three stepwise CBM family 10 (CBM10) truncations, and GFP fusions of the individual CBM10s and all three domains together by pull-down assays, affinity gel electrophoresis, and activity assays. Only the C-terminal CBM10-3 was found to bind strongly to microcrystalline cellulose (dissociation constant, Kd = 1.48 μM). CBM10-3 and CBM10-2 bound galactomannan with similar affinity (Kd = 0.2–0.4 mg/ml), but CBM10-1 had 20-fold lower affinity for this substrate. CBM10 truncations barely affected specific activity on carob galactomannan and konjac glucomannan. Full-length SdGH5_8-CBM10x3 was twofold more active on the highly galactose-decorated viscous guar gum galactomannan and crystalline ivory nut mannan at high enzyme concentrations, but the specific activity was fourfold to ninefold reduced at low enzyme and substrate concentrations compared with the enzyme lacking CBM10-2 and CBM10-3. Comparison of activity and binding data for the different enzyme forms indicates unproductive and productive polysaccharide binding to occur. We conclude that the C-terminal-most CBM10-3 secures firm binding, with contribution from CBM10-2, which with CBM10-1 also provides spatial flexibility.

Interactions between proteins and carbohydrates play a vital role in life and have through evolution been optimized to match the environments where they take place. Affinities of protein–carbohydrate complexes range from millimolar to nanomolar. Low-affinity binding (millimolar range) is considered a key factor in dynamic systems, such as plant cell wall synthesis and degradation, microbe–host interplay, and synthesis and mobilization of storage polysaccharides. The carbohydrate active enzymes catalyzing these different reactions very often contain one or more noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that facilitate the formation of enzyme–substrate complexes and can specifically bind with the substrate polysaccharides or with different polysaccharides located nearby, such as in the plant cell wall. It is common that polysaccharide hydrolases contain several CBMs, but it is difficult to understand the function of these individual CBMs because of their interplay with each other, substrate, other polysaccharides, and the catalytic domain (CD), and perhaps even more than one CD is present (1Conway J.M.

Certain insights are established, for example, on enzymes in cellulosomes with domains of the polyspecific CBM32 family interacting with galactose, lactose, polygalacturonic acid, and N-acetyllactosamine (2Low K.E.

There are many examples where a functional role has been depicted for specific domains, while being unknown for others in multidomain architectures (3Krska D. Larsbrink J.

Clearly, there are relatively few three-dimensional structures available of the more complex multidomain enzymes because of a number of challenges. One being the recombinant production of multimodular proteins containing interdomain linker regions prone to limited proteolysis, another is the dynamic flexibility inherent to the multimodular domain architectures (2Low K.E.

The four prominent types of β-mannans include galactomannans having a β-1,4 mannose backbone with different extents of α-1,6 galactose decoration, glucomannans with an essentially linear backbone of glucosyl and mannosyl units, which in the galactoglucomannans are substituted by α-1,6-galactose (5Dey P.M.

https://openalex.org/W3155824142,"Accurate streamflow prediction plays a pivotal role in hydraulic project design, nonpoint source pollution estimation, and water resources planning and management. However, the highly non-linear relationship between rainfall and runoff makes prediction difficult with desirable accuracy. To improve the accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction, a seasonal Support Vector Regression (SVR) model coupled to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was developed for 13 subwatersheds in the Illinois River watershed (IRW), U.S. Terrain, precipitation, soil, land use and land cover, and monthly streamflow data were used to build the SWAT model. SWAT Streamflow output and the upstream drainage area were used as two input variables into SVR to build the hybrid SWAT-SVR model. The Calibration Uncertainty Procedure (SWAT-CUP) and Sequential Uncertainty Fitting-2 (SUFI-2) algorithms were applied to compare the model performance against SWAT-SVR. The spatial calibration and leave-one-out sampling methods were used to calibrate and validate the hybrid SWAT-SVR model. The results showed that the SWAT-SVR model had less deviation and better performance than SWAT-CUP simulations. SWAT-SVR predicted streamflow more accurately during the wet season than the dry season. The model worked well when it was applied to simulate medium flows with discharge between 5 m 3 s -1 and 30 m 3 s -1 , and its applicable spatial scale fell between 500 to 3000 km 2 . The overall performance of the model on yearly time series is “Satisfactory”. This new SWAT-SVR model has not only the ability to capture intrinsic non-linear behaviors between rainfall and runoff while considering the mechanism of runoff generation but also can serve as a reliable regional tool for an ungauged or limited data watershed that has similar hydrologic characteristics with the IRW."

Larazotide acetate (LA) is a first in class oral peptide developed as a tight junction regulator, which is a lead candidate for management of CeD. A delayed release formulation was tested in vitro and predicted release in the mid duodenum and jejunum, the target site of CeD. The aim of this study was to follow the concentration versus time profile of orally administered LA in the small intestine using a porcine model. A sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to quantify LA concentrations in porcine intestinal fluid samples. Oral dosing of LA (1 mg total) in overnight fasted pigs resulted in time dependent appearance of LA in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. Peak LA concentrations (0.32-1.76 μM) occurred at 1 hour in the duodenum and in proximal jejunum following oral dosing, with the continued presence of LA (0.02-0.47 μM) in the distal duodenum and in proximal jejunum (0.00-0.43 μM) from 2 to 4 hours following oral dosing. The data shows that LA is available in detectable concentrations at the site of CeD."
https://openalex.org/W3153373770,"Background Even after curative resection, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients suffer a high rate of recurrence. There is an unmet need to predict which patients will experience early recurrence after resection in order to adjust treatment strategies. Methods Data of patients with resectable PDAC undergoing surgical resection between January 2005 and September 2018 were reviewed to stratify for early recurrence defined as occurring within 6 months of resection. Preoperative data including demographics, tumor markers, blood immune-inflammatory factors and clinicopathological data were examined. We employed Elastic Net, a sparse modeling method, to construct models predicting early recurrence using these multiple preoperative factors. As a result, seven preoperative factors were selected: age, duke pancreatic monoclonal antigen type 2 value, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index, tumor size, lymph node metastasis and is peripancreatic invasion. Repeated 10-fold cross-validations were performed, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the usefulness of the models. Results A total of 136 patients was included in the final analysis, of which 35 (34%) experienced early recurrence. Using Elastic Net, we found that 7 of 14 preoperative factors were useful for the predictive model. The mean AUC of all models constructed in the repeated validation was superior to the standard marker CA 19–9 (0.718 vs 0.657), whereas the AUC of the model constructed from the entire patient cohort was 0.767. Decision curve analysis showed that the models had a higher mean net benefit across the majority of the range of reasonable threshold probabilities. Conclusion A model using multiple preoperative factors can improve prediction of early resectable PDAC recurrence."

https://openalex.org/W3155825173,"We provide evidence that a member of the human Schlafen (SLFN) family of proteins, SLFN5, is overexpressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Targeted deletion of SLFN5 results in decreased PDAC cell proliferation and suppresses PDAC tumorigenesis in in vivo PDAC models. Importantly, high expression levels of SLFN5 correlate with worse outcomes in PDAC patients, implicating SLFN5 in the pathophysiology of PDAC that leads to poor outcomes. Our studies establish novel regulatory effects of SLFN5 on cell cycle progression through binding/blocking of the transcriptional repressor E2F7, promoting transcription of key genes that stimulate S phase progression. Together, our studies suggest an essential role for SLFN5 in PDAC and support the potential for developing new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of pancreatic cancer through SLFN5 targeting."
https://openalex.org/W3118021397,"Heme oxygenase (HO) converts heme to carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and free iron, products that are essential in cellular redox signaling and iron recycling. In higher plants, HO is also involved in the biosynthesis of photoreceptor pigment precursors. Despite many common enzymatic reactions, the amino acid sequence identity between plant-type and other HOs is exceptionally low (∼19.5%), and amino acids that are catalytically important in mammalian HO are not conserved in plant-type HOs. Structural characterization of plant-type HO is limited to spectroscopic characterization by electron spin resonance, and it remains unclear how the structure of plant-type HO differs from that of other HOs. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of Glycine max (soybean) HO-1 (GmHO-1) at a resolution of 1.06 A and carried out the isothermal titration calorimetry measurements and NMR spectroscopic studies of its interaction with ferredoxin, the plant-specific electron donor. The high-resolution X-ray structure of GmHO-1 reveals several novel structural components: an additional irregularly structured region, a new water tunnel from the active site to the surface, and a hydrogen-bonding network unique to plant-type HOs. Structurally important features in other HOs, such as His ligation to the bound heme, are conserved in GmHO-1. Based on combined data from X-ray crystallography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and NMR measurements, we propose the evolutionary fine-tuning of plant-type HOs for ferredoxin dependency in order to allow adaptation to dynamic pH changes on the stroma side of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplast without losing enzymatic activity under conditions of fluctuating light."
https://openalex.org/W3140900180,"Processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the amyloidogenic pathway is associated with the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. The cleavage of APP by β-secretase to generate the transmembrane 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99) and subsequent processing of C99 by γ-secretase to yield amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are essential steps in this pathway. Biochemical evidence suggests that amyloidogenic processing of C99 occurs in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched liquid-ordered phase membrane rafts. However, direct evidence that C99 preferentially associates with these rafts has remained elusive. Here, we tested this by quantifying the affinity of C99-GFP for raft domains in cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). We found that C99 was essentially excluded from ordered domains in vesicles from HeLa cells, undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, or SH-SY5Y-derived neurons; instead, ∼90% of C99 partitioned into disordered domains. The strong association of C99 with disordered domains occurred independently of its cholesterol-binding activity or homodimerization, or of the presence of the familial Alzheimer disease Arctic mutation (APP E693G). Finally, through biochemical studies we confirmed previous results, which showed that C99 is processed in the plasma membrane by α-secretase, in addition to the well-known γ-secretase. These findings suggest that C99 itself lacks an intrinsic affinity for raft domains, implying that either i) amyloidogenic processing of the protein occurs in disordered regions of the membrane, ii) processing involves a marginal subpopulation of C99 found in rafts, or iii) as-yet-unidentified protein-protein interactions with C99 in living cells drive this protein into membrane rafts to promote its cleavage therein."
https://openalex.org/W3154275660,"PR domain zinc finger protein 4 (PRDM4) is a transcription factor that plays key roles in stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis. However, its biological role and exact mechanism in cervical cancer remain unknown. Here, both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot assays demonstrated that the expression of PRDM4 in cervical cancer tissues was much lower than that in the normal cervix. A xenograft assay showed that PRDM4 overexpression in the cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and HeLa dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in vivo. Conversely, the silencing of PRDM4 promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, PRDM4 induced cell cycle arrest at the transition from G0/G1 phase to S phase by upregulating p27 and p21 expression and downregulating Cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inactivated in PRDM4-overexpressing cells, which decreased the levels of p-AKT and upregulated the expression of PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and qChIP assays confirmed that PRDM4 transactivated the expression of PTEN by binding to two specific regions in the PTEN promoter. Furthermore, PTEN silencing or a PTEN inhibitor rescued the cell defects induced by PRDM4 overexpression. Therefore, our data suggest that PRDM4 inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by downregulating the activity of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by directly transactivating PTEN expression in cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3146501139,"Natural antibodies, predominantly immunoglobulin M (IgM), play an important role in the defense against pathogens and in maintaining homeostasis against oxidized molecules known as oxidation-specific epitopes, such as those contained in oxidized low-density lipoproteins. However, owing to the complexity of the oxidized products, very few individual epitopes have been characterized in detail. In the present study, to identify endogenous sources of oxidation-specific epitopes, we stimulated mouse spleen and peritoneal cavity (PerC) cells in vitro with bovine serum albumin modified with a variety of lipid peroxidation-related carbonyl compounds and identified the acrolein-modified bovine serum albumin as the most efficient trigger studied for the production of IgM in PerC cells. The acrolein-specific epitopes accelerated the differentiation of B-1a cells, a fetal-derived B cell lineage, to plasma cells. In addition, acrolein-modified bovine serum albumin was specifically bound to B-1a cells, suggesting the presence of an acrolein-specific IgM-B cell receptor (BCR). A hybridoma, RE-G25, producing an acrolein-specific IgM, was established from the PerC cells and was indeed identified as a population of B cells expressing a specific IgM-BCR. In addition, we analyzed the BCR repertoire of acrolein-specific B cells and identified the most frequent IgM heavy chain gene segments of the B cells. These data established the presence of innate B cells expressing the acrolein-specific BCR and suggested that in addition to our understanding of acrolein as a toxic aldehyde, it may play a role as a trigger of the innate immune response."

However, the pathological significance of this process and its underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. Here we show that treatment of epithelial cells with pseudotyped HIV-1 viral particles or recombinant gp120 protein results in the activation of protein kinase G 1 (PKG1). Examination of epithelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that PKG1 activation mediates the epithelial barrier damage upon HIV-1 exposure. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that PKG1 interacts with stathmin and phosphorylates stathmin at serine 63 in the presence of gp120. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrate that PKG1-mediated phosphorylation of stathmin promotes its autophagic degradation by enhancing the interaction between stathmin and the autophagy adaptor protein p62. Collectively, these results suggest that HIV-1 exposure exploits the PKG1/stathmin axis to affect the microtubule cytoskeleton and thereby perturbs epithelial cell junctions.

Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which exposure to HIV-1 increases epithelial permeability, which has implications for the development of effective strategies to prevent mucosal HIV-1 transmission. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) affects millions of people worldwide. The major routes of HIV-1 transmission are percutaneous injury (blood or bodily fluid), cutaneous injury (skin wound), and contact with mucous membranes. In most cases (>90%), HIV-1 infection is initiated via different mucosal (e.g., genital, rectal, and occasionally oral) epithelial surfaces after sexual contact (1Hladik F. McElrath M.J.

The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds to its primary receptor cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and chemokine coreceptors, including C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), and undergoes entry-related conformational changes (6Shaik M.M.

CCR5 and CXCR4 are expressed in genital, intestinal, and oral mucosal membranes. The attachment of HIV-1 viral particles to the mucosal membrane depends on the interaction of gp120 with its chemokine coreceptors. The mucosal epithelium functions as a selectively permeable barrier through the formation of cell junctions, including tight and adherens junctions, which are multiprotein complexes that connect adjacent epithelial cells (7France M.M.

Ther. 2020; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the pathological relevance and molecular basis of these events are unknown. In this study, we report a previously undescribed mechanism by which exposure of mucosal epithelial cells to HIV-1 breaches the mucosal barrier to initiate the infection cycle. We show that HIV-1 exposure activates protein kinase G (PKG) 1 to phosphorylate stathmin at serine 63, thereby promoting its degradation via autophagy. This in turn triggers microtubule hyperstabilization and disassembly of the junctional complex, leading to the disruption of the mucosal barrier. To investigate the clinical significance and molecular basis of mucosal barrier disruption by HIV-1 gp120, we examined the integrity of cell junctions based on the localization of the tight junction marker, ZO-1, and the adherens junction marker, E-cadherin (18Garcia M.A. Nelson W.J.

Caco-2 human colon cancer cells were incubated with envelope (Env)-pseudotyped HIV-1 or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG)-pseudotyped control viruses. The junctional localization of ZO-1 and E-cadherin was decreased upon HIV-1 exposure (Fig. 1, A–D). AMD3100 is a CXCR4 antagonist that has been shown to specifically inhibit HIV-1 entry and membrane fusion by blocking interaction of the virus with CXCR4 (21De Clercq E. AMD3100/CXCR4 inhibitor.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). AMD3100 treatment abrogated the decrease in ZO-1 and E-cadherin junctional signals following HIV-1 exposure (Fig. 1, A–D). Microtubules play an important role in the delivery of junctional proteins to cell contact sites and the assembly of junctional complexes (15Vasileva E. Citi S.

We performed immunofluorescence labeling to detect acetylated α-tubulin, a marker of stabilized microtubules (23Eshun-Wilson L. Zhang R. Portran D. Nachury M.V. Toso D.B. Lohr T. Vendruscolo M. Bonomi M. Fraser J.S. Nogales E. Effects of alpha-tubulin acetylation on microtubule structure and stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 10366-10371Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and found that incubation with HIV-1 pseudoviruses caused microtubule hyperstabilization in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1, E and F). To examine the relationship between HIV-1 exposure and microtubule organization, we used AMD3100 to block HIV-1 interaction with CXCR4. Microtubule hyperstabilization was largely reversed by AMD3100 treatment (Fig. 1, E and F). Microtubule assembly from α/β-tubulin heterodimers is inhibited by microtubule-destabilizing proteins such as stathmin (24Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J.

Gullberg M. Oncoprotein 18 is a phosphorylation-responsive regulator of microtubule dynamics.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We observed that exposure to HIV-1 pseudoviruses decreased the level of stathmin in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1G), consistent with the finding that HIV-1 exposure hyperstabilizes microtubules. Thus, downregulation of stathmin leads to microtubule hyperstabilization, allowing HIV-1 to compromise epithelial cell junctions. To investigate the molecular link between HIV-1 exposure and stathmin degradation, we immunoprecipitated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged stathmin from transfected HEK293T cells and examined stathmin-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry. Two candidate proteins were identified, namely, PKG1 and AarF domain-containing kinase 3 (ADCK3) (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table S1). As phosphorylation is an important regulator of protein kinase activity, we examined the activity of PKG1 and ADCK3 following HIV-1 exposure. HIV-1 gp120 increased the serine/threonine phosphorylation of PKG1 (Fig. 2C), indicating its activation, whereas ADCK3 phosphorylation was unaffected (Fig. 2D). Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of PKG1 enhanced junctional ZO-1 and E-cadherin signals in the presence of HIV-1 gp120 (Fig. 2, E–H). On the other hand, ADCK3 knockdown did not abrogate the decrease in junctional ZO-1 and E-cadherin localization (Fig. 2, E–H). These results suggest that HIV-1 exposure results in the activation of PKG1, which might be related to stathmin degradation and microtubule reorganization. PKG1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by cyclic GMP and regulates diverse signal transduction pathways. We examined the molecular relevance of PKG1 in HIV-1-induced degradation of stathmin by immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation of PKG1-Flag and stathmin-GFP revealed an interaction between the two proteins in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The His pulldown assay confirmed their direct interaction in vitro (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, endogenous PKG1 coimmunoprecipitated with stathmin in intestinal, oral, and vaginal epithelial cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that PKG1 and stathmin interact in vivo. Stathmin undergoes extensive phosphorylation in response to various extracellular factors, and its tubulin-sequestering capacity is weakened by phosphorylation at one or more of its four conserved serine residues (serine 16, 25, 38, and 63) (27Manna T. Thrower D.A. Honnappa S. Steinmetz M.O. Wilson L. Regulation of microtubule dynamic instability in vitro by differentially phosphorylated stathmin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15640-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. Multiple phosphorylation of stathmin.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we investigated whether the interaction between PKG1 and stathmin leads to stathmin phosphorylation by coexpressing PKG1-Flag and stathmin-GFP in Ca9-22 cells. PKG1 overexpression increased stathmin serine/threonine phosphorylation (Fig. 3E), suggesting that stathmin is a substrate of PKG1; this was accompanied by a decrease in stathmin protein levels, implying that phosphorylation interferes with the stability of stathmin. Treatment of cells with HIV-1 gp120 activated PKG1 and further increased stathmin serine/threonine phosphorylation, while markedly reducing stathmin protein levels (Fig. 3E). Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis identified serine 38 and 63 as the residues in stathmin that were phosphorylated upon HIV-1 gp120 treatment (Fig. 3F, Fig. S1, A and B, and Table S2). Using phosphorylation-specific antibodies, we found that serine 63 phosphorylation was increased in Caco-2 cells exposed to HIV-1 pseudoviruses or treated with gp120, while serine 38 phosphorylation was not obviously affected (Fig. 3, G and H). Treatment of cells with Rp-8-pCPT-cyclic GMPS sodium (RPG), an inhibitor of PKG1 activity (29Butt E. Eigenthaler M. Genieser H.-G. (Rp)-8-pCPT-cGMPS, a novel cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor.Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 269: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), abrogated the increase in stathmin serine 63 phosphorylation (Fig. S2A). Moreover, siRNA-mediated PKG1 depletion could also block the increase in serine 63 phosphorylation and degradation of stathmin (Fig. 3I). As protein kinase A (PKA) could also phosphorylate stathmin at serine 63, we carried out PKA knockdown (Fig. 3J) or inhibition of its activity with H-89 (Fig. S2B) and found that PKA depletion could not abrogate the increase of serine 63 phosphorylation and degradation of stathmin. In addition, PKA depletion did not abrogate the decrease in junctional localization of ZO-1 and E-cadherin under HIV-1 gp120 treatment (Fig. S3, A–D). These results indicate that interaction with PKG1 promotes stathmin serine 63 phosphorylation and that this is enhanced upon HIV-1 exposure. The pathological link between stathmin phosphorylation by PKG1 and the disruption of cell junctions by HIV-1 is supported by our observation that PKG1 knockdown rescued the junctional damage caused by HIV-1 gp120 treatment (Fig. 2, E–H). Based on these data, we investigated whether inhibition of PKG1 activity would rescue this junctional breakdown. As expected, treatment with the PKG1 inhibitor RPG mitigated HIV-1 gp120-induced loss of junctional integrity, including that of tight junctions (Fig. 4, A and B) and adherens junctions (Fig. 4, C and D). We next assessed the integrity of cell junctions in the presence or absence of HIV-1 with stathmin overexpression/rescue experiments in Caco-2 cells. HIV-1-disrupted cell junctions could be rescued by overexpression of stathmin-GFP (Fig. 4, E–H). However, mutation of the stathmin serine 63 residue phosphorylated by PKG1 restored junctional integrity much better. Thus, HIV-1-induced epithelial junction damage is directly related to PKG1-mediated stathmin phosphorylation. The tubulin-binding capacity of stathmin is reduced and the microtubule-depolymerization function of stathmin is inhibited by its phosphorylation at serine 63 (27Manna T. Thrower D.A. Honnappa S. Steinmetz M.O. Wilson L. Regulation of microtubule dynamic instability in vitro by differentially phosphorylated stathmin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15640-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We tested whether the PKG1/stathmin signaling axis mediates stathmin-dependent changes in microtubule stability induced by HIV-1 exposure. In addition to restoring cell junctions, PKG1 knockdown abolished the microtubule-hyperstabilizing effects of HIV-1 gp120 (Fig. 5, A and B), confirming the essential role of PKG1 in HIV-1-induced microtubule hyperstabilization. Application of the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole to disrupt bundled microtubules reversed the damage to tight and adherens junctions caused by HIV-1 gp120 (Fig. 5, C–E), suggesting that the junctional disruption was caused by PKG1/stathmin-mediated microtubule hyperstabilization. To evaluate this possibility, stathmin was overexpressed in cells with or without HIV-1 exposure, and microtubule morphology was analyzed. Overexpression of stathmin-GFP abrogated HIV-1-induced microtubule hyperstabilization, and this effect was enhanced when the stathmin S63A (phosphodeficient) mutant was overexpressed (Fig. 5, F and G). Thus, PKG1-mediated stathmin phosphorylation underlies the microtubule hyperstabilization induced by HIV-1. Our previous work showed that stathmin was targeted for autophagic degradation by treatment with HIV-1 gp120 (17Xie W. Li D. Dong D. Li Y. Zhang Y. Duan L. Liu X. Meng W. Liu M. Zhou J. HIV-1 exposure triggers autophagic degradation of stathmin and hyperstabilization of microtubules to disrupt epithelial cell junctions.Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2020; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKG1 decreased stathmin protein levels (Fig. 3E), whereas PKG1 depletion had the opposite effect (Fig. 3I). We examined the relationship between stathmin phosphorylation and autophagic degradation in greater detail by comparing the half-lives of WT, S63A (phosphodeficient) mutant, and S63D (phosphomimetic) mutant stathmin-GFP proteins. The S63A and S63D mutants had longer and shorter half-lives, respectively, than WT stathmin (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating that stathmin phosphorylation at serine 63 decreases its stability. Autophagosomes can be visualized by detection of fluorescently labeled microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) puncta (30Yoshii S.R. Mizushima N. Monitoring and measuring autophagy.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017; 18: 1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 31Xie W. Zhou J. Aberrant regulation of autophagy in mammalian diseases.Biol. Lett. 2018; 14: 20170540Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We examined the intracellular distribution of WT, S63A, and S63D stathmin-GFP proteins. We found that more S63D stathmin was targeted to intracellular LC3 puncta compared with the WT protein following gp120 treatment (Fig. 6C). To investigate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the domain of stathmin that interacts with p62 using a set of stathmin deletion mutants fused to GFP (Fig. 6D). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p62 interacted with different domains of stathmin, but much less with the N-terminal truncation mutant (Fig. 6E). Moreover, less S63A and more S63D stathmin-GFP coprecipitated with Flag-p62 compared with the WT protein (Fig. 6F). These results indicate that PKG1-mediated phosphorylation of stathmin at serine 63 promotes stathmin degradation by autophagy. The binding of HIV-1 gp120 to its chemokine coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4 is known to trigger the activation of multiple signaling pathways related to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection (32Nazli A.

The results presented here reveal the molecular mechanism by which HIV-1 penetrates the epithelial barrier as well as the pathological significance of this novel regulatory pathway (Fig. 6G). HIV-1 exposure triggers PKG1 activation and stathmin phosphorylation, inhibition, and degradation, leading to the hyperstabilization of microtubules and disruption of epithelial cell junctions (Fig. 6G). The gp120 protein is the major focus of developing HIV-1 vaccines (36Beena V. Choudhary K. Rajeev R. Sivakumar R. Heera R. Padmakumar S. Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine an update.J. Oral Maxillofac. Pathol. 2013; 17: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Efforts to develop HIV-1 vaccines targeting gp120, however, have been hampered by the chemical and structural properties of gp120, which make it difficult for antibody binding. The present study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of HIV-1-induced mucosal barrier dysfunction, which may facilitate the development of vaccines targeting gp120.

For example, phosphorylation by the Epstein-Barr virus kinase BGLF4 at serine 16, 25, and 38 reduces the microtubule-destabilizing capacity of stathmin (40Chen P.W. Lin S.J. Tsai S.C. Lin J.H. Chen M.R. Wang J.T. Lee C.P. Tsai C.H. Regulation of microtubule dynamics through phosphorylation on stathmin by Epstein-Barr virus kinase BGLF4.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10053-10063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our results reveal that stathmin phosphorylation at serine 63 is markedly increased upon HIV-1 exposure. Serine 63 phosphorylation by PKA is known to inhibit stathmin activity and promote microtubule depolymerization (41Yip Y.Y. Yeap Y.Y. Bogoyevitch M.A. Ng D.C. cAMP-Dependent protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mediate stathmin phosphorylation for the maintenance of interphase microtubules during osmotic stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 2157-2169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have sought to identify the role of PKA in stathmin phosphorylation induced by HIV-1 gp120. Our data show that PKA depletion could not block the induction of stathmin phosphorylation, although PKA knockdown could indeed decrease the basal level of stathmin phosphorylation. In this study, we have identified PKG1 by LC-MS/MS analysis as a novel kinase of stathmin that specifically phosphorylates the serine 63 residue in the presence of HIV-1 pseudoviruses or recombinant gp120 protein. PKG1 acts as serine/threonine kinase that protects against heart disease, neuronal disease, and thoracic aortic disease. Serine 27, serine 45, serine 51, threonine 59, serine 65, serine 73, and threonine 85 residues of PKG1 have been reported to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro (42Pinkse M.W.H. Heck A.J.R.

Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that the phosphorylation of PKG1 is increased by gp120 treatment. We speculate that PKG1 may be activated through autophosphorylation upon gp120 treatment and then phosphorylate stathmin at serine 63. These findings indicate that the inhibition of stathmin activity by PKG1-mediated phosphorylation contributes to HIV-1-induced microtubule hyperstabilization. Binding of"

CAP has been isolated from different cells and tissues in an equimolar complex with actin, and previous studies have shown that a CAP–actin complex contains six molecules each of CAP and actin. Intriguingly, here, we successfully isolated a complex of Xenopus cyclase-associated protein 1 (XCAP1) with actin from oocyte extracts, which contained only four molecules each of XCAP1 and actin. This XCAP1–actin complex remained stable as a single population of 340 kDa species during hydrodynamic analyses using gel filtration or analytical ultracentrifugation. Examination of the XCAP1–actin complex by high-speed atomic force microscopy revealed a tripartite structure: one middle globular domain and two globular arms. The two arms were observed in high and low states. The arms at the high state were spontaneously converted to the low state by dissociation of actin from the complex. However, when extra G-actin was added, the arms at the low state were converted to the high state. Based on the known structures of the N-terminal helical-folded domain and C-terminal CARP domain, we hypothesize that the middle globular domain corresponds to a tetramer of the N-terminal helical-folded domain of XCAP1 and that each arm in the high state corresponds to a heterotetramer containing a dimer of the C-terminal CARP domain of XCAP1 and two G-actin molecules. This novel configuration of a CAP–actin complex should help to understand how CAP promotes actin filament disassembly.

Regulated assembly and disassembly of actin filaments are vital to the diverse function of the actin cytoskeleton (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Actin, a central player in cell shape and movement.Science. 2009; 326: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is one of the actin-regulatory proteins that control multiple key aspects of actin filament dynamics (2Ono S.

However, CAP was later recognized as an actin-binding protein in a variety of eukaryotes. CAP binds to actin monomers and inhibits polymerization (6Freeman N.L. Chen Z. Horenstein J. Weber A.

CAP also promotes exchange of actin-bound nucleotides in competition with cofilin and increases ATP-bound actin monomers that are readily available for polymerization (7Moriyama K. Yahara I.

Intriguingly, when nonrecombinant native CAP is isolated from tissues or cells, actin is associated with CAP in a multimeric complex at an equimolar ratio and cannot be dissociated without harsh conditions. Porcine CAP (originally reported as ASP-56) was isolated from platelets as a complex with actin, and actin was finally dissociated from CAP by 3 M urea (21Gieselmann R. Mann K.

In addition, recent studies have shown that the CAP–actin complex containing acetylated actin is an inhibitor of inverted formin 2 (INF2) (22Mu A. Fung T.S. Kettenbach A.N. Chakrabarti R. Higgs H.N.

Thus, the CAP and actin have biological functions as a complex, but how the complex is assembled and why the complex formation is important for its functions remain unknown. The native complex of yeast CAP (also known as Srv2) and actin is a 6:6 complex of ∼600 kDa (8Balcer H.I. Goodman A.L. Rodal A.A. Smith E. Kugler J. Heuser J.E. Goode B.L.

The N-terminal half of yeast and mouse CAPs form a hexameric “shuriken” structure, which is mediated by oligomerization of a putative coiled-coil region at the most N-terminus (10Chaudhry F.

Although we know structures of parts of the CAP–actin complex, we still have limited knowledge on the structure of the entire complex. Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated that the N-terminal regions of human CAP1 and CAP2 primarily form tetramers instead of hexamers (34Purde V. Busch F. Kudryashova E. Wysocki V.H. Kudryashov D.S. Oligomerization affects the ability of human cyclase-associated proteins 1 and 2 to promote actin severing by cofilins.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 5647Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether the 6:6 configuration is conserved among CAP–actin complexes from different sources remains unknown. In this study, we purified a complex of Xenopus CAP1 and actin and demonstrated that the complex contained the two proteins in a 4:4 stoichiometric ratio, which is a novel configuration of the CAP–actin complex. We purified a native complex of CAP and actin from Xenopus oocyte extracts (Fig. 1). When Xenopus oocyte extracts were applied to a column in which glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused Xenopus ADF/cofilin (XAC) was immobilized, several proteins specifically bound to the column as described previously (35Okada K. Obinata T. Abe H. XAIP1: A Xenopus homologue of yeast actin interacting protein 1 (AIP1), which induces disassembly of actin filaments cooperatively with ADF/cofilin family proteins.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We reported that the 65-kDa, 42-kDa, and 19-kDa proteins were Xenopus actin-interacting protein 1 (XAIP1), actin, and XAC, respectively (35Okada K. Obinata T. Abe H. XAIP1: A Xenopus homologue of yeast actin interacting protein 1 (AIP1), which induces disassembly of actin filaments cooperatively with ADF/cofilin family proteins.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing identified that the 94-kDa and 60-kDa proteins were gelsolin (36Ankenbauer T. Kleinschmidt J.A. Vandekerckhove J. Franke W.W. Proteins regulating actin assembly in oogenesis and early embryogenesis of Xenopus laevis: Gelsolin is the major cytoplasmic actin-binding protein.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and cyclase-associated protein 1 (XCAP1) (37KhosrowShahian F. Hubberstey A.V. Crawford M.J. CAP1 expression is developmentally regulated in Xenopus.Mech. Dev. 2002; 113: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), respectively. We attempted to isolate XCAP1 using anion-exchange chromatography followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography, but XCAP1 and actin were not separated during these procedures and were instead purified together in an equimolar ratio (Fig. 1B). Further gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-200 also resulted in coelution of XCAP1 and actin in a single peak at ∼390 kDa (our unpublished observation), which is much larger than XCAP1 or actin alone, or a 1:1 complex, indicating that they form a stable multimeric complex. Native molecular mass of the XCAP1–actin complex was determined more accurately by two different methods: size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and analytical ultracentrifugation. In SEC-MALS, the XCAP1–actin complex was resolved as a single peak with a molecular mass of 340 kDa (Fig. 1C). There were no detectable peaks that corresponded to dissociated XCAP1 or actin, indicating that the XCAP1–actin complex was stable during the SEC-MALS analysis. Likewise, in analytical ultracentrifugation, the XCAP1–actin complex was resolved as a single peak of 337 kDa (S = 10) (Fig. 1D), which agrees with the result of SEC-MALS. Considering the molecular masses of individual XCAP1 (52 kDa) and actin (42 kDa), the native molecular mass of the XCAP1–actin complex most closely matched with that of a 4:4 complex (calculated molecular mass of 376 kDa). The experimentally determined molecular mass was ∼10% smaller than the calculated molecular mass. This could be due to partial dissociation of the complex during the analyses, which is a known limitation in some cases of SEC-MALS experiments (38Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. Determination of molecular masses of proteins in solution: Implementation of an HPLC size exclusion chromatography and laser light scattering service in a core laboratory.J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). Since CAPs are known to bind to actin monomers, the XCAP1–actin complex most likely contains G-actin. Therefore, these results indicate that the native XCAP1 and G-actin form a stable complex at a 4:4 stoichiometric ratio. Structure of the XCAP1–actin complex in its native state was examined by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) (Figs. 2 and 3). Typical images on mica surfaces showed that the complex consisted of three globular domains (Fig. 2A), which we designated as the middle globular domain (MGD, shown in red in Fig. 2A cartoons) and two arms (Arm 1 and Arm 2, shown in green or blue in Fig. 2A cartoons). The height of MGD was 3.6 ± 0.9 nm (n = 107) (Fig. 2, B and C) and remained relatively stable during time-lapse imaging (Fig. 2, A and G, Supplementary Movie S1). By contrast, the two arms were observed in two different states: a high state (Arm-HS, shown in blue in Fig. 2A cartoons) and a low state (Arm-LS, shown in green in Fig. 2A cartoons, also see Fig. 3). The height of Arm-HS was 7.5 ± 0.5 nm (n = 855) (Fig. 2, D and E), while that of Arm-LS was 3.3 ± 0.3 nm (n = 1078) (Figs. 2F and 3, C and D). In some cases, the arms transitioned either from Arm-LS to Arm-HS (Fig. 2, A and G, blue line at ∼0.9 s) or from Arm-HS to Arm-LS (Fig. 2, A and G, green line at 4.5 s), suggesting that association or dissociation of a component, presumably G-actin, occurred during observations. Over the periods of HS-AFM observations, Arm-HS gradually decreased, while Arm-LS predominated, suggesting that Arm-HS was converted to Arm-LS by dissociation of actin over time likely due to repeated tapping by the AFM probe and adsorption of the complex on the surface (see below). Some of the complexes had Arm-LS throughout the observations (Fig. 2A, indicated by dashed line, Fig. 3A, Supplementary Movie S2), and the height of Arm-LS was 3.3 ± 0.3 nm (n = 1078) (Fig. 3, B–D).Figure 3The XCAP1–actin complex with both arms in a low state is stable.

Distribution of the distance between two arms (H) and between MGD and one of the arms (I) and single Gaussian fitting yielded average distances as indicated in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The two arms were very dynamic when they were in Arm-HS (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Movie S1), but restricted within 14.8 ± 4.9 nm (n = 214) of MGD (Fig. 2, H and I) as if the arms were connected to MGD by flexible linkers. The distance between the highest points of the two arms in Arm-HS fluctuated in a wide range with an average of 17.4 ± 7.6 nm (n = 427) (Fig. 2, H and J), further supporting the presence of flexible linkers between MGD and each arm. However, once arms were converted from Arm-HS to Arm-LS, they were stabilized in Arm-LS (Fig. 3, A–D, Supplementary Movie S2), while MGD remained unchanged (Fig. 3, B, E and F). The distance between two arms became wider [22.9 ± 5.7 nm (n = 539)], whereas that between each arm and MGD became narrower [13.0 ± 3.7 nm (n = 1078)]. These results suggest that Arm-LS was physically stabilized by adsorption to the mica surface. To test how surface adsorption affects the molecular features of the XCAP1–actin complex, we used a mica surface that was treated with APTES, which adds positive charges to the surface and causes nonspecific strong adsorption of proteins. On APTES-treated mica, the two arms were almost always detected in the low state (Arm-LS) with the height of 3.0 ± 0.4 nm (n = 2293) (Fig. 4, A–D, Supplementary Movie S3). The height and shape of MGD were indistinguishable between normal and APTES-treated mica surfaces (Fig. 4, A, B, E, and F). The distance between the two arms remained relatively constant at 25.4 ± 5.6 nm (n = 1331) (Fig. 4, G and H), which is much wider than that of two arms in Arm-HS on normal mica surfaces (Fig. 2I), suggesting that the two arms were strongly immobilized on the surface and spread apart. By contrast, the distance between MGD and an arm remained constant on the APTES-treated surface (Fig. 4, G and I) in a similar manner to MGD and Arm-LS on the normal surface (Fig. 3I). These observations suggest that strong adsorption of the XCAP1–actin complex onto a solid surface artificially converts Arm-HS to Arm-LS by causing dissociation of an arm-bound component, which we hypothesize to be G-actin. To test whether the height conversion of the arms is due to G-actin dissociation and association, we examined effects of additional free ADP-G-actin on the XCAP1–actin complex (Fig. 5). Freshly prepared samples of the XCAP1–actin complex contained mostly Arm-HS (Fig. 5A). However, after 15 min, most of them were converted to Arm-LS (Fig. 5B). After most of the arms were converted to Arm-LS (after ∼20 min), final 100 nM ADP-G-actin was added, and molecular features of the complex were observed over time (Fig. 5, C and D). In the presence of ADP-G-actin, frequent and reversible conversions of the arms between Arm-LS and Arm-HS were observed (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Movie S4). In the example shown in Figure 5C (dashed circle), initially both arms were Arm-LS (green arrowheads) at 0.6 s (Fig. 5C, top left panel), one arm was then converted to Arm-HS (blue arrowhead) at 0.8 s (Fig. 5C, top second panel), and another arm was converted to Arm-HS at 2.2 s (Fig. 5C, top fourth panel). Conversely, conversions from Arm-HS to Arm-LS were also observed (Fig. 5C, top right panel at 10.6 s and bottom second panel at 11.6 s). A plot of conversion events over time (Fig. 5D) indicates that the conversion between Arm-LS and Arm-HS was reversible and independently occurred at each arm without coordination between the two arms within a single complex. The rate of conversion events from Arm-LS to Arm-HS in the presence of ADP-G-actin was 0.14 ± 0.04 molecules−1 s−1 (Fig. 5E). Even in the absence of ADP-G-actin, conversion of Arm-LS to Arm-HS was occasionally observed at a rate of 0.03 ± 0.03 molecules−1 s−1 (Fig. 5E) most likely due to rebinding of dissociated G-actin to the complex, which is consistent with the spontaneous transition from Arm-LS to Arm-HS as demonstrated in Figure 1A. In the presence of ADP-G-actin alone or in the absence of the XCAP1–actin complex and ADP-G-actin, no objects that matched the size of Arm-LS or Arm-HS were observed (N.D.: none detected, Fig. 5E). These results strongly suggest that G-actin is a component of the two arm domains of the XCAP1–actin complex. Based on known biochemical and biophysical properties of CAP from other species, we propose a model for the structure of the XCAP1–actin complex, which is in the appearance of two “butterflies” (CARP/G-actin) and a “flower” (HFD) (Fig. 6). We hypothesize that MGD corresponds to a tetramer of the HFD of XCAP1 and that each arm domain in the high state (Arm-HS) corresponds to a heterotetramer containing a dimer of the CARP domain of XCAP1 and two G-actin molecules (Fig. 6). The HFD of CAP by itself forms a dimer (12Kotila T. Wioland H. Enkavi G. Kogan K. Vattulainen I. Jegou A. Romet-Lemonne G. Lappalainen P.

https://openalex.org/W3117472937,"ADP-dependent kinases were first described in archaea, although their presence has also been reported in bacteria and eukaryotes (human and mouse). This enzyme family comprises three substrate specificities; specific phosphofructokinases (ADP-PFKs), specific glucokinases (ADP-GKs), and bifunctional enzymes (ADP-PFK/GK). Although many structures are available for members of this family, none exhibits fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) at the active site. Using an ancestral enzyme, we obtain the first structure of an ADP-dependent kinase (AncMsPFK) with F6P at its active site. Key residues for sugar binding and catalysis were identified by alanine scanning, D36 being a critical residue for F6P binding and catalysis. However, this residue hinders glucose binding because its mutation to alanine converts the AncMsPFK enzyme into a specific ADP-GK. Residue K179 is critical for F6P binding, while residues N181 and R212 are also important for this sugar binding, but to a lesser extent. This structure also provides evidence for the requirement of both substrates (sugar and nucleotide) to accomplish the conformational change leading to a closed conformation. This suggests that AncMsPFK mainly populates two states (open and closed) during the catalytic cycle, as reported for specific ADP-PFK. This situation differs from that described for specific ADP-GK enzymes, where each substrate independently causes a sequential domain closure, resulting in three conformational states (open, semiclosed, and closed).

This situation differs from that described for specific ADP-GK enzymes, where each substrate independently causes a sequential domain closure, resulting in three conformational states (open, semiclosed, and closed). Glycolysis is one of the most important cellular processes to obtain ATP in all living organisms, being universally conserved. Nonetheless, in some archaea from the phylum Euryarchaeota, a modified version of this pathway has been described, where glucose and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) are phosphorylated by homologous enzymes that use ADP instead of ATP as phosphoryl donor (1Guixé V. Merino F. The ADP-dependent sugar kinase family: kinetic and evolutionary aspects.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These ADP-dependent sugar kinases can be specific for glucose (ADP-glucokinase [ADP-GK]), fructose-6P (ADP-phosphofructokinase [ADP-PFK]), or bifunctional able to use both substrates (ADP-PFK/GK). Sequence analysis, phylogenetic closeness, and the presence of conserved motifs associate to bifunctionality, leading to propose that the ADP-PFK from the order Methanosarcinales would be bifunctional enzymes. However, the kinetic characterization of two enzymes from this order shows that these enzymes have a marked preference for F6P, unlike the enzymes from Methanococcales (2Zamora R.A.

Recently, the structure of a bifunctional ADP-PFK/GK from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjPFK/GK, PDB code: 5OD2) was also reported. This was the first structure of an ADP-PFK/GK enzyme belonging to the order Methanococcales (10Tokarz P. Wiśniewska M. Kamiński M.M. Dubin G. Grudnik P.

Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structures of ADP-dependent GKs in the apo form and in complex with ligands from different species indicates that both substrates (ADP and glucose) induce a conformational change, which has been suggested to be critical to the enzyme function. Moreover, a comparison of ADP-GK from T. litoralis bound to different ligands reveals three conformational states with sequential changes induced by both ligands that correlate with its kinetic mechanism. This ligand-induced conformational change brings the two domains closer through a hinge formed by flexible loops located between the large and small domains (1Guixé V. Merino F. The ADP-dependent sugar kinase family: kinetic and evolutionary aspects.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the structure of the ADP-PFK from P. horikoshii in its apo form was superimposed with that obtained in complex with AMP, no such conformational change was observed. Moreover, because most of the structures of this family correspond to GK enzymes, plenty of information is available about residues involved in glucose binding and in catalysis. Unfortunately, despite the efforts performed by several groups, no crystal structure of an ADP-dependent kinase with F6P at its active site is available to date. These efforts include the specific ADP-PFK from P. horikoshii (PhPFK), where cocrystallization and soaking trials in the presence of F6P, fructose-1,6-bisP, along with ADP or nonhydrolyzable analogs of nucleotide were performed (9Currie M.A. Merino F. Skarina T. Wong A.H.Y. Singer A. Brown G. Savchenko A. Caniuguir A. Guixé V. Yakunin A.F. Jia Z. ADP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3. Structure determination and biochemical characterization of PH1645.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22664-22671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Also, trials with enzymes such as ADP-PFK/GK from Methanococcoides burtonii (MbPFK/GK) (2Zamora R.A. Gonzalez-Órdenes F. Castro-Fernández V. Guixé V. ADP-dependent phosphofructokinases from the archaeal order Methanosarcinales display redundant glucokinase activity.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2017; 633: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), Methanosarcina mazei (MmazPFK/GK), and Methanohalobium evestigatum (MevePFK/GK) were unsuccessful (12González-Ordenes F. Cea P.A. Fuentes-Ugarte N. Muñoz S.M. Zamora R.A. Leonardo D. Garratt R.C. Castro-Fernandez V. Guixé V. ADP-dependent kinases from the archaeal order Methanosarcinales adapt to salt by a non-canonical evolutionarily conserved strategy.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The absence of such a structure has precluded studies that identify key residues for F6P binding and catalysis. To address this issue, we focus our efforts on obtaining a crystal structure of an ADP-PFK complexed with F6P. We choose the last common ancestor of the order Methanosarcinales because the protein can be obtained soluble with a high yield and its structure complexed with Mg-ADP (PDB code: 6C8Z) has been recently reported (12González-Ordenes F. Cea P.A. Fuentes-Ugarte N. Muñoz S.M. Zamora R.A. Leonardo D. Garratt R.C. Castro-Fernandez V. Guixé V. ADP-dependent kinases from the archaeal order Methanosarcinales adapt to salt by a non-canonical evolutionarily conserved strategy.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis shows the presence of the conserved motif associates with bifunctionality, and kinetic characterization demonstrated that this ancestral enzyme could employ F6P or glucose as substrates, being a valuable model to address key residues responsible for sugar binding. Nonetheless, the kinetic parameters for both substrates suggest that glucose phosphorylation can be considered a promiscuous activity. Moreover, because the AncMsPFK structure in the presence of Mg-ADP is available, we can evaluate the impact of ligand binding on the conformational changes relevant to catalysis. Here, we report the crystallographic structure of an ancestral ADP-PFK in ternary complex with F6P and Mg-ADPβS, being the first structure of an enzyme from the ADP-dependent family with F6P at its active site. This structure represents a closed conformation compared with the ADP-PFK structures reported to date. Structures of other ancestral proteins from this enzyme family, such as the AncMT-PFK/GK and AncMsPFK (PDB codes: 5K27 and 6C8Z) are reported, but only in the presence of nucleotide (AMP and Mg-ADP, respectively) (11Castro-Fernandez V.

The structure of the AncMsPFK in complex with F6P-Mg-ADPβS was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 3.12 Å resolution to Rwork/Rfree values of 0.24/0.27. Statistics for data collection and refinement are shown in Table 1. The AncMsPFK crystal contained one molecule per asymmetric unit with 460 of the expected 490 residues, and the unit cell corresponds to P 212121. In the final model, 97.8% of the residues were in favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and none were in the disallowed region.Table 1Crystallographic data and refinement statistics for AncMsPFK-F6PData collection X-ray sourceLNLS MX2 DetectorPILATUS 2M Wavelength (Å)1.459 Resolution range (Å)46.54–3.12 Space groupP 21 21 21 Unitary cell (Å, °)a = 67.57 b = 79.59 c = 108.57α = β = γ = 90 Total reflections/unique reflections135,177/10,902 Multiplicity12.4 (12.1) Completeness98.33 (99.53) Mean I/σ (I)16.5 (3.02) R-merge0.1507 (0.841) R-pim0.04486 (0.2532) CC1/20.996 (0.9)Refinement R-work/R-free0.2436/0.2772Number of atoms Protein3,540 Ligands44 Waters5B-factors Protein85.90 Ligands77.48 Waters66.90RMS deviations Body lengths (Å)0.005 Bond angles (°)1.06Ramachandran plot Favored (%)97.81 Outside (%)0.00 Rotamer outliers (%)0.54PDB code6XIOPDB, Protein Data Bank.Statistics for the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses.

The structure of AncMsPFK displays the classic fold described previously for ADP-dependent kinases, a large domain containing an α/β/α Rossmann-like fold with eleven stranded β-sheets surrounded by 14 α-helices, and a small domain formed by seven stranded β-sheets and four α-helices (3Ito S. Fushinobu S. Yoshioka I. Koga S. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Structural basis for the ADP-specificity of a novel glucokinase from a hyperthermophilic archaeon.Structure. 2001; 9: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, 28 residues from the small domain cannot be solved in this structure; 24 of them belong to helices α2 and α3 and 4 from a β-turn located between β-sheets β9 and β10 (Fig. 1A). The lack of electronic density in these areas of the small domain in the closed conformation of AncMsPFK could result from the intrinsic flexibility of these regions. Also, for the small domain, a high average B-factor of 121 Å2 was refined compared with the 77.5 Å2 of the large domain (Fig. S1). In the same way, the average B-factor of the small domain in the closed structure of AncMsPFK is higher than values obtained for other ADP-PFK open conformations structures, such as Mg-ADP bound AncMsPFK or AMP-bound PhPFK. This value is even higher than the one reported for other closed conformation structures, such as the MjPFK/GK (Table S1). The active site is located in a cleft between both domains (Fig. 1B), connected by a region of flexible loops that act as a hinge during the ligand-induced conformational change. The electronic density at the active site of the AncMsPFK structure allows us to assign both substrates, F6P and the Mg-ADPβS complex, being the first structure of an ADP-dependent kinase with F6P at its active site (Fig. 2A). Analysis of residues involved in sugar binding shows that F6P is mainly stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 2B). The ribose ring interacts with D36, G115, Q116, and D471 residues. The strictly conserved D471 residue belongs to the GXGD motif and corresponds to the catalytic base that activates the hydroxyl group of the sugar to be phosphorylated, for the nucleophilic attack toward the ADP (1Guixé V. Merino F. The ADP-dependent sugar kinase family: kinetic and evolutionary aspects.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The phosphate group makes contacts with N32, N34, E90, N181, K179, and Q244. Analysis of residues around F6P within a 5 Å radius identified M113, G114, I119, I183, I208, S210, S211, R212, M245, V467, and G468 (Fig. S2). In the theoretical docking model of ADP-PFK from P. horikoshii bounded with AMP, the R212 residue establish a direct interaction with the phosphate group of F6P (9Currie M.A. Merino F. Skarina T. Wong A.H.Y. Singer A. Brown G. Savchenko A. Caniuguir A. Guixé V. Yakunin A.F. Jia Z. ADP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3. Structure determination and biochemical characterization of PH1645.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22664-22671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which is not observed in the AncMsPFK structure (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the Mg-ADPβS complex is located in a shallow pocket in the large domain establishing hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with protein residues. The adenine moiety is surrounded by the side chains of residues L362, A395, V459, P469, and I469 and makes two hydrogen bonds with the main chain of V460. The ribose ring established these interactions with the H360 and S361 residues, whereas the β-phosphate interacts with R206 (Fig. 2C). Atoms of the lateral chain of residue R206 showed a high B-factor and a poor electronic density. However, this residue is highly conserved in the ADP-dependent family and has been pointed out to interact with the phosphoryl group of ADP, stabilizing the transfer reaction intermediary. These interactions are conserved among ADP-dependent sugar kinases and are also present in the AncMsPFK structure in the presence of Mg-ADP (PDB code: 6C8Z) (12González-Ordenes F. Cea P.A. Fuentes-Ugarte N. Muñoz S.M. Zamora R.A. Leonardo D. Garratt R.C. Castro-Fernandez V. Guixé V. ADP-dependent kinases from the archaeal order Methanosarcinales adapt to salt by a non-canonical evolutionarily conserved strategy.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively low resolution of the structure, four water molecules around the Mg2+ ion were located, assuming its classical octahedral coordination geometry, which is in agreement with the electronic density of that region. Thus, the lateral chain of residues E282, T284, D310, E313, and D471 and the main chain of F283 interact indirectly with the Mg2+ ion through water molecules. Residue E282 belongs to the conserved HXE motif, whereas residues E313 and D310 belong to the DXXE motif, both of which are critical for Mg-ADP binding and ternary complex formation in the ADP-dependent sugar kinases family (13Abarca-Lagunas M.J. Rivas-Pardo J.A. Ramírez-Sarmiento C.A. Guixé V. Dissecting the functional roles of the conserved NXXE and HXE motifs of the ADP-dependent glucokinase from Thermococcus litoralis.FEBS Lett. 2015; 589: 3271-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the key residues responsible for sugar binding, we search for a structure similar to AncMsPFK with glucose at its active site. Using the web Dali server (14Holm L. Benchmarking fold detection by DaliLite v.5.Bioinformatics. 2019; 35: 5326-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we found that the bifunctional ADP-PFK/GK from M. jannaschii (MjPFK/GK, PDB code: 5OD2) was the most similar structure, with a 46% of identity, an RMSD for Cα of 1.9 Å over 425 residues, and a Z factor of 48. This structure was obtained in complex with glucose, the 5-iodotubercidine inhibitor, inorganic phosphate, and a Mg2+ ion at the active site. A structural alignment of both structures reveals that most of the residues that interact with glucose (D36, E90, G114, G115, Q116, N181, Q244, and D471) are present in the same position in the AncMsPFK structure except residues E90, Q116, and Q244. These residues appear to be located far away from the sugar in the ancestral enzyme, probably because of the presence of the phosphate group of F6P (Fig. 2D). Also, residue R206 of AncMsPFK is present in a different position compared with the glucose bound structure. This can be attributed to the inorganic phosphate emulating the β-phosphate of the ADP, which interacts with this arginine residue. Structural alignment of the ancestral enzyme with the specific GK from T. litoralis bound to glucose and AMP (TlGK, PDB code: 4B8S) shows that N181 of AncMsPFK is the only residue not conserved among those interacting with glucose (Fig. S3). In TlGK, this residue is replaced by histidine in agreement with the substrate-specificity motifs described for this family (2Zamora R.A. Gonzalez-Órdenes F. Castro-Fernández V. Guixé V. ADP-dependent phosphofructokinases from the archaeal order Methanosarcinales display redundant glucokinase activity.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2017; 633: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of active-site residues, we mutated residues N32, D36, E90, K179, N181, R206, and R212 by alanine. The mutants were kinetically characterized to assess their role in F6P, as well as in glucose binding and catalysis. Among the residues selected, N32, D36, and R206 are highly conserved in the whole family of ADP-dependent kinases, whereas residues K179, N181, and R212 are only conserved in specific ADP-PFK and bifunctional enzymes. On the other hand, the E90 residue is only conserved in specific ADP-GKs and bifunctional enzymes (Fig. 3). Table 2 shows the kinetic parameters for both sugar substrates, glucose, and F6P for the WT enzyme and the selected mutants. For the PFK activity, D36A and K179A mutants display the most significant KM increase for F6P, around 1,000-fold compared with the WT enzyme, whereas for the N181A and R212A mutants, this increase is approximately 200-fold. Regarding the catalytic constant (kcat), the most significant change was observed in the D36A mutant, where this value decreases 400-fold compared with the WT enzyme. Owing to the decrease in the catalytic constant and the high glucose concentrations needed to determine the kinetic parameters for the GK activity, a high error in the estimation of the KM values of some mutants is observed. The highest increase in the KM for glucose was observed in the N181A mutant (around 6-fold), whereas for the N32A and E90A mutants, this value increases 4- and 2-fold, respectively. The most significant diminution in the kcat (180-fold) is obtained when the E90 residue was mutated to alanine. Unexpectedly, the D36A mutant displays the most remarkable diminution in the KM for glucose (approximately 200-fold) and only a slight decrease in the kcat, which provokes an increment in the catalytic efficiency of about two orders of magnitude. Although this residue interacts with the C3 and C4 hydroxyl groups of glucose, this result suggests that the aspartic residue would hinder glucose binding. On the other hand, the most dramatic effect was observed in the R206A mutant, where no PFK or GK activity was detected in the assay conditions used for the other mutants. Efforts to detect PFK activity using discontinuous assays and reaction time of 18 h allow us to estimate a PFK activity of about 2 × 10−6 U/mg. This value represents a diminution of 600 thousand–fold respect to the WT enzyme, which precludes the estimation of the kinetic parameters for this mutant.Table 2Kinetic parameters for WT and AncMsPFK mutantsEnzymeF6PGlucoseKM mMkcat s−1Ki mMkcat/kM M−1s−1KM mMkcat s−1Ki mMkcat/kM M−1s−1WT0.014 ± 1.5 × 10−31.2 ± 0.038 × 105131 ± 190.09 ± 5 × 10−30.69N32A0.18 ± 0.040.03 ± 2 × 10−358 ± 15165545 ± 1840.006 ± 1 × 10−30.011D36AaThe GK activity of the D36A mutant was calculated from three independent measurements.14 ± 10.003 ± 1 × 10−40.20.65 ± 0.080.045 ± 2 × 10−363 ± 969E90AbFor the E90A mutant, both activities were calculated from three independent measurements.0.09 ± 9.6 × 10−30.015 ± 4 × 10−465 ± 13163307 ± 695 × 10−4 ± 5 × 10−51.6 × 10−3K179A13 ± 20.04 ± 1.5 × 10−33113 ± 170.04 ± 2 × 10−30.35N181A2.8 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.0277 ± 12139744 ± 890.02 ± 2 × 10−30.03R212A2.9 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.04645201 ± 320.14 ± 0.010.70F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; GK, glucokinases.The standard error was calculated from two independent measurements.a The GK activity of the D36A mutant was calculated from three independent measurements.b For the E90A mutant, both activities were calculated from three independent measurements.

Analysis of residues involved in the stabilization of the close conformation of AncMsPFK reveals several interactions between the large and the small domains, governed by hydrogen bonds. These polar interactions include residues located close to F6P (R212-Q244 and E90-T284), and others such as arginine residues, far away from this sugar (R67-Q287 and R112-G397). Moreover, residue R78 is within an appropriate distance to interact with Q287 (Fig. 4). These interactions are present only in the ternary complex structure, being absent in the ADP-bound structure, supporting its stabilizing role in the closed state of the protein. Further analyses of ligand-induced conformational changes were performed after modeling the missing secondary structure elements of the AncMsPFK small domain, using the small domain of the AncMsPFK structure bound to Mg-ADP as a template (PDB code: 6C8Z). A comparison of the open conformation of AncMsPFK (Mg-ADP) and the complete model in the closed conformation (F6P-Mg-ADPβS) shows an RMSD of 5.4 Å for the Cα positions. Analysis of the theoretical radius of gyration (Rgt) using the web CRYSOL server (15Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. CRYSOL - a program to evaluate X-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Cryst. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2569) Google Scholar) indicates that the model in the presence of F6P-Mg-ADPβS has a domain closure of 1.9 Å when compared with the structure in the presence of Mg-ADP. This difference is even more dramatic if the distance between the large and small domain center of mass was compared; in the closed conformation, both domains are 7.5 Å closer than in the structure with Mg-ADP at the active site (Fig. 5A). A more detailed inspection of the conformational change using the DynDom web server (16Girdlestone C. Hayward S. The DynDom3D webserver for the analysis of domain movements in multimeric proteins.J. Comput. Biol. 2016; 23: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) shows a small-domain movement of 48° as a consequence of F6P binding (Fig. 5B). In this movement, 22 residues act as a hinge (Table S2), where residues N32, N34, D36, K179, N181, and R212, responsible for sugar substrate binding, can be found (Fig. 5C). Half of them are located in β-sheets regions (N34, D36, and N181) and the other ones in loops (N32, K179, and R212) (Fig. S4). Ancestral sequence reconstruction has been traditionally used to obtain information regarding the evolutionary history of a protein family (17Castro-Fernandez V. Herrera-Morande A. Zamora R.

However, recently, it has also been proposed as a powerful tool for protein engineering, drug discovery, and for other applications, such as the development of biocatalysts (18Gumulya Y. Gillam E.M.

In contrast, members of the remaining subfamilies are found only in prokaryotes, primarily in the bacteria (1Niehaus T.D. Gerdes S. Hodge-Hanson K. Zhukov A. Cooper A.J. ElBadawi-Sidhu M. Fiehn O.

Many prokaryotes encode multiple Rid proteins, often from different subfamilies. Despite the prevalence of these proteins, the vast majority of the Rid proteins have not been functionally characterized. The exception is the RidA subfamily. All RidA subfamily members tested have enamine deaminase activity (3Irons J. Hodge-Hanson K.M. Downs D.M. PA5339, a RidA homolog, is required for full growth in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J.

In Salmonella enterica, and the few other bacteria tested, hydrolysis of the reactive imine intermediate 2-aminoacrylate (2-AA) by RidA prevents metabolic damage that can occur when 2-AA accumulates in vivo. These studies convincingly support the hypothesis that 2-AA is the physiologically relevant substrate of RidA. Some members of the Rid1–3 subfamilies have imine–enamine deaminase activity when assayed with general amino acid oxidases, though the physiological relevance of these activities has not been determined (1Niehaus T.D.

Escherichia coli RutC is the founding member of the ninth Rid subfamily and encoded in the pyrimidine utilization (rut) operon. The rutABCDEFG operon encodes enzymes required for the use of uracil (or uridine) as a nitrogen source and is divergently transcribed from a gene encoding helix–turn–helix protein (RutR) that is assumed to be an associated regulator (9Kim K.S.

RutB hydrolyzes ureidoacrylate to result in the formation of carbamate and 3-aminoacrylate (3-AA), both of which were proposed to be spontaneously hydrolyzed to produce ammonia (9Kim K.S. Pelton J.G. Inwood W.B. Andersen U. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. The rut pathway for pyrimidine degradation: Novel chemistry and toxicity problems.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4089-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The deaminated 3-AA (malonate semialdehyde) is then reduced by RutE (or YdfG) to form 3-hydroxy propionate. This final product of the pathway accumulates in the medium and is thought to be excreted as waste by the cell (9Kim K.S. Pelton J.G. Inwood W.B. Andersen U. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E.

The presence of genes in the rut operon whose products have no assigned role raised the possibility that these steps might be catalyzed enzymatically in vivo by RutC or RutD, two enzymes that have not been biochemically characterized. In the first case, 3-AA undergoes a deaminating hydrolysis reaction, which is similar to the reaction attributed to RidA with 2-AA. RutC is a protein that has the arginine residue (Arg104) predictive of enamine deaminase activity of Rid family members (1Niehaus T.D. Gerdes S. Hodge-Hanson K. Zhukov A. Cooper A.J. ElBadawi-Sidhu M. Fiehn O. Downs D.M. Hanson A.D. Genomic and experimental evidence for multiple metabolic functions in the RidA/YjgF/YER057c/UK114 (Rid) protein family.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16: 382Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Hodge-Hanson K.M.

Members of the Rid protein family have broad imine deaminase activity and can accelerate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa D-arginine dehydrogenase (DauA) reaction in vitro.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0185544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This study was initiated to test the hypothesis that RutC was a 3-AA deaminase that catalyzed the deamination of 3-AA to malonate semialdehyde (9Kim K.S. Pelton J.G. Inwood W.B. Andersen U. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. The rut pathway for pyrimidine degradation: Novel chemistry and toxicity problems.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4089-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Data herein show that RutC significantly increases the rate of 3-AA deamination over that achieved with solvent water. The further demonstration that rutC was not necessary for utilization of uridine in vivo was consistent with the spontaneous occurrence of the relevant reaction. The hypothesized 3-AA deaminase activity of RutC was assessed using the coupled assay described in the Experimental procedures section. In this setup, RutB generated 3-AA in situ from chemically synthesized ureidoacrylate. In situ formation of 3-AA enabled the measurement of 3-AA deamination by RutC to yield malonate semialdehyde. Measurements of the NADPH-dependent rate of malonate semialdehyde reduction to 3-hydroxypropionate as a function of ureidoacrylate by EcYdfG (malonate semialdehyde reductase; Enzyme Commission no.: 1.1.1.298) allowed us to determine apparent RutC kinetic parameters. The range of ureidoacrylate concentration that yielded a linear relationship to NADPH oxidation rate was between 1 and 4 mM (Fig. S1); we used 0.8 mM NADPH throughout our experiments. We determined in detail the rates of NADPH oxidation within the aforementioned range of ureidoacrylate to more reliably determine RutC kinetic parameters (Fig. 2; Table 1). Deamination of 3-AA by RutC contributed to an increased rate of NADPH consumption. Under optimal reaction conditions, and in the absence of RutC, ureidoacrylate was converted to malonate semialdehyde with an apparent Vmax of 9 nmoles/min, reflecting the rate at which spontaneous deamination of 3-AA occurred. In the presence of RutC, the apparent Vmax increased to 32 nmoles/min. Based on the assumption that RutB is turning over efficiently, apparent Km and kcat values were calculated for RutC (Table 1). No oxidation of NADPH was detected in the absence of either RutB or YdfG. Rid proteins lacking a key conserved arginine (residue 105 as per S. enterica numbering) have no detectable enamine deaminase activity (7Lambrecht J.A. Flynn J.M. Downs D.M.

Consistently, a RutCR104A variant failed to increase in the rate of NADPH oxidation over that allowed by solvent water, indicating the RutCR104A variant had no 3-AA deaminase activity (Fig. 2; Table 1).Table 1Kinetics of spontaneous and RutC-catalyzed deamination of 3-AAParameterNoneRutCRutCR104AVmax9.0 ± 1.031.9 ± 3.99.0 ± 0.9Km (mM)7.1 ± 1.69.1 ± 1.97.3 ± 1.4kcatN/A5215N/A, not applicable.Assays included RutB (5 μM), YdfG (1 μM), and the indicated RutC protein (3 μM when present) in Tris–HCl (40 mM, pH 8.2).

Standard error is reported. 3-AA differs from the physiologically relevant substrate of RidA, namely 2-AA, by the position of the amino group. The overall similarity of the molecules suggested there could be functional overlap between members of the RidA subfamily and RutC. RidA did not deaminate 3-AA, emphasizing the unique activity of RutC (data not shown). In contrast, RutC efficiently deaminated 2-AA generated in situ by the cysteine desulfhydrase (CdsH) enzyme acting on cysteine (Fig. 3). Numerous Rid proteins outside the RidA subfamily have activity with 2-AA in vitro under standard conditions (8Hodge-Hanson K.M. Downs D.M. Members of the Rid protein family have broad imine deaminase activity and can accelerate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa D-arginine dehydrogenase (DauA) reaction in vitro.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0185544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Members of the RidA subfamily restore growth to a S. enterica ridA mutant with the weak expression allowed by the uninduced pBAD promoter. In contrast, when rutC is provided in trans, growth of the ridA mutant was restored only when expression was induced. Furthermore, while the culture reached a final density equal to that of a wildtype strain, it had a significantly extended lag time. These results suggested that RutC could deaminate 2-AA in vivo, albeit less efficiently than RidA. Finally, expression of the allele encoding a RutCR104A variant failed to restore growth of the ridA mutant with or without induction (Fig. 4). Thus, RutC joined the group of Rid proteins proficient at 2-AA deamination in vitro but only poorly able to suppress phenotypes of a S. enterica ridA mutant in vivo (8Hodge-Hanson K.M. Downs D.M. Members of the Rid protein family have broad imine deaminase activity and can accelerate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa D-arginine dehydrogenase (DauA) reaction in vitro.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0185544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This result emphasizes that the in vitro analysis of 2-AA deaminase activity as currently done cannot be used as a definitive measure of physiological relevance.Figure 4Escherichia coli rutC complements a Salmonella enterica ridA mutant.

Mol. Sci. 2018; 19945Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). LOX enzymes oxidize amino acids to their corresponding iminoamino acids, which can be deaminated by solution water to generate the respective ketoacid (14Hafner E.W. Wellner D. Reactivity of the imino acids formed in the amino acid oxidase reaction.Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An imine will react with semicarbazide present in the reaction mix to form a semicarbazone that absorbs at 248 nm. It follows that if the rate of semicarbazone formation decreases in the presence of a Rid protein, the respective imine is a substrate of that protein. Six amino acids that were efficient substrates of LOX (8Hodge-Hanson K.M. Downs D.M. Members of the Rid protein family have broad imine deaminase activity and can accelerate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa D-arginine dehydrogenase (DauA) reaction in vitro.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0185544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were used to probe RutC substrate specificity. Using these amino acids as substrates, the rate of semicarbazone formation was determined when RutC, RidA, or no Rid protein was provided in the reaction (Fig. 5). RidA showed activity primarily on the imino derivatives of methionine and leucine. These results were consistent with those previously reported (8Hodge-Hanson K.M. Downs D.M. Members of the Rid protein family have broad imine deaminase activity and can accelerate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa D-arginine dehydrogenase (DauA) reaction in vitro.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0185544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, RutC had a broader substrate specificity with significant activity on each of the six iminoamino acids (Fig. 5). The most significant difference between the RidA and RutC proteins was noted when histidine, arginine, or phenylalanine was substrates for LOX. While none of these iminoamino acids have defined roles in the metabolism of E. coli or S. enterica, the results suggested differences in the active site configuration of the two proteins from different subfamilies of the Rid superfamily. The 3-AA deaminase reaction attributed to RutC can occur in the absence of enzyme with solvent water, raising the question whether this enzyme would be required for the Rut pathway in vivo. The ΔrutC strain NCM4105 carrying an empty cloning vector did not grow at room temperature (23 °C) with uridine (5 mM) as sole nitrogen, as reported (9Kim K.S. Pelton J.G. Inwood W.B. Andersen U. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. The rut pathway for pyrimidine degradation: Novel chemistry and toxicity problems.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4089-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Unexpectedly, expression of rutC in trans did not restore growth of this strain, suggesting that the lesion in rutC was polar on downstream gene(s) required for rut pathway function. Consistent with this scenario, a plasmid carrying the complete rutCDEFG operon restored growth of ΔrutC strain with uridine as sole nitrogen source. Importantly, when the rutC gene within the operon was mutated to encode the inactive RutCR104A variant, the resulting plasmid also restored growth of the ΔrutC strain on uridine. These results demonstrated that rutC was not essential for Rut pathway function under the laboratory conditions used. The role of RutD in the catabolic pathway was unclear from past work, and a plausible model is that this enzyme could facilitate the hydrolysis of carbamate (Fig. 1). A ΔrutD strain NCM4861 carrying an empty vector was unable to use uridine, as previously reported (9Kim K.S. Pelton J.G. Inwood W.B. Andersen U. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. The rut pathway for pyrimidine degradation: Novel chemistry and toxicity problems.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4089-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing the complete rutCDEFG operon allowed growth of the ΔrutD mutant. Surprisingly, a plasmid that encoded an inactive variant of RutC (RutCR104A) and a truncated variant of RutD restored growth (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrated that the ΔrutD strain could not catabolize uridine because of polarity of the lesion on one or more of the downstream rut genes. Thus, the results were consistent with a model in which RutD (in addition to RutC) facilitates a reaction than can occur spontaneously. RutC is the founding member of a ninth Rid subfamily and located within the rutABCDEFG operon in E. coli, which encodes enzymes required for the use of uracil (or uridine) as a nitrogen source (9Kim K.S. Pelton J.G. Inwood W.B. Andersen U. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. The rut pathway for pyrimidine degradation: Novel chemistry and toxicity problems.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4089-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Loh K.D. Gyaneshwar P. Markenscoff Papadimitriou E. Fong R. Kim K.S. Parales R. Zhou Z. Inwood W. Kustu S. A previously undescribed pathway for pyrimidine catabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5114-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Data herein demonstrated that RutC catalyzes the deamination of 3-AA, a proposed intermediate in the Rut pathway. The assignment of an enzymatic function to RutC is an important correction to the literature (9Kim K.S. Pelton J.G. Inwood W.B. Andersen U. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. The rut pathway for pyrimidine degradation: Novel chemistry and toxicity problems.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4089-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Knapik A.A. Petkowski J.J.

Commun. 2012; 68: 1294-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RutC is similar to biochemically characterized members of the RidA subfamily in that it accelerates a deamination reaction that is catalyzed by water. Significantly, the substrate of RutC is not acted upon by RidA, despite the fact that these enzymes share other substrates in vitro, including the physiological substrate 2-AA. As expected, the active site arginine that has been associated with the deaminase activity of other Rid proteins is present in RutC, and a variant lacking it (RutCR104A) is inactive. Additional studies, both with RutC and other Rid proteins, are needed to define structural components responsible for the substrate specificity of RutC and facilitate the ability to categorize Rid family members and predict their physiological roles. Despite demonstrable 3-AA deaminase activity of the purified protein in vitro, RutC was not required for E. coli to utilize uridine as nitrogen source under the conditions tested. Other enzymes of the pathway were required for growth with uridine as nitrogen source under these same conditions. This result suggests that the rate of spontaneous 3-AA hydrolysis is sufficient to generate enough nitrogen for robust growth under laboratory conditions. The prevalence of rutC in bacterial species that have a Rut pathway suggests that the enzyme may provide a competitive advantage under as-yet-unknown conditions. We consider it likely that the laboratory conditions used do not detect a fitness defect that would be relevant in the natural environment. Taken together, the current data suggest that the action of RutC (and potentially RutD) might result in higher nitrogen levels that could be critical for competition in a specific environmental niche. This scenario would be consistent with the emerging model in which the unifying feature of Rid superfamily members is that they accelerate reactions that occur nonenzymatically in vivo (4Irons J.

This model further suggests that the RidA subfamily prevents metabolic damage caused by a reactive intermediate (16Borchert A.J. Ernst D.C. Downs D.M.

Sci. 2019; 44: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas members of other subfamilies increase the efficiency of metabolic processes that might otherwise be constrained by the rate of spontaneous hydrolysis in the cell (17Irons J.L.

Extension from the correct nucleotide pair (C) was not observed, but the primer with A paired opposite 1,N2-ε-G was readily extended. Crystal structures of ternary hpol η insertion-stage complexes with nonhydrolyzable nucleotides dAMPnPP or dCMPnPP showed a syn orientation of the adduct, with the incoming A staggered between adducted base and the 5’-adjacent T, while the incoming C and adducted base were roughly coplanar. The formation of a bifurcated H-bond between incoming dAMPnPP and 1,N2-ε-G and T, compared with the single H-bond formed between incoming dCMPnPP and 1,N2-ε-G, may account for the observed facilitated insertion of dGTP and dATP. Thus, preferential insertion of purines by hpol η across from etheno adducts contributes to distinct outcomes in error-prone DNA replication. Etheno (ε)-adducts, e.g., 1,N2-ε−guanine (1,N2-ε-G) and 1,N6-ε−adenine (1,N6-ε-A), are formed through the reaction of DNA with metabolites of vinyl compounds or with lipid peroxidation products. These lesions are known to be mutagenic, but it is unknown how they lead to errors in DNA replication that are bypassed by DNA polymerases. Here we report the structural basis of misincorporation frequencies across from 1,N2-ε-G by human DNA polymerase (hpol) η. In single-nucleotide insertions opposite the adduct 1,N2-ε-G, hpol η preferentially inserted dGTP, followed by dATP, dTTP, and dCTP. This preference for purines was also seen in the first extension step. Analysis of full-length extension products by LC-MS/MS revealed that G accounted for 85% of nucleotides inserted opposite 1,N2-ε-G in single base insertion, and 63% of bases inserted in the first extension step.

Thus, preferential insertion of purines by hpol η across from etheno adducts contributes to distinct outcomes in error-prone DNA replication.

These Y-Family pols play major roles in replication past DNA damage, whereby TLS can proceed in both an error-prone and an error-free fashion. Y-family pols share the right-handed palm, finger, and thumb domains with replicative ones but feature an additional little finger domain and unique makeups of their active sites. E. coli possesses five pols, with pols IV and V being members of the Y-Family (30Eoff R.L. Egli M. Guengerich F.P.

In the model archaeal organism Sulfolobus solfataricus, DNA pol IV (Dpo4) exhibits bypass behavior that is in some cases similar to that of human pol η (29Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R.

In initial work directed at the activity of a bypass pol past the 1,N2-ε-G adduct, we investigated the steady-state kinetics of Dpo4-catalyzed insertion and extension reactions (31Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irminia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. DNA adduct bypass polymerization by Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase Dpo4.

Experiments with individual dNTPs showed that A was the base preferentially inserted opposite 1,N2-ε-G. The products from full-length extension reactions were identified by an LC-MS/MS approach that revealed Dpo4 used multiple bypass mechanisms. Dpo4 extended primers containing 1,N2-ε-G to full length such that frameshifts predominated over A incorporation opposite the lesion. Thus, for a 3′-(1,N2-ε-G)CACT-5′ template, 5′-GTGA-3′ (frameshift, no insertion opposite 1,N2-ε-G) was the major extension product and 5′-AGTGA-3′ was a minor product. Generation of the former entails a frameshift such that primer G base pairs with template C. Crystal structures of a binary Dpo4-DNA and three ternary Dpo4-DNA-ddNTP complexes revealed an anti conformation of 1,N2-ε-G that was stacked between adjacent base pairs but unopposed by a residue from the primer strand (31Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irminia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. DNA adduct bypass polymerization by Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase Dpo4.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In these so-called Type 2 structures, Dpo4 is able to accommodate two template bases in the active site, thereby trapping a frameshift intermediate and shedding light on the mechanism of incorporation into the growing primer of either A or G opposite T or C, respectively, located on the 5′-side of the lesion. A subsequent study investigated the abilities of four human pols to synthesize past the 1,N2-ε-G adduct and their tendencies for error-prone or error-free bypass (32Choi J.-Y. Zang H. Angel K.C. Kozekov I.D. Goodenough A.K. Rizzo C.J. Guengerich F.P. Translesion synthesis across 1,N2-ethenoguanine by human DNA polymerases.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One of them, the replicative human pol δ was completely blocked by the etheno lesion. The human Y-family pols κ and ι exhibited similar rates of either dTTP or dCTP incorporation. In comparison, hpol η was more efficient at bypassing the lesion than hpols κ and ι, but it also showed the highest error frequency, incorporating dGTP > dATP > dCTP. This order was maintained irrespective of whether the 5′-adjacent residue to the lesion was C or T. Therefore, Dpo4 and hpol η use different mechanisms of bypassing the 1,N2-ε-G lesion, whereby the latter pol appears to consistently insert a base opposite 1,N2-ε-G and then extend the primer in an error-free fashion. In the present work, we conducted further insertion and extension experiments with the most active of the human bypass pols, pol η, opposite the 1,N2-ε-G lesion. The bypass behavior was assessed both with the 18mer 5′-d(CAT [1,N2-ε-G]AT GAC GCT TCC CCC)-3′ (T(εG)A, 1) and 5′-d(TCA T[1,N2-ε-G]G AAT CCT TCC CCC)-3′ (T(εG)G, 2) template strands, positioning the lesion between A and T and G and T, respectively. hpol η favored insertion of dGTP opposite the adduct in both sequence contexts, followed by dATP ≅ dTTP > dCTP for the 5′-T(εG)A-3′ (1) template and dATP > dTTP > dCTP for the 5′-T(εG)G-3′ (2) template. The ability of hpol η to extend from the lesion was tested after the correct (1,N2-ε-G:C) base pair and a (1,N2-ε-G:A) mispair. Interestingly, the polymerase was unable to extend from the former but capable of carrying out postlesion extension from the latter. We determined crystal structures of two insertion-stage hpol η complexes with the template/primer duplex 5′-d(CAT [1,N2-ε-G]AT GAC GCT)-3′/3′-d(TA CTG CGA)-5′ and either incoming dAMPnPP or dCMPnPP (nonhydrolyzable analogs of dATP and dCTP, respectively) in the presence of Mg2+. The incoming dAMPnPP adopts a staggered orientation opposite 1,N2-ε-G in the syn orientation, with H-bond formation between the N6 atom of A and both the O6 atom of 1,N2-ε-G and the O4 atom of the 5'-T. In the complex with incoming dCMPnPP, the lesion also assumes the syn orientation but pairs opposite C with formation of an H-bond between the N4 atom of C and the O6 atom of 1,N2-ε-G. The combined hpol η bypass and structural data with DNA template–primer duplexes containing the 1,N2-ε-G adduct contribute to a better understanding of the diverse mechanisms underlying the preferred insertion of dATP and dGTP by this pol opposite distinct lesions. In previous work directed at hpol η bypass of abasic sites and the 1,N6-ε-A adduct, we established the preferential insertion of dATP and dGTP opposite these lesions (33Patra A. Zhang Q. Lei L. Su Y. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. Structural and kinetic analysis of nucleoside triphosphate incorporation opposite an abasic site by human translesion DNA polymerase η.J. Biol.

Chem. 2016; 291: 14134-14145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as seen here with the bypass of 1,N2-ε-G. However, structures of insertion stage complexes reveal that the “purine rule” with an abasic site involves interactions between the incoming nucleotide base and the template strand backbone that can also result in frameshifts (33Patra A. Zhang Q. Lei L. Su Y. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. Structural and kinetic analysis of nucleoside triphosphate incorporation opposite an abasic site by human translesion DNA polymerase η.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 8028-8038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both incoming dGTP and dATP stack onto the 1,N6-ε-A adduct, which adopts the anti conformation at the hpol η active site, whereas incoming dTTP is coplanar with the lesion in the syn conformation. Conversely, the preferred insertion of dGTP and dATP by hpol η occurs with the 1,N2-ε-G lesion in the syn conformation without the involvement of stacking between the lesioned and incoming nucleotide base moieties. 1,N2-ε-G maintains the syn orientation even opposite incoming dCTP, and unlike the case of bypass of abasic sites, the preferred insertion of purine nucleotides opposite 1,N2-ε-G is devoid of frameshifts. hpol η-mediated bypass of 1,N2-ε-G was performed using two different sequence contexts, 5′-T(εG)A-3′ (1) and 5′-T(εG)G-3′ (2) (see Table S1 for oligonucleotide sequences), employing full-length extension and single-nucleotide insertion assays. The oligonucleotide sequence context 5′-T(εG)A-3′ (1) was designed on the basis of the sequence used for crystallography. The 5′-T(εG)G-3′ (2) oligonucleotide was studied previously (32Choi J.-Y. Zang H. Angel K.C. Kozekov I.D. Goodenough A.K. Rizzo C.J. Guengerich F.P. Translesion synthesis across 1,N2-ethenoguanine by human DNA polymerases.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Full-length primer extension reactions were performed in the presence of all four dNTPs using the respective primers (see Table S1 for oligonucleotide sequences). Under our experimental conditions, the bypass of 1,N2-ε-G was slower compared with unmodified templates (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4A) for both sequence contexts. Single-nucleotide insertion assays were done utilizing individual dNTPs to determine the insertions across the adduct. The incorporation preference for the control templates was dCTP > dTTP > dGTP > dATP (Fig. 3B, Fig. S4B lanes 1–12). hpol η preferentially added dGTP across from 1,N2-ε-G, at almost similar rates for both sequence contexts. The incorporation preference for the 5′-T(εG)A-3′ (1) template was dGTP > dATP ≅ dTTP > dCTP (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–12) while for the 5′-T(εG)G-3′ (2) template, the preference was dGTP > dATP > dTTP > dCTP (Fig. S4C, lanes 1–12). These results show that hpol η tolerates 1,N2-ε-G in both sequence contexts. hpol η-mediated postlesion extension for 1,N2-ε-G was performed for both the sequence contexts 5′-T(εG)A-3′ (1) and 5′-T(εG)G-3′ (2) (see Table S1 for oligonucleotide sequences) employing full-length extension and single-nucleotide insertion assays. We utilized two different primers for postlesion extension after the correct base pair (1,N2-ε-G:C) and a mispair (1,N2-ε-G:A). For a misincorporated base, A was used opposite the lesion because it showed the greatest misincorporation frequency, following that for dGTP. Full-length primer extension reactions were performed in the presence of all four dNTPs using the respective primers (see Table S1 for oligonucleotide sequences). As a result, for both the sequence contexts, under our experimental conditions, extension from the 1,N2-ε-G:C pair was slower (Fig. 4A and Fig. S5A, lane 7) compared with the unmodified templates (Fig. 4A and Fig. S5A, lane 2). For the 1,N2-ε-G:A pair, extension was faster (Fig. 5A and Fig. S6A, lane 7) compared with unmodified templates (Fig. 5A and Fig. S6A, lane 2).Figure 5hpol η-mediated postlesion full-length and single-nucleotide insertion assays using 1,N2-ε-G in template 5′-T(εG)A-3′ (1) and Primer_3.

For correct base pairing, the incorporation preference for control template 1 was dTTP > dGTP > dCTP > dATP (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–12), and the incorporation preference for the control template 2 was dATP > dTTP >dGTP > dCTP (Fig. S5B lanes 1–12). In the case of the 1,N2-ε-G:C template–primer pairs, postlesion insertion was drastically retarded, indicating resistance to extension past the correct base pair C. Overall, hpol η-mediated formation of very small amounts of inserted products for both sequence contexts was observed, at similar rates. The postlesion insertion preference for 5′-T(εG)A-3′ (1) template was dTTP > dGTP > dATP > dCTP (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–12) while for the 5′-T(εG)G-3′ (2) template, the preference was dGTP > dATP ≅ dTTP ≅ dCTP (Fig. S5C, lanes 1–12). For a mispair (G:A), postlesion insertion was drastically affected for the control template 1 (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–12), while the incorporation preference for the control template 2 was dTTP > dATP ≅ dGTP > dCTP (Fig. S6B, lanes 1–12). In the case of the 1,N2-ε-G:A template–primer pairs, the postlesion insertions were unaffected (Fig. 5C, Fig. S6C). The order of postlesion insertion for both the sequence contexts was dTTP > dGTP > dATP > dCTP (Fig. 5C, Fig. S6C, lanes 1–12). The preference for T insertion during hpol η-mediated postlesion bypass was also observed previously for unmodified (2′-F-G:C pair) as well as modified (N7-CH3 2′-F-G:C pair) templates (35Njuma O.J.

Objective To investigate the prevalence of stunting and associated factors among public primary school children of the Bahir Dar city. Method A cross-sectional study was carried out from March to June 2019. Data were coded and entered into the Epi-Data and exported to SPSS version 23 software. The pupil was stunted if the height- for-age was ≤ -2 SDs from the median growth standards according to the WHO. A descriptive summary was computed using frequency, percent, mean, median and standard deviation. A simple logistic regression model was fitted to identify associated factors between the independent variables and the dependent variable at a 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value &lt;0.05. Results 370 primary school pupils were included in the study with the mean age of 10.15 (± 2.23 SD) years. 51.6% of the pupils were females. The total prevalence of stunting was 15.13% (95%CI; 11%, 19%). The burden of stunting was higher in the age group of 11 years and older. Pupil’s age older than 11 years (AOR = 15. 6; 95%CI; 3.31, 73.45; p-value &lt; 0. 001) and male sex (AOR = 7. 07; 95%CI: 2.51, 19.89; p-value &lt; 0. 0002) were significantly associated with stunting. Conclusion The prevalence of stunting was relatively lower than the regional estimated stunting level. Older age and male sex were significantly associated with stunting."
https://openalex.org/W3116543296,"Rare sequence variants in the microglial cell surface receptor TREM2 have been shown to increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease-linked TREM2 mutations seem to confer a partial loss of function, and increasing TREM2 cell surface expression and thereby its function(s) might have therapeutic benefit in AD. However, druggable targets that could modulate microglial TREM2 surface expression are not known. To identify such targets, we conducted a screen of small molecule compounds with known pharmacology using human myeloid cells, searching for those that enhance TREM2 protein at the cell surface. Inhibitors of the kinases MEK1/2 displayed the strongest and most consistent increases in cell surface TREM2 protein, identifying a previously unreported pathway for TREM2 regulation. Unexpectedly, inhibitors of the downstream effector ERK kinases did not have the same effect, suggesting that noncanonical MEK signaling regulates TREM2 trafficking. In addition, siRNA knockdown experiments confirmed that decreased MEK1 and MEK2 were required for this recruitment. In iPSC-derived microglia, MEK inhibition increased cell surface TREM2 only modestly, so various cytokines were used to alter iPSC microglia phenotype, making cells more sensitive to MEK inhibitor-induced TREM2 recruitment. Of those tested, only IFN-gamma priming prior to MEK inhibitor treatment resulted in greater TREM2 recruitment. These data identify the first known mechanisms for increasing surface TREM2 protein and TREM2-regulated function in human myeloid cells and are the first to show a role for MEK1/MEK2 signaling in TREM2 activity."

The Rho-dependent transcription termination plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria. The transcription termination of about half of the operons in Escherichia coli is controlled by this termination process. The Rho protein, a homohexamer with a protomer of 46.8 kDa, is a highly conserved protein found in most bacteria. It is an RNA/DNA helicase or translocase that dissociates RNA polymerase from the DNA template using its RNA-dependent ATPase activity to bring about the transcription termination (1Richardson J.P.

Bacteriol. 2018; 200e00380-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the Rho-interacting C-terminal region or its derivatives in isolation might show Rho-inhibitory activities, which could be further developed into antimicrobials targeting the Rho protein. Alternative strategies to design new-generation antimicrobials, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are essential in the wake of the emergence of many multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant pathogenic strains. Efforts to design AMPs from different phage proteins such as endolysins, LysAB2 (14Peng S.Y. You R.I. Lai M.J. Lin N.T. Chen L.K. Chang K.C.

Agents Chemother. 2016; 60: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have been reported earlier. Here, we report the design of peptides from the mutagenized CTD (helix 7) of Psu, using a phenotypic screening method. We screened peptides based on their ability to induce growth defects and inhibiting Rho-dependent termination in vivo. These peptides not only had the mutagenized sequence from Psu helix 7 but also contained an extra region from the adjacent nucleotide sequence of the plasmid that got appended to their C-terminal region because of frame-shift mutations. In vitro, the peptides inhibited the RNA release and ATPase activities of the E. coli Rho via a direct interaction. The molecular docking and genetic and biochemical evidence revealed that they bind near the primary RNA-binding region of Rho at the interface of its two subunits. Both the peptides and Psu exerted similar genome-wide upregulation upon in vivo expressions. The expressions of these peptides caused lethality in Mycobacteria and inhibited the in vitro functions of the Rho proteins from various other pathogens. The bacteriophage P4 capsid protein, Psu, has been shown to act as an inhibitor of the transcription terminator Rho of E. coli and various bacterial pathogens (9Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Abhishek M. Ramya M.L. Suganthan R. Sen R. Mechanism of inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 protein Psu.J. Biol.

The C-terminal helix 7 of the Psu protein (Fig. 1A) interacts directly with the Rho (9Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Abhishek M. Ramya M.L. Suganthan R. Sen R.

Hence, we hypothesized that this helix could be used for developing anti-Rho peptides. The overexpression of the isolated 21-mer Psu helix 7 did not induce any toxic effect in E. coli, unlike the full-length Psu (Fig. 2A). Therefore, to obtain gain-of-function peptide(s) from this WT helix 7, we used a phenotypic screening strategy by randomly mutagenizing specific amino acids of this 21-mer peptide. We used different synthetic DNA oligonucleotides containing one or more degenerated codons at the positions corresponding to each of the targeted residues. The residues that were already shown (11Ranjan A. Sharma S. Banerjee R. Sen U. Sen R. Structural and mechanistic basis of anti-termination of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 capsid protein Psu.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 6839-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to be important for the interaction with Rho were selected. The amino acid positions of Psu, N174, F177, S181, and L184 were targeted, and the oligonucleotides were designed to mutagenize the first, the second, or both the positions of each of the codon of the targeted residues (Fig. 1B). The library of mutant peptides was cloned under the control of an IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter in the pNL150 vector and was expressed in the RS734 strain having a lacZ-reporter cassette fused downstream of a Rho-dependent terminator, tR1 (Plac-nutR/tR1-lacZYA). In this setup, gain-of-function peptide clones would yield blue colonies on the LB X-gal plates. We screened ∼80,000 colonies. The colonies appearing deep blue were screened and were further checked for their growth-inhibition properties (Fig. 1C). The mutant clones obtained above were expressed in a WT MG1655 strain in the presence of 100 μM of the inducer, IPTG, and the growth assays were followed (Fig. 2, A and B). We observed significant growth defects upon expressions of several peptide clones. Among the nine peptide clones, peptides 16 and 33 exhibited severe growth defects and strong in vivo antitermination of Rho-dependent termination (Fig. 3). The in vivo Rho inhibitory properties of these two peptides were comparable with that of Psu. Upon nucleotide sequencing of these peptide clones, we observed that all the peptides, in addition to the desired point mutations, acquired novel sequences, which evolved because of a frameshift mutation in the helix-7 sequence (Figs. 2C and S1). The addition of new sequences was from the adjacent vector sequences at their C-terminal region, which converted these gain-of-function peptides into 38-mer peptides from the original 21-mer helix 7 of Psu. In silico modeling of these two peptides, using the threading method in the Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER ) server, revealed that the C-terminal new adjacent sequence was predicted to fold into a helical structure, whereas a part of the N-terminal region formed weak antiparallel β-sheets that were stabilized as random coils after a 1-μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (Fig. 2, D and E, and Fig. S2). This adjacent sequence might be responsible for structurally stabilizing the peptides in vivo that were absent in the 21-mer WT helix 7 rendering the latter unstable and nonfunctional. The quality of the predicted structures was high with a confidential score for peptides 16 and 33 of −1.79 and −1.72, respectively. The structure validation by the Ramachandran plot showed that both the peptides have no residues in the disallowed regions (Fig. 2, D and E). To understand the structural basis of the variations in their functional efficiencies, we modeled and performed dynamic simulations of all the other peptides and compared their RMSD structural deviations from peptide 33 (Fig. S1B). We observed that the changes in the amino acid sequences in the helix-7 regions induced structural variations ranging from ∼6 Å to ∼11 Å as compared with peptide 33. Unlike peptides 16 and 33, in most of the other peptides, the N-terminal β-sheets remained intact after the MD simulation. Also, the spatial orientations of the C-terminal helixes of these other peptides were significantly different compared with peptide 33. We reasoned that these structural changes could have affected the functions of these peptides. CD spectra of peptides 16 and 33 also revealed that they are predominantly α-helical (Fig. S3). We tested the in vivo anti-Rho function potentials of peptides 16 and 33. For this purpose, we first performed in vivo Rho-dependent termination assays using an MC4100 strain having a single-copy galEP3 reporter in the chromosome. This reporter cassette consists of a series of Rho-dependent terminators present in the IS2 element inserted at the beginning of the galactose operon. If the expression of Psu or the peptides (cloned in pNL150, under an IPTG-inducible promoter, Ptac) inhibits the Rho function, antitermination will occur through these terminators, leading to expression of the galactose operon that would be manifested as red or pink colonies on MacConkey–galactose indicator plates. We observed the appearance of red colonies upon overexpression of the WT Psu and the peptides indicating the inhibition of Rho-dependent termination in vivo (Fig. S4A). Next, we monitored the effects of the in vivo expressions of Psu and the peptides on Rho-dependent termination at two well-known terminators, trpt′ and trac, using the lacZ reporter system. They are Plac-trpt′-lacZAY (RS2045) and Plac-H19B nutR/tR1-lacZAY (RS2047), where the terminators are fused upstream of the lacZ genes and are inserted in the chromosome of E. coli MG1655 Δrac Δlac. The colonies would appear blue on the LB–X-gal indicator plates if the Rho-dependent termination is inhibited. We observed that upon expressions of Psu and the peptides (induction by 50 μM IPTG), deep blue colonies appeared on the indicator plates. Colonies were white or pale blue in the presence of an empty pNL150 vector (Fig. 3A). We repeated the in vivo termination assays using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to get more quantitative data by measuring the level of lacZ expression using the same terminator-lacZAY fusion templates described above (Fig. 3B). The strains described in Figure. 3A having these two lacZ fusions in the chromosome and harboring the pNL150 vector alone or expressing Psu or the peptides were used. Upon induction by IPTG, the expression levels of the Plac-trac-lacZ fusion were observed to be enhanced by 28-fold when Psu was expressed, whereas in the presence of the peptides, this level was increased by 6- to 12-folds. In the case of the trpt′-lacZ fusion, these enhanced levels of expression were less but still were significant. These results further confirmed that like Psu, peptides are capable of inhibiting Rho-dependent termination in vivo efficiently. Earlier, we have shown that in vitro, the binding of Psu to Rho reduced the rate of RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis of the latter (9Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Abhishek M. Ramya M.L. Suganthan R.

A bacteriophage capsid protein is an inhibitor of a conserved transcription terminator of various bacterial pathogens.J. Bacteriol. 2018; 200e00380-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We used an in vitro–synthesized RNA having the λtR1 terminator sequence to induce the in vitro ATPase function of the E. coli Rho. We observed that like Psu, both the peptides inhibited the ATPase activity of the E. coli Rho (Fig. 3C). Owing to higher affinity, peptide 33 was more efficient than peptide 16 in inhibiting this Rho function in vitro. However, about 10 times more molar amount of peptides than Psu was required to observe this inhibitory activity. The requirement of a higher concentration of peptides to exert their effect is consistent with the requirement of a higher level of IPTG induction in the in vivo experiments. It should be noted that the peptides used in the in vitro studies were chemically synthesized. Psu is capable of inhibiting E. coli Rho-dependent termination in an in vitro–purified system (9Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Abhishek M. Ramya M.L. Suganthan R. Sen R. Mechanism of inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 protein Psu.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26491-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Next, we assayed the peptide-mediated inhibition of the in vitro transcription termination functions of the Rho. We used a linear DNA template where a trpt′ terminator is fused downstream of a strong T7A1 promoter. On this template, efficient transcription termination over a terminator zone is usually observed in the presence of Rho (Fig. 3D; (16Chalissery J. Banerjee S. Bandey I. Sen R. Transcription termination defective mutants of rho: Role of different functions of rho in releasing RNA from the elongation complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 855-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). The amount of run-off transcripts at the end of this template gives the measure of Rho inhibition by the peptides. We observed that the amount of run-off transcripts increased to ∼28% at higher concentrations of peptide 33 from ∼6% in its absence. A similar level of in vitro Rho inhibition was earlier observed in the presence of Psu (9Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Abhishek M. Ramya M.L. Suganthan R. Sen R. Mechanism of inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 protein Psu.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26491-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peptide 33 did not have any effect on transcription when Rho was absent (lane 2 from left). The effect of peptide 16 in this type of transcription termination assays was observed to be much less, which could be due to its weaker affinity for Rho (data not shown). Next, we measured the inhibition of Rho-mediated RNA release from a stalled elongation complex (EC) by the peptides. We designed a setup where the EC is stalled on a template bound to magnetic beads at a particular position inside the trpt′ terminator region using the lac repressor as a roadblock (RB) (Fig. 3E, top panel). On this template also, the transcription is initiated from the T7A1 promoter. In this setup, the RNA released because of the Rho-dependent transcription termination would be visible in the supernatant (S). We observed that in the presence of either Psu (Fig. S4B) or the peptides (Fig. 3E for peptide 33 and Fig. S4B for peptide 16), the Rho-induced RNA release from the stalled EC was significantly inhibited. Peptide 16 could efficiently inhibit the RNA release of Rho only when stalled EC was used (Fig. S4B). Similar to the ATPase assays, higher concentrations of peptides than Psu were required to bring about this inhibition function. Peptide 33 exerted its action at a lower concentration than peptide 16, indicating a tighter binding to Rho by the former (Fig. S4B). It should be noted that the peptides do not have any adverse effect on the in vitro transcription process in the absence of Rho (Fig. 3E, no Rho lane). In general, at ≥50 μM, peptide 33 exerted its maximal effects. However, as these peptides were synthesized and commercially purchased, the concentration requirements to exert the maximum effect varied between different lots. These observations strongly indicate that the peptides are capable of inhibiting the in vitro functions of Rho protein in a manner comparable with that observed for the WT Psu. Earlier, we have demonstrated the formation of a specific Psu–E. coli Rho complex in vivo by overexpressing both the proteins together in the same strain (9Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Abhishek M. Ramya M.L. Suganthan R. Sen R. Mechanism of inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 protein Psu.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26491-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, we failed to obtain a stable in vitro Rho–Psu complex with the WT Rho. We observed that an in vitro stable complex between Psu and Rho could form if a mutant Rho, P167L, was used (11Ranjan A. Sharma S. Banerjee R. Sen U. Sen R. Structural and mechanistic basis of anti-termination of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 capsid protein Psu.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 6839-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This mutant Rho was obtained as a suppressor of a Psu mutant that was defective in binding to WT Rho (11Ranjan A. Sharma S. Banerjee R. Sen U. Sen R. Structural and mechanistic basis of anti-termination of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 capsid protein Psu.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 6839-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This Rho mutant appeared to form a stable hexamer at a lower concentration unlike the WT Rho, which could have improved its affinity for Psu. We assumed that this Rho mutant would also have a higher affinity for the peptides. Hence, to demonstrate peptide–Rho interactions in vitro, we have used P167L Rho. We performed the pull-down assays by using His-tagged versions of Psu (Fig. S4C) and peptides 16 and 33 (Fig. 4A) and the non–His-tagged P167L Rho, where peptides and Psu were bound to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose beads. In this assay, unbound Rho would be visible in the flow-through and the wash fractions, and the bound Rho would be in the eluted fraction. In all these cases, ∼ 40 to 70% of Rho proteins were found to be associated with the peptides (Fig. 4A), a level comparable with what we observed for the Psu–Rho complex (Fig. S4C). The complexes were observed to be formed at the ratios of Rho hexamer:peptide 16::1:6, Rho hexamer:peptide 33::1:4, and Rho hexamer:Psu:: 1:3. In all these cases, ratios were calculated from the amounts of Rho/Psu/peptides expressed in micrograms (Fig. 4A). These results indicated a direct interaction of the peptides with Rho, which induced the anti-Rho functions. To understand the mode of interactions of the peptides with P167L Rho, we performed the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis of peptides 16– and 33–Rho interactions. The binding and thermodynamic parameters are listed in Figure. 4B. We observed the following. (1) Peptide 33 binds to P167L Rho with a fairly high affinity (Kd = 17 nM) with a Rho hexamer:peptide 33::1:4 binding stoichiometry. Peptide 16 binds with much weaker affinity and with significantly reduced stoichiometry. This weaker binding of peptide 16 is consistent with its requirement of higher concentrations in the functional assays (Fig. 3). (2) The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the binding of both the peptides is highly enthalpy driven, most likely because of the formation of specific H-bonds between the amino acids of the peptides and Rho (17London N. Movshovitz-Attias D. Schueler-Furman O. The structural basis of peptide-protein binding strategies.Structure. 2010; 18: 188-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), which is common for smaller peptides fitting into specific pockets of larger macromolecules via an “induced-fit” mechanism. The aforementioned results showed that the functional peptides contain an N-terminal His-tag sequence and an additional sequence from the vector appended to their C-terminal region in addition to that derived from Psu helix 7. To understand the importance of additional N- and C-terminal regions, we made a series of deletions in these regions and performed growth assays in similar ways as described in Figure. 2A. We observed that the N-terminal 6XHis-tagged WT Psu helix 7 sequence either in the presence or absence of the C-terminal adjacent vector sequence did not cause a growth defect in the presence of IPTG (Fig. 5A; see the plots, helix 7 peptide, and helix 7 + adjacent sequence). The presence of C-terminal vector sequences (shown in green) in peptides 16 and 33 was found to be essential for their function in vivo (Fig. 5A). This suggests that in addition to the C-terminal vector sequence, the mutations present in the helix-7 region (shown in red) of peptides 16 and 33 are also important. The vector sequence might be providing structural stability to the mutated helix-7 region of the peptides. The length of these two peptides is too long to be functional as AMPs as cells would not allow their entry when added exogenously. So, we explored the minimal length of these peptides required to remain functional. We constructed a series of truncated versions of the peptides with the deletions of amino acids from their C-terminal region and expressed them in vivo in the presence of IPTG and monitored their abilities to induce growth defects in a similar way as described in Figure. 2 (Fig. 5B). We observed that up to eight amino acids could be deleted from the C-terminal region of peptide 33, without incurring significant functional defects"
https://openalex.org/W3151820029,"Interactions of membrane-bound mammalian cytochromes P450 (CYPs) with NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), which are required for metabolism of xenobiotics, are facilitated by membrane lipids. A variety of membrane mimetics, such as phospholipid liposomes and nanodiscs, have been used to simulate the membrane to form catalytically active CYP:POR complexes. However, the exact mechanism(s) of these interactions are unclear because of the absence of structural information of full-length mammalian CYP:POR complexes in membranes. Herein, we report the use of amphipols (APols) to form a fully functional, soluble, homogeneous preparation of full-length CYP:POR complexes amenable to biochemical and structural study. Incorporation of CYP2B4 and POR into APols resulted in a CYP2B4:POR complex with a stoichiometry of 1:1, which was fully functional in demethylating benzphetamine at a turnover rate of 37.7 ± 2.2 min−1, with a coupling efficiency of 40%. Interestingly, the stable complex had a molecular weight (Mw) of 338 ± 22 kDa determined by multiangle light scattering, suggestive of a tetrameric complex of 2CYP2B4:2POR embedded in one APol nanoparticle. Moreover, negative stain electron microscopy (EM) validated the homogeneity of the complex and allowed us to generate a three-dimensional EM map and model consistent with the tetramer observed in solution. This first report of the full-length mammalian CYP:POR complex by transmission EM not only reveals the architecture that facilitates electron transfer but also highlights a potential use of APols in biochemical and structural studies of functional CYP complexes with redox partners."

This cross-sectional study collected data through a structured questionnaire. HCAs affiliated with home care agencies in Taichung, Taiwan were recruited through purposive sampling. A total of 487 questionnaires were distributed from September to December 2015 with 280 valid responses collected (57.4%).This study predicted the factors of HCAs’ intention to receive oral health care training through a decision tree analysis. The decision tree model classified the respondents with an accuracy of 77.5%. The optimal predictor variable was oral health care knowledge (χ 2 = 66.662, p &lt; 0.0001). Among the low-scoring respondents on oral health care knowledge, 76.4% were classified in the “uninterested” group, whereas 84.8% of the high scorers were classified in the “interested” group. The second best predictor variable was whether oral health care is part of the job responsibility (χ 2 = 7.979, p = 0.007). Among those who answered Yes, 92.9% were in the interested group, as were 76.5% of those who answered No. It is recommended to add “disease and oral care-related content” and “safety protection, assessment, and usage of oral care tools during practical oral care process” to the oral healthcare training course content for HCAs in order to improve HCAs’ oral healthcare knowledge and oral care skills. These research findings are valuable and may be taken into account in the future development of the in-service educational training of oral healthcare for HCAs."

Gulbins E. Acid ceramidase rescues cystic fibrosis mice from pulmonary infections.Infect. Immun. 2020; 89e00677-20Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This suggests that the acid ceramidase plays a key role in regulating the infection susceptibility of CF mice and possibly also humans. Our current model suggests that deficiency of Cftr results in increased ceramide levels that mediate a downregulation of acid ceramidase and, thereby, a further upregulation of ceramide and a concomitant downregulation of sphingosine. These alterations form a vicious cycle and may cause the infection susceptibility of CF mice and human individuals with CF. At present, it is unknown how Cftr regulates acid ceramidase expression. A link between the acid ceramidase and interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), also named interferon consensus sequence binding protein, has been previously shown in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells with a marked upregulation of IRF8 and a downregulation of acid ceramidase (26Hu X. Yang D. Zimmerman M. Liu F. Yang J. Kannan S. Burchert A. Szulc Z. Bielawska A. Ozato K. Bhalla K. Liu K. IRF8 regulates acid ceramidase expression to mediate apoptosis and suppresses myelogeneous leukemia.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether Cftr deficiency regulates IRF8 and, in turn, whether IRF-8 controls acid ceramidase expression in CF cells. Here, we demonstrate that deficiency of Cftr or functional inhibition of Cftr results in upregulation of IRF8 and a concomitant downregulation of acid ceramidase protein expression and activity. Genetic downregulation of IRF8 abrogated the effect of genetic deficiency or functional inhibition of CFTR on acid ceramidase expression and activity. Genetic downregulation of IRF8 also normalized increased ceramide and reduced sphingosine levels in CF cells or after functional inhibition of CFTR. The reduced sphingosine levels upon prolonged inhibition of CFTR increased the infection susceptibility of cells to P. aeruginosa, which was restored by downregulation of IRF8 using siRNA technology, direct addition of sphingosine to the cells, or cellular treatment with ceramidase to generate sphingosine. To investigate whether Cftr deficiency alters expression levels of IRF8, we used CFMHH mice that express low levels of Cftr, and Cftr−/− mice that are deficient for Cftr, but express human CFTR under the control of a fatty acid binding protein (FABP) promoter in the intestine. Both strains can be fed a normal diet. Syngenic littermates were used as controls. All mice were on a C57BL/6H background. We determined the protein expression of IRF8 in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells from wild-type and CF mice by western blotting (Fig. 1) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2A). The results revealed a marked upregulation of IRF8 in tracheal epithelial cells from CF mice compared with the levels in wild-type mice (Fig. 1). The expression of IRF8 increased with age of the CF mice (Fig. 1). Confocal microscopy studies from trachea or lung of CF and wild-type mice confirmed the upregulation of IRF8 in epithelial cells of CF mice (Fig. 2A). IRF8 expression was normalized to actin fluorescence in epithelial cells. We also investigated whether treatment of tracheal epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a paradigmatic proinflammatory mediator, results in a further change of the expression of IRF8, but failed to detect an effect of LPS on IRF8 expression (Fig. 1).Figure 2Cftr/CFTR deficiency induces an upregulation of IRF8—immunofluorescence confocal microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W3156500194,"Introduction The Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100) is a point of care instrument that simulates plug formation under high shear flow. The PFA-100 measures the time required to occlude the aperture in a biochemically active cartridge and is expressed in a term of closure time (CT). In Algeria, the reference values used in clinical laboratories are of Western origin. However, ethnic, genetic, dietary environmental, and diet differences between populations may affect reference intervals. We established the reference intervals of PFA-100 closure times in healthy Algerian adults according to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry method, and we compared them with those of Western and Asian countries. Material and methods We enrolled 303 healthy blood donors in the study. 218 subjects met inclusion criteria. We analyzed the blood sample on the PFA-100 for CT with both the collagen epinephrine and collagen ADP cartridges. Results The reference intervals of PFA-100 collagen epinephrine CT and PFA-100 collagen ADP CT were 91–207 seconds and 71–144 seconds, respectively. Compared to Western and Asian populations, there were significant differences. The upper limits of CTs were higher for Algerians in this study. Our findings show that many healthy Algerians would be incorrectly identified as having a primary hemostasis abnormality according to the reference intervals of the manufacturer and scientific literature. Conclusion This report provides the first reference intervals for PFA-100 CTs in healthy Algerian adults. These results improve the accuracy of diagnosis and patient care in Algeria."

Scheffler et al. discovered that Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a small molecule that inhibits other P. aeruginosa cells from adsorbing to surfaces by interfering with type IV pili dynamics. The inhibition of cell adsorption could present a method to prevent biofilm formation on sensitive surfaces in hospitals and industry. Bacterial biofilms are surface-associated multicellular communities that are highly resistant to removal. Scheffler et al. discovered that Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a small molecule that inhibits other P. aeruginosa cells from adsorbing to surfaces by interfering with type IV pili dynamics. The inhibition of cell adsorption could present a method to prevent biofilm formation on sensitive surfaces in hospitals and industry. Surface contamination by microbes in hospitals and in the food industry can threaten human life. Often, bacteria exist on these surfaces as resilient multicellular communities, termed “biofilms,” in which cells adhere to each other and the surface, embedded in an extracellular matrix (1Berne C. Ellison C.K. Ducret A. Brun Y.V. Bacterial adhesion at the single-cell level.Nat. Rev. 2018; 16: 616-627Google Scholar). As such, surface-adsorbed cells in biofilms are difficult to remove for proper sterilization of sensitive equipment and environments (2Davies D. Understanding biofilm resistance to antibacterial agents.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Biofilm assembly initiates with the surface adhesion of one or few cells. This adhesion is dependent on physical and chemical forces and can vary according to the environment, bacterial growth state, and properties of the surface itself. To enhance this initial attachment, some species have developed specialized appendages. For example, P. aeruginosa, a bacterial opportunistic human pathogen that is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired infections, elaborates “Type IV” pili, an extracellular polymer that the cell can actively extend and retract to sense surfaces and adhere to them (3McCallum M. Burrows L.L. Howell P.L. The dynamic structures of the type IV pilus.Microbiol. Spectr. 2019; 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that P. aeruginosa induces expression of virulence factors upon initial attachment, making this initial adherence step a potential target for the development of new antimicrobial drugs (4Persat A. Inclan Y.F. Engel J.N. Stone H.A. Gitai Z. Type IV pili mechanochemically regulate virulence factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 7563-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Many bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, use secondary metabolites to affect their population dynamics, including triggering the formation of biofilms and initiating their subsequent dispersal, inducing the production of virulence factors, and interfering with the growth of other competing species. However, it was not clear whether bacterial molecules might also inhibit the first steps in biofilm formation. Scheffler et al. (5Scheffler R.J. Sugimoto Y. Bratton B.P. Ellison C.K. Koch M.D. Donia M.S. Gitai Z. Pseudomonas aeruginosa detachment from surfaces via a self-made small molecule.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) therefore screened cell-free media from P. aeruginosa cultures to search for molecules that would disrupt P. aeruginosa early cell surface attachment and consequently promote cell dispersal in early-stage biofilms. To achieve this, the authors first developed a high-throughput microscopy-based adsorption assay (which they termed “DISPEL”) to assess the dispersal activity of P. aeruginosa cell-free culture media harvested at different growth phases. They discovered that media harvested from stationary-phase bacterial cultures could robustly disperse surface-attached P. aeruginosa. The investigators purified a molecule responsible for this dispersal activity and, by employing mass spectrometry and NMR, identified it as 2-methyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (MHQ): a result that was consistent with their later observation that commercially available MHQ effectively dispersed surface-attached P. aeruginosa. MHQ has previously been characterized as a secondary metabolite, but the origins and functions of this compound have not been investigated. The structural similarity of MHQ with other alkyl quinolones implicated in quorum sensing, such as 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (HHQ) and 2-heptyl-3,4-dihydroxyquinoline (PQS), led the authors to consider that the pqsABCDE operon, responsible for quinolone synthesis, could be responsible for synthesis of MHQ as well (6Gallagher L.A. McKnight S.L. Kuznetsova M.S. Pesci E.C. Manoil C. Functions required for extracellular quinolone signaling by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Accordingly, analysis of culture media harvested from a P. aeruginosa strain lacking this operon showed the absence of MHQ production, demonstrating that these genes are required for MHQ synthesis. Interestingly, despite the structural similarity of HHQ, PQS, and other alkyl quinolones of various tail lengths synthesized by this operon with MHQ, these other alkyl quinolones did not exhibit dispersal activity against surface-attached P. aeruginosa. The authors next examined how MHQ inhibits early attachment. The addition of MHQ to P. aeruginosa did not kill the cells, nor did it disrupt the cells’ membrane integrity, ruling out some of the most standard antibiotic mechanisms. However, upon examination of MHQ-treated cells by light microscopy, the authors observed that the rod-shape P. aeruginosa cells that were initially adsorbed onto the surface via a cell pole (and therefore oriented vertically) switched to a horizontal orientation, presumably to increase cell surface contact in an effort to maintain adherence (Fig. 1). This phenotype was similar to that resulting from cells without the ability to elaborate type IV pili. Additionally, the authors observed that MHQ-treated cells displayed reduced twitching motility (7Marathe R. Meel C. Schmidt N.C. Dewenter L. Kurre R. Greune L. Schmidt M.A. Muller M.J. Lipowsky R. Maier B. Klumpp S. Bacterial twitching motility is coordinated by a two-dimensional tug-of-war with directional memory.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)—a bacterial surface translocation driven by type IV pili powered by cycles of polymerization, adhesion, and retraction—compared with wild-type cells. To directly visualize the effect of MHQ treatment on pilus dynamics, the authors fluorescently labeled pili and examined pilus activity using fluorescence microscopy, which revealed that pilus extension and retraction were diminished in the presence of MHQ. The authors proposed that preventative administration of purified MHQ may limit P. aeruginosa growth on sensitive surfaces. Moving forward, it will be interesting to test if the coadministration of MHQ with antibiotics, for example, would increase bactericidal activity via partial or complete dispersal. Moreover, given the striking effect of MHQ on P. aeruginosa adherence, testing the efficacy of the molecule in inhibiting the dynamics of type IV pili of other bacterial species may provide insight into how broadly effective MHQ may be in inhibiting biofilm formation. One of the most surprising aspects of this work is that the authors discovered that conditioned media from the ΔpqsABCDE mutant, which does not make detectable levels of MHQ, fully retained dispersal activity. This suggested that, although MHQ was sufficient for surface dispersal, it was not necessary, thereby indicating that an additional dispersal factor or factors secreted by P. aeruginosa remain to be discovered! Of course, identification of the additional factor or factors in the conditioned media that also harbor a dispersal activity similar to MHQ may reveal why this process requires separate, redundant mechanisms. Finally, the study raises an important physiological question about the lifestyle of P. aeruginosa that is difficult to address: what is the biological purpose of P. aeruginosa harboring this dispersal activity? While the protective benefits of biofilm formation have been self-evident, it remains unclear why P. aeruginosa cells may want to coax other P. aeruginosa cells to not adhere near them. The authors posit that cells that initially colonize an area and have grown to high density may not welcome cells that are at a different growth stage, for example, and would want to exclude them from joining. Alternatively, it is possible that dispersal represents a response to specific environmental stresses that requires at least part of a population to flee. Clearly, the mechanism must provide a selective advantage to the bacterium, so examining the fitness benefit of cells harboring the dispersal mechanism versus those that do not, as well as the cues that induce dispersal activity, may ultimately reveal details of this understudied aspect of the lifestyle of P. aeruginosa. The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article."

Plasmodium falciparum is the most severe and prevalent malaria parasite, and about 228 million malaria cases were reported in 2018 (https://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report/en/). With increased investments in malaria elimination programs and therapeutic interventions, the worldwide malaria burden started declining. However, the emergence of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum toward most currently available drugs including artemisinin-based combination therapies is of great concern (1Dondorp A.M. Nosten F.

Five major species of Plasmodium that can infect humans are P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi, of which the P. falciparum is the most virulent species that causes cerebral malaria with high chances of mortality (3Snow R.W.

Epigenetics in Plasmodium: What do we really know?.Eukaryot. Cel. 2010; 9: 1150-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum is an obligate intracellular parasite and has a complicated life cycle. Asexual development occurs inside the red blood cells (RBCs) of humans where the parasite develops through the ring, trophozoite, and multinucleated schizont stages and ruptures the RBCs to release up to 30 merozoites that can further invade new RBCs and continue their development (5Soulard V.

Plasmodium falciparum full life cycle and Plasmodium ovale liver stages in humanized mice.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 1-9Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The parasite uses various regulatory mechanisms for the completion of its life cycle to survive inside RBCs. The gene regulatory mechanisms are regulated in an intriguing and complex way as the P. falciparum adapts to the multiple stages during its development.

However, another study has reported that DNMT2, a DNA methyltransferase homolog in P. falciparum 3D7 preferably methylate the tRNA aspartic acid (15Govindaraju G. Jabeena C.A. Sethumadhavan D.V.

Thus, it implies that the chromatin modifications and nucleosome dynamics are the key in the regulation of stage-specific differential gene expression in P. falciparum (16Silberhorn E. Schwartz U.

The differences in nucleosome dynamics contribute to the chromatin structures that are associated with the transcriptional activity of several invasion genes (17Kensche P.R. Hoeijmakers W.A.M.

The nucleosome landscape of Plasmodium falciparum reveals chromatin architecture and dynamics of regulatory sequences.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 2110-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was proposed that extremely high AT content (81%) in the genome can affect the proper positioning of nucleosomes in P. falciparum (16Silberhorn E. Schwartz U. Löffler P. Schmitz S.

However, reports have shown that nucleosome dynamics of the parasite in RBC stages are not majorly mediated by AT-rich genome or through histone variants (18Lu X.M. Bunnik E.M. Pokhriyal N.

This strongly implies that the formation of functional chromatin structure may require extranucleosomal positioning signals viz locus-specific methylation, acetylation on the histone proteins to achieve the successful chromatin organization in P. falciparum (20Batugedara G.

The dynamic distribution of methyl marks and its functional readout through epigenetic methyl binding proteins are essential to maintain the proper chromatin structure as well as to regulate the precise gene expression. It is known that “histone tail” modifications are essential in recruiting effector proteins, whereas “histone core” modifications are essentially involved in the regulation of nucleosome dynamics (22Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Regulated nucleosome mobility and the histone code.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The globular domain methylations of histone proteins viz H3K56, H3R42, H3K79, H4K91, and histone 3 at lysine 64 (H3K64) are known to play major roles in gene suppression in mammals (23Tessarz P.

H3K64 trimethylation marks heterochromatin and is dynamically remodeled during developmental reprogramming.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 777Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reports had shown that the trimethylation at lysine 64 on histone 3 (H3K64me3) mark is enriched in the pericentric heterochromatin, repeat sequences, and transcriptionally repressed regions (24Daujat S. Weiss T. Mohn F. Lange U.C. Ziegler-Birling C. Zeissler U. Lappe M. Schübeler D. Torres-Padilla M.E. Schneider R.

Dissecting the role of H3K64me3 in mouse pericentromeric heterochromatin.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In humans, unlike histone tail modifications, which regulate the gene expression at the DNA level, the globular domain modifications help in nucleosome dynamics and thereby modulating chromatin plasticity (22Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Regulated nucleosome mobility and the histone code.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The previous reports have shown that epigenetic modifications are involved in stage-specific gene expression in P. falciparum (6Chaal B.K. Gupta A.P. Wastuwidyaningtyas B.D. Luah Y. Bozdech Z.

However, the role of histone core modifications in not studied so far. Here, we report on the histone lysine methylation mark on the lateral surface of H3K64 in P. falciparum. Using various biochemical assays, we have identified that PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes methylate at H3K64 with PfSET5, showing more activity toward the 64th lysine of the histone H3 subunit than PfSET4 protein. Both the enzymes prefer nucleosome as a substrate and do not methylate free histone 3 protein. The structural characterization of PfSET5 has identified that the enzyme forms the dimer to recognize nucleosome substrates. We found that the H3K64me3 mark is enriched in the ring and trophozoite stages and reduced in the multinucleated schizont stages of P. falciparum. The global chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing analysis has identified that the H3K64me3 mark is reduced on the genes of exported proteins in the schizont stage of P. falciparum. We observed an inverse correlation of expression of the exported family of proteins to the deposition of the H3K64me3 mark in the RBC stages of P. falciparum. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence on the dynamic association of the H3K64me3 mark with the subsets of genes that encode for exported proteins and might potentially involve in regulation of gene expression in P. falciparum. The unique methylation marks on the H3 subunit were identified in the acid-extracted histone proteins (H3, H2B, H2A, and H4) isolated from the trophozoite stage of parasite culture and separated on 16% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The Coomassie Blue–stained gel band corresponding to the H3 subunit (around 16 kDa) was excised and subjected to MS analysis. Subsequently, the acquired raw data were subjected to database search using MASCOT for protein identification. Mass spectrum of the peptides shows the mass shift of 43 Da in the modified peptide, which further validated the presence of trimethyl groups (Figs. 1B and S1). The P. falciparum encodes H3 protein and its variant H3.3, of which the variant H3.3 demarcates euchromatic coding and subtelomeric regions of P. falciparum (26Fraschka S.A. Henderson R.W. Bártfai R. H3.3 demarcates GC-rich coding and subtelomeric regions and serves as potential memory mark for virulence gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 31965Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The identified H3K64me3 modified peptide matches to both H3 and H3.3 proteins, and the present study focus only on H3. The immunoblot analysis of histone proteins extracted from P. falciparum with anti-H3K64me3 antibody further confirmed the presence of the methyl mark on the H3 subunit of the parasite (Fig. 1C). The specificity of the H3K64me3 mark antibody was verified using a dot blot assay with synthetic peptides containing various methylation marks (Fig. S2; Supplementary File 1, sheet 6). To rule out the possibility of in vitro culture–adapted acquisition of the H3K64me3 mark, we validated the presence of the H3K64me3 mark on histone proteins extracted from fresh clinical isolates of P. falciparum (Fig. 1D), which strongly suggests the physiological relevance of the H3K64me3 mark in P. falciparum. To locate the H3K64me3 position in the nucleosome, we have analyzed the human nucleosome structure (Protein Data Bank [PDB] # 2CV5) and found that lysine 64 (K64) is located on the lateral surface of the H3 subunit and resides near to the DNA contact point (Fig. 1E). It is reported that the structure of the nucleosome in P. falciparum is found to be dynamic throughout its development inside the RBCs (17Kensche P.R. Hoeijmakers W.A.M. Toenhake C.G. Bras M. Chappell L. Berriman M. Bártfai R. The nucleosome landscape of Plasmodium falciparum reveals chromatin architecture and dynamics of regulatory sequences.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 2110-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), thus the possibility of trimethylation at H3K64 may directly or indirectly contribute to this process as the methyl mark resides very close to the DNA contact point in the nucleosome. The earlier report identified that H3K64me3 functions as a repressor methyl mark in mammals (24Daujat S. Weiss T. Mohn F. Lange U.C. Ziegler-Birling C. Zeissler U. Lappe M. Schübeler D. Torres-Padilla M.E. Schneider R. H3K64 trimethylation marks heterochromatin and is dynamically remodeled during developmental reprogramming.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Dissecting the role of H3K64me3 in mouse pericentromeric heterochromatin.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the H3K64me3-specific methyltransferases are not identified to date in any of the eukaryotes, but it was reported that knockdown of Suv39H1, a well-known H3K9 methyltransferase, leads to the reduction of the H3K64me3 mark and proposed that Suv39H1 could methylate both H3K9 and H3K64 in mammals because of conservation of the RK motif in both positions on the H3 substrate (24Daujat S. Weiss T. Mohn F. Lange U.C. Ziegler-Birling C. Zeissler U. Lappe M. Schübeler D. Torres-Padilla M.E. Schneider R. H3K64 trimethylation marks heterochromatin and is dynamically remodeled during developmental reprogramming.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 777Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To identify the H3K64 methyltransferases in the malaria parasite, we cloned, expressed, and purified 9 SET (Su (var) 3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, and Trithorax) domains from P. falciparum as glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant proteins (Fig. S3, A and B). We tested the enzymatic activity using tritiated SAM as a cofactor and found that all the 9 SET domains were active on P. falciparum nucleosome substrates (Fig. 2A). Although all the purified Plasmodium falciparum Su (var) 3-9, Enhancer (PfSET) enzymes are active on the mononucleosome, this radiolabeling methylation assay would not provide the exact target lysine that gets methylated on histone proteins. To identify the PfSET enzymes that methylate at the H3K64 position, we used synthetic mononucleosome without any post-translational modifications for enzyme assays (EpiCypher) and the quality of the nucleosome was verified using 16% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. S3C). The methylation assay was performed with PfSET enzymes using nonradiolabeled SAM as a cofactor followed by immunoblotting with the anti-H3K64me3 antibody. The results have identified that PfSET4 and PfSET5 preferentially methylated at the H3K64 position (Fig. 2, B and C), of which the PfSET5 enzyme shows strong activity toward H3K64 when compared with the PfSET4 enzyme. We also observed a weak signal with PfSET3-methylated nucleosome, which is known to methylate at H3K9 in P. falciparum (27Cui L. Fan Q. Cui L. Miao J. Histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in Plasmodium falciparum.Int. J. Parasitol. 2008; 38: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This may be due to the conservation of the RK motif at K9 and K64 positions in the histone 3 proteins (Fig. S4). Furthermore, we performed the methylation assay for PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes with the synthetic mononucleosomes and immunoblotted with the anti-H3K9me3 antibody. We observed that both enzymes do not methylate at the H3K9 position, rather they methylate at 64th lysine residue of the H3 subunit (Fig. 2D). Also, we have identified that the PfSET3 enzyme methylates only H3K9 and does not methylate H3K64, which suggest that PfSET4 and PfSET5 are the two enzymes evolved to methylate a target lysine (64th lysine residue of H3) and do not have the cross enzymatic activity to H3K9 residue of H3 in P. falciparum (Fig. 2D). As H3K64 resides very proximal to the DNA contact in the nucleosome, we tested the substrate selectivity of PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes. The radiolabeling assays on various substrates have clearly shown that both PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes selectively methylate nucleosome substrates, but do not methylate free histone substrates (Fig. 2, E and F) (Fig. S5). This suggests that H3K64 methyltransferases prefer an intact nucleosome as the substrate to successfully methylate the target K64 on histone 3 subunits in P. falciparum. The PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzyme activities were verified using various synthetic histone peptides (Supplementary File 2, sheet 6). In vitro peptide methylation assay for various target lysine peptides (H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, H3K64, and H3K64A peptides) with PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes followed by the dot blot assay with the anti-H3K64me3 antibody was performed. The results showed that both enzymes prefer to methylate at H3K64 peptides (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, we performed methylation with H3K9 and H3K36 peptides for PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes, followed by dot blot with anti-H3K9me3 and anti-H3K36me3 antibodies, which revealed that these enzymes do not prefer to methylate at H3K9 and H3K36 peptides (Fig. 3C). To substantiate our results, we performed a methylation assay for both proteins with H3K64 WT and H3K64A mutant peptides using tritiated SAM as a cofactor, and the methylated peptides were separated on any kD PAGE gel. The autoradiography image confirms that PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes methylate at H3K64 and mutating the K64 to alanine in the substrate peptide leads to complete reduction of the enzyme activity by PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes (Fig. 3D). The possible reason for methylation of the PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes on the peptides rather than histone proteins might be due to the small size and easy accessibility of the peptides to the active sites of these enzymes. Thus, the biochemical assay confirms that the PfSET4 and PfSET5 enzymes methylate at H3K64 and do not methylate at K9 and K36 on histone 3 proteins. The nucleosome-specific activity of PfSET4 and PfSET5 on H3K64 is exciting as these two proteins do not methylate free histone protein. Particularly, it is interesting to note that PfSET5 is a small protein consisting of 178 amino acids that harbor an SET domain and does not contain any regulatory domains (Fig. S3A). To address the mechanisms of nucleosome specificity by PfSET5, we used the X-ray crystal structure deposited by Structural Genomics Consortium, and the resolution of the X-ray crystal structure of PfSET5 is 2.4 Å (PDB # 4RZ0) (28Jiang, D. Q., Tempel, W., Loppnau, P., Graslund, S., He, H., Ravichandran, M., Seitova, A., Arrowsmith, C. H., Edwards, A. M., Bountra, C., Hui, R., Hutchinson, A., Lin, Y. H., Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC). CRystal Structure of Plasmodium falciparum putative histone methyltransferase PFL0690c. Deposited: 2014-12-17 Released: 2015-01-21.Google Scholar). The available PfSET5 crystal structure in the PDB portal lacks significant loops in the structure, and the missing loops in the protein were modeled as described in the Experimental procedures section to generate the complete structure of PfSET5 protein. The structural data show that PfSET5 forms a dimer with two monomer subunits facing opposite directions (Fig. 4A). To get mechanistic insights on how the PfSET5 dimer protein interacts with the nucleosome substrate, we performed molecular docking analysis of PfSET5 with nucleosome structure to identify the potential interface on PfSET5 that mediates its interaction with the nucleosome. The molecular docking analysis has shown that PfSET5 interacts with DNA on the nucleosome using both monomer subunits (Fig. 4B). The surface potential analysis has identified that the PfSET5 dimer forms basic amino acid patches that mediate the interaction of the protein to the negatively charged DNA on the nucleosome (Fig. 4C). The amino acids K64, R73, and K114 of PfSET5 protein are the key three basic amino acids that form basic patches to interact with the negatively charged DNA structure on nucleosome (Fig. 4C). We hypothesized that mutating the positively charged amino acids to negatively charged amino acids in PfSET5 could reduce the protein interaction with the negatively charged nucleosome structure. To test this, we have mutated the lysine and arginine amino acids in the basic patches to glutamic acid in PfSET5, which confirmed the presence of the right mutation by Sanger sequencing. The PfSET5 mutant proteins were expressed and purified with the quality equivalent to that of the WT protein (Fig. S6). The methylation assay with the nucleosome using mutant PfSET5 enzymes revealed a significant reduction in methylation activity of PfSET5 K64E mutant enzyme on the nucleosome substrate (Fig. 4D). The other two mutant proteins did not show any changes with methyltransferase activity (Fig. 4D). This suggests the K64 in PfSET5 proteins might involve in the interaction with the nucleosome substrate. It is possible that upon binding to the nucleosome substrate, the PfSET5 protein may undergo conformational changes to reach the target lysine at the 64th position of the H3 subunit. The structural changes could be potentially due to the reorganization of the disordered charged loops missing in the crystal structure (residues 57–76 and 104–113 in 4RZ0) harboring K64 that display a drastic reduction in methylation upon charge reversal mutation. To address this, we performed a methylation assay with DNase-treated nucleosome as the substrate that removes the DNA from the core nucleosome and performed methylation assay with WT PfSET5 enzyme. We observed reduced methylation activity of PfSET5 enzyme on DNase-treated mononucleosome than with the undigested mononucleosome substrates, which strongly suggest that intact nucleosome and hence the negative potential around the DNA is essential to methylate at H3K64 by PfSET5 WT enzyme (Fig. 4E). Overall, our results identified two enzymes PfSET4 and PfSET5 from P. falciparum methylate at H3K64 on the nucleosome substrates. The chromatin architecture of P. falciparum is dynamic throughout its intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) stages, which may regulate the stage-specific differential gene expression that helps the parasite to develop and survive inside the host. Because the H3K64 resides at the DNA contact point of the histone, we hypothesized that this unconventional methyl mark could be dynamically deposited in various developmental stages of P. falciparum. To address this, we examined the levels of the H3K64me3 mark on the H3 protein extracted from synchronous P. falciparum culture. We observed the enrichment of the H3K64me3 mark in the ring and trophozoite stages, whereas a significant reduction of the H3K64me3 mark in the multinucleated schizont stage is observed (Fig. 5A). The immunoblot for H3 control protein both on the blot and off blot has remained the same throughout all three stages of P. falciparum (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we investigated the levels of other well-reported gene repressor methyl marks on H3 protein viz H3K9me3 and H3K36me3, and we did not observe any changes in their levels as P. falciparum develops inside RBCs (Fig. 5A). The relative quantification of the H3K64me3 mark intensity to"

While there is an increasing number of studies yielding support for reciprocal influences between self-esteem and perceived conflict in romantic relationships, longitudinal transactions between these constructs from both partners’ perspectives have not been studied systematically to date. Our aim was to close this gap. To that end, we examined the transactional and longitudinal interplay between self-esteem and perceived relationship conflict in continuing romantic couples from a dyadic perspective. Our sample consisted of N = 1,093 young adult female–male relationships from the German Family Panel. Individuals’ self-esteem, perceived conflict frequency, and their perceptions of their partners’ dysfunctional conflict styles (i.e., unconstructive behavior, withdrawal) were examined annually throughout a time span of five years. Based on dyadic bivariate latent change models, we tested our assumption that self-esteem and aspects of perceived relationship conflict are negatively interrelated within individuals and between partners both within and across time. We found one actor effect of self-esteem on changes in unconstructive behavior above and beyond initial unconstructive behavior levels, supporting self-broadcasting perspectives. Moreover, we found strong support for sociometer perspectives. Actor effects highlighted the importance of perceived conflict frequency for subsequent self-esteem changes. In addition, perceived conflict styles affected both partners’ self-esteem. The results imply that perceiving conflict is a between-person process, and might be more important for the development of self-esteem than vice versa."

In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of the flocculants/coagulants chitosan, Moringa oleifera seed (MOS), and poly-aluminium chloride (PAC) in settling cyanobacterial species present in the Legedadi Reservoir. We also tested whether coagulant-treated reservoir water promotes cyanobacteria growth. Our data showed that suspended solids in the turbid reservoir acted as ballast, thereby enhancing settling and hence the removal of cyanobacterial species coagulated with chitosan, Moringa oleifera seed, or their combination. Compared to other coagulants, MOS of 30 mg/L concentration, with the removal efficiency of 93.6%, was the most effective in removing cyanobacterial species without causing cell lysis. Contrary to our expectation, PAC was the least effective coagulant. Moreover, reservoir water treated with MOS alone or MOS combined with chitosan did not support any growth of cyanobacteria during the first two weeks of the experiment. Our data indicate that the efficacy of a flocculant/coagulant in the removal of cyanobacteria is influenced by the uniqueness of individual lakes/reservoirs, implying that mitigation methods should consider the unique characteristic of the lake/reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W3155218680,"Objectives Physician encounters with patients with type 2 diabetes act as motivation for self-management and lifestyle adjustments that are indispensable for diabetes treatment. We elucidate the sociodemographic sources of variation in encounter usage and the impact of encounter usage on glucose control, which can be used to recommend encounter usage for different sociodemographic strata of patients to reduce risks from Type 2 diabetes. Data and methods We analyzed data from a multi-facility clinic in the Midwestern United States on 2124 patients with type 2 diabetes, from 95 ZIP codes. A zero-inflated Poisson model was used to estimate the effects of various ZIP-code level sociodemographic variables on the encounter usage. A multinomial logistic regression model was built to estimate the effects of physical and telephonic encounters on patients’ glucose level transitions. Results from the two models were combined in marginal effect analyses. Results and conclusions Conditional on patients’ clinical status, demographics, and insurance status, significant inequality in patient encounters exists across ZIP codes with varying sociodemographic characteristics. One additional physical encounter in a six-month period marginally increases the probability of transition from a diabetic state to a pre-diabetic state by 4.3% and from pre-diabetic to the non-diabetic state by 3.2%. Combined marginal effect analyses illustrate that a ZIP code in the lower quartile of high school graduate percentage among all ZIP codes has 1 fewer physical encounter per six months marginally compared to a ZIP code at the upper quartile, which gives 5.4% average increase in the probability of transitioning from pre-diabetic to diabetic. Our results suggest that policymakers can target particular patient groups who may have inadequate encounters to engage in diabetes care, based on their immediate environmental sociodemographic characteristics, and design programs to increase their encounters to achieve better care outcomes."
