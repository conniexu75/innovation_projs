ZIKV infection mostly causes mild disease, but in some patients, nervous system involvement is indicated. A particular worry is an observed correlation between infection of mothers in the first trimester of pregnancy and microcephaly in newborns. Garcez et al. tested the effects of ZIKV compared with dengue virus infection on human neural stem cells grown as organoids. ZIKV targeted the human brain cells, reduced their size and viability in vitro, and caused programmed cell death responses. Science , this issue p. 816"
https://openalex.org/W2321369117,"A key feature of inflammation is the timely recruitment of leukocytes, including monocytes, from blood into tissues, the latter maturing into macrophages over a period of 2-3 days. Using multi-channel spinning disk microscopy, we identified a rapid pathway of macrophage recruitment into an injured organ via a non-vascular route requiring no maturation from monocytes. In response to a sterile injury in liver, a reservoir of fully mature F4/80(hi)GATA6(+) peritoneal cavity macrophages rapidly invaded into afflicted tissue via direct recruitment across the mesothelium. The invasion was dependent on CD44 and DAMP molecule ATP and resulted in rapid replication and switching of macrophage toward an alternatively activated phenotype. These macrophages dismantled the nuclei of necrotic cells releasing DNA and forming a cover across the injury site. Rapid invasion of mature macrophages from body cavity with capacity for induction of reparative phenotype may impact altered tissues ranging from trauma to infections to cancer. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2333286569,"Sean Whalen and colleagues present a computational method, TargetFinder, for reconstructing three-dimensional regulatory landscapes using one-dimensional genomic features. TargetFinder identifies the minimal set of features necessary to predict individual interacting enhancer–promoter pairs and accurately distinguishes them from non-interacting pairs. Discriminating the gene target of a distal regulatory element from other nearby transcribed genes is a challenging problem with the potential to illuminate the causal underpinnings of complex diseases. We present TargetFinder, a computational method that reconstructs regulatory landscapes from diverse features along the genome. The resulting models accurately predict individual enhancer–promoter interactions across multiple cell lines with a false discovery rate up to 15 times smaller than that obtained using the closest gene. By evaluating the genomic features driving this accuracy, we uncover interactions between structural proteins, transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, and transcription that together distinguish interacting from non-interacting enhancer–promoter pairs. Most of this signature is not proximal to the enhancers and promoters but instead decorates the looping DNA. We conclude that complex but consistent combinations of marks on the one-dimensional genome encode the three-dimensional structure of fine-scale regulatory interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2314176140,"The estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and forkhead box protein 1 (FoxA1) are significant factors in breast cancer progression. FoxA1 has been implicated in establishing ER-binding patterns though its unique ability to serve as a pioneer factor. However, the molecular interplay between ER, GR, and FoxA1 requires further investigation. Here we show that ER and GR both have the ability to alter the genomic distribution of the FoxA1 pioneer factor. Single-molecule tracking experiments in live cells reveal a highly dynamic interaction of FoxA1 with chromatin in vivo. Furthermore, the FoxA1 factor is not associated with detectable footprints at its binding sites throughout the genome. These findings support a model wherein interactions between transcription factors and pioneer factors are highly dynamic. Moreover, at a subset of genomic sites, the role of pioneer can be reversed, with the steroid receptors serving to enhance binding of FoxA1."

Our study underlines the importance of measuring the dynamics of key players in response to chemotherapy to determine mechanisms of resistance and optimize the timing of combination therapy. Chemotherapy resistance remains a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment. Considerable effort has been put forward to understand mechanisms of resistance in order to disrupt them and improve patient outcomes. In many cases, resistance has been linked to specific mutations in a subset of tumor cells, allowing them to survive chemotherapy treatment (Holohan et al., 2013Holohan C. Van Schaeybroeck S.

Investigations into isogenic populations of tumor cells reveal that resistance also emerges through non-genetic mechanisms, often through stochastic fluctuations in key factors in response to the drug (Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.A.

For many cancer types, the p53 transcription factor is a key player in the cellular response to DNA damage induced by chemotherapy (Figure 1A) (Vazquez et al., 2008Vazquez A. Bond E.E. Levine A.J. Bond G.L. The genetics of the p53 pathway, apoptosis and cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). DNA-damaging agents disrupt the interaction between p53 and its transcriptional target and negative regulator Mdm2, leading to stabilization of p53 (Haupt et al., 1997Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Mdm2 promotes the rapid degradation of p53.Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar). Increased abundance of p53 triggers the transcription of multiple genes in various downstream programs, including apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest (Riley et al., 2008Riley T. Sontag E. Chen P. Levine A. Transcriptional control of human p53-regulated genes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested a threshold mechanism where the choice between alternative programs depends upon p53 protein levels (Chen et al., 1996Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. p53 levels, functional domains, and DNA damage determine the extent of the apoptotic response of tumor cells.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, Kracikova et al., 2013Kracikova M.

A threshold mechanism mediates p53 cell fate decision between growth arrest and apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In these models, low levels of p53 trigger cell-cycle arrest and high levels of p53 lead to apoptosis. In addition, p53’s affinity for different target genes was shown to depend on the presence of specific transcriptional co-factors or post-translational modifications (Das et al., 2007Das S. Raj L.

Acetylation is indispensable for p53 activation.Cell. 2008; 133: 612-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that the dynamics of p53 play a role in the specificity of the response with pulsed p53 favoring DNA repair and cell-cycle arrest genes and sustained p53 triggering activation of senescence and apoptotic genes (Batchelor et al., 2011Batchelor E. Loewer A. Mock C. Lahav G. Stimulus-dependent dynamics of p53 in single cells.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 488Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, Purvis et al., 2012Purvis J.E. Karhohs K.W. Mock C. Batchelor E. Loewer A. Lahav G. p53 dynamics control cell fate.Science. 2012; 336: 1440-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The variation in p53 dynamics between individual cells and the potential effect of such variation on the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy has not been explored. Here, we studied the role of p53 dynamics in the fractional killing response to chemotherapy drugs with a focus on cisplatin. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug that forms both inter and intra-strand DNA crosslinks as well as protein-DNA crosslinks that are highly toxic to rapidly dividing cancer cells (Kelland, 2007Kelland L. The resurgence of platinum-based cancer chemotherapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (3648) Google Scholar). Human colon cancer cells treated with intermediate doses of cisplatin show a heterogeneous response; a fraction of cells die while others enact cell-cycle arrest (Figure 1B) (Berndtsson et al., 2007Berndtsson M. Hägg M. Panaretakis T. Havelka A.M. Shoshan M.C. Linder S. Acute apoptosis by cisplatin requires induction of reactive oxygen species but is not associated with damage to nuclear DNA.Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By quantifying p53 levels in single cells treated with cisplatin, we found a strong link between apoptosis and the dynamics of p53. Specifically, apoptotic cells accumulated p53 earlier and faster than surviving cells. Our analysis revealed that cells must reach a critical threshold level of p53 in order to enact apoptosis and this threshold increases with time following drug treatment. We further showed that the increase in the apoptotic threshold over time is not due to diminished p53 activity but instead is linked to the upregulation of genes in the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family. LCL-161, a small molecule that inhibits IAP proteins and is currently under clinical trials, significantly abolished the increase in the p53 apoptotic threshold with time. Increased IAP expression inhibits two separate apoptotic pathways that are differentiated by their dependence on caspase-8/Rip1. Our work points to p53 dynamics as a critical node underlying resistance to cisplatin and highlights the importance of studying individual cell behaviors for designing efficient drug combinations. We developed a system to measure p53 dynamics and cell fate in single human colon cancer cells (HCT116) following cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin was previously shown to induce p53-dependent apoptosis in HCT116 cells (Berndtsson et al., 2007Berndtsson M. Hägg M. Panaretakis T. Havelka A.M. Shoshan M.C. Linder S. Acute apoptosis by cisplatin requires induction of reactive oxygen species but is not associated with damage to nuclear DNA.Int. J.

Cisplatin causes cell death via TAB1 regulation of p53/MDM2/MDMX circuitry.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1739-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We created an isogenic HCT116 p53 Venus knock-in cell line (p53-VKI), in which one allele of TP53 is tagged with a Venus fluorescent protein at the C terminus of exon 11 (Figure 1C). The other allele of TP53 is wild-type and unaltered. We verified that p53-Venus levels mimicked induction of endogenous p53, indicating that the Venus tag does not alter the regulation of p53 dynamics in response to cisplatin (Figure 1D). In addition, survival curves revealed that parental HCT116 and p53-VKI cells show a similar dose-dependent decrease in viability in response to cisplatin (Figures 1E and S1A) indicating that Venus-tagged p53 does not alter p53 activity in response to cisplatin. We treated HCT116 p53-VKI cells with cisplatin and measured nuclear p53-Venus levels and cellular outcomes (apoptosis or survival) in single cells (Figure 1F). Cells were tracked for 72 hr as apoptotic events had largely ceased by this time (Figures S1A and S1B). Cells that did not die enacted cell-cycle arrest (Figures 1F, S1E, and S1F). We observed induction of p53 in both apoptotic and surviving cells, yet there was substantial heterogeneity in the levels, rate, and timing of p53 induction between cells (Figures 1F and S1C). To determine what features of p53 dynamics are associated with apoptosis, we extracted multiple parameters from the p53 trajectory of each cell and compared these parameters between apoptotic and surviving cells (Figure 2A). We initially focused on 12.5 μM cisplatin as this provided equal population sizes of apoptotic and surviving cells in our experimental system (Figure S1D). We found that maximum p53 levels did not differ between apoptotic and surviving cells (Figure 2B), suggesting that cell death is not simply determined by a fixed p53 threshold. Time-integrated p53 was also not associated with cell death (Figure 2C). In fact, surviving cells showed higher integrated levels of p53 than apoptotic cells. This is likely because p53 traces of surviving cells last longer than traces of apoptotic cells (Figure S2A).Figure S2Apoptotic Cells Accumulate p53 Faster Than Surviving Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Histogram of the percentile rank of integrated p53 levels for each apoptotic cell at the time of death when compared to every other surviving cell at the same time.(B) Histogram showing p53 levels of single cells before cisplatin treatment.

N.S. not significant (p > 0.05). The rate of p53 accumulation was associated with cell death. Apoptotic cells showed a faster accumulation of p53 than surviving cells (Figure 2D) and a shorter time to reach half-maximal p53 levels (Figure 2E). This difference in rate was strongly reflected in the time it took for p53 to reach 2 SD above its basal levels (Figures 2A and 2F). By this measure, apoptotic cells accumulate p53 significantly earlier than cells that survived cisplatin treatment (Figure 2F). We refer to this metric as “p53 onset” and use it to describe the time of p53 induction throughout this paper. In agreement with our previous work (Loewer et al., 2010Loewer A. Batchelor E. Gaglia G. Lahav G. Basal dynamics of p53 reveal transcriptionally attenuated pulses in cycling cells.Cell. 2010; 142: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), ∼12% of cells show high basal levels of p53 before cisplatin treatment (Figure S2B). To test the role of these cells in contributing to the correlation between early p53 induction and cell death, we removed them from our dataset and re-analyzed the metrics in Figure 2A. This analysis revealed similar trends as the complete dataset (Figures S2C–S2G), suggesting that cells with high basal levels of p53 are not responsible for the differences between apoptotic and surviving cells. To investigate the effect of cisplatin dose on p53 onset, we treated cells with half and double the IC50 concentration of cisplatin (Figures 2G–2I). Cells treated with a low concentration of cisplatin showed a later p53 onset and a decreased amount of cell death (Figures 2G and 2J), while a higher cisplatin concentration led to an earlier p53 onset and more cell death (Figures 2I and 2J). For all concentrations tested, apoptotic cells did not have higher maximum or integrated p53 levels, but did accumulate p53 earlier than surviving cells (Figures S2H–S2J). Similar trends were found in response to two other chemotherapy drugs, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin and the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (Figure S3), suggesting that the correlation between early induction of p53 and cell death is not limited to cisplatin but rather general to other DNA damaging drugs. To further explore the correlation between the timing of p53 accumulation and cell fate, we combined p53 traces from all three doses of cisplatin into a viability matrix that calculates the percentage of apoptotic cells given the time in which cells accumulated different levels of p53 (Figures 2K and 2L). To do this, we broke up each p53 trace into 5-hr time intervals. Within each time interval, we binned cells according to integrated p53 levels and determined what percentage of cells in each bin died in response to cisplatin. The resultant viability matrix shows the percentage of apoptotic cells given a specific range of p53 levels (y axis) and the time that cells reached that level (x axis). The matrix shows that within each time interval, cells with higher levels of p53 are more likely to die than cells with lower levels of p53 (Figure 2K). In addition, within each p53 level interval, cells that reached that level earlier had a higher probability of apoptosis. These data show that a cell’s probability of death depends on both the timing and levels of p53 induction. These results led us to propose that p53 must reach a critical threshold level in order to trigger apoptosis and that this threshold increases with time after cisplatin treatment. Therefore, cells that accumulate p53 slower must reach higher levels of p53 in order to induce apoptosis. Consistent with this, we found a positive correlation between the time of death and the integrated p53 levels of apoptotic cells (Pearson’s R = 0.54; Figure S2K). In order to visualize how the p53 apoptotic threshold changes over time, we sought to plot a threshold that most accurately separates the apoptotic and surviving cells. To do this, we performed a logistic regression analysis on each time window of the viability matrix in Figure 2K. We then used this data to assess the level of p53 required in each time window for at least 75% of cells to die (Figure 2L). This analysis produced a threshold that increases with time and has an accuracy of 70% (Figure 2L). Fixed threshold models performed poorly in comparison to an increasing threshold (Figure S3M). Although some reached accuracies of ∼54%, they used an arbitrarily low threshold that maximizes true positives at the expense of true negatives. Linear thresholds that maximized both true positives and true negatives were only ∼40% accurate (Figure S3N). Note that while an increasing threshold more accurately predicts cell death than a fixed threshold, there is still an overlap in p53 dynamics in surviving and apoptotic cells (Figures 2K and 2L). This is likely due to fluctuations in other cellular factors that control apoptosis in response to DNA damage (e.g., Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.A. Eden E. Issaeva I. Sigal A. Milo R. Liron Y. Kam Z. Cohen L. Danon T. Perzov N. et al.Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug.Science. 2008; 322: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We experimentally tested the increasing threshold model by accelerating the rate of p53 accumulation at different times post cisplatin treatment and measuring the effect on cell fate (Figure S4). Acceleration of p53 was achieved using Nutlin-3, a small molecule that stabilizes p53 without further inducing DNA damage (Vassilev et al., 2004Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. et al.In vivo activation of the p53 pathway by small-molecule antagonists of MDM2.Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3784) Google Scholar). Addition of Nutlin-3 to cells early in the response (5 hr after cisplatin treatment) led to an earlier p53 onset and to a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (Figures 3A, 3B , and S4B). Interestingly, when cells were treated with Nutlin-3 late (30 hr after cisplatin treatment), p53 reached similar maximum levels and higher integrated levels than cells treated with Nutlin-3 early (Figures 3C, 3D, and S4C). However, late acceleration of p53 had only a modest effect on cell death (Figure 3A). These experiments support a model in which the potential for p53 to enact the apoptotic program decreases with time.Figure 3Early Accumulation of p53 Increases Cell DeathShow full caption(A) Percentage of apoptotic cells for each treatment measured by time-lapse microscopy.

We first asked whether p53 target genes in different programs respond differently to the time of p53 induction. Specifically, does rapidly-induced p53 favor the induction of apoptotic genes while slow accumulation of p53 favors cell-cycle arrest genes? To test the relationship between p53 dynamics and its target genes in different programs, we created a cell line expressing reporters for PUMA, a p53 target gene in the apoptosis pathway (Nakano and Vousden, 2001Nakano K. Vousden K.H. PUMA, a novel proapoptotic gene, is induced by p53.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2001Yu J. Zhang L.

WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression.Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7916) Google Scholar). Both PUMA and p21 levels are increased by cisplatin treatment (Duale et al., 2007Duale N. Lindeman B. Komada M. Olsen A.-K. Andreassen A. Soderlund E.J. Brunborg G. Molecular portrait of cisplatin induced response in human testis cancer cell lines based on gene expression profiles.Mol. Cancer. 2007; 6: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and HCT116 PUMA−/− cells have reduced sensitivity to cisplatin (Jiang et al., 2006Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du Q. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z. Regulation of PUMA-alpha by p53 in cisplatin-induced renal cell apoptosis.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We tracked PUMA and p21 induction in single cells after cisplatin treatment and quantified their dynamics together with p53 and cell fate (Figures 4B and 4C). We found that PUMA and p21 were induced in both apoptotic and surviving cells (Figures 4D and 4E). Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between integrated p53 levels and integrated PUMA and p21 levels (Figures 4F and 4G). This suggests that p53 accumulation simply translates into PUMA and p21 induction regardless of the time of p53 activation. Indeed, we found no correlation between the time of p53 onset and the level of PUMA or p21 expression (Figures 4H and 4I). These results show that the ability of p53 to transcribe apoptotic and cell-cycle arrest genes does not change over time, suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for the increase in the p53 threshold required for apoptosis. Another possible mechanism for the increasing threshold is that cisplatin might upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins that antagonize p53-dependent apoptosis. In this scenario, slow accumulation of p53 allows time for apoptotic inhibitors to build up, compete with apoptotic genes, and prevent cell death. A buildup of apoptotic inhibitors increases the amount of p53 required to enact apoptosis. To identify putative anti-apoptotic genes that move the p53 threshold, we used a publicly available microarray dataset of HCT116 cells treated with cisplatin (Duale et al., 2007Duale N. Lindeman B. Komada M. Olsen A.-K. Andreassen A. Soderlund E.J. Brunborg G. Molecular portrait of cisplatin induced response in human testis cancer cell lines based on gene expression profiles.Mol. Cancer. 2007; 6: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We searched for genes that were significantly upregulated after cisplatin treatment (p < 0.05) and associated with negatively regulating apoptosis (GO: 0043066). This analysis revealed three genes from the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family (cIAP1, cIAP2, and ML-IAP/LIVIN). Overexpression of IAP proteins was previously shown to decrease apoptosis in response to different DNA-damaging agents (Liston et al., 1996Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S.

In addition, IAP proteins are frequently overexpressed in tumors and associated with poor patient survival and resistance to chemotherapy (Lopes et al., 2007Lopes R.B. Gangeswaran R. McNeish I.A.

We measured the fold change in gene expression for the three IAP genes identified by the search, as well as XIAP, an additional member in the IAP family. Cisplatin led to an increase in the expression of all four IAP genes tested, with cIAP2 and ML-IAP showing the strongest induction (Figure 5A). Western blots confirmed an increase in all four IAP proteins in response to cisplatin (Figures 5B and 5C). Etoposide, camptothecin, and doxorubicin also caus"

NMDAR dysfunction is directly implicated in diseases ranging from seizure to ischemia. Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about how the NMDAR transitions between inactive and active states and how small molecules inhibit or activate ion channel gating. Here, we report electron cryo-microscopy structures of the GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor in an ensemble of competitive antagonist-bound states, an agonist-bound form, and a state bound with agonists and the allosteric inhibitor Ro25-6981. Together with double electron-electron resonance experiments, we show how competitive antagonists rupture the ligand binding domain (LBD) gating ""ring,"" how agonists retain the ring in a dimer-of-dimers configuration, and how allosteric inhibitors, acting within the amino terminal domain, further stabilize the LBD layer. These studies illuminate how the LBD gating ring is fundamental to signal transduction and gating in NMDARs."

While some favor the concept of facultative progenitors involved in homeostasis and repair, neither a location nor markers for such cells have been defined. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) labels a rare population of long-lived, quiescent pancreatic cells. In vitro, Dclk1+ cells proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic inflammation. Accordingly, their loss has detrimental effects after cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Expression of mutant Kras in Dclk1+ cells does not affect their quiescence or longevity. However, experimental pancreatitis converts Kras mutant Dclk1+ cells into potent cancer-initiating cells. As a potential effector of Kras, Dclk1 contributes functionally to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these observations indicate that Dclk1 marks quiescent pancreatic progenitors that are candidates for the origin of pancreatic cancer.

Studies to date have failed to provide strong evidence for the existence of stem cells in the pancreas. Nevertheless, the pancreas displays a slow but steady cellular turnover and significant capacity for regeneration following injury. Acinar cells show a high degree of plasticity, while less plasticity has been shown for centroacinar and ductal cells, although acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) likely requires reprogramming not only within the acinar compartment but perhaps within ductal cells as well. It has not been determined whether all acinar cells have the same ability to dedifferentiate or if there is a specific subset with greater plasticity (Bailey et al., 2015Bailey J.M. Hendley A.M.

While some investigators support the notion of committed progenitors, others propose that during injury, acinar cells dedifferentiate to act as facultative progenitor cells (Kong et al., 2011Kong B.

In theory, such facultative progenitors should demonstrate considerable plasticity in response to stress (Valdez et al., 2015Valdez I.A. Teo A.K. Kulkarni R.N. Cellular stress drives pancreatic plasticity.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 273ps2Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the regenerative capacities of the pancreas could be the presence of quiescent or reserve progenitors (Li and Clevers, 2010Li L. Clevers H.

The possibility that the pancreas harbors acinar cells with a higher capacity to participate in transformation, for example facultative progenitor cells, has not been thoroughly examined, but it may have important implications for diagnosis and prevention of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Kong et al., 2011Kong B.

Hepatol. 2011; 8: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such a subpopulation of cells may not be distinguishable based upon conventional morphology but would require genetic lineage tracing. Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) has been proposed as a marker of pancreatic progenitors (May et al., 2010May R. Sureban S.M. Lightfoot S.A. Hoskins A.B. Brackett D.J. Postier R.G. Ramanujam R. Rao C.V. Wyche J.H. Anant S. Houchen C.W. Identification of a novel putative pancreatic stem/progenitor cell marker DCAMKL-1 in normal mouse pancreas.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G303-G310Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that Dclk1+ cells are involved in the development of a variety of gastrointestinal tumors. Using Dclk1 CreERT knockin mice, it has been shown that Dclk1 identifies stem-like cells within ApcMin/+ adenomas (Nakanishi et al., 2013Nakanishi Y. Seno H. Fukuoka A. Ueo T. Yamaga Y. Maruno T. Nakanishi N. Kanda K. Komekado H. Kawada M. et al.Dclk1 distinguishes between tumor and normal stem cells in the intestine.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Colonic Dclk1+ cells are long-lived and quiescent even in the setting of oncogenic mutations, but they can be activated by injury to initiate colorectal cancer (Westphalen et al., 2014Westphalen C.B. Asfaha S. Hayakawa Y. Takemoto Y. Lukin D.J. Nuber A.H. Brandtner A. Setlik W. Remotti H. Muley A. et al.Long-lived intestinal tuft cells serve as colon cancer-initiating cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 1283-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Rare Dclk1+ cells can be found in the healthy pancreas, primarily in the ductal epithelium, and are markedly increased in ADM and murine PanINs (mPanINs) (Delgiorno et al., 2014Delgiorno K.E. Hall J.C. Takeuchi K.K. Pan F.C. Halbrook C.J. Washington M.K. Olive K.P. Spence J.R. Sipos B. Wright C.V. et al.Identification and manipulation of biliary metaplasia in pancreatic tumors.Gastroenterology. 2014; 146 (e235): 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, Dclk1+ cells in preinvasive lesions and pancreatic cancer cell lines display a considerable amount of stemness (Bailey et al., 2014Bailey J.M. Alsina J. Rasheed Z.A. McAllister F.M. Fu Y.Y. Plentz R. Zhang H. Pasricha P.J. Bardeesy N. Matsui W. et al.DCLK1 marks a morphologically distinct subpopulation of cells with stem cell properties in preinvasive pancreatic cancer.Gastroenterology. 2014; 146: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, although earlier studies have suggested a role for Dclk1+ cells in PDAC development, their role in homeostasis, repair, and initiation of PDAC has not been clearly established (Kopp and Sander, 2014Kopp J.L. Sander M. New insights into the cell lineage of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: evidence for tumor stem cells in premalignant lesions?.Gastroenterology. 2014; 146: 24-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that Dclk1 labels a population of quiescent cells activated by pancreatic injury. Dclk1+ cells are largely resistant to an oncogenic Kras mutation, but they act as potent cancer-initiating cells following injury. Finally, Dclk1 gene function is involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis, as Dclk1 is a potential Kras effector protein. Dclk1 has been proposed to mark pancreatic progenitor cells (May et al., 2010May R. Sureban S.M. Lightfoot S.A. Hoskins A.B. Brackett D.J. Postier R.G. Ramanujam R. Rao C.V. Wyche J.H. Anant S.

Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G303-G310Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed lineage tracing studies using Dclk1 BAC CreERT (Dclk1 CreERT) mice (Westphalen et al., 2014Westphalen C.B. Asfaha S. Hayakawa Y. Takemoto Y. Lukin D.J. Nuber A.H. Brandtner A. Setlik W. Remotti H. Muley A. et al.Long-lived intestinal tuft cells serve as colon cancer-initiating cells.J. Clin.

In uninduced mice, uniform expression of membranous red fluorescent protein indicated absence of Cre recombinase activity at baseline (Figures S1C and S1D). Twenty-four hours post-induction with Tamoxifen, recombination was not confined to one compartment but occurred in acinar, centroacinar, and duct cells (Figures 1A–1D, Figure S1E). Immunofluorescence (IF) on Dclk1 R26-tdTomato (tdTom) mice showed uniform expression of EpCam, which marks all pancreatic epithelial cells (Khan et al., 2011Khan M.S. Tsigani T. Rashid M. Rabouhans J.S. Yu D. Luong T.V. Caplin M. Meyer T. Circulating tumor cells and EpCAM expression in neuroendocrine tumors.Clin. Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), in Dclk1-TdTomato+ cells (Figures S1F and S1G). One week after induction, flow cytometry revealed recombination in 0.1%–0.5% of pancreatic epithelial cells isolated from Dclk1 tdTom mice (Figure S1H). The majority of Dclk1-TdTomato+ cells (82%) were located in the acinar compartment, whereas ∼15% of recombination occurred in pancreatic ducts and terminal duct/centroacinar cells. Of note, a fraction of 15% recombined duct cells shows a slight enrichment of ductal cells compared to the pancreas as a whole. Recombination in islets was rare (Figure 1E). To characterize the Dclk1+ lineage, we isolated recombined cells from Dclk1 tdTom mice by flow cytometry and subjected them to RNaseq analysis. Analysis by qPCR confirmed higher levels of Dclk1 in tdTomato+ cells when compared to tdTomato− cells (Figure S1I). Both fractions (tdTomato+ and tdTomato− cells) contained a heterogeneous mix of acinar, ductal, and other cell types. We analyzed our RNaseq results and compared them to published results on pure pancreatic acinar (Krah et al., 2015Krah N.M. De La O J.P. Swift G.H. Hoang C.Q. Willet S.G. Chen Pan F. Cash G.M.

We used average counts/million ≥ 1 as a criterion (Smyth et al., 2015Smyth G.K. Ritchie M. Thorne N. Wettenhall J. Shi W. Hu Y. Limma: Linear Models for Microarray and RNA-Seq Data User’s Guide.

Both Dclk1+ and Dclk1− cells expressed 8% more genes than are expressed in acinar cells, but not ductal cells, compared to genes that are expressed in ductal cells, but not acinar cells (p = 0.0003) (Table S1 and Figures S1I–S1M), indicating that both populations were primarily acinar in composition. Thus, while the Dclk1 lineage contains both acinar and ductal cells, the acinar cells predominate as shown by gene expression as well as morphology. Pathway analysis of Dclk1-TdTomato+ versus Dclk1-TdTomato− cells (see the Supplemental Information) revealed a quiescent phenotype in Dclk1+ cells caused by significant inactivation of genes involved in cell proliferation in the Ras (Bryant et al., 2014Bryant K.L.

Confirmatory qPCR revealed differential expression of all genes tested with the exception of Fzd8 (p = 0.07) (Figures S1N–S1R). To improve identification of recombined cells and allow staining using a green fluophore, we conducted IF staining on Dclk1 tdTom mice. Very few recombined ductal and centroacinar cells stained positive for Dclk1 (Figure 1F). Ductal Dclk1-TdTomato+ cells stained positive for Cytokeratin 19 (Figure 1G) while Dclk1-TdTomato+ cells within the acinar compartment stained positive for amylase (Figure 1H). Based on morphology and the absence of Dclk1 and cytoplasmic acetylated-tubulin staining (not shown), the vast majority of recombined cells did not qualify as tuft cells. These findings of a discrepancy between Dclk1 gene expression (based on Cre recombination) and protein expression are in line with previous reports showing a paucity of Dclk1+ tuft cells in the healthy pancreas (Delgiorno et al., 2014Delgiorno K.E. Hall J.C. Takeuchi K.K. Pan F.C. Halbrook C.J. Washington M.K. Olive K.P. Spence J.R. Sipos B.

Recombined cells rarely stained positive for proliferation markers such as Ki67 and Phospho-Histone H3, and long-term lineage tracing revealed that most recombined cells persisted as single cells over 12 months (Figures 1I–1L and Figure S2H). Over longer periods of observation, we detected occasional clusters of recombined acinar cells (Figure 1M), indicative of a small degree of lineage tracing. Such clusters were rarely seen in ducts (not shown). Flow cytometry of pancreata from Dclk1 tdTom mice 1 week and 3 months post-induction revealed a small but significant expansion (∼5-fold) of recombined epithelial (Dclk1+/EpCam+) cells over 3 months (Figure 1N). Analysis of the constitutive Dclk1 BAC Cre line (Figure S1B) on postnatal day 7 (P7) revealed single acinar and ductal cells, arguing against a major role of the Dclk1+ lineage in pancreatic development (Figures 1O and 1P). 3D pancreatic spheroid cultures have been used to study the characteristics of adult pancreatic stem cells (Huch et al., 2013Huch M.

Dclk1 tdTom mice were treated with Tamoxifen and pancreatic primary cultures were established as described (Wescott et al., 2009Wescott M.P. Rovira M. Reichert M. von Burstin J. Means A. Leach S.D.

In these experiments, 10,000 cells were seeded in each well and recombined (tdTom+) cells were counted immediately after seeding. Under these conditions, Dclk1-TdTomato+ cells readily formed spheres (Figure 2A) and were roughly 70 times more efficient in forming spheres than Dclk1-TdTomato− cells, indicating a considerable degree of proliferative potential (Figure 2B). To address whether Dclk1+ cells were necessary for spheroid formation in vitro, we generated pancreatic spheres from Dclk1 CreERT;R26-DTA (Dclk1 DTA) mice, where Cre-recombination causes diphtheria-toxin-A-dependent elimination of cells expressing Dclk1 (Buch et al., 2005Buch T. Heppner F.L. Tertilt C. Heinen T.J. Kremer M. Wunderlich F.T. Jung S. Waisman A. A Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor mediates cell lineage ablation after toxin administration.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Although Dclk1+ cell were present in only a minority of spheres, 4-OH Tamoxifen (Tam) treatment 24 hr post-isolation led to a significant decrease (23% reduction) in sphere formation (Figure 2C). Sphere size did not differ between treated spheres and controls, arguing against a toxic effect of Tam (Figure S3A). To demonstrate that Dclk1-TdTomato+ cells not only initiate but also sustain organoid growth, we conducted lineage tracing of established organoids. Cells were isolated from Dclk1 tdTom mice and spheres were cultured for 3 days prior to Tamoxifen induction. Twelve hours post-induction, single TdTomato+ cells were found in a subset of organoids (Figure 2D, Figures S3B–S3D), but over time fluorescent microscopy and morphometric analysis revealed clonal expansion of these single cells, paralleling organoid growth (Figures 2D and 2E). After in vitro induction, some organoids showed uniform expression of the tdTom reporter, arguing for an upregulation of Dclk1 mRNA expression during organoid formation (Figures S3E and S3F). This is in line with a significant upregulation of Dclk1 expression in the process of acinar to ductal metaplasia (Bailey et al., 2014Bailey J.M. Alsina J. Rasheed Z.A. McAllister F.M. Fu Y.Y. Plentz R. Zhang H. Pasricha P.J. Bardeesy N.

Accordingly, when spheres generated from Dclk1 DTA mice were allowed to grow for 72 hr before treatment with Tamoxifen (Figure 2F), we observed a significant reduction in sphere numbers after 4 additional days in culture (Figure 2G). Taken together, these data indicate that Dclk1+ cells efficiently form pancreatic organoids and sustain organoid growth. Expansion of Dclk1+ tuft cells has been observed in response to tissue damage (Saqui-Salces et al., 2011Saqui-Salces M. Keeley T.M. Grosse A.S. Qiao X.T. El-Zaatari M. Gumucio D.L. Samuelson L.C.

To test if the Dclk1+ lineage responds to injurious stress, Dclk1 mTmG mice were subjected to various forms of pancreatic injury. Cerulein-induced pancreatitis led to a significant expansion (2-fold) of recombined cells over the course of 2 weeks (Figure S4E, Figures 3A–3F). As Dclk1+ cells can be found in ductal and acinar compartments, we analyzed the expansion in each compartment by scoring GFP-labeled cells and classifying them as single cells (Figures 3B and 3D, green line), doublets (Figures 3B and 3D, red line), or clones of three or more cells (Figures 3B and 3D, blue line). While there was a modest expansion of ductal clones (2-fold; Figures 3C and 3D), we observed a marked increase in clonal labeling within the acinar compartment (∼2% at day 0 versus ∼36% at day 7; Figures 3A and 3B). Control mice (Dclk1 mTmG) were induced with Tamoxifen, but not treated with cerulein, and analyzed in parallel. Furthermore, to exclude the possibilities that the Dclk1 transcript was upregulated through tissue injury or that we mistook a relative survival advantage of Dclk1+ cells as an expansion of the lineage, we treated Dclk1 mTmG mice with cerulein, waited for 24 hr, induced recombination with Tamoxifen, and analyzed animals after an additional 12 hr. In these experiments, we observed similar numbers of Dclk1+ cells to those in mice under resting conditions (Figures S4F–S4H). To investigate proliferation in Dclk1+ and Dclk1− cells, we performed Ki67 staining on sections from Dclk1 mTmG mice after cerulein treatment and scored Ki67+ cells in recombined and non-recombined cells. Seven days after cerulein treatment, Ki67+ acinar (Figure 3E) and ductal (Figure 3F) cells were significantly more frequent in the Dclk1+ compartment, arguing for a proliferative advantage of the Dclk1+ lineage. Finally, specific analysis of areas with ADM 72 hr after cerulein treatment revealed that ∼20%–40% of ADMs were at least partly traced by previously labeled Dclk1+ cells (Figures S4I and S4J). Pancreatic duct ligation led to a 50% increase in lineage tracing when compared to untreated controls (Figure 3H). Lineage tracing was analyzed in the pancreas proximal to the duodenum so we could assess compensatory growth in the pancreas not affected by pressure necrosis due to the suture. Next, we tested the effect of partial pancreatectomy. Two weeks after surgery, we observed large areas of traced exocrine tissue (Figure 3I).

Here we used the whole-genome sequences from 498 strains of M. tuberculosis to identify new resistance-conferring genotypes. By combining association and correlated evolution tests with strategies for amplifying signal from rare variants, we found that loss-of-function mutations in ald (Rv2780), encoding L-alanine dehydrogenase, were associated with unexplained drug resistance. Convergent evolution of this loss of function was observed exclusively among multidrug-resistant strains. Drug susceptibility testing established that ald loss of function conferred resistance to D-cycloserine, and susceptibility to the drug was partially restored by complementation of ald. Clinical strains with mutations in ald and alr exhibited increased resistance to D-cycloserine when cultured in vitro. Incorporation of D-cycloserine resistance in novel molecular diagnostics could allow for targeted use of this toxic drug among patients with susceptible infections."
https://openalex.org/W2321385422,"Every nucleosome across the genome must be disrupted and reformed when the replication fork passes, but how chromatin organization is re-established following replication is unknown. To address this problem, we have developed Mapping In vivo Nascent Chromatin with EdU and sequencing (MINCE-seq) to characterize the genome-wide location of nucleosomes and other chromatin proteins behind replication forks at high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that the characteristic chromatin landscape at Drosophila promoters and enhancers is lost upon replication. The most conspicuous changes are at promoters that have high levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalling and DNA accessibility and show specific enrichment for the BRM remodeler. Enhancer chromatin is also disrupted during replication, suggesting a role for transcription factor (TF) competition in nucleosome re-establishment. Thus, the characteristic nucleosome landscape emerges from a uniformly packaged genome by the action of TFs, RNAPII, and remodelers minutes after replication fork passage."

They also identify common variation at TCL1A associated with increased risk of mosaic loss of the Y chromosome. Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) leading to gonosomal XY/XO commonly occurs during aging, particularly in smokers. We investigated whether mLOY was associated with non-hematological cancer in three prospective cohorts (8,679 cancer cases and 5,110 cancer-free controls) and genetic susceptibility to mLOY. Overall, mLOY was observed in 7% of men, and its prevalence increased with age (per-year odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12–1.15; P < 2 × 10−16), reaching 18.7% among men over 80 years old. mLOY was associated with current smoking (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.82–3.03; P = 5.55 × 10−11), but the association weakened with years after cessation. mLOY was not consistently associated with overall or specific cancer risk (for example, bladder, lung or prostate cancer) nor with cancer survival after diagnosis (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.73–1.04; P = 0.12). In a genome-wide association study, we observed the first example of a common susceptibility locus for genetic mosaicism, specifically mLOY, which maps to TCL1A at 14q32.13, marked by rs2887399 (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.36–1.78; P = 1.37 × 10−10)."

The epigenetic regulation of Wnt signaling in HSCs remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the histone deacetylase SIRT6 regulates HSC homeostasis through the transcriptional repression of Wnt target genes. Sirt6 deletion promoted HSC proliferation through aberrant activation of Wnt signaling. SIRT6-deficient HSCs exhibited impaired self-renewal ability in serial competitive transplantation assay. Mechanistically, SIRT6 inhibits the transcription of Wnt target genes by interacting with transcription factor LEF1 and deacetylating histone 3 at lysine 56. Pharmacological inhibition of the Wnt pathway rescued the aberrant proliferation and functional defect in SIRT6-deficient HSCs. Taken together, these findings disclose a new link between SIRT6 and Wnt signaling in the regulation of adult stem cell homeostasis and self-renewal capacity."

Here we show that the microbiota is critical for inducing antigen-specific IgG production after intranasal immunization. After mucosal vaccination with CT, both antibiotic-treated and germ-free (GF) mice had reduced amounts of antigen-specific IgG, smaller recall-stimulated cytokine responses, impaired follicular helper T (TFH) cell responses and reduced numbers of plasma cells. Recognition of symbiotic bacteria via the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2) sensor in cells that express the integrin CD11c (encoded by Itgax) was required for the adjuvanticity of CT. Reconstitution of GF mice with a Nod2 agonist or monocolonization with Staphylococcus sciuri, which has high Nod2-stimulatory activity, was sufficient to promote robust CT adjuvant activity, whereas bacteria with low Nod2-stimulatory activity did not. Mechanistically, CT enhanced Nod2-mediated cytokine production in dendritic cells via intracellular cyclic AMP. These results show a role for the microbiota and the intracellular receptor Nod2 in promoting the mucosal adjuvant activity of CT."

First, we show that the public significantly underestimated the extent of the scientific consensus. We then find that those given concrete information about scientists’ views were more likely to report believing that climate change was already underway and that it was caused by humans. However, their beliefs about the necessity of making policy decisions and their willingness to donate money to combat climate change were not affected. Information provision affected liberals, moderates, and conservatives similarly, implying that the gap in beliefs between liberals and conservatives is not likely to be bridged by information treatments similar to the one we study. Finally, we conducted a 6-month follow-up with respondents to see if the treatment effect persisted; the results were statistically inconclusive."

We investigated a set of 20 Bacteroidia pilins from the human microbiome whose structures and mechanism of assembly were unknown. Crystal structures and biochemical data revealed a diverse protein superfamily with a common Greek-key β sandwich fold with two transthyretin-like repeats that polymerize into a pilus through a strand-exchange mechanism. The assembly mechanism of the central, structural pilins involves proteinase-assisted removal of their N-terminal β strand, creating an extended hydrophobic groove that binds the C-terminal donor strands of the incoming pilin. Accessory pilins at the tip and base have unique structural features specific to their location, allowing initiation or termination of the assembly. The Bacteroidia pilus, therefore, has a biogenesis mechanism that is distinct from other known pili and likely represents a different type of bacterial pilus."
https://openalex.org/W2333823583,"Neurons receive input from the outside world or from other neurons through neuronal receptive endings (NREs). Glia envelop NREs to create specialized microenvironments; however, glial functions at these sites are poorly understood. Here, we report a molecular mechanism by which glia control NRE shape and associated animal behavior. The C. elegans AMsh glial cell ensheathes the NREs of 12 neurons, including the thermosensory neuron AFD. KCC-3, a K/Cl transporter, localizes specifically to a glial microdomain surrounding AFD receptive ending microvilli, where it regulates K(+) and Cl(-) levels. We find that Cl(-) ions function as direct inhibitors of an NRE-localized receptor-guanylyl-cyclase, GCY-8, which synthesizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). High cGMP mediates the effects of glial KCC-3 on AFD shape by antagonizing the actin regulator WSP-1/NWASP. Components of this pathway are broadly expressed throughout the nervous system, suggesting that ionic regulation of the NRE microenvironment may be a conserved mechanism by which glia control neuron shape and function."

These BMP-driven events underlie various control mechanisms in the extracellular space that can regulate the level, positioning, and timing of BMP signals (3Umulis D. O'Connor M.B. Blair S.S. The extracellular regulation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling.Development. 2009; 136: 3715-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The most established mechanism of extracellular regulation of BMPs is represented by the concept of diffusible BMP antagonists that prevent access of BMPs to their signaling receptors and therefore effectively block BMP action (4Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Controlling TGF-β signaling.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative concept is that BMPs are targeted to extracellular scaffolds, such as fibrillin microfibrils (FMF) or collagen IV-rich networks that control and integrate BMP signaling in a context-specific manner (5Ramirez F. Rifkin D.B. Extracellular microfibrils: contextual platforms for TGFβ and BMP signaling.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Wang X. Harris R.E.

FMF are 10–12-nm diameter extracellular scaffolds that are ubiquitously found in all tissues with a characteristic “beads on a string”-like appearance when extracted and visualized by negative-stained or rotary-shadowed electron micrographs. FMF serve as template for the deposition of elastin, but they are also found as non-elastin-associated independent networks (5Ramirez F. Rifkin D.B.

Two PDs associate in a non-covalent fashion with the mature growth factor (GF), the disulfide-cross-linked C-terminal cleavage product from the precursor. In contrast to PD-GF complexes of TGF-β-1, -2, and -3 (collectively called TGF-β), BMP complexes are not always latent. For example, it could be demonstrated that BMP-9 and BMP-7 are secreted by cells in the form of complexes that display the same bioactivity in solution as the mature GFs alone (12Brown M.A. Zhao Q.

For BMP-7 complex, 9,000 particles were selected, and for BMP-7 dialyzed with fibrillin-1, 11,000 particles were selected, using a combination of manual and semiautomated picking. Following contrast transfer function correction, each data set was subjected to two-dimensional classification. For BMP-7 complex, a total of 140 projection averages were selected and used to generate an initial three-dimensional model with C2 symmetry. This model was used as a start seed for eight rounds of iterative refinement to produce a self-consistent three-dimensional structure. Resolution estimates were 35 Å using Fourier shell correlation with a cut-off value of 0.5. Modeling was performed using UCSF Chimera (26Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S.

BMP-7 PD variants were coated at 0.1 μm to Nunc MaxiSorp flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and BMP-7 GF was incubated in solution. Bound GF was detected using a polyclonal anti-BMP-7 GF antibody (500-P198, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Sandwich ELISAs were performed by coating a monoclonal anti-His6 tag antibody (clone AD1.1.10, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 1 μg/ml. BMP-7 PD variants were dialyzed together with the GF in TBS containing 1 m urea overnight followed by incubation with the coated capture antibody and detection of the GF.

BMP-7 GF was covalently coupled to CM5 sensor chips at 500 resonance units (RUs), and PD variants were flown over in HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) (BIAcore AB) containing 1 m urea. To test the PD/GF interaction at pH 4.5, 1,000 RUs of BMP-7 PD were immobilized, and 0–80 nm GF was injected in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20. For PD/PD interaction experiments, 500–800 RUs of full-length PD (residues 30–292) or truncated variants (residues 48–292 or 55–292) were immobilized on the chip, and potential self-interaction was tested by injecting 0–320 nm PD variants in HBS-EP, 1 m urea. For interaction experiments with rF87 and BMP-7 PD truncation variants, PD variants were immobilized at 500–800 RUs, and rF87 was injected at 0–80 nm in HBS-EP. For competition experiments with the BMP type II receptor, PD variants were immobilized at 500–800 RUs, and 100 nm BMP-7 GF was injected in the presence of 0–500 nm of soluble extracellular domain of BMPRII receptor (R&D Systems) followed by a subsequent 100 nm injection (“coinject” mode) of a monoclonal anti-BMP-7 GF antibody (MAB3542, R&D Systems) to detect bound GF. All injections were in HBS-EP buffer. Kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting (1:1 interaction model with mass transfer) to the association and dissociation curves according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BIAevaluation version 3.0 software). Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values) were then calculated as the ratio of kd/ka. 10 μg of BMP-7 complex dialyzed against TBS containing 0.25–4 m urea was applied to a 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient. Ultracentrifugation was carried out as described previously using a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge (13Sengle G. Ono R.N. Lyons K.M. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. A new model for GF activation: type II receptors compete with the prodomain for BMP-7.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 1025-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Each gradient was collected in 28 fractions and analyzed by Western blotting using specific anti-BMP-7 PD (mAb2 from Millipore, Billerica, MA) and GF (500-P198, Peprotech) antibodies (13Sengle G. Ono R.N. Lyons K.M. Bächinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. A new model for GF activation: type II receptors compete with the prodomain for BMP-7.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 1025-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). mAb anti-His6 (clone AD1.1.10, R&D Systems) and rF11 (both at 10 μg/ml) were adsorbed overnight to 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc). 5% milk was incubated as a blocking solution for 1 h, followed by three TBS/Tween washes and subsequent incubation with 0.5 μm BMP-7 complex in 2% milk for 2 h. To quantify the bound amounts of BMP-7 complex, the plate was incubated with stripping solution (100 μl/well of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.3) for 20 min. Each time, the contents of 96 wells were pooled and dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid overnight. This solution was lyophilized and resuspended in 50 μl of TBS. 5-μl dots were placed on a nitrocellulose membrane together with a diluted series of dots containing BMP-7 complex at known concentrations serving as a standard curve. After drying, the membrane was blocked in 5% milk and incubated with anti-BMP-7 PD antibody mAb2 (Millipore) (1 mg/ml, 1:500) for 2 h. The membrane was washed and subsequently incubated with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 2 h. After the final washes, signals were developed using the Bio-Rad Opti 4CN Substrate kit. The membrane was scanned, and signals were quantitated using ImageQuant. C2C12 cells were seeded onto plates in which quantitated amounts of BMP-7 complex had been immobilized. After 5 h, the total mRNA was immediately harvested, and mRNA expression levels of Id3, a BMP-responsive element, were monitored by real-time quantitative PCR. BMP-7 complex was added at 300 ng/ml to the medium as positive control, and BSA-coated wells served as negative control. The BMP-7 PD was modeled, using the TGF-β-1 LAP crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 3RJR) as a template, with MODELLER (32Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10511) Google Scholar) in UCSF Chimera (26Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera: a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27912) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment, generated partially with ClustalW with some manual realignment guided by CD secondary structural information, was inputted to guide homology modeling. In LAP, the first 28 amino acids form the α1-helix, but because our CD shows that the first 12 residues of BMP-7 PD are not helical, these amino acids were refined with MODELLER, and an unstructured conformation that allowed interaction between the BMP-7 PDs was selected. The structure of the BMP-7 GF (Protein Data Bank code 1BMP) was substituted for TGF-β-1 GF. A break in the peptide chain was introduced at residue Pro80 to allow the PD to be rotated into an open conformation without moving the N-terminal region. The BMP-9 complex structure (Protein Data Bank code 4YCI) and the BMP-7 complex EM map were used to guide rotation of the PD into an open conformation. To determine the shape and structure of the BMP-7 complex, we used single-particle TEM. Recombinantly expressed and affinity-purified BMP-7 complex (Fig. 1B) was negatively stained (Fig. 2A), and particles were classified using reference-free alignment (Fig. 2A) and used to calculate a three-dimensional reconstruction with 2-fold symmetry to a 35 Å resolution. The three-dimensional structure of BMP-7 complex reveals an open boomerang-shaped conformation with dimensions 13 × 9 × 5 nm (Fig. 2B) similar to the BMP-9 complex structure (33Mi L.Z. Brown C.T. Gao Y. Tian Y. Le V.Q. Walz T. Springer T.A. Structure of bone morphogenetic protein 9 procomplex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, superimposition of the BMP-9 complex at 20 Å resolution with the determined BMP-7 EM envelope suggests that the angle between the boomerang arms may be wider in BMP-9 (Fig. 2C). Independently, we determined the three-dimensional shape of the BMP-7 complex in solution using SAXS. Measurements were made at the DESY and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Fig. 3). The data quality was assessed using a Guinier plot, and the Rg obtained was 4.8 nm (Fig. 3A). Ab initio bead models were generated using the program GASBOR with 2-fold symmetry. At least 20 separate simulations were completed to determine the common structural features; the models fit the experimental data with a mean discrepancy factor χ of 0.96, and variation between the models had a mean normalized spatial discrepancy factor of 2.25. The averaged model had dimensions of 15 × 8 × 5 nm (Fig. 3E). The overall shape of the SAXS model is similar to that determined by EM, and together they show that the BMP-7 complex has an open conformation similar to the recently determined BMP-9 complex structure (33Mi L.Z.

Based on sequence homology to the TGF-β-1 PD, it was previously predicted that the N-terminal region of the BMP-7 PD forms an amphipathic α-helix containing hydrophobic residues that mediate specific interactions with the mature GF (34Shi M.

https://openalex.org/W2316949560,"The probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii has been shown to ameliorate disease severity in the context of many infectious and inflammatory conditions. However, use of S. boulardii as a prophylactic agent or therapeutic delivery vector would require delivery of S. boulardii to a healthy, uninflamed intestine. In contrast to inflamed mucosal tissue, the diverse microbiota, intact epithelial barrier, and fewer inflammatory immune cells within the healthy intestine may all limit the degree to which S. boulardii contacts and influences the host mucosal immune system. Understanding the nature of these interactions is crucial for application of S. boulardii as a prophylactic agent or therapeutic delivery vehicle. In this study, we explore both intrinsic and immunomodulatory properties of S. boulardii in the healthy mucosal immune system. Genomic sequencing and morphological analysis of S. boulardii reveals changes in cell wall components compared to non-probiotic S. cerevisiae that may partially account for probiotic functions of S. boulardii. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry demonstrate limited S. boulardii association with murine Peyer's patches. We also show that although S. boulardii induces a systemic humoral immune response, this response is small in magnitude and not directed against S. boulardii itself. RNA-seq of the draining mesenteric lymph nodes indicates that even repeated administration of S. boulardii induces few transcriptional changes in the healthy intestine. Together these data strongly suggest that interaction between S. boulardii and the mucosal immune system in the healthy intestine is limited, with important implications for future work examining S. boulardii as a prophylactic agent and therapeutic delivery vehicle."

These plasmids allow for the formation of functional γ-secretase complexes displaying specific activities and maturations. We show that PS1-containing γ-secretase complexes were targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas PS2-containing ones were addressed to the trans-Golgi network, to recycling endosomes, and, depending on the APH1-variant, to late endocytic compartments. Overall, these novel constructs unravel a presenilin-dependent subcellular targeting of γ-secretase complexes.

So far, no full-length class B receptor structures have been determined resulting in a relative lack of information regarding the bioactive conformation of the N-terminal portion of the peptide hormones, as well as the role of the 7TM domain in peptide ligand recognition.

Although GLP-1R and GCGR share over 50% sequence identity, they have opposing physiological roles; GCGR is activated by glucagon during fasting and mobilizes glucose into the blood, whereas GLP-1R functions postprandially by stimulating insulin secretion to control circulating glucose levels (1Meier J.J.

It is thus necessary to understand the ligand selectivity and recognition mechanism of the GLP-1R/GCGR axis to design specific drugs directed at either receptor. Chimeric constructs of GLP-1 in combination with glucagon have been used to identify structural determinants of ligand selectivity for GLP-1R and GCGR (31Hjorth S.A. Adelhorst K. Pedersen B.B.

Substitution of C-terminal GLP-1 residues with corresponding glucagon residues decreases GLP-1R binding and maintains low binding affinity for GCGR. The affinity of this GLP-1/glucagon chimera is however rescued by substituting the 7TM domain of GCGR with that of GLP-1R, suggesting that the N-terminal region of GLP-1 (His7–Leu20) is selectively recognized by the 7TM domain of GLP-1R (31Hjorth S.A.

These GLP-1/glucagon chimera experiments demonstrate that the ECD and 7TM domains of GLP-1R both play a role in GLP-1/glucagon selectivity but do not provide detailed structural insights into the molecular mechanism that drives selective recognition of the N-terminal region of GLP-1 by the 7TM domain of GLP-1R. The objectives of this study were therefore to identify the structural determinants of GLP-1 binding in the 7TM domain of GLP-1R and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of selective recognition of GLP-1. To study the influence of specific residues on receptor function, the desired mutations were introduced to wild-type GCGR (11Siu F.Y. He M. de Graaf C. Han G.W. Yang D. Zhang Z. Zhou C. Xu Q.

The single mutants and E3646.53bN/E3877.42bQ double mutant were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of receptor clones were confirmed by sequencing with the ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). CHO-K1 or HEK-293T cells were seeded onto 96-well poly-d-lysine or fibronectin-treated cell culture plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a density of 2.7 × 104 per well. After overnight culture, the cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant GLP-1R or GCGR DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, washed twice with the blocking buffer (F12 supplemented with 33 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4), and incubated with blocking buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. For homogeneous binding, the cells were incubated in binding buffer (PBS with 10% BSA, pH 7.4) with a constant concentration of 125I-GLP-1, 125I-exendin(9–39), or 125I-glucagon (40 pm) and different concentrations of unlabeled GLP-1 (3.57 pm to 1 μm), exendin-4 (3.57 pm to 1 μm), exendin-(9–39) (3.57 pm to 1 μm), glucagon (3.57 pm to 1 μm), or truncated GLP-1 (GLP-1-(7–36), GLP-1-(9–36), and GLP-1-(15–36) (17.86 pm to 5 μm) at room temperature for 3 h. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed by 50 μl of lysis buffer (PBS supplemented with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). The plates were subsequently counted for radioactivity (counts/min (cpm)) in a scintillation counter (MicroBeta2 Plate Counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a scintillation mixture (OptiPhase SuperMix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). cAMP accumulation was measured using HTRF-cAMP dynamic kit (Cisbio International, Gif sur Yvette Cedex, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids bearing wild-type and mutant GLP-1R. Twenty four h post-transfection, cells were collected and used to seed white poly-d-lysine-coated 384-well plates at a density of 8000 cells per well. Cells were incubated for a further 24 h at 37 °C. They were then incubated for 30 min in assay buffer (DMEM, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) with different concentrations of peptides at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of lysis buffer containing HTRF reagents. Plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature, and time-resolved FRET signals were measured after excitation at 620 and 650 nm by an EnVision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Approximately 1 × 105 transfected cells were blocked with PBS containing 5% BSA at room temperature for 15 min and incubated with 1:1000 diluted primary antibody (anti-FLAG, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h.

https://openalex.org/W2330932313,"Welwitschia mirabilis is an ancient and rare plant distributed along the western coast of Namibia and Angola. Several aspects of Welwitschia biology and ecology have been investigated, but very little is known about the microbial communities associated with this plant. This study reports on the bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere of W. mirabilis and the surrounding bulk soil. Rhizosphere communities were dominated by sequences of Alphaproteobacteria and Euromycetes, while Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and fungi of the class Dothideomycetes jointly dominated bulk soil communities. Although microbial communities within the rhizosphere and soil samples were highly variable, very few “species” (OTUs defined at a 97% identity cut-off) were shared between these two environments. There was a small ‘core’ rhizosphere bacterial community (formed by Nitratireductor, Steroidobacter, Pseudonocardia and three Phylobacteriaceae) that together with Rhizophagus, an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, and other putative plant growth-promoting microbes may interact synergistically to promote Welwitschia growth."
https://openalex.org/W2332589616,"Increasing evidence indicates an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving biologic therapy, and the effectiveness of isoniazid prophylaxis (INHP) in TB prevention. We aimed to examine 1) the incidence rate (IR) and risk factors for TB among RA patients receiving different therapies; 2) INHP effectiveness for TB prevention; 3) mortality rates after TB diagnosis in patients receiving different therapies. This retrospective study was conducted using a nationwide database: 168,720 non-RA subjects and a total of 42,180 RA patients including 36,162 csDMARDs-exposed, 3,577 etanercept-exposed, 1,678 adalimumab-exposed and 763 rituximab-exposed patients. TB risk was 2.7-fold higher in RA cohort compared with non-RA group, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 2.58. Advanced age, male, the use of corticosteroids ≧ 5 mg/day, and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease were risk factors for developing TB. Using csDMARDs-exposed group as reference, aHR of TB was the highest with adalimumab treatment (1.52), followed by etanercept (1.16), and the lowest with rituximab (0.08). INHP could effectively reduce TB risk in biologics-exposed patients. Mortality rates after TB diagnosis were higher in RA patients, particularly the elderly and those with DM, with lower rates in adalimumab-exposed patients compared with csDMARDs-exposed patients. In conclusion, TB risk was increased in patients receiving TNF-α inhibitors, but the risk associated with rituximab therapy was relatively low. With the effectiveness of INHP shown in the prevention of biologics-associated TB, stricter implementation of INHP should be beneficial. The mortality from biologics-associated TB may be efficiently reduced through increased awareness."

We evaluated the effectiveness of PCV10 on pneumonia morbidity and mortality among infants during the first two years after vaccine introduction.This is a population-based nested case-control study using four merged nationwide case-based electronic health data registries: live birth, vaccination, hospitalization and mortality. Children born in 2010 and 2011 were followed from two moths of age for a period of two years. Using four different case definitions of pneumonia hospitalization and/or mortality (all-cause and pneumonia related deaths), all cases and four randomly selected matched controls per case were selected. Controls were matched to cases on analysis time. Vaccination status was then assessed. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated using conditional logistic regression.There were a total of 497,996 children in the 2010 and 2011 Chilean live-birth cohorts. PCV10 VE was 11.2% (95%CI 8.5-13.6) when all pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths were used to define cases. VE increased to 20.7 (95%CI 17.3-23.8) when ICD10 codes used to denote viral pneumonia were excluded from the case definition. VE estimates on pneumonia deaths and all-cause deaths were 71.5 (95%CI 9.0-91.8) and 34.8 (95% CI 23.7-44.4), respectively.PCV10 vaccination substantially reduced the number of hospitalizations due to pneumonia and deaths due to pneumonia and to all-causes over this study period. Our findings also reinforce the importance of having quality health information systems for measuring VE."
https://openalex.org/W2319804825,"Olfactory transduction is a process by which olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) transform odor information into neuronal electrical signals. This process begins with the binding of odor molecules to receptor proteins on olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) dendrites. The major molecular components involved in olfaction include odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), chemosensory proteins (CSPs), odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs). More importantly, as potential molecular targets, chemosensory proteins are used to identify novel attractants or repellants for environmental-friendly pest management. In this study we analyzed the transcriptome of the flea beetle, Phyllotreta striolata (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), a serious pest of Brassicaceae crops, to better understand the molecular mechanisms of olfactory recognition in this pest. The analysis of transcriptomes from the antennae and terminal abdomens of specimens of both sexes identified transcripts from several key molecular components of chemoreception including 73 ORs, 36 GRs, 49 IRs, 2 SNMPs, 32 OBPs, 8 CSPs, and four candidate odorant degrading enzymes (ODEs): 143 cytochrome P450s (CYPs), 68 esterases (ESTs), 27 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and 8 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Bioinformatic analyses indicated that a large number of chemosensory genes were up-regulated in the antennae. This was consistent with a potential role in olfaction. To validate the differential abundance analyses, the expression of 19 genes encoding various ORs, CSPs, and OBPs was assessed via qRT-PCR between non-chemosensory tissue and antennae. Consistent with the bioinformatic analyses, transcripts for all of the genes in the qRT-PCR subset were elevated in antennae. These findings provide the first insights into the molecular basis of chemoreception in the striped flea beetle."
https://openalex.org/W2324566879,"Schwann cells (SCs) arise from neural crest cells (NCCs) that first give rise to SC precursors (SCPs), followed by immature SCs, pro-myelinating SCs, and finally, non-myelinating or myelinating SCs. After nerve injury, mature SCs ‘de-differentiate’, downregulating their myelination program while transiently re-activating early glial lineage genes. To better understand molecular parallels between developing and de-differentiated SCs, we characterized the expression profiles of a panel of 12 transcription factors from the onset of NCC migration through postnatal stages, as well as after acute nerve injury. Using Sox10 as a pan-glial marker in co-expression studies, the earliest transcription factors expressed in E9.0 Sox10+ NCCs were Sox9, Pax3, AP2α and Nfatc4. E10.5 Sox10+ NCCs coalescing in the dorsal root ganglia differed slightly, expressing Sox9, Pax3, AP2α and Etv5. E12.5 SCPs continued to express Sox10, Sox9, AP2α and Pax3, as well as initiating Sox2 and Egr1 expression. E14.5 immature SCs were similar to SCPs, except that they lost Pax3 expression. By E18.5, AP2α, Sox2 and Egr1 expression was turned off in the nerve, while Jun, Oct6 and Yy1 expression was initiated in pro-myelinating Sox9+/Sox10+ SCs. Early postnatal and adult SCs continued to express Sox9, Jun, Oct6 and Yy1 and initiated Nfatc4 and Egr2 expression. Notably, at all stages, expression of each marker was observed only in a subset of Sox10+ SCs, highlighting the heterogeneity of the SC pool. Following acute nerve injury, Egr1, Jun, Oct6, and Sox2 expression was upregulated, Egr2 expression was downregulated, while Sox9, Yy1, and Nfatc4 expression was maintained at similar frequencies. Notably, de-differentiated SCs in the injured nerve did not display a transcription factor profile corresponding to a specific stage in the SC lineage. Taken together, we demonstrate that uninjured and injured SCs are heterogeneous and distinct from one another, and de-differentiation recapitulates transcriptional aspects of several different embryonic stages."

Using antibiotics and the prebiotic oligofructose, which has been shown to counteract excess fat mass, we explored the gut microbiota-dependent effects of oligofructose on body composition and host metabolism. Diet-induced obese male Sprague Dawley rats, fed a background high-fat/sucrose diet, were randomized to one of the following diets for 6 wk: 1) high-energy control; 2) 10% oligofructose; 3) ampicillin; 4) ampicillin + 10% oligofructose; 5) ampicillin/neomycin; or 6) ampicillin/neomycin + 10% oligofructose. Combining oligofructose with ampicillin treatment blunted the decrease in adiposity seen with oligofructose. Although ampicillin did not affect total bacteria, ampicillin impeded oligofructose-induced increases in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus In contrast, the combination of ampicillin and neomycin reduced total bacteria but did not abrogate the oligofructose-induced decrease in adiposity.

https://openalex.org/W2317613600,"Small RNAs can be engineered to target and eliminate expression of disease-causing genes or infectious viruses, resulting in the preclinical and clinical development of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics using these small RNAs. To ensure the success of RNAi therapeutics, small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) must co-opt sufficient quantities of the endogenous microRNA machinery to elicit efficient gene knockdown without impeding normal cellular function. We previously observed liver toxicity-including hepatocyte turnover, loss of gene repression and lethality-in mice receiving high doses of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector expressing shRNAs (rAAV-shRNAs); however the mechanism by which toxicity ensues has not been elucidated. Using rAAV-shRNAs we have now determined that hepatotoxicity arises when exogenous shRNAs exceed 12% of the total amount of liver microRNAs. After this threshold was surpassed, shRNAs specifically reduced the initially synthesized 22-nucleotide isoform of microRNA (miR)-122-5p without substantially affecting other microRNAs, resulting in functional de-repression of miR-122 target mRNAs. Delivery of a rAAV-shRNA vector expressing mature miR-122-5p could circumvent toxicity, despite the exogenous shRNA accounting for 70% of microRNAs. Toxicity was also not observed in Mir122-knockout mice regardless of the level or sequence of the shRNA. Our study establishes limits to the microRNA machinery that is available for therapeutic siRNAs and suggests new paradigms for the role of miR-122 in liver homeostasis in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2334621394,"Background Within the ToyBox-study, a kindergarten-based, family-involved intervention was developed to prevent overweight and obesity in European preschoolers, targeting four key behaviours related to early childhood obesity, including water consumption. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the ToyBox-intervention (cluster randomized controlled trial) on water intake and beverage consumption in European preschoolers and to investigate if the intervention effects differed by implementation score of kindergartens and parents/caregivers. Method A sample of 4964 preschoolers (4.7±0.4 years; 51.5% boys) from six European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Poland, Spain) was included in the data analyses. A standardized protocol was used and parents/caregivers filled in socio-demographic data and a food-frequency questionnaire. To assess intervention effects, multilevel repeated measures analyses were conducted for the total sample and for the six country-specific samples. Based on the process evaluation questionnaire of teachers and parents/caregivers, an implementation score was constructed. To assess differences in water intake and beverage consumption by implementation score in the total sample, multilevel repeated measures analyses were performed. Results Limited intervention effects on water intake from beverages and overall beverage consumption were found. However, important results were found on prepacked fruit juice consumption, with a larger decrease in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, also a decline in plain milk consumption was found. Implementation scores were rather low in both kindergartens and parents/caregivers. Nevertheless, more favorable effects on beverage choices were found in preschoolers whose parents/caregivers and kindergarten teachers had higher implementation scores compared to those with lower implementation scores. Conclusion The ToyBox-intervention can provide the basis for the development of more tailor-made interventions. However, new strategies to improve implementation of interventions should be created."
https://openalex.org/W2333834261,"Stenosis is a critical problem in the long-term efficacy of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs). We previously showed that host monocyte infiltration and activation within the graft drives stenosis and that TGF-β receptor 1 (TGF-βR1) inhibition can prevent it, but the latter effect was attributed primarily to inhibition of mesenchymal cell expansion. In this study, we assessed the effects of TGF-βR1 inhibition on the host monocytes. Biodegradable TEVGs were implanted as inferior vena cava interposition conduits in 2 groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 25/group): unseeded grafts and unseeded grafts with TGF-βR1 inhibitor systemic treatment for the first 2 wk. The TGF-βR1 inhibitor treatment effectively improved TEVG patency at 6 mo compared to the untreated control group (91.7 vs. 48%, P < 0.001), which is associated with a reduction in classic activation of mononuclear phagocytes. Consistent with these findings, the addition of rTGF-β to LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated monocytes enhanced secretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-6; this effect was blocked by TGF-βR1 inhibition (P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that the TGF-β signaling pathway contributes to TEVG stenosis by inducing classic activation of host monocytes. Furthermore, blocking monocyte activation by TGF-βR1 inhibition provides a viable strategy for preventing TEVG stenosis while maintaining neotissue formation.—Lee, Y.-U., de Dios Ruiz-Rosado, J., Mahler, N., Best, C.

It was recently reported that the Jα18-deficient mouse described by our group in 1997 harbors perturbed TCRα repertoire, which raised concerns regarding the validity of some of the experimental conclusions that have been made using this mouse line. To resolve this concern, we generated a novel Traj18-deficient mouse line by specifically targeting the Traj18 gene segment using Cre-Lox approach. Here we showed the newly generated Traj18-deficient mouse has, apart from the absence of Traj18, an undisturbed TCRα chain repertoire by using next generation sequencing and by detecting normal generation of Vα19Jα33 expressing mucosal associated invariant T cells, whose development was abrogated in the originally described Jα18-KO mice.

Diabetic males were fed control, low, or high-iron diets, the latter, with or without capsaicin. Healthy rats were fed identical diets, but without the capsaicin supplement. We then measured the parameters listed above, using the Student t-test and ANOVA, to compare groups.Healthy rats fed a low-iron diet exhibited significantly reduced total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, compared with rats fed a control diet. Significantly reduced blood lipid was also provoked by low dietary iron in diabetic rats, compared with those fed a control diet. Insulin, and glucose tolerance was only improved in healthy rats fed the low-iron diet. Significant increases in total cholesterol were found in diabetic rats fed a high-iron diet, compared with healthy rats fed the same diet, although no statistical differences were found for triglycerides. Hemoglobin levels, which were not statistically different in diabetic versus healthy rats fed the high-iron diet, fell when capsaicin was added. Capsaicin also provoked a fall in the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in diabetic animals, versus diabetics fed with the high iron diet alone. In conclusion, low levels of dietary iron reduced levels of serum triglycerides, hemoglobin, and cholesterol, and significantly improved insulin, and glucose tolerance in healthy rats. In contrast, a high-iron diet increased cholesterol significantly, with no significant changes to triglyceride concentrations. The addition of capsaicin to the high-iron diet (for diabetic rats) further reduced levels of hemoglobin, cholesterol, and triglycerides. These results suggest that capsaicin, may be suitable for the treatment of elevated hemoglobin, in patients."

We examined the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of HMOX1 and its application as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for AD. Our results show that HMOX1 mRNA and protein expression was approximately 12.2-fold and 7.9-fold increased in H4-sw cells, respectively. Increased HMOX1 expression was also detected in the brain, particularly the hippocampus, of AD model transgenic mice. However, the methylation of specific CpG sites within its promoter, particularly at CpG located −374 was significantly decreased in H4-sw cells. Treatment of neuroglioma cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine resulted in reduced methylation of HMOX1 promoter accompanied by enhanced HMOX1 expression strongly supporting DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation of HMOX1. Toxic Aβ-induced aberrant hypomethylation of HMOX1 at −374 promoter CpG site was correlated with increased HMOX1expression. In addition to neuroglioma cells, we also found Aβ-induced epigenetic regulation of HMOX1 in human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells. We evaluated DNA methylation status of HMOX1 at −374 promoter CpG site in blood samples from AD patients, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and control individuals using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We observed lower methylation of HMOX1 at the −374 promoter CpG site in AD patients compared to MCI and control individuals, and a correlation between Mini-Mental State Examination score and demethylation level. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed good discrimination of AD patients from MCI patients and control individuals. Our findings suggest that the methylation status of HMOX1 at a specific promoter CpG site is related to AD progression."

Although SERPINE2 is a candidate susceptibility gene for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the physiologic role of this protease inhibitor in lung development and homeostasis is unknown. We observed spontaneous monocytic-cell infiltration in the lungs of Serpine2-deficient (SE2-/-) mice, beginning at or before the time of lung maturity, which resulted in lesions that resembled bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). The initiation of lymphocyte accumulation in the lungs of SE2-/- mice involved the excessive expression of chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules that are essential for BALT induction, organization, and maintenance. BALT-like lesion formation in the lungs of SE2-/- mice was also associated with a significant increase in the activation of thrombin, a recognized target of SE2, and excess stimulation of NF-κB, a major regulator of chemokine expression and inflammation. Finally, systemic delivery of thrombin rapidly stimulated lung chemokine expression in vivo. These data uncover a novel mechanism whereby loss of serine protease inhibition leads to lung lymphocyte accumulation.—Solleti, S. K., Srisuma, S., Bhattacharya, S., Rangel-Moreno, J., Bijli, K.

https://openalex.org/W2333192432,"Much of our current knowledge regarding the association of FOXP2 with speech and language development comes from singleton and small family studies where a small number of rare variants have been identified. However, neither genome-wide nor gene-specific studies have provided evidence that common polymorphisms in the gene contribute to individual differences in language development in the general population. One explanation for this inconsistency is that previous studies have been limited to relatively small samples of individuals with low language abilities, using low density gene coverage. The current study examined the association between common variants in FOXP2 and a quantitative measure of language ability in a population-based cohort of European decent (n = 812). No significant associations were found for a panel of 13 SNPs that covered the coding region of FOXP2 and extended into the promoter region. Power analyses indicated we should have been able to detect a QTL variance of 0.02 for an associated allele with MAF of 0.2 or greater with 80% power. This suggests that, if a common variant associated with language ability in this gene does exist, it is likely of small effect. Our findings lead us to conclude that while genetic variants in FOXP2 may be significant for rare forms of language impairment, they do not contribute appreciably to individual variation in the normal range as found in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2326527743,"Mitochondria play a critical role in aging, however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. We found that a mutation disrupting the C. elegans homolog of Miro GTPase (miro-1) extends life span. This phenotype requires simultaneous loss of miro-1 from multiple tissues including muscles and neurons, and is dependent on daf-16/FOXO. Notably, the amount of mitochondria in the miro-1 mutant is reduced to approximately 50% of the wild-type. Despite this reduction, oxygen consumption is only weakly reduced, suggesting that mitochondria of miro-1 mutants are more active than wild-type mitochondria. The ROS damage is slightly reduced and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response pathway is weakly activated in miro-1 mutants. Unlike previously described long-lived mitochondrial electron transport chain mutants, miro-1 mutants have normal growth rate. These results suggest that the reduction in the amount of mitochondria can affect the life span of an organism through activation of stress pathways."

These assays identified mitochondrial 3-ketoacylCoA thiolase (ACAA2) as the p46Shc major partner. Furthermore, p46Shc modulation iv vitro and iv vivo modulates ACAA2 activity. Mitochondrial lipid oxidation is a stepwise pathway resulting in the production of acetoacetylCoA and acetylCoA, which enters the TCA cycle to form citrate.

Livers were extracted from 3 m/o C57Bl6 male mice and homogenized in ice-cold fractionation buffer: 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4. Cell debris (P1) was separated from homogenates (Tot) for 5 min at 400 × g, and the supernatant (S1) centrifuged for 10 min at 700 × g for the separation of nuclei or intact unbroken cells (P2) and the supernatant (S2) centrifuged at 7000 × g for 15 min for the isolation of mitochondria (P3) and cytosolic fraction (S3).

Protocols. 2007; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar. Briefly, livers from fasted mice were placed into ice-cold isolation medium (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, 0.1% FA-free BSA, pH 7.4), chopped, rinsed from blood, placed in 10% (w/v) isolation medium, and homogenized with six strokes at 1000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °;C, and the resulting supernatant was decanted into clean centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min (4 °;C). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended and washed in isolation medium with and without BSA, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in isolation medium without BSA (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Mitochondria were plated (10 μg/50 μl protein per well), spun at 4 °;C for 20 min at 3000 × g, and covered with 450 μm MAS-3 Seahorse assay medium (115 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% FA-free BSA), supplemented with either 10 mm succinate+2 μm rotenone, 10 mm pyruvate+5 mm malate, or 20 μm palmitoyl-l-carnitine+10 mm malonate to measure fluxes through respective oxidative processes. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were measured starting from basal respiration followed by sequential regimens of 2 mm ADP, 1 μm oligomycin, 50 μm FCCP, and 4 μm antimycin A/2 μm rotenone. Basal respiration was assayed in 2 cycles of mix (50 s) and measuring (2 min), ADP in one cycle of mix (50 s) and measuring (8 min), oligomycin in 1 cycle of mix (50 s) and measuring (4 min), FCCP in 1 cycle of mix (50 s) and measuring (4 min), antimycin A/rotenone in 1 cycle of mix (50 s), and measuring (4 min). Unbuffered DMEM was used for glucose-driven OCR measurements, and KHB (111 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm carnitine, 0.6% fat-free BSA, pH 7.4) was used to measure palmitate-driven OCR of cultured cells. FL83B cells (200 μl) of DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% FBS (50.000/well) onto Seahorse plates and let attach overnight; medium was changed to 2.5 mm glucose DMEM for 24 h and then changed to KHB.

Medium was changed to KHB; cells were equilibrated for 1 h, and OCR was assayed with following regiments concentrations: BSA/sodium palmitate 0.6%/200 μm complex, oligomycin, 1 μm; FCCP, 5 μm; rotenone, 0.1 μm; antimycin A, 1 μm. Total protein in each well was used for normalization. Mouse liver mitochondria were tested for quality as described, lysed with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) lysis buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 0.5% CHAPS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). 5 mg of lysates were incubated in 600 μl of lysis buffer with 10 μg of rabbit IgG or rabbit polyclonal anti-Shc antibody and 50 μl of Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen Inc., Grand Island, NY) at 4 °;C for 2 h. Precipitates were analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibody. Precipitates were separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris PAGE, stained with colloid Coomassie Blue; bands were excised, and sent for mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins were isolated with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies), and Westerns were analyzed with the indicated antibody. BN gel electrophoresis and second dimension SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting were performed according to the protocol described by Wittig and Schagger (19Wittig I. Schägger H. Electrophoretic methods to isolate protein complexes from mitochondria.Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 723-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin for 15 min on ice; buffer: 2 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0.

For the second dimension, strips of BN gels were denatured in 50 mm TrisHCl (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, 200 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue; Western blots were performed. Proteins we expressed in HEK T293 cells: terminally biotinylated p46Shc protein, p46Shc version lacking the PTB domain (p46ShcδPTB), p46Shc lacking the SH2 domain (p46ShcδSH2), GFP, and ACAA2 were produced using the described plasmids. Expression, purity, and biotinylation levels of proteins were verified by Western blotting. Proteins were purified with avidin agarose, and p46Shc or p46ShcδSH2 were loaded onto sets of Octet RED 384 SA biosensors (Pall ForteBio LLC., Menlo Park, CA) to a density of 7 nm followed by blocking of non-occupied streptavidin residues of biosensors with 200 μm biotin. Sensors were tested against titration series of concentrations of purified ACAA2 or GFP as follows: 3.5 μm, 1.7 μm, 0.9 μm, 433.7 nm, 216.9 nm, 108.4 nm, 54.2 nm, and 27.1 nm for both ACAA2 and GFP. Series dilutions were prepared in BLI Kinetic Buffer (Pall ForteBio LLC., Menlo Park, CA) containing 1% BSA. We tested the full size p46Shc in parallel with p46ShcδPTB, p46ShcδSH2, and GFP against indicated concentrations of ACAA2. GFP sensors were used to compensate for possible signal drifting due to buffer changes or nonspecific bindings of ACAA2 to the sensors. A typical binding sensorgram is presented in Fig. 4a. After a stable baseline was achieved, biosensors were moved into solution that contain ACAA2 or GFP (the association step) for 900 s, then biosensors were moved into a buffer without ACAA2 or GFP (the dissociation step); log plots of responses [nm] were created against log C [nm] of thiolase, and EC50 and Hill slopes were measured. AcylCoA dehydrogenase activity, using palmitoyl-CoA as substrate, was determined at 600 nm (∈ = 21 mm−1 cm−1) by measuring the decrease in absorbance due to acylCoA-dependent reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) in the presence of phenazine methosulfate (PMS). The activity of 3-hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase, using acetoacetylCoA as substrate, was determined at 340 nm (∈ = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1) by measuring the oxidation of NADH. The activity of 3-oxoacylCoA thiolase, using acetoacetylCoA as substrate, was determined at 303 nm (∈ = 16.9 mm−1 cm−1) by measuring the breakdown of the thioester bond. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS 9.4 and Excel Statistical Data Analysis Tool package 2007. Unless indicated otherwise, p values were determined with one-way ANOVA followed by Scheffe’s post hoc planed comparison test; *, p < 0.1; **, p < 0.05. Survival curves were analyzed with Logrank Test using Prizm 4 for Windows Version 4.02 Software. p46Shc was previously reported to have cryptic N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence and to be targeted to the mitochondria (6Ventura A.

Livers from C57BL6 mice were fractionated: the highest-respiring fractions had more of the p46Shc isoform (Fig. 1b), and only p46Shc, but not p52Shc was very abundant in the purified mitochondrial fraction (He). These results are consistent with mitochondrial localization of p46Shc. This is also consistent with data published earlier by others where p46Shc was noted to be mitochondrially localized (6Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G.

https://openalex.org/W2313279471,"Multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for blood pressure (BP) have been detected in rat models of human polygenic hypertension. Great challenges confronting us include molecular identifications of individual QTLs. We first defined the chromosome region harboring C1QTL1 to a segment of 1.9 megabases that carries 9 genes. Among them, we identified the gene encoding the fibronectin type III domain containing 1 protein (Fndc1)/activator of G protein signaling 8 (Ags8) to be the strongest candidate for C1QTL1, since numerous non-synonymous mutations are found. Moreover, the 5' Fndc1/Ags8 putative promoter contains numerous mutations that can account for its differential expression in kidneys and the heart, prominent organs in modulating BP, although the Fndc1/Ags8 protein was not detectable in these organs under our experimental conditions. This work has provided the premier evidence that Fndc1/Ags8 is a novel and strongest candidate gene for C1QTL1 without completely excluding other 8 genes in the C1QTL1-residing interval. If proven true by future in vivo function studies such as single-gene Fndc1/Ags8 congenics, transgenesis or targeted-gene modifications, it might represent a part of the BP genetic architecture that operates in the upstream position distant from the end-phase physiology of BP control, since it activates a Gbetagamma component in a signaling pathway. Its functional role could validate the concept that a QTL in itself can influence BP 'indirectly' by regulating other genes downstream in a pathway.

Although many VirB substrates have been identified in Brucella, we still know very little about the secretion mechanism that mediates their translocation across the two membranes and the periplasmic space. In this manuscript, we describe the identification of a gene, virJ, that codes for a protein with periplasmic localization that is involved in the intracellular replication process and virulence in mice. Our analysis revealed that this protein is necessary for the secretion of at least two VirB substrates that have a periplasmic intermediate and that it directly interacts with them. We additionally show that VirJ also associates with the apparatus per se and that its absence affects the assembly of the complex. We hypothesize that VirJ is part of a secretion platform composed of the translocon and several secretion substrates and that it probably coordinates the proper assembly of this macromolecular complex.

Intracellular pathogenic bacteria have the capacity to circumvent the host defenses to establish a secure niche for replication. The mechanisms necessary to establish this “safe haven” are multiple, but in many cases they depend on the capacity of the bacteria to secrete and translocate effector molecules to the host cell (1Cossart P. Roy C.R. Manipulation of host membrane machinery by bacterial pathogens.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Brucella spp., the causative agent of brucellosis, is a zoonotic Gram-negative bacterium that still inflicts important economic losses in livestock and serious human health problems in endemic areas (2Corbel M.J. Brucellosis: an overview.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1997; 3: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Brucella is an intracellular pathogen with the capacity to avoid the bactericidal effects of its target cells, such as macrophages (one of the primary cell targets). To achieve this, the bacterium codes for a T4SS 5The abbreviations used are: T4SStype IV secretion systemBCVBrucella-containing vacuoleTSBtryptic soy brothBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophage(s)BACTHbacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid assayIPimmunoprecipitation. that secretes and translocates effector proteins to the host cell that modulate the cellular response, avoiding the phagocytic process and favoring the infectious process (3Comerci D.J.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4849-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In Brucella, this secretion system is named virB because of its homology to the Agrobacterium tumefaciens conjugation-like system that translocates the T-DNA (transferred DNA) into the plant cell (11Alvarez-Martinez C.E. Christie P.J. Biological diversity of prokaryotic type IV secretion systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The activity of the VirB system is necessary, in a first phase, to avoid the fusion of the BCV with the lysosomes and, in a second phase, to redirect its fate to an endoplasmic reticulum-derived membrane niche, where it actively replicates (3Comerci D.J. Martínez-Lorenzo M.J. Sieira R. Gorvel J.P. Ugalde R.A.

Type IV secretion systems are macromolecular complexes that span the inner membrane, the periplasmic space, and the outer membrane, are present in many bacteria, and are ancestrally related to conjugation systems. Recently, the complete structure of a T4SS has been solved by electron microscopy, shedding light on several mechanistic aspects of the secretion process (13Low H.H. Gubellini F. Rivera-Calzada A. Braun N. Connery S. Dujeancourt A. Lu F. Redzej A. Fronzes R. Orlova E.V. Waksman G. Structure of a type IV secretion system.Nature. 2014; 508: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). One interesting finding was the fact that the outer membrane core component of the system is connected to the inner membrane complex by a periplasmic stalk, which could allow substrates present in the periplasm to be engaged by the system (13Low H.H. Gubellini F. Rivera-Calzada A. Braun N. Connery S. Dujeancourt A. Lu F. Redzej A. Fronzes R. Orlova E.V. Waksman G. Structure of a type IV secretion system.Nature. 2014; 508: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This is an important difference to other secretion systems that either engage their substrates in the cytoplasm or the periplasm. To date, in Brucella, several VirB substrates have been identified, but we still have almost no knowledge on what their targets are or what biological activities they have in the host cell. Additionally, very little is known about the secretion of T4SSs per se, the mechanism by which the substrates are selected, or how they are actually translocated through the system and into the host cells. Even though initially it was believed that the effectors are engaged by the T4SS in the cytoplasm, there has been increasing evidence that some proteins have a periplasmic localization or are inserted in the membrane (6Döhmer P.H. Valguarnera E. Czibener C. Ugalde J.E.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As indicated above, these observations are consistent with the recent structure of a type IV system and should encourage a re-evaluation of the proposed secretion mechanism of these fascinating nanomachines. The most studied T4SS is the A. tumefaciens virB system, a supramolecular structure with ∼12 components, all codified in the Ti megaplasmid (11Alvarez-Martinez C.E. Christie P.J. Biological diversity of prokaryotic type IV secretion systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses from several groups over the past 30 years have given us a detailed picture of the functionality of this system (for a recent review, see Ref. 18Nester E.W. Agrobacterium: nature's genetic engineer.Front. Plant Sci. 2014; 5: 730PubMed Google Scholar). In 1995, a group identified a gene in the Ti plasmid that they named virJ, which codes for periplasmic protein with a role in the T-DNA transfer process (19Pan S.Q. Jin S. Boulton M.I. Hawes M. Gordon M.P. Nester E.W. An Agrobacterium virulence factor encoded by a Ti plasmid gene or a chromosomal gene is required for T-DNA transfer into plants.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Work performed several years later by this same group additionally showed that VirJ associates with some VirB substrates and suggested that type IV secretion in Agrobacterium might by be a two-step process and that VirJ plays a role in the interaction of some secreted substrates with the T-pilus (17Pantoja M. Chen L. Chen Y. Nester E.W. Agrobacterium type IV secretion is a two-step process in which export substrates associate with the virulence protein VirJ in the periplasm.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the only report identifying a protein involved in the type IV secretion process that participates in the translocation of substrates with periplasmic localization. We have recently identified a VirB secretion substrate in Brucella abortus that we named SepA and that is involved in the early stages of the intracellular replication cycle (6Döhmer P.H. Valguarnera E. Czibener C. Ugalde J.E. Identification of a type IV secretion substrate of Brucella abortus that participates in the early stages of intracellular survival.Cell Microbiol. 2014; 16: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We showed that this new effector protein is secreted in a VirB-dependent manner, that its inactivation affects the intracellular trafficking particularly during the initial stages, and that its secretion involves a periplasmic intermediate (6Döhmer P.H. Valguarnera E. Czibener C. Ugalde J.E. Identification of a type IV secretion substrate of Brucella abortus that participates in the early stages of intracellular survival.Cell Microbiol. 2014; 16: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although in Brucella this was the first report identifying a VirB substrate with a two-step secretion process involving a periplasmic intermediate, it was reported that other effectors have a predicted periplasmic signal peptide or putative transmembrane domains (5de Jong M.F. Sun Y.H. den Hartigh A.B. van Dijl J.M. Tsolis R.M.

Brucella modulates secretory trafficking via multiple type IV secretion effector proteins.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We report here the identification in Brucella of a homologue of the A. tumefaciens virJ gene and characterized this gene genetically and biochemically. We showed that this gene is a virulence factor that codes for a protein that localizes in the periplasm and plays a central role in the secretion of two type IV secretion substrates (SepA and Bpe123). Moreover, our results indicate that VirJ directly interacts with both effectors and forms a complex with core components of the VirB apparatus, such as VirB5 and VirB8, strongly suggesting that some substrates might be part of a secretion platform of which VirJ could be a central core component. Brucella melitensis bv. abortus 2308 was used as a wild-type strain. B. abortus strains were grown in tryptic soy agar (Difco/BD Biosciences) or in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 37 °C on a rotary shaker for 16–24 h. Manipulation of B. abortus was performed at the biosafety level 3 laboratory facility at the Universidad Nacional de San Martín. Escherichia coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani agar and broth at 37 °C or 2xYT at 18 °C. If necessary, media was supplemented with appropriated antibiotic at the indicated final concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; and nalidixic acid, 5 μg/ml. To construct a Ba ΔvirJ mutant strain, the regions flanking the virJ gene were amplified and ligated using a recombinant PCR technique (20Czibener C. Ugalde J.E. Identification of a unique gene cluster of Brucella spp. that mediates adhesion to host cells.Microbes Infect. 2012; 14: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR amplification were VirJ1 (5′-CCGGAATTCGCTGACCTTTTCCAAGCAAG-3′) and VirJ2 (5′-GATCGCCAATGCCTTTCTCAT-3′) to amplify a 500-bp upstream region and VirJ3 (5′-AAGGCATTGGCGATCGCAAATCACATGCCGTTACCG-3′) and VirJ4 (5′-CGCGGATCCGACAACACGTTCCAGCCTTA-3′) to amplify a 500-bp downstream region. VirJ-1 and VirJ-4 were used in an overlapping PCR. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated to the pK18mobSacB plasmid digested with the same enzymes. The plasmid pK18mobSacB/ΔvirJ was introduced into the B. abortus strain by biparental mating using the E. coli S17λpir strain. Double recombination events (Kms Sacr) were selected, and gene knockout was confirmed by genomic PCR. To construct a C-terminal 3×FLAG-tagged version of VirJ the plasmid pBBR1-MCS4–3×FLAG was used (6Döhmer P.H. Valguarnera E. Czibener C. Ugalde J.E. Identification of a type IV secretion substrate of Brucella abortus that participates in the early stages of intracellular survival.Cell Microbiol. 2014; 16: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). VirJ was amplified by PCR from B. abortus 2308 genomic DNA using primers VirJ5 (5′-CCCAAGCTTCCTTTGGAGTTCATTCGCAA-3′) and VirJ6 (5′-CGGAATTCGCGCGCAGGGCGCGG-3′). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the resulting fragment was cloned in pBBR1-MCS4–3×FLAG in the same sites, generating an in-frame fusion to the 3×FLAG epitope. The resulting plasmid, named pBBR4/virJ-3×FLAG, was introduced into the B. abortus strain by biparental mating. The expression of virJ-3×FLAG was confirmed by Western blotting. To construct the Ba sepA and Ba ΔvirJ/sepA strains expressing SepA-3×FLAG, the plasmid pBBR4/sepA-3×FLAG (6Döhmer P.H. Valguarnera E. Czibener C. Ugalde J.E. Identification of a type IV secretion substrate of Brucella abortus that participates in the early stages of intracellular survival.Cell Microbiol. 2014; 16: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was introduced into the Ba wild-type and Ba ΔvirJ mutant strains by biparental mating. The expression of SepA-3×FLAG was confirmed by Western blotting. To construct the Ba bpe123 and Ba ΔvirJ/bpe123 strains expressing Bpe123–3×FLAG, the plasmid pBPE123-FLAG(1–153) (7Marchesini M.I. Herrmann C.K. Salcedo S.P. Gorvel J.P. Comerci D.J. In search of Brucella abortus type IV secretion substrates: screening and identification of four proteins translocated into host cells through VirB system.Cell Microbiol. 2011; 13: 1261-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was introduced in the Ba wild-type and Ba ΔvirJ mutant strains by biparental mating. The expression of Bpe123–3×FLAG was confirmed by Western blotting. To construct glutathione S-transferase-tagged VirJ protein (VirJ-GST), the virJ gene was amplified by PCR from B. abortus 2308 genomic DNA using primers GST-VirJ FW (5′-cgggatccatggatgccatgttggcccg-3′) and GST-VirJ RV (5′-cggaattctcagcgcgcagggcgcgg-3′). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting fragments were cloned in pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare) in the same sites, generating an in-frame fusion to the GST. The expression of VirJ-GST was confirmed by Western blotting. Recombinant poly-histidine-tagged SepA (SepA-His6) or Bpe123 (Bpe123-His6) were expressed in E. coli and purified using nickel affinity chromatography under native conditions. Briefly, E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C at 250 rpm, and the expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) at A600 nm = 0.6. 3 h post-induction, cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. Supernatants were recovered and applied to a HisTrapTM HP column (GE Healthcare). The recombinant proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (100–500 mm). For the GST pulldown assay, imidazole was eliminated by dialysis. Recombinant GST or VirJ-GST was expressed in E. coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography under native conditions. Briefly, E. coli strains were grown in 2XYT broth at 37 °C at 250 rpm, and expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.2 mm) at A600 nm = 0.8. Cultures were transferred to 18 °C, and 16 h post-induction cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. Supernatants were recovered and applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with 20 mm glutathione. For the GST pulldown assay, glutathione was eliminated by dialysis. A standard antibiotic protection assay was performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and murine macrophage-like J774 A.1 cells (10Sieira R. Comerci D.J. Sánchez D.O. Ugalde R.A. A homologue of an operon required for DNA transfer in Agrobacterium is required in Brucella abortus for virulence and intracellular multiplication.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4849-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To obtain BMDM, bone marrow cells were isolated from femora of 6- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 female mice and differentiated into macrophages as described in Ref. 12Celli J. de Chastellier C. Franchini D.M. Pizarro-Cerda J. Moreno E. Gorvel J.P. Brucella evades macrophage killing via VirB-dependent sustained interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates in suitable culture medium at 105 cells/ml and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Brucella strains were grown in TSB with the appropriate antibiotics for 24 h and diluted in culture medium prior to infection. The suspension was added at the indicated multiplicity of infection (50:1 for J774 A.1 cells and 200:1 for BMDM) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed, and fresh medium containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin was added. At 4, 24, or 48 h post-infection, cells were washed and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. The intracellular CFUs were determined by direct plating on TSB agar plates. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips and infected as described above. At different times post-infection, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and further processed for immunofluorescence labeling. Briefly, coverslips were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 15 min with PBS plus 50 mm NH4Cl to quench free aldehyde groups. Coverslips were then incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS containing 10% horse serum, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% saponin solution (permeabilization) for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated with the secondary antibodies in PBS containing 10% horse serum, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% saponin solution under the same conditions. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Samples were examined on a Nikon microscope (Eclipse TE 2000) at a magnification of ×60 with a lens with a numerical aperture of 1.42. The software MBF ImageJ v1.43 m (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health) was used to merge the microscopic images. To determine the percentages of bacteria that co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1, BMDM cells were infected with Ba SepA or Ba ΔvirJ SepA strains expressing SepA-3×FLAG (multiplicity of infection, 200:1). At 4 and 24 h post-infection, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for immunofluorescence labeling. The primary antibodies used were rat anti-mouse LAMP-1 ID4B (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa; dilution, 1:4000) and rabbit anti-Brucella polyclonal antibody (dilution, 1:1500). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 568 antibodies or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) at a 1:4000 dilution. For DNA staining, DAPI dye at 0.5 mg/ml (final concentration) was used. Co-localization was determined by counting the number of bacteria positive for both labels and expressed as the percentage of LAMP-1-positive BCVs. The assays were performed in triplicate, and a minimum of 100 intracellular bacteria (visualized by indirect immunofluorescence) were scored. Images were acquired with a confocal microscope (Olympus F100) at a magnification of ×60 with a lens with a numerical aperture of 1.42. The software MBF ImageJ v1.43 m was used to merge the microscopic images. To analyze the secretion of SepA, J774 A.1 cells were infected with Ba SepA or Ba ΔvirJ SepA strains expressing SepA-3×FLAG (multiplicity of infection, 1000:1). At 4 h post-infection, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for immunofluorescence labeling using rabbit anti-Brucella polyclonal antibody (dilution, 1:1500) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (dilution, 1:4000). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) at a 1:4000 dilution. For DNA staining, DAPI dye was used. Co-localization was determined by counting the number of bacteria positive for both labels and expressed as the percentage of FLAG-positive BCVs. The assays were performed in triplicate, and a minimum of 100 intracellular bacteria (visualized by indirect immunofluorescence) was counted. To analyze the secretion of Bpe123, J774 A.1 cells were infected with Ba Bpe123 or Ba ΔvirJ Bpe123 strains expressing Bpe123–3×FLAG. At 4 h post-infection, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence labeling and co-localization were determined as described above. Analysis of the assembly status of the VirB secretion system in the membrane was performed as described previously (21Del Giudice M.G. Ugalde J.E. Czibener C. A lysozyme-like protein in Brucella abortus is involved in the early stages of intracellular replication.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81: 956-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Brucella whole-cell extracts and cell membranes were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. For cell membranes, non-reducing conditions were preserved. Samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The presence and degree of assembly of the VirB5 and VirB8 proteins was carried out by immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for VirB5 and VirB8 (dilution, 1:2000) and IRDye secondary anti-rabbit antibody (LI-COR, Inc.). All antibodies were diluted in TBS, 1% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween solution. Detection was performed using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR, Inc.). Brucella or E. coli whole-cell extracts were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE (10% or 12.5% depending on the assay) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The presence of 3×FLAG-tagged proteins was carried out by immunoblot analysis using mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (dilution, 1:5000), mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody, mouse anti-SepA or anti-Bpe123 polyclonal antibodies, and IRDye secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (LI-COR, Inc.). All antibodies were diluted in TBS, 1% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween solution. Detection was performed using the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR, Inc.). Mice infections were performed as described previously (22Ugalde J.E. Comerci D.J. Leguizamón M.S. Ugalde R.A.

Groups of five 8- to 9-week-old female BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 1 × 105 CFUs of B. abortus 2308 wild-type, ΔvirJ, or complemented strains in PBS. At 2 weeks post-infection, spleens from infected mice were removed and homogenized in 2 ml of PBS. Serial dilutions from individualized spleens were plated on tryptic soy agar with the appropriate antibiotics to quantify recovered CFUs. Localization assays were performed as described previously (6Döhmer P.H. Valguarnera E. Czibener C. Ugalde J.E.

Pca1p, a cadmium exporter in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is rapidly degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) system via a cis-acting degron that exists at the 250-350 amino acid region of Pca1p and is transferable to other proteins to serve as a degradation signal. Cadmium stabilizes Pca1p in a manner dependent on the degron. This suggested that cadmium-mediated masking of the degron impedes its interaction with the molecular factors involved in the ERAD. The characteristics and mechanisms of action of the degron in Pca1p and most of those in other proteins however remain to be determined. The results presented here indicate that specific cysteine residues in a degron of Pca1p sense cadmium. An unbiased approach selecting non-functional degrons indicated a critical role of hydrophobic amino acids in the degron for its function. A secondary structure modeling predicted the formation of an amphipathic helix. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the functional significance of the hydrophobic patch. Last, hydrophobic amino acids in the degron- and cadmium-binding region affected the interaction of Pca1p with the Ssa1p molecular chaperone, which is involved in ERAD. These results reveal the mechanism of action of the degron, which might be useful for the identification and characterization of other degrons."
https://openalex.org/W2313310596,"The accepted rate rate of caesarean section is 15%. It is expected that an increase in the density of midwives in the family physician program lead to a decrease in this indicator. This study aimed to compare the rates of caesarean section and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery before and after the implementation of the family physician program in health centres with and without an increase in midwives density.In this cross-sectional study, using multistage cluster sampling method a total of 668 mothers with two-month-old children were selected from among all mothers with two-month-old children who were living in rural areas of Kurdistan province. Using the difference-in-differences model and Matchit statistical model, the factors associated with caesarean section rates and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery were compared in centres with and without an increase in midwives density after the implementation of the family physician program. To compare the changes before and after the program, we used the data collected from the same number of women in 2005 as the baseline.After adjusting for baseline data collected in 2005, the resutls showed no significant change in caesarean section rates and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery in the centres with and without an increase in midwives density after the implementation of the family physician program. The Matchit model showed a significant mean increase 14%(0.03-0.25) in women's awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth between 2005 and 2013 in health centres where the density of midwives increased compared with health centres where it did not. The difference-in-differences model showed that the odds ratio of women's preference for caesarean section decreased by 41% among participants who were aware of the benefits of natural childbirth, (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: (0.22-0.85); P>0.001).The results of this study showed that an increase in the density of midwives in the family physician program led to an increase in women's awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth. An increase in women's awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth was associated with a decreased preference for caesarean section, however this reduction did not have a significant impact on caesarean section rates; possibly, this finding might be attributed to the complexity of this problem that needs a mixed strategy involving various stockholders."
https://openalex.org/W2334229838,"Widespread application of β cell replacement to obtain insulin independence in people with type 1 diabetes requires an unlimited source of insulin-producing cells and the ability to block the pathological immune response. Recent reports in Nature Medicine and Nature Biotechnology present a creative bioengineering strategy for achieving these goals. Widespread application of β cell replacement to obtain insulin independence in people with type 1 diabetes requires an unlimited source of insulin-producing cells and the ability to block the pathological immune response. Recent reports in Nature Medicine and Nature Biotechnology present a creative bioengineering strategy for achieving these goals. Despite continual refinements in recombinant insulin and improved insulin delivery systems, the devastating secondary complications of diabetes mellitus continue to impact and claim the lives of the >350 million people worldwide affected by this disease (Shaw et al., 2010Shaw J.E. Sicree R.A. Zimmet P.Z. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2010; 87: 4-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar). β cell replacement therapies, achieved through either solid organ pancreas or islet transplantation, dramatically improve metabolic control without the need for exogenous insulin and stabilize retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Solid organ pancreas transplantation remains the gold standard for achieving long-term insulin independence with outstanding metabolic control for people with type I diabetes (Gruessner and Gruessner, 2013Gruessner R.W. Gruessner A.C. Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2013; 9: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Based on its invasiveness as well as the requirement for lifelong immunosuppression post-transplant, most referrals for pancreas transplantation occur at the onset of end-stage renal failure. At that time, the need for a kidney necessitates lifelong immunosuppression, making simultaneous pancreas allografts more attractive. Unfortunately, by the time end-stage renal failure develops, other secondary complications of diabetes are frequently advanced and irreversible. Cellular transplantation offers the promise of a less-invasive strategy for β cell replacement without a major surgical procedure, thereby justifying earlier intervention prior to the development of the secondary complications of diabetes. Pancreatic islets retrieved from deceased donor pancreata can be percutaneously infused into the portal system and survive long-term within the sinusoids of the liver. Indeed, long-term insulin independence has been achieved following islet transplantation in highly selected type I diabetic recipients, with success rates and costs approximating those of solitary pancreas transplantation in preuremic type I diabetic recipients (Moassesfar et al., 2016Moassesfar S. Masharani U. Frassetto L.A. Szot G.L. Tavakol M. Stock P.G. Posselt A.M. Am. J. Transplant. 2016; 16: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, although islet transplantation avoids the perioperative morbidity of a pancreas transplant, success still depends on aggressive, lifelong immunosuppression and associated risks of infections and malignancies. Furthermore, both islet and pancreas transplantation depend on a scarce resource—the deceased donor pancreas. As a result, only a small fraction of people with type I diabetes can benefit from this life-enhancing therapy. Therefore, research to improve β cell replacement therapies has focused on two goals: (1) creating an unlimited source of β cells and (2) eliminating the need for chronic immunosuppression to protect those β cells from both allo- and autoimmune responses. Recent reports in Nature Medicine (Vegas et al., 2016bVegas A.J. Veiseh O. Gürtler M. Millman J.R. Pagliuca F.W. Bader A.R. Doloff J.C. Li J. Chen M. Olejnik K. et al.Nat.

These advances depend on significant recent progress in technology for generating an unlimited source of insulin-producing cells that phenotypically look and function like normal β cells (Pagliuca et al., 2014Pagliuca F.W.

Bioengineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) successfully protected these insulin-producing cells (Pagliuca et al., 2014Pagliuca F.W. Millman J.R. Gürtler M. Segel M.

Cell. 2014; 159: 428-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) from the immune response using an innovative microencapsulation strategy (Vegas et al., 2016aVegas A.J. Veiseh O. Doloff J.C. Ma M. Tam H.H. Bratlie K. Li J. Bader A.R. Langan E. Olejnik K. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, Vegas et al., 2016bVegas A.J. Veiseh O. Gürtler M. Millman J.R. Pagliuca F.W. Bader A.R. Doloff J.C. Li J. Chen M. Olejnik K. et al.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Since the early trials of islet transplantation nearly 40 years ago, encapsulation has been pursued as a potential strategy to protect islets from the immune response, with the goal of completely eliminating the need for immunosuppressive agents. Success in this field has been elusive, as a semipermeable membrane, which protects islets from the immune system, may limit effective insulin/glucose transfer across the barrier as well as compromise access to sufficient oxygen and nutrients. Microencapsulation of a few islets/β cell clusters or macroencapsulation of large numbers of islets/β cell clusters within a semipermeable device are both limited by an immune response against the synthetic materials containing the tissue (Anderson et al., 2008Anderson J.M. Rodriguez A. Chang D.T. Semin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 86-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (3390) Google Scholar). The potent fibrotic reaction to the encapsulation device further limits transfer of oxygen and nutrients, compromising viability of encapsulated tissue. For this reason, the identification of three tirazole-containing analogs that impede the foreign body reaction to modified alginate present in microcapsules is a major step forward. Importantly, the protected microcapsules contained human stem-cell-derived β cell clusters and were tolerated in both mice and nonhuman primates (Vegas et al., 2016aVegas A.J. Veiseh O. Doloff J.C. Ma M. Tam H.H. Bratlie K. Li J. Bader A.R. Langan E. Olejnik K. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Of equal importance, infusing the microcapsules into the peritoneal cavity of diabetic C57BL/6J mice generated long-term normoglycemia in the absence of immunosuppression (Vegas et al., 2016bVegas A.J. Veiseh O. Gürtler M. Millman J.R. Pagliuca F.W. Bader A.R. Doloff J.C. Li J. Chen M. Olejnik K. et al.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Their use of microencapsulation to prevent an immune response against xenogeneic tissue in a highly reactive strain of mice while maintaining metabolic function is vitally important as a proof of principle that a semipermeable barrier can effectively block the immune response against stem-cell-derived β cells without compromising metabolic function in an immune-competent animal. While these studies provide a useful platform for development of future therapies, there are some practical considerations that may limit clinical translation of this strategy. Most notably, the intraperitoneal dissemination of the microcapsules prevents their recovery, which presents a safety concern and impedes post-transplant analysis. Because the introduction of stem-cell-derived β cells poses potential risks for neoplastic transformation, hypoglycemia, or other unknown adverse outcomes, the early clinical trials will require a retrievable scaffold/device, and this may be more readily achievable with macrovesicular technology. Macrovesicular devices would also facilitate close examination of the retrieved cells. In theory, the risk of neoplastic transformation may be greater with less-differentiated cells, and to address this concern, Vegas and colleagues transplanted a more-differentiated insulin-producing cell than the pancreatic progenitor cells used in previous preclinical models (Kroon et al., 2008Kroon E. Martinson L.A. Kadoya K. Bang A.G. Kelly O.G. Eliazer S. Young H. Richardson M. Smart N.G. Cunningham J. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). While these cells may lower the theoretical risk of neoplastic transformation, long-term studies are needed to verify the actual risk. Until there is a better understanding of what these risks are, we think clinical trials should require a retrievable device that utilizes some combination of microencapsulation, macroencapsulation, and scaffold technologies (see Figure 1). In summary, the advances reported by Vegas and colleagues (Vegas et al., 2016aVegas A.J. Veiseh O. Doloff J.C. Ma M. Tam H.H. Bratlie K. Li J. Bader A.R. Langan E. Olejnik K. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, Vegas et al., 2016bVegas A.J. Veiseh O. Gürtler M. Millman J.R. Pagliuca F.W. Bader A.R. Doloff J.C. Li J. Chen M. Olejnik K. et al.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) have moved us closer to the holy grail of rendering a type 1 diabetic patient free of insulin therapy using β cell replacement from an unlimited source in the absence of immunosuppression. The rigorous scientific approach utilized to develop a nonreactive immune barrier for microencapsulation should be commended. This thoughtful approach should be applied to all potential strategies for protecting β cell clusters from the immune response and will likely require some combination of microencapsulation, macroencapsulation, and scaffolds for structural support. The challenge and burden of maintaining tight blood sugar control with exogenous insulin has a major impact on the quality of life for people with diabetes. This vulnerable population is highly motivated to participate in clinical trials that may eliminate the rigors of insulin administration and prevent the devastating secondary complications of the disease. As we move closer to achieving a true cure for diabetes with cellular therapies in the absence of immunosuppression, it is imperative that the medical/scientific community safely translates these advances to clinical practice using the same scientific rigor that was used by Vegas and colleagues.

All MR images were acquired with fast spin echo (FSE) pulse sequence using two MR scanners (1.5 T and 3.0 T). The stitching procedures for each part of spine MR image were performed and implemented on a graphic user interface (GUI) configuration. Moreover, the stitching process is performed in two categories; manual point-to-point (mPTP) selection that performed by user specified corresponding matching points, and automated point-to-point (aPTP) selection that performed by SIFT algorithm. The stitched images using SIFT algorithm showed fine registered results and quantitatively acquired values also indicated little errors compared with commercially mounted stitching algorithm in MRI systems. Our study presented a preliminary validation of the SIFT algorithm application to MRI spine images, and the results indicated that the proposed approach can be performed well for the improvement of diagnosis. We believe that our approach can be helpful for the clinical application and extension of other medical imaging modalities for image stitching."
https://openalex.org/W2327505733,"CEA is associated with peri-operative risk of brain ischemia, due both to emboli production caused by manipulation of the plaque and to potentially noxious reduction of cerebral blood flow by carotid clamping. Mild hypothermia (34-35°C) is probably the most effective approach to protect brain from ischemic insult. It is therefore a substantial hypothesis that hypothermia lowers the risk of ischemic brain damage potentially associated with CEA. Purpose of the study is to test whether systemic endovascular cooling to a target of 34.5-35°C, initiated before and maintained during CEA, is feasible and safe.The study was carried out in 7 consecutive patients referred to the Vascular Surgery Unit and judged eligible for CEA. Cooling was initiated 60-90 min before CEA, by endovascular approach (Zoll system). The target temperature was maintained during CEA, followed by passive, controlled rewarming (0.4°C/h). The whole procedure was carried out under anesthesia.All the patients enrolled had no adverse events. Two patients exhibited a transient bradycardia (heart rate 30 beats/min). There were no significant differences in the clinical status, laboratory and physiological data measured before and after CEA.Systemic cooling to 34.5-35.0°C, initiated before and maintained during carotid clamping, is feasible and safe.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02629653."
https://openalex.org/W2328793728,"ATP-binding cassette transporters use an alternating access mechanism to move substrates across cellular membranes. This mode of transport ensures the selective passage of molecules while preserving membrane impermeability. The crystal structures of MalFGK2, inward- and outward-facing, show that the transporter is sealed against ions and small molecules. It has yet to be determined whether membrane impermeability is maintained when MalFGK2 cycles between these two conformations. Through the use of a mutant that resides in intermediate conformations close to the transition state, we demonstrate that not only is chloride conductance occurring, but also to a degree large enough to compromise cell viability. Introduction of mutations in the periplasmic gate lead to the formation of a channel that is quasi-permanently open. MalFGK2 must therefore stay away from these ion-conducting conformations to preserve the membrane barrier; otherwise, a few mutations that increase access to the ion-conducting states are enough to convert an ATP-binding cassette transporter into a channel."
https://openalex.org/W2329004613,"Dysfunctions of MeCP2 protein lead to various neurological disorders such as Rett syndrome and Autism. The exact functions of MeCP2 protein is still far from clear. At a molecular level, there exist contradictory data. MeCP2 protein is considered a single immunoreactive band around 75 kDa by western-blot analysis but several reports have revealed the existence of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands above and below the level where MeCP2 is expected. MeCP2 immunoreactive bands have been interpreted in different ways. Some researchers suggest that multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands are unidentified proteins that cross-react with the MeCP2 antibody or degradation product of MeCP2, while others suggest that MeCP2 post-transcriptional processing generates multiple molecular forms linked to cell signaling, but so far they have not been properly analyzed in relation to Rett syndrome experimental models. The purpose of this study is to advance understanding of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control neural cells and p.T158M MeCP2e1 mutant cells. We have generated stable wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Application of N- and C- terminal MeCP2 antibodies, and also, RFP antibody minimized concerns about nonspecific cross-reactivity, since they react with the same antigen at different epitopes. We report the existence of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control cells, stable wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Also, MeCP2 immunoreactive bands differences were found between wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Slower migration phosphorylated band around 70kDa disappeared in p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. These data suggest that threonine 158 could represent an important phosphorylation site potentially involved in protein function. Our results clearly indicate that MeCP2 antibodies have no cross-reactivity with similar epitopes on others proteins, supporting the idea that MeCP2 may exist in multiple different molecular forms and that molecular pattern variations derived from altered post-transcriptional processing may underlay Rett syndrome physiophatology"
