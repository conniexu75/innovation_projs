https://openalex.org/W3175450024,"Abstract Long-term complications after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are common in hospitalized patients, but the spectrum of symptoms in milder cases needs further investigation. We conducted a long-term follow-up in a prospective cohort study of 312 patients—247 home-isolated and 65 hospitalized—comprising 82% of total cases in Bergen during the first pandemic wave in Norway. At 6 months, 61% (189/312) of all patients had persistent symptoms, which were independently associated with severity of initial illness, increased convalescent antibody titers and pre-existing chronic lung disease. We found that 52% (32/61) of home-isolated young adults, aged 16–30 years, had symptoms at 6 months, including loss of taste and/or smell (28%, 17/61), fatigue (21%, 13/61), dyspnea (13%, 8/61), impaired concentration (13%, 8/61) and memory problems (11%, 7/61). Our findings that young, home-isolated adults with mild COVID-19 are at risk of long-lasting dyspnea and cognitive symptoms highlight the importance of infection control measures, such as vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3175922295,"The mammalian cerebral cortex has an unparalleled diversity of cell types, which are generated during development through a series of temporally orchestrated events that are under tight evolutionary constraint and are critical for proper cortical assembly and function1,2. However, the molecular logic that governs the establishment and organization of cortical cell types remains unknown, largely due to the large number of cell classes that undergo dynamic cell-state transitions over extended developmental timelines. Here we generate a comprehensive atlas of the developing mouse neocortex, using single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing. We sampled the neocortex every day throughout embryonic corticogenesis and at early postnatal ages, and complemented the sequencing data with a spatial transcriptomics time course. We computationally reconstruct developmental trajectories across the diversity of cortical cell classes, and infer their spatial organization and the gene regulatory programs that accompany their lineage bifurcation decisions and differentiation trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate how this developmental map pinpoints the origin of lineage-specific developmental abnormalities that are linked to aberrant corticogenesis in mutant mice. The data provide a global picture of the regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular diversification in the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W3176137376,"In diseased organs, stress-activated signalling cascades alter chromatin, thereby triggering maladaptive cell state transitions. Fibroblast activation is a common stress response in tissues that worsens lung, liver, kidney and heart disease, yet its mechanistic basis remains unclear1,2. Pharmacological inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins alleviates cardiac dysfunction3–7, providing a tool to interrogate and modulate cardiac cell states as a potential therapeutic approach. Here we use single-cell epigenomic analyses of hearts dynamically exposed to BET inhibitors to reveal a reversible transcriptional switch that underlies the activation of fibroblasts. Resident cardiac fibroblasts demonstrated robust toggling between the quiescent and activated state in a manner directly correlating with BET inhibitor exposure and cardiac function. Single-cell chromatin accessibility revealed previously undescribed DNA elements, the accessibility of which dynamically correlated with cardiac performance. Among the most dynamic elements was an enhancer that regulated the transcription factor MEOX1, which was specifically expressed in activated fibroblasts, occupied putative regulatory elements of a broad fibrotic gene program and was required for TGFβ-induced fibroblast activation. Selective CRISPR inhibition of the single most dynamic cis-element within the enhancer blocked TGFβ-induced Meox1 activation. We identify MEOX1 as a central regulator of fibroblast activation associated with cardiac dysfunction and demonstrate its upregulation after activation of human lung, liver and kidney fibroblasts. The plasticity and specificity of BET-dependent regulation of MEOX1 in tissue fibroblasts provide previously unknown trans- and cis-targets for treating fibrotic disease. BET proteins regulate a reversible transcriptional switch that governs fibroblast activation in heart disease through the transcription factor MEOX1."
https://openalex.org/W3175575573,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a devastating global pandemic, infecting over 43 million people and claiming over 1 million lives, with these numbers increasing daily. Therefore, there is urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, immune evasion, and disease progression. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can block IRF3 and NF-κB activation early during virus infection. We also identify that the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins NSP1 and NSP13 can block interferon activation via distinct mechanisms. NSP1 antagonizes interferon signaling by suppressing host mRNA translation, while NSP13 downregulates interferon and NF-κB promoter signaling by limiting TBK1 and IRF3 activation, as phospho-TBK1 and phospho-IRF3 protein levels are reduced with increasing levels of NSP13 protein expression. NSP13 can also reduce NF-κB activation by both limiting NF-κB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Last, we also show that NSP13 binds to TBK1 and downregulates IFIT1 protein expression. Collectively, these data illustrate that SARS-CoV-2 bypasses multiple innate immune activation pathways through distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3174286252,"Changing food preferences brought about by westernization that have deleterious health effects1,2-combined with myriad forces that are contributing to increased food insecurity-are catalysing efforts to identify more nutritious and affordable foods3. Consumption of dietary fibre can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity4-6. A substantial number of reports have explored the effects of dietary fibre on the gut microbial community7-9. However, the microbiome is complex, dynamic and exhibits considerable intra- and interpersonal variation in its composition and functions. The large number of potential interactions between the components of the microbiome makes it challenging to define the mechanisms by which food ingredients affect community properties. Here we address the question of how foods containing different fibre preparations can be designed to alter functions associated with specific components of the microbiome. Because a marked increase in snack consumption is associated with westernization, we formulated snack prototypes using plant fibres from different sustainable sources that targeted distinct features of the gut microbiomes of individuals with obesity when transplanted into gnotobiotic mice. We used these snacks to supplement controlled diets that were consumed by adult individuals with obesity or who were overweight. Fibre-specific changes in their microbiomes were linked to changes in their plasma proteomes indicative of an altered physiological state."
https://openalex.org/W3173966488,"Background Scientists across the world are working on innovating a successful vaccine that will save lives and end COVID-19 pandemic. World Health Organization (WHO) is working to make sure COVID-19 vaccines can be safely delivered to all those who need them. Indeed, the successful deployment and a sufficient uptake of vaccines is equally important. Acceptance and accessibility of such vaccine is a key indicator of vaccination coverage. Objective This study aimed to assess the determinants of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among school teachers in Gondar City. Methods An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from December, 2020 to January, 2021. A total of 301 school teachers selected using stratified simple random sampling were included. Descriptive analysis such as medians, means, proportions, standard deviations and frequencies were computed. Linear regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results The median intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine was 3.33 with interquartile range of 2.67–4.0. Of the participants 54.8% had scored above the median of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine score. 54% variance in intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine was explained by the independent variables. Being affiliated with other category of religion, bachelor degree educational status, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, and cues to action were significantly associated with the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion The median score of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine was 3.33. Socio-demographic and health beliefs influenced the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the study participant. Policy makers and stakeholders should focus on strong health promotion about risks of the pandemic, benefit, safety, and efficacy of vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3175578593,"Background Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities for testing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients. Methods We conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio ™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS during the second pandemic wave in Switzerland. Results 402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT clinical sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2–86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a clinical specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9–99.9) for the Ag-RDT. For cycle threshold values ≤ 26.7 (≥ 1E6 SARS-CoV-2 genomes copies/mL, a presumed cut-off for infectious virus), 96.3% sensitivity (95%CI: 90.7–99.0%) was obtained with the Ag-RDT using OPS. Interpretation Based on our findings, the diagnostic performance of the Panbio ™ Covid-19 RDT with OPS samples, if taken by a trained person and high requirements regarding quality of the specimen, meet the criteria required by the WHO for Ag-RDTs (sensitivity ≥80% and specificity ≥97%) in a high incidence setting in symptomatic individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3173989195,"Background Like many other women in the developing world, the practice of breast cancer screening among Ghanaian women is unsatisfactory. As a result, many cases are diagnosed at advanced stages leading to poor outcomes including mortalities. An understanding of the awareness and predictors of breast examination is an important first step that may guide the design of interventions aimed at raising awareness across the general population. This study aimed to explore the awareness, risk factors, and self-reported screening practices of breast cancer among female undergraduate students at the University of Health and Allied Sciences. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 385 female undergraduate students using a pre-tested questionnaire. Data were analysed using Stata Version 13.1 and presented using descriptive and inferential statistics comprising frequency, percentage, chi-square, and binary logistic regression. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed to quantify the association between regular Breast-Self Examination (BSE) and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. Results Seventy-three per cent of the students were aware of breast cancer, with social media being the most important source of information (64.4%). The prevalence of breast cancer risk factors varied from 1% of having a personal history of breast cancer to 14.3% for positive family history of breast cancer. Current use of oral pills/injectable contraceptives was confirmed by 13.2% of participants; 20% were current alcohol users and10.1% were physically inactive. Regarding breast examination, 42.6% performed BSE; 10.1% had Clinical Breast Examination (CBE), while 2.3% had undergone mammography in the three years preceding the study. Women who did not believe to be susceptible to breast cancer (AOR: 0.04; 95%CI: 0.02–0.09) and those who did not know their risk status (AOR: 0.02; 95%CI: 0.005–0.57) were less likely to perform regular BSE compared to those who displayed pessimism. Further, women with no religious affiliation had 0.11 (95%CI: 0.02–0.55) odds of examining their breast regularly compared to Christians. Conclusion This study demonstrated moderate awareness of the modalities of breast cancer screening and the risk factors of breast cancer among the students. However, there exists a gap between awareness and practice of breast cancer screening, which was influenced by optimism in breast cancer risk perception and religion. Awareness campaigns and education should be intensified in the University to bridge this gap."
https://openalex.org/W3175881832,"Although both leukocytosis and leukopenia have been considered Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria, leukopenia is not generally considered a normal response to infection. We sought to evaluate the prognostic validity of leukopenia as a sign of sepsis-defining hematological organ dysfunction within the Sepsis-3 framework. We hypothesized that leukopenia is associated with higher risk of mortality than leukocytosis among patients with suspected infection.We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Medical Information Mart v1.4 in Intensive Care-III database. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the association between leukopenia and mortality in patients with suspected infection defined by Sepsis-3.We identified 5,909 ICU patients with suspected infection; 250 (4.2%) had leukopenia. Leukopenia was associated with increased in-hospital mortality compared with leukocytosis (OR, 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-1.9). After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities in the Sepsis-3 consensus model, leukopenia remained associated with increased risk of mortality compared with leukocytosis (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). Further adjustment for the platelet component of the SOFA attenuated the association between leukopenia and mortality (OR decreased from 1.5 to 1.1). However, 83 (1.4%) of patients had leukopenia without thrombocytopenia and 14 had leukopenia prior to thrombocytopenia.Among ICU patients with suspected infection, leukopenia was associated with increased risk of death compared with leukocytosis. Due to correlation with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia did not independently improve the prognostic validity of SOFA; however, leukopenia may present as a sign of sepsis prior to thrombocytopenia in a small subset of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3174451709,"Abstract Congenital myasthenia (CM) is a devastating neuromuscular disease, and mutations in DOK7, an adaptor protein that is crucial for forming and maintaining neuromuscular synapses, are a major cause of CM 1,2 . The most common disease-causing mutation ( DOK7 1124_1127 dup ) truncates DOK7 and leads to the loss of two tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated and recruit CRK proteins, which are important for anchoring acetylcholine receptors at synapses. Here we describe a mouse model of this common form of CM ( Dok7 CM mice) and a mouse with point mutations in the two tyrosine residues ( Dok7 2YF ). We show that Dok7 CM mice had severe deficits in neuromuscular synapse formation that caused neonatal lethality. Unexpectedly, these deficits were due to a severe deficiency in phosphorylation and activation of muscle-specific kinase (MUSK) rather than a deficiency in DOK7 tyrosine phosphorylation. We developed agonist antibodies against MUSK and show that these antibodies restored neuromuscular synapse formation and prevented neonatal lethality and late-onset disease in Dok7 CM mice. These findings identify an unexpected cause for disease and a potential therapy for both DOK7 CM and other forms of CM caused by mutations in AGRIN , LRP4 or MUSK , and illustrate the potential of targeted therapy to rescue congenital lethality."
https://openalex.org/W3175963035,"Probiotics are health beneficial bacterial populations colonizing the human gut and skin. Probiotics are believed to be involved in immune system regulation, gut microbiota stabilization, prevention of infectious diseases, and adjustments of host metabolic activities. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium affect glycemic levels, blood lipids, and protein metabolism. However, the interactions between probiotics and metabolic diseases as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic animal models to study the effect of Probioglu TM , a multi-strain probiotic supplement including Lactobaccilus salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32, L . johnsonii MH-68, L . reuteri GL-104, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CP-9, on the regulation of physiochemical parameters related to type-2 diabetes. Experimental rats were randomly assigned into five groups, control group, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats (STZ group), STZ + 1× Probioglu TM group, STZ + 5× Probioglu TM group, and STZ + 10× Probioglu TM group, and physiological data were measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Our results indicate that supplementation with Probioglu TM significantly improved glucose tolerance, glycemic levels, insulin levels, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Furthermore, we observed reduction in urea and blood lipid levels, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (TC). Probioglu TM administration increased the β-cell mass in STZ-induced diabetic animal models, whereas it reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. In addition, the enhancement of oxidative stress biomarkers and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities was associated with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. We conclude that Probioglu TM attenuates STZ-induced type-2 diabetes by protecting β-cells, stabilizing glycemic levels, and reducing inflammation. Among all probiotic treating groups, the 10×Probioglu TM treatment revealed the best results. However, these experimental results still need to be validated by different animal models of type-2 diabetes and human clinical trials in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3175612184,"The distribution of multiscale pores and fractures in coal and rock is an important basis for reflecting the capacity of fluid flow in coal seam seepage passages. Accurate extraction and qualitative and quantitative analysis of pore-fracture structures are helpful in revealing the flow characteristics of fluid in seepage channels. The relationship between pore and fracture connectivity can provide a scientific reference for optimizing coal seam water injection parameters. Therefore, to analyse the change in permeability caused by the variability in the coal pore-fracture network structure, a CT scanning technique was used to scan coal samples from the Leijia District, Fuxin. A total of 720 sets of original images were collected, a median filter was used to filter out the noise in the obtained images, and to form the basis of a model, the reconstruction and analysis of the three-dimensional pore-fracture morphology of coal samples were carried out. A pore-fracture network model of the coal body was extracted at different scales. Using the maximum sphere algorithm combined with the coordination number, the effect of different quantitative relationships between pore size and pore throat channel permeability was studied. Avizo software was used to simulate the flow path of fluid in the seepage channels. The change trend of the fluid velocity between different seepage channels was discussed. The results of the pore-fracture network models at different scales show that the pore-fracture structure is nonuniform and vertically connected, and the pores are connected at connecting points. The pore size distribution ranges from 104 μm to 9425 μm. The pore throat channel length distribution ranges from 4206 μm to 48073 μm. The size of the coordination number determines the connectivity and thus the porosity of the coal seam. The more connected pore channels there are, the larger the pore diameters and the stronger the percolation ability. During flow in the seepage channels of the coal, the velocity range is divided into a low-speed region, medium-speed region and high-speed region. The fluid seepage in the coal seam is driven by the following factors: pore connectivity > pore and pore throat dimensions > pore and pore throat structure distribution. Ultimately, the pore radius and pore connectivity directly affect the permeability of the coal seam."
https://openalex.org/W3177235330,"Clubroot is one of the most serious diseases affecting Brassicaceae plants worldwide. However, there is no effective control method for clubroot. Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant hormone that plays a critical role in plant defense. In our study, we found the disease severity of a clubroot-sensitive cultivar of pakchoi, Xinxiaqing, was reduced with 0.6mM exogenous SA after the infection of P. brassicae. To investigate the mechanism of SA-reduced disease severity against clubroot, then we analyzed the plant growth, alteration of antioxidant enzyme system, and related gene expression of Xinxiaqing. Results showed that the clubroot incidence rate and disease index were decreased after being treated with 0.6 mM exogenous SA. Furthermore, plant growth, reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, and membrane lipid peroxidation were changed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbic acid-peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), were increased. Additionally, the production rates of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anion (O2·-) were also inhibited. The expression levels of genes, encoding SOD, APX, CAT, and GR, were increased. By summering all results, we conclude that 0.6 mM SA contributes to the reduction of disease severity to clubroot by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, abilities of osmotic regulation, and ROS scavenging to reduce the clubroot-induced damage in pakchoi."
https://openalex.org/W3080170698,"Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) represents a global threat owing to its ability to resist most of the currently available antimicrobial agents. Moreover, emergence of carbapenem resistant A. baumannii (CR-AB) isolates limits the available treatment options. Enzymatic degradation by variety of ß-lactamases, have been identified as the most common mechanism of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii. The alarming increase in the prevalence of CR-AB necessitates continuous screening and molecular characterization to appreciate the problem. The present study was performed to assess the prevalence and characterize carbapenemases among 206 CR-AB isolated from various clinical specimens collected from different intensive care units at Kasr Al-Aini Hospital. All isolates were confirmed to be A. baumannii by detection of the blaOXA-51-like gene. Molecular screening of 13 common Ambler class bla carbapenemases genes in addition to insertion sequence (IS-1) upstream OXA-23 were performed by using four sets of multiplex PCR, followed by identification using gene sequencing technology. Among the investigated genes, the prevalence of blaOXA-23, and blaOXA-58 were 77.7%, and 1.9%, respectively. The ISAba1 was detected in 10% of the blaOXA-23 positive isolates. The prevalence of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) studied; blaNDM-1, blaSPM, blaVIM, blaSIM-1 were 11.7%, 6.3%, 0.5%, and 0.5% respectively. One of class A; bla KPC was detected in 10.7% of the investigated isolates. blaOXA-24/40, blaIMP, blaGES, blaVEB and blaGIM were not detected in any of the studied isolates. Moreover, 18.4% of the isolates have shown to harbor two or more of the screened bla genes. We concluded that the most prevalent type of ß-lactamases genes among CR-AB isolates collected from Egyptian patients were blaOXA-23 followed by blaNDM-1 and blaKPC."
https://openalex.org/W3173717575,"Among cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers, the mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) is a promising candidate. A growing attention has been also dedicated to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), an oxidative derivative of the gut metabolite trimethylamine (TMA). With the aim to identify biomarkers predictive of CVD, we investigated TMA, TMAO, and mtDNAcn in a population of 389 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 151 healthy controls, in association with established risk factors for CVD (sex, age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) and troponin, an established marker of CAD. MtDNAcn was significantly lower in CAD patients; it correlates with GFR and TMA, but not with TMAO. A biomarker including mtDNAcn, sex, and hypertension (but neither TMA nor TMAO) emerged as a good predictor of CAD. Our findings support the mtDNAcn as a promising plastic biomarker, useful to monitor the exposure to risk factors and the efficacy of preventive interventions for a personalized CAD risk reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3173170212,"Mental wellness is an important topic among practicing veterinarians. Peer reviewed studies focusing on veterinary house officers' wellbeing are lacking in veterinary medicine. The aim of this study was to assess wellbeing of house officers using validated surveys for anxiety, burnout, depression, and quality of life. A cross-sectional survey of 103 house officers (residents, interns, and fellows) was performed. Respondents were invited to voluntarily complete the online surveys. Anxiety, burnout, depression, and quality of life were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Short Form-8 (SF-8), respectively. Descriptive statistics were calculated. For qualitative analysis, respondents were requested to rate their perception of the level of stress regarding various work-related stressors. The first survey was completed in 2017 with 60 respondents of which 51 (85%) identified as females and nine (15%) identified as males. The second survey was completed in 2018 with 43 respondents of which 35 (81.4%) identified as females and 8 (18.6%) identified as males. Respondents reported high levels of burnout characterized by high levels of emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment but reported mild levels of anxiety and depression. The mental component of their quality of life score was lower than the general US population, whereas the physical component score was consistent with the general US population. Respondents indicated moderate scores of stress for concerns regarding patient management, research, teaching, work-life balance, relationships, organizational skills, time management, finances, and the mental and emotional impact of the work environment. The high levels of burnout, and low mental quality of life in house officers require specific intervention programs to improve wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3174123270,"Our objective was to examine conflicts of interest between the UK's health-focused All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) and the pharmaceutical industry between 2012 and 2018. APPGs are informal cross-party groups revolving around a particular topic run by and for Members of the UK's Houses of Commons and Lords. They facilitate engagement between parliamentarians and external organisations, disseminate knowledge, and generate debate through meetings, publications, and events. We identified APPGs focusing on physical or mental health, wellbeing, health care, or treatment and extracted details of their payments from external donors disclosed on the Register for All-Party Parliamentary Groups. We identified all donors which were pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical industry-funded patient organisations. We established that sixteen of 146 (11%) health-related APPGs had conflicts of interest indicated by reporting payments from thirty-five pharmaceutical companies worth £1,211,345.81 (16.6% of the £7,283,414.90 received by all health-related APPGs). Two APPGs (Health and Cancer) received more than half of the total value provided by drug companies. Fifty APPGs also had received payments from patient organisations with conflicts of interest, indicated by reporting 304 payments worth £986,054.94 from 57 (of 84) patient organisations which had received £27,883,556.3 from pharmaceutical companies across the same period. In total, drug companies and drug industry-funded patient organisations provided a combined total of £2,197,400.75 (30.2% of all funding received by health-related APPGs) and 468 (of 1,177-39.7%) payments to 58 (of 146-39.7%) health-related APPGs, with the APPG for Cancer receiving the most funding. In conclusion, we found evidence of conflicts of interests through APPGs receiving substantial income from pharmaceutical companies. Policy influence exerted by the pharmaceutical industry needs to be examined holistically, with an emphasis on relationships between actors potentially playing part in its lobbying campaigns. We also suggest ways of improving transparency of payment reporting by APPGs and pharmaceutical companies."

Results from PSM showed that land circulation could significantly increase farmers’ decisions to plant food crops, which confirms the positive effect of rural land circulation on the “grain orientation” of crop planting structure. Results from GPSM further indicate that the total land circulation, the paddy land circulation, and the dry land circulation all have significantly positive effects on planting structure adjustment towards “grain orientation.” Additionally, planting structure adjustment towards “grain orientation” increases as the scale of land circulation increases, and the former shows a higher rate of increase than the latter, which confirms that rural land circulation facilitates an adjustment in structure towards planting food crops."
https://openalex.org/W3174604867,"This study approaches the investigation of the simplification hypotheses in corpus-based translation studies from a syntactic complexity perspective. The research is based on two comparable corpora, the English monolingual part of COCE (Corpus of Chinese-English) and the native English corpus of FLOB (Freiburg-LOB Corpus of British English). Using the 13 syntactic complexity measures falling into five subconstructs (i.e. length of production unit, amount of subordination, amount of coordination, phrasal complexity and overall sentence complexity), our results show that translation as a whole is less complex compared to non-translation, reflected most prominently in the amount of subordination and overall sentence complexity. Further pairwise comparison of the four subgenres of the corpora shows mixed results. Specifically, the translated news is homogenous to native news as evidenced by the complexity measures; the translated genres of general prose and academic writing are less complex compared to their native counterparts while translated fiction is more complex than non-translated fiction. It was found that mean sentence length always produced a significant effect on syntactic complexity, with higher syntactic complexity for longer sentence lengths in both corpora. ANOVA test shows a highly significant main effect of translation status, with higher syntactic complexity in the non-translated texts (FLOB) than the translated texts (COCE), which provides support for the simplification hypothesis in translation. It is also found that, apart from translation status, genre is an important variable in affecting the complexity level of translated texts. Our study offers new insights into the investigation of simplification hypothesis from the perspective of translation from English into Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W3176434780,"Exposure to particulate matter has been shown to increase the adhesion of bacteria to human airway epithelial cells. However, the impact of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on the respiratory microbiome is unknown.Forty children were recruited through the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, a longitudinal cohort followed from birth through early adolescence. Saliva and induced sputum were collected at age 14 years. Exposure to TRAP was characterized from birth through the time of sample collection using a previously validated land-use regression model. Sequencing of the bacterial 16S and ITS fungal rRNA genes was performed on sputum and saliva samples. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa and diversity indices were compared in children with exposure to high and low TRAP. We also used multiple linear regression to assess the effect of TRAP exposure, gender, asthma status, and socioeconomic status on the alpha diversity of bacteria in sputum.We observed higher bacterial alpha diversity indices in sputum than in saliva. The diversity indices for bacteria were greater in the high TRAP exposure group than the low exposure group. These differences remained after adjusting for asthma status, gender, and mother's education. No differences were observed in the fungal microbiome between TRAP exposure groups.Our findings indicate that exposure to TRAP in early childhood and adolescence may be associated with greater bacterial diversity in the lower respiratory tract. Asthma status does not appear to confound the observed differences in diversity. These results demonstrate that there may be a TRAP-exposure related change in the lower respiratory microbiota that is independent of asthma status."
https://openalex.org/W3177286580,"Increasing salinity is one of the major drawbacks for plant growth. Besides the ion itself being toxic to plant cells, it greatly interferes with the supply of other macronutrients like potassium, calcium and magnesium. However, little is known about how sodium affects the translocation of these nutrients from the root to the shoot. The major driving force of this translocation process is thought to be the water flow through the xylem driven by transpiration. To dissect the effects of transpiration from those of salinity we compared salt stressed, ABA treated and combined salt- and ABA treated poplars with untreated controls. Salinity reduced the root content of major nutrients like K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. Less Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the roots resulted in reduced leaf Ca2+ and leaf Mg2+ levels due to reduced stomatal conductance and reduced transpiration. Interestingly, leaf K+ levels were positively affected in leaves under salt stress although there was less K+ in the roots under salt. In response to ABA, transpiration was also decreased and Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels decreased comparably to the salt stress treatment, while K+ levels were not affected. Thus, our results suggest that loading and retention of leaf K+ is enhanced under salt stress compared to merely transpiration driven cation supply."
https://openalex.org/W3177420596,"In light of the role that airborne transmission plays in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ongoing high global mortality from well-known airborne diseases such as tuberculosis and measles, there is an urgent need for practical ways of identifying congregate spaces where low ventilation levels contribute to high transmission risk. Poorly ventilated clinic spaces in particular may be high risk, due to the presence of both infectious and susceptible people. While relatively simple approaches to estimating ventilation rates exist, the approaches most frequently used in epidemiology cannot be used where occupancy varies, and so cannot be reliably applied in many of the types of spaces where they are most needed.The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of a non-steady state method to estimate the absolute ventilation rate, which can be applied in rooms where occupancy levels vary. We used data from a room in a primary healthcare clinic in a high TB and HIV prevalence setting, comprising indoor and outdoor carbon dioxide measurements and head counts (by age), taken over time. Two approaches were compared: approach 1 using a simple linear regression model and approach 2 using an ordinary differential equation model.The absolute ventilation rate, Q, using approach 1 was 2407 l/s [95% CI: 1632-3181] and Q from approach 2 was 2743 l/s [95% CI: 2139-4429].We demonstrate two methods that can be used to estimate ventilation rate in busy congregate settings, such as clinic waiting rooms. Both approaches produced comparable results, however the simple linear regression method has the advantage of not requiring room volume measurements. These methods can be used to identify poorly-ventilated spaces, allowing measures to be taken to reduce the airborne transmission of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, and SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3173654599,"Eating chocolate in the morning or in the evening/at night, may differentially affect energy balance and impact body weight due to changes in energy intake, substrate oxidation, microbiota (composition/function), and circadian-related variables. In a randomized controlled trial, postmenopausal females (n = 19) had 100 g of chocolate in the morning (MC), in the evening/at night (EC), or no chocolate (N) for 2 weeks and ate any other food ad libitum. Our results show that 14 days of chocolate intake did not increase body weight. Chocolate consumption decreased hunger and desire for sweets (P < .005), and reduced ad libitum energy intake by ~300 kcal/day during MC and ~150 kcal/day during EC (P = .01), but did not fully compensate for the extra energy contribution of chocolate (542 kcal/day). EC increased physical activity by +6.9%, heat dissipation after meals +1.3%, and carbohydrate oxidation by +35.3% (P < .05). MC reduced fasting glucose (4.4%) and waist circumference (−1.7%) and increased lipid oxidation (+25.6%). Principal component analyses showed that both timings of chocolate intake resulted in differential microbiota profiles and function (P < .05). Heat map of wrist temperature and sleep records showed that EC induced more regular timing of sleep episodes with lower variability of sleep onset among days than MC (60 min vs 78 min; P = .028). In conclusion, having chocolate in the morning or in the evening/night results in differential effects on hunger and appetite, substrate oxidation, fasting glucose, microbiota (composition and function), and sleep and temperature rhythms. Results highlight that the “when” we eat is a relevant factor to consider in energy balance and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3175754700,"The scale-up of indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets, together with other interventions have considerably reduced the malaria burden in The Gambia. This study examined the biting and resting preferences of the local insecticide-resistant vector populations few years following scale-up of anti-vector interventions.Indoor and outdoor-resting Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were collected between July and October 2019 from ten villages in five regions in The Gambia using pyrethrum spray collection (indoor) and prokopack aspirator from pit traps (outdoor). Polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to identify molecular species, insecticide resistance mutations, Plasmodium infection rate and host blood meal.A total of 844 mosquitoes were collected both indoors (421, 49.9%) and outdoors (423, 50.1%). Four main vector species were identified, including An. arabiensis (indoor: 15%, outdoor: 26%); An. coluzzii (indoor: 19%, outdoor: 6%), An. gambiae s.s. (indoor: 11%, outdoor: 16%), An. melas (indoor: 2%, outdoor: 0.1%) and hybrids of An. coluzzii-An. gambiae s.s (indoors: 3%, outdoors: 2%). A significant preference for outdoor resting was observed in An. arabiensis (Pearson X2 = 22.7, df = 4, P<0.001) and for indoor resting in An. coluzzii (Pearson X2 = 55.0, df = 4, P<0.001). Prevalence of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc)-1014S was significantly higher in the indoor-resting (allele freq. = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.78-1, P = 0.03) than outdoor-resting (allele freq. = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.76-0.87) An. arabiensis population. For An. coluzzii, the prevalence of most mutation markers was higher in the outdoor (allele freq. = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.81-0.98) than indoor-resting (allele freq. = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.56-0.86) mosquitoes. However, in An. gambiae s.s., the prevalence of Vgsc-1014F, Vgsc-1575Y and GSTe2-114T was high (allele freq. = 0.96-1), but did not vary by resting location. The overall sporozoite positivity rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.5-2%) in mosquito populations. Indoor-resting An. coluzzii had mainly fed on human blood while indoor-resting An. arabiensis fed on animal blood.In this study, high levels of resistance mutations were observed that could be influencing the mosquito populations to rest indoors or outdoors. The prevalent animal-biting behaviour demonstrated in the mosquito populations suggest that larval source management could be an intervention to complement vector control in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W3174319977,"Mixed economies provide a unique context for testing theories of fertility change. Because they have a stake in two traditions, mixed-economy households balance the demands of both a labor-based subsistence economy, which benefits from a large family, and a wage-labor economy, which benefits from reduced fertility. Additionally, household size changes over the course of its life-cycle and shapes available economic opportunities. Here we argue that in mixed economies, fertility may reflect opportunities for livelihood diversity rather than simply responding to the restricted socioeconomic benefits of small families. While low fertility may in some cases have an economic benefit, low fertility can also limit the livelihood diversity of a household which is a key strategy for long-term economic success. We test this prediction with longitudinal data from a Maya community undergoing both a sustained decline in fertility and rapid integration into the market economy. Using household-level fertility, number of adults, and livelihood diversity at two time points, we find that household size is positively related to livelihood diversity, which in turn is positively related to household income per-capita. However, household size also has a negative association with income per capita. The results reflect a balancing act whereby households attempt to maximize the economic diversity with as few members as possible. Broadly, these results suggest that theories of fertility decline must account for how households pool resources and diversify economic activities in the face of increasing market integration, treating fertility as both an outcome and an input into economic and reproductive decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3174545448,"The burden of STIs is particularly high in HIV-infected MSM patients. A recent increase in STIs prevalence has been noticed in the US and western European countries. We aim to assess trends in asymptomatic STIs following the publication of recommendations for STIs screening, i.e. Chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (NG). Seventeen centers located in the Paris area participated in the study. All asymptomatic HIV-infected MSM patients attending a follow up consultation were proposed to participated in the study. Asymptomatic patients were included over 2 periods: period 1 from April to December 2015 and period 2 from September to December 2017. Etiologic diagnosis of STIs including hepatitis B, C, syphilis, was performed using a serological test, including a non-treponemal titer with a confirmatory treponemal assay for syphilis. CT and NG were screened using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs) on 3 anatomical sites, i.e. urine, rectal and pharyngeal. Overall, 781 patients were included: 490 and 291 in periods 1 and 2 respectively. Asymptomatic CT, NG, and syphilis were diagnosed in 7.5%, 4.8% and, 4.2% respectively. The rate of patients having a multisite asymptomatic infection was 10.2% and 21.1% for CT and NG respectively. The most frequently involved anatomical sites for CT and NG asymptomatic infections were anorectal (66.1% and 55.2% respectively) and pharyngeal (47.4% and 60.5% respectively). CT and NG asymptomatic infection increased by 1.3- and 2-fold respectively between the two periods while syphilis decreased by 3 folds. Our results encourage to reconsider multisite screening for CT and NG in asymptomatic HIV positive MSM as the yield of screening urinary samples only might be low. Despite the more systematic STI screening of asymptomatic HIV positive MSM the prevalence of STI is increasing in MSM in France. Therefore, this strategy has not led to alter CT and NG transmission. The decrease of syphilis might involve self-medication by doxycycline, and the intensification of syphilis screening."
https://openalex.org/W3173869137,"Since the first case reported of SARS-CoV-2 the end of December 2019 in China, the number of cases quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend, demonstrating that a global pandemic is possible. As of December 3, 2020, the total number of cases reported are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000 deaths affecting 218 countries and territories. In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered in a hard way, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, namely COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step phenomenological epidemic approach. First, we use a simple generalized growth model to fit the main parameters at the early epidemic phase; later, we apply our previous finding over a logistic growth model to that characterize both waves completely. The results show that even in the absence of accurate data series, it is possible to characterize the curves of case incidence, and construct a short-term forecast of 60 days in the near time horizon, in relation to the expected total duration of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3174435277,"Vascular epiphytes represent almost 10% of all terrestrial plant diversity. Being structurally dependent on trees, epiphytes live at the interface of vegetation and atmosphere, making them susceptible to atmospheric changes. Despite the extensive research on vascular epiphytes, little is known about wind disturbance on these plants. Therefore, this study investigated the wind-epiphyte mechanical interactions by quantifying the drag forces on epiphytic bromeliads when subjected to increasing wind speeds (5–22 m s -1 ) in a wind tunnel. Drag coefficients ( C d ) and Vogel exponents ( B ) were calculated to quantify the streamlining ability of different bromeliad species. Bromeliads’ reconfiguration occurred first via bending and aligning leaves in the flow direction. Then leaves clustered and reduced the overall plant frontal area. This reconfiguration caused drag forces to increase at a slower rate as wind velocity increased. In the extreme case, drag force was reduced by 50% in a large Guzmania monostachia individual at a wind velocity of 22 m s -1 , compared to a stiff model. This species had one of the smallest C d (0.58) at the highest wind velocity, and the largest negative mean B (-0.98), representing the largest reconfiguration capacity amongst the tested bromeliads. The streamlining ability of bromeliads was mainly restricted by the rigidity of the lower part of the plant where the leaves are already densely clustered. Wind speeds used in this study were generally low as compared to storm force winds. At these low wind speeds, reconfiguration was an effective mechanism for drag reduction in bromeliads. This mechanism is likely to lose its effectiveness at higher wind speeds when continuous vigorous fluttering results in leaf damage and aspects such as root-attachment strength and substrate stability become more relevant. This study is a first step towards an understanding of the mechanical bottleneck in the epiphyte-tree-system under wind stress."
https://openalex.org/W3174640653,"Background The effects of long-term cigarette smoke exposure on pulmonary physiology and how those effects lead to reduced exercise capacity are not well established. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the spirometry, single-breath gas transfer (DLCO), peripheral muscle strength, and maximum exercise capacity data in patients referred to McMaster University Medical Centre for cardiopulmonary exercise testing between 2000 and 2012. Results 29,441 subjects underwent CPET and had a recorded smoking history [58% male, mean age 51.1 years (S.D.±19.6), BMI 27.4 kg/m 2 (±5.8)]. 7081 (24%) were current or former smokers and were divided into 4 categories by packs years (mean ±S.D.): &lt;10 (5.8±3.3), 10–20 (17.1±2.9), 20–30 (27.1±2.8), 30–40 (37.3±2.8), and &gt;40 (53.9±12.8). Patients with greater cigarette smoke exposure had lower expiratory flow rates (FEV1, FEF50, FEF75, PEFR), DLCO, and maximum power output (MPO) during exercise. There was no association between smoke exposure and muscle strength. Modeling MPO (kpm/min) output as a function of demographic and physiologic variables showed that the data are well explained by muscle strength (kg), FEV1 (L), and DLCO (mmHg/min/mL) in similar magnitude (MPO = 42.7*Quads 0.34 *FEV1 0.34 * DLCO 0.43 ; r = 0.84). Conclusions Long-term cigarette smoke exposure is associated with small airway narrowing and impaired diffusion capacity but not with peripheral muscle weakness. The effects of smoking, age, and gender on maximum power output are mediated by reductions in FEV1, muscle strength and DLCO. Exercise capacity in smokers may benefit from therapies targeting all 3 variables."
https://openalex.org/W3175650402,"GPR126 is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor which lies on chromosome 6q24. Genetic variants in this region are reproducibly associated with lung function and COPD in genome wide association studies (GWAS). The aims of this study were to define the role of GPR126 in the human lung and in pulmonary disease and identify possible casual variants. Online tools (GTEx and LDlink) identified SNPs which may have effects on GPR126 function/ expression, including missense variant Ser123Gly and an intronic variant that shows eQTL effects on GPR126 expression. GPR126 signaling via cAMP-mediated pathways was identified in human structural airway cells when activated with the tethered agonist, stachel. RNA-seq was used to identify downstream genes/ pathways affected by stachel-mediated GPR126 activation in human airway smooth muscle cells. We identified ~350 differentially expressed genes at 4 and 24 hours post stimulation with ~20% overlap. We identified that genes regulated by GPR126 activation include IL33, CTGF, and SERPINE1, which already have known roles in lung biology. Pathways altered by GPR126 included those involved in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Here, we suggest a role for GPR126 in airway remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W3175882892,"The amount of artificial electromagnetic fields of various parameters in the honey bee's environment increases globally. So far, it had been proven that exposure to an E-field at 50 Hz can cause changes in bee's behavior, alter the activity of proteases, and enzymatic antioxidants. Due to the potentially harmful effect of this factor on honey bees, we decided to investigate the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and the concentration of albumin and creatinine in bee's hemolymph after exposure to 50 Hz E-field. Honey bee workers were placed in wooden cages (200 × 150 × 70 mm) and exposed to the 50 Hz E-field with the intensity of <1, 5.0, 11.5, 23.0, or 34.5 kV/m for 1, 3, 6, or 12h. A homogeneous 50 Hz E-field was generated in the form of a plate capacitor. Hemolymph samples for analysis were taken immediately after the end of exposure to the E-field from 100 bees from each group. According to our study, the activity of AST, ALT, and ALP in honey bees' hemolymph decreased after exposure to 50 Hz E-field with various intensities. The decrease in AST, ALT, and ALP activity intensified with prolonged exposure time. 50 Hz E-field may cause the impairment of crucial metabolic cycles in the honey bees' organism (such as the citric acid cycle, ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, β-oxidation). Moreover, exposure to E-Field altered the concentration of creatinine and albumin, which are important non-enzymatic antioxidants. Such changes may indicate a disturbance in protein metabolism and increased muscle activity."
https://openalex.org/W3177007813,"Patients with diabetes are at a high risk for developing cardiac dysfunction in the absence of coronary artery disease or hypertension, a condition known as diabetic cardiomyopathy. Contributing to heart failure is the presence of diabetic kidney disease. The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is a non-obese, non-hypertensive model of type 2 diabetes that, like humans, shares a susceptibility locus on chromosome 10. Herein, we perform a detailed analysis of cardio-renal remodeling and response to renin angiotensin system blockade in GK rats to ascertain the validity of this model for further insights into disease pathogenesis.Study 1: Male GK rats along with age matched Wistar control animals underwent longitudinal assessment of cardiac and renal function for 32 weeks (total age 48 weeks). Animals underwent regular echocardiography every 4 weeks and at sacrifice, early (~24 weeks) and late (~48 weeks) timepoints, along with pressure volume loop analysis. Histological and molecular characteristics were determined using standard techniques. Study 2: the effect of renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade upon cardiac and renal function was assessed in GK rats. Finally, proteomic studies were conducted in vivo and in vitro to identify novel pathways involved in remodeling responses.GK rats developed hyperglycaemia by 12 weeks of age (p<0.01 c/w Wistar controls). Echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function demonstrated preserved systolic function by 48 weeks of age. Invasive studies demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary congestion and impaired diastolic function. Renal function was preserved with evidence of hyperfiltration. Cardiac histological analysis demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy (p<0.05) with evidence of significant interstitial fibrosis (p<0.05). RT qPCR demonstrated activation of the fetal gene program, consistent with cellular hypertrophy. RAS blockade resulted in a reduction blood pressure(P<0.05) cardiac interstitial fibrosis (p<0.05) and activation of fetal gene program. No significant change on either systolic or diastolic function was observed, along with minimal impact upon renal structure or function. Proteomic studies demonstrated significant changes in proteins involved in oxidative phosp4horylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, beta-oxidation, and PI3K/Akt signalling (all p<0.05). Further, similar changes were observed in both LV samples from GK rats and H9C2 cells incubated in high glucose media.By 48 weeks of age, the diabetic GK rat demonstrates evidence of preserved systolic function and impaired relaxation, along with cardiac hypertrophy, in the presence of hyperfiltration and elevated protein excretion. These findings suggest the GK rat demonstrates some, but not all features of diabetes induced ""cardiorenal"" syndrome. This has implications for the use of this model to assess preclinical strategies to treat cardiorenal disease."
https://openalex.org/W3174181908,"Background As the global burden of dementia increases, the absence of treatment underscores the need for identification of factors that may improve cognitive reserve–the ability to stave off cognitive decline in old age. The beneficial association between musical instrument engagement and episodic memory has been identified in children, young adults, and older adults. Yet, previous studies in musical instrument engagement have rarely examined the potential for adolescence and adulthood exposures to independently improve cognition, nor have they been linked with the rate of memory decline over time in older adults. We investigated whether adolescent musical instrument engagement and continued musical instrument engagement over the adult life course were separately associated with higher episodic memory, as well as rate of decline in a large longitudinal cohort. Methods Data were from a prospective cohort of high school graduates from 1957. High school music engagement (HSME) was ascertained through graduate yearbooks and assessed as membership in musical performance groups. A questionnaire was used to assess musical engagement through adulthood (MEA) at ages 35, 55, and 65. The episodic memory score was composed of immediate and delayed recall task scores, and was assessed when participants were aged approximately 65 and 72 years old among 5,718 individuals. Linear mixed models were used to assess the association between music, and memory performance and decline over time. Results Of high school graduates who participated in the study, 38.1% played music in high school, and 21.1% played music in adulthood. While musical engagement was more common in those who played in childhood, 40% of those who played continuously as an adult did not play in high school. High HSME ( B = 0.348, p = 0.049) and continuous MEA ( B = 0.424, p = 0.012) were associated with higher memory scores at age 65 after covariate adjustment. When examining memory decline, the benefits of high HSME decreased over time ( B = -0.435, p = 0.048), while the rate of decline did not differ between MEA groups. Exploratory models revealed differential benefits for HSME and immediate recall, and MEA and delayed recall. Conclusion This study provides further evidence that musical engagement in childhood or adulthood is associated with non-musical cognitive reserve. These two exposures may act differentially in different domains of episodic memory. Further work is needed to determine the relationship between musicianship and the rate of cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W3174523235,"Resilience is important for people to maintain mental health after negative life-events. However, its longitudinal psychological and social predictors are poorly revealed. Based on the ecological system theory model, the current study aimed to determine the longitudinal temporal mechanism underlying the development of early-adulthood resilience using long-term (early-life trauma and personality), medium-term and short-term (life-events, social support, and depression) psychosocial predictors. A total of 505 university students were recruited at baseline (T1), 433 of whom took part in a three-year longitudinal investigation (T2). The results showed that at T1 and T2, the resilience scores of individuals were identically high (72.98 and 73.21, respectively). Pearson correlation analysis showed that early-adulthood resilience was negatively correlated with early-life trauma, psychoticism and neuroticism, depression, ad life-events, and positively correlated with extraversion, social-support, and resilience. Regression and structural equation models showed that extraversion had a direct positive effect on T1 resilience through the mediation of T1 life-events, depression, and social-support, while childhood emotional neglect (EN) had indirect negative effect and extraversion had direct positive effect on T2 resilience through the mediation of T1 resilience, and T2 depression and social-support. In conclusion, this study is among the first to reveal the longitudinal temporal process of the development of early-adulthood resilience using remote and adjacent psychosocial predictors. The findings confirm that childhood EN and extraversion have a remote impact on early-adulthood resilience through recent and current depression and social-support. Our results imply that early-life trauma does not hinder the development of early-adulthood resilience in a linear trend."
https://openalex.org/W3174660711,"The objective of this study was to use available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors in subpopulations and epidemic dynamics at the population level to estimate probabilities of severe illness and the case and infection fatality rates (CFR and IFR) stratified across subgroups representing all combinations of the risk factors age, comorbidities, obesity, and smoking status. We focus on the first year of the epidemic in Los Angeles County (LAC) (March 1, 2020-March 1, 2021), spanning three epidemic waves. A relative risk modeling approach was developed to estimate conditional effects from available marginal data. A dynamic stochastic epidemic model was developed to produce time-varying population estimates of epidemic parameters including the transmission and infection observation rate. The epidemic and risk models were integrated to produce estimates of subpopulation-stratified probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR for LAC. The probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR were found to vary as extensively between age groups as within age categories combined with the presence of absence of other risk factors, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for age categories alone, let alone the entire population. The fine-grained subpopulation-stratified estimates of COVID-19 outcomes produced in this study are useful in understanding disparities in the effect of the epidemic on different groups in LAC, and can inform analyses of targeted subpopulation-level policy interventions."

Besides, a balance between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) is required for cancer cell morphology and angiogenesis. Here, we determined gene signatures associated with the morphology and microenvironment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) to enable prognosis prediction. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 31 PCNSL samples revealed gene signatures as follows: ACTA2 , ACTR10 , CAPG , CORO1C , KRT17 , and PALLD in cytoskeleton, CDH5 , CLSTN1 , ITGA10 , ITGAX , ITGB7 , ITGA8 , FAT4 , ITGAE , CDH10 , ITGAM , ITGB6 , and CDH18 in adhesion, COL8A2 , FBN1 , LAMB3 , and LAMA2 in ECM, ADAM22 , ADAM28 , MMP11 , and MMP24 in MMP. Prognosis prediction formulas with the gene expression values and the Cox regression model clearly divided survival curves of the subgroups in each status. Furthermore, collagen genes contributed to gene network formation in glasso, suggesting that the ECM balance controls the PCNSL microenvironment. Finally, the comprehensive balance of morphology and microenvironment enabled prognosis prediction by a combinatorial expression of 8 representative genes, including KRT17 , CDH10 , CDH18 , COL8A2 , ADAM22 , ADAM28 , MMP11 , and MMP24 . Besides, these genes could also diagnose PCNSL cell types with MTX resistances in vitro . These results would not only facilitate the understanding of biology of PCNSL but also consider targeting pathways for anti-cancer treatment in personalized precision medicine in PCNSL."

We surveyed young adults about asthma in 2008 and 2016 and examined the impact of gender, AR and smoking. Methods Thirty-thousand randomly selected subjects aged 16–75 years in Western Sweden received postal questionnaires in 2008 and 50,000 in 2016. This study is based on responders aged 16–25 years, 2,143 in 2008 and 2,484 in 2016. Results From 2008–2016 current asthma increased from 9.3% to 11.5% (p = 0.014) and was significant in males without AR (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.09–3.07) and male smokers (aOR 3.02, 95% CI 1.12–8.13). In both years the risk of current asthma was reduced by growing up on a farm (aOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.81–0.84 and aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23–0.996), independent of a family history of asthma or allergy. AR did not differ significantly from 2008–2016 (22.5% vs 24.4%, p = 0.144). Current smoking decreased from 20.3% to 15.2% (p&lt;0.001), especially in females (23.5% to 16.2%, p&lt;0.001). Female smokers started smoking later and smoked fewer cigarettes in 2016 than 2008. In 2016, 4.8% of the cohort reported using electronic cigarettes. Of those, 60.7% also smoked tobacco and more than two-thirds who used both (67.2%) were heavy smokers. Conclusion Current asthma increased in respondents aged 16–25 from 2008–2016, mainly among males without AR and male smokers. Current AR levelled off in this young population, while current smoking decreased among females."
https://openalex.org/W3174338326,"The nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio (N:C) can be used as one metric in histology for grading certain types of tumor malignancy. Current N:C assessment techniques are time-consuming and low throughput. Thus, in high-throughput clinical contexts, there is a need for a technique that can assess cell malignancy rapidly. In this study, we assess the N:C ratio of four different malignant cell lines (OCI-AML-5-blood cancer, CAKI-2-kidney cancer, HT-29-colon cancer, SK-BR-3-breast cancer) and a non-malignant cell line (MCF-10A -breast epithelium) using an imaging flow cytometer (IFC). Cells were stained with the DRAQ-5 nuclear dye to stain the cell nucleus. An Amnis ImageStreamX® IFC acquired brightfield/fluorescence images of cells and their nuclei, respectively. Masking and gating techniques were used to obtain the cell and nucleus diameters for 5284 OCI-AML-5 cells, 1096 CAKI-2 cells, 6302 HT-29 cells, 3159 SK-BR-3 cells, and 1109 MCF-10A cells. The N:C ratio was calculated as the ratio of the nucleus diameter to the total cell diameter. The average cell and nucleus diameters from IFC were 12.3 ± 1.2 μm and 9.0 ± 1.1 μm for OCI-AML5 cells, 24.5 ± 2.6 μm and 15.6 ± 2.1 μm for CAKI-2 cells, 16.2 ± 1.8 μm and 11.2 ± 1.3 μm for HT-29 cells, 18.0 ± 3.7 μm and 12.5 ± 2.1 μm for SK-BR-3 cells, and 19.4 ± 2.2 μm and 10.1 ± 1.8 μm for MCF-10A cells. Here we show a general N:C ratio of ~0.6-0.7 across varying malignant cell lines and a N:C ratio of ~0.5 for a non-malignant cell line. This study demonstrates the use of IFC to assess the N:C ratio of cancerous and non-cancerous cells, and the promise of its use in clinically relevant high-throughput detection scenarios to supplement current workflows used for cancer cell grading."
https://openalex.org/W3174780255,"To evaluate the health risk of radon and its progeny, a large amount of accurate monitoring data is needed according to the theory and practice of health risk assessment. However, the indoor radon levels in different regions in China and worldwide reveal temporal and spatial variations. In addition, the residents living in different areas follow distinct living modes. Therefore, it is recommended and accepted by many researchers to detect the radon level in local areas and subsequently conduct health risk assessments based on local detection data. In this study, 21 bedrooms of households in Weifang city were selected, and the indoor 222Rn and 220Rn levels were detected with RAD7 radon detector in winter, while the annual effective radiation dose was calculated for ordinary residents in Weifang city.

The 24- and 12-hour average levels of 220Rn were 30.4±12.3 Bq/m3 and 22.4±11.6 Bq/m3, respectively. There were significant differences in the average levels of 222Rn and 220Rn between floors. The estimated annual effective radiation dose received by ordinary residents in Weifang city was 1.7193 mSv, of which 0.9479 mSv originated from 222Rn and its progeny and 0.7714 mSv originated from 220Rn and its progeny, accounting for 55.1% and 44.9%, respectively, of the total dose. Our findings suggest that 220Rn should not be ignored by local residents in Weifang city, and more attention should be paid to 220Rn in future research."

We included participants who were older than 65 years of age and had no certification in long-term care at baseline. Poor oral function was evaluated by the Kihon Checklist. Among participants with poor oral function, they were further classified by the degree of quality of life (QOL) impairment due to dysphagia. Main outcome is LOI or death from all cause. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence of intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for potential confounders.Of 1,272 participants, 150 participants (11.8%) had poor oral function. The overall incidence of LOI or death was 10.0% in the participants with poor oral function, while 3.3% in the participants without. Participants with poor oral function were more likely to develop LOI or death than those without (crude HR = 3.17 [95% CIs 1.74-5.78], adjusted HR = 2.30 [95% CIs 1.22-4.36]). 10 participants (0.79%) were classified as poor oral function with QOL impairment, and were more likely to develop LOI or death than those without poor oral function (crude HR = 7.45 [95% CIs 1.80-30.91], adjusted HR = 8.49 [95% CIs 1.88-38.34]).Poor oral function was associated with higher risk of LOI or death in functionally independent older adults in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3175958592,"To investigate the influence of bedding structure and different loading rates on the dynamic fracture characteristics and energy dissipation of Datong coal, a split Hopkinson bar was used to obtain the fracture characteristics of coal samples with different bedding angles. The process of crack initiation and propagation in Datong coal was recorded by the high-speed camera. The formula for the model I fracture toughness of the transversely isotropic material is obtained on the basis of the finite element method (FEM) together with the J-integral. By comparing the incident energy, absorbed energy, fracture energy and residual kinetic energy of Datong coal samples under various impact speeds, the energy dissipation characteristics during the dynamic fracture process of coal considering the bedding structure is acquired. The experimental results indicate that the fracture pattern of notched semi-circular bending (NSCB) Datong coal is tensile failure. After splitting into two parts, the coal sample rotates approximately uniformly around the contact point between the sample and the incident rod. The dynamic fracture toughness is 3.52~8.64 times of the quasi-static fracture toughness for Datong coal. Dynamic fracture toughness increases with increasing impact velocity, and the effect of bedding angle on fracture toughness then decreases. In addition, the residual kinetic energy of coal samples with the same bedding angle increases with the increase of impact speed. The energy utilization rate decreases continuously, and the overall dispersion of statistical data decreases gradually. In rock fragmentation engineering, the optimum loading condition is low-speed loading regardless of energy utilization efficiency or fracture toughness. These conclusions may have significant implications for the optimization of hydraulic fracturing process in coal mass and the further understanding of crack propagation mechanisms in coalbed methane extraction (CME). The anisotropic effect of coal should be fully considered in both these cases."
https://openalex.org/W3176028822,"The Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor Y (CNFY) is produced by the gram-negative, enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The bacterial toxin belongs to a family of deamidases, which constitutively activate Rho GTPases, thereby balancing inflammatory processes. We identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans as essential host cell factors for intoxication with CNFY. Using flow cytometry, microscopy, knockout cell lines, pulsed electron–electron double resonance, and bio-layer interferometry, we studied the role of glucosaminoglycans in the intoxication process of CNFY. Especially the C-terminal part of CNFY, which encompasses the catalytic activity, binds with high affinity to heparan sulfates. CNFY binding with the N-terminal domain to a hypothetical protein receptor may support the interaction between the C-terminal domain and heparan sulfates, which seems sterically hindered in the full toxin. A second conformational change occurs by acidification of the endosome, probably allowing insertion of the hydrophobic regions of the toxin into the endosomal membrane. Our findings suggest that heparan sulfates play a major role for intoxication within the endosome, rather than being relevant for an interaction at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W3177141801,"Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of pain in the plantar region of the heel, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is an option used in cases where conservative treatment fails. Hyaluronic acid (HA), initially used for osteoarthrosis, is a treatment option because it has been applied to extra-articular regions, such as tendons, ligaments, and fascia. The aim of the present study will be to evaluate the outcomes of pain, function, and personal satisfaction after a single injection of HA and to compare the results with those of ESWT in patients with chronic plantar fasciitis.The study will include 80 patients who will be randomized to receive three sessions of ESWT (n = 40) or a single ultrasound-guided HA injection in the plantar fascia (n = 40). The outcomes will include the visual analog pain scale score, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS). All of the assessments will be performed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Statistical analysis will be performed using the repeated measures ANOVA (analysis of variance test) for primary and secondary outcomes and also Fisher's Least Significant Difference, a Post-Hoc test. We will use R software for statistical analysis, randomization, and sample size calculation.Recruitment and data collection will begin in November 2020, with completion scheduled for November 2022 and final publication available in March 2023.This trial will evaluate the effects of a single ultrasound-guided HA injection for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (Register Number: RBR-97vkx4) http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-97vkx4/."
https://openalex.org/W3174675618,"The emergence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) has alarmed the global community due to its tendency for colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients are colonized by vancomycin resistant Enterococci than other groups. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci and its associated factors among HIV infected patients on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART).Institution based cross sectional study was conducted among HIV infected patients on ART at from June 1 to August 30, 2020. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected by pre-tested structured questionnaire. Stool sample was collected and processed by standard microbiological techniques. Kirby Bauer Disc diffusion method was used to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Data were entered by Epi data version 4.6.0.2 and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between dependent and independent variables. P-values in the multivariable analysis, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the strength of association. P-value ≤0.05 was considered as significant.Enterococci spp was isolated on 123/200 (61.50%) patients. Among these isolates, the incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was 11.4% [95% CI: (6.0-17.0)]. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns against Enterococci showed highest rate of resistance to ampicillin (69.9%). Multidrug resistances were observed in 49.59% of Enterococci isolates. Study participants who had prior antibioticexposurer more than two weeks [AOR = 7.35; 95% CI: (1.2144.64)] and hospitalization for the last six months [AOR = 5.68; 95% CI: (1.09 29.74)] were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci.In our study high incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was found. Previous exposure to antibiotics for more than two weeks and hospitalization for more than six months were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci. The isolated Enterococci had variable degrees of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, periodic surveillance on antimicrobial resistance pattern, adhering to rational use of antibiotics and implementing infection prevention protocols may reduce colonization by VRE."
https://openalex.org/W3176108980,"To evaluate the ability of confocal near-infrared reflectance (NIR) to diagnose retrograde microcystic maculopathy (RMM) in eyes with temporal visual field (VF) loss and optic atrophy from chiasmal compression. To compare NIR findings with optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in the same group of patients.Thirty-four eyes (26 patients) with temporal VF loss from chiasmal compression and 41 healthy eyes (22 controls) underwent NIR fundus photography, and macular OCT scanning. VF loss was estimated and retinal layers thickness were measured on OCT. Two examiners blinded to the diagnosis randomly examined NIR images for the presence of hyporeflective abnormality (HA) and OCT scans for the presence of microcystic macular abnormalities (MMA). The total average and hemi-macular HA area and number of microcysts were determined. The groups were compared and the level of agreement was estimated.The OCT-measured macular retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers were thinner and the inner nuclear layer was thicker in patients compared to controls. HA and MMA were detected in 22 and 12 patient eyes, respectively, and in 0 controls (p<0.001, both comparisons). HA was significantly more frequent than MMA in patients with optic atrophy, and agreement between HA and MMA (both total and hemi-macular) was fair (kappa range: 0.24-0.29). The mean HA area was significantly greater in the nasal than temporal hemi-macula. A re-analysis of the 14 eyes with discrepant findings allowed to confirm RMM in 20 eyes (20/34) indicating that OCT detected RMM in 12 and missed it in 8 eyes. On the other hand, NIR correctly detected 18 out of 20 eyes, overcalled 4 and missed 2.RMM is a frequent finding in eyes with severe VF loss from long-standing chiasmal compression. NIR photography appears to be more sensitive than OCT for detecting RMM and may be useful as screening method for its presence."
https://openalex.org/W3174629886,"Changing environmental conditions are forcing natural resource managers and communities to adapt their strategies to account for global shifts in precipitation, temperature, sea level and more, all of which are occurring in addition to local human impacts. Adapting to threats from climate change requires a fundamental shift in the practice of natural resource management through the development of forward-looking ""climate-smart"" goals and strategies. Here we present a proof-of-concept application of a decision-support tool to help design climate-smart management actions for the watershed and coral reef management plan for Guánica Bay watershed in southwest Puerto Rico. We also explore the connection between adaptation planning and coral reef resilience, using a recently developed Puerto Rico-wide reef resilience assessment. In the first phase of the study, we used the publicly available Adaptation Design Tool to draft initial climate-smart versions of twelve proposed management actions. In the second phase, two actions (dirt road management on steep slopes, and coral reef restoration) were further refined through consultations with local experts to make more detailed design adjustments; this included the option to use information from the coral reef resilience assessment to inform design improvements. The first phase resulted in moderately detailed assessments that broadly accounted for anticipated direct and indirect effects of climate change on the planned management actions. The second phase resulted in more site-specific technical assessments and additional important design details. The expert panel charged with discussing climate-smart reef restoration around Guánica used the reef resilience assessment to guide discussion of reef restoration, highlighting the importance of having such information available for adaptation planning. This study demonstrates how climate change impacts can be effectively incorporated into a management plan at the most granular level of planning and how a structured, formalized process can be as valuable as the resulting adaptation information."
https://openalex.org/W3175779963,"A key aspect in defining cell state is the complex choreography of DNA binding events in a given cell type, which in turn establishes a cell-specific gene-expression program. Here we wanted to take a deep analysis of DNA binding events and transcriptional output of a single cell state (K562 cells). To this end we re-analyzed 195 DNA binding proteins contained in ENCODE data. We used standardized analysis pipelines, containerization, and literate programming with R Markdown for reproducibility and rigor. Our approach validated many findings from previous independent studies, underscoring the importance of ENCODE's goals in providing these reproducible data resources. We also had several new findings including: (i) 1,362 promoters, which we refer to as 'reservoirs,' that are defined by having up to 111 different DNA binding-proteins localized on one promoter, yet do not have any expression of steady-state RNA (ii) Reservoirs do not overlap super-enhancer annotations and distinct have distinct properties from super-enhancers. (iii) The human specific SVA repeat element may have been co-opted for enhancer regulation and is highly transcribed in PRO-seq and RNA-seq. Collectively, this study performed by the students of a CU Boulder computational biology class (BCHM 5631 -Spring 2020) demonstrates the value of reproducible findings and how resources like ENCODE that prioritize data standards can foster new findings with existing data in a didactic environment."
https://openalex.org/W3176010683,"Opposing genetic and cultural-social explanations for the origin of language are currently the focus of much discussion. One of the functions linked to the longitudinal fascicle is language, which links Wernicke's area and Broca's area in the brain, and its size should indicate the brain increase in the evolution. Sapajus is a New World primate genus with high cognition and advanced tool use similar to that of chimpanzees. A study of the gross anatomy of the longitudinal fascicle of Sapajus using Kingler's method found it to differ from other studied primates, such as macaques and chimpanzees, mainly because its fibers join the cingulate fascicle. As in other non-human primates, the longitudinal fascicle of Sapajus does not reach the temporal lobe, which could indicate a way of separating these fascicles to increase white matter in relation to individual function. The study of anatomical structures seems very promising for understanding the basis of the origin of language. Indeed, socio-historical-cultural philosophy affirms the socio-cultural origin of speech, although considering the anatomical structures behind it working as a functional system."
https://openalex.org/W3175048903,"The first Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) virtual Catalyst Conference (CC), Integrative Approach for Complex Diseases Prevention and Management and Beyond, was held on December 16, 2020. The conference focused on several disease-driven approaches, including multiomics and molecular and genetic epidemiology, which have been applied to dissect the pathophysiological and etiological mechanism of a wide range of health conditions from musculoskeletal diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and cancers to aging. There were four invited presentations and two keynote speakers over about half a day. This CC was organized based on the following rationale. Both hypothesis-driven and data-driven approaches that integrate the recent developments in biotechnology have been employed to scrutinize the etiologic and molecular mechanisms of many different complex diseases and to provide insights for diseases or mortality classification and stratification. These studies have shed light on the prevention and management of these diseases and beyond. This first conference among the virtual CC series aimed to present and discuss cutting-edge methodological examples in traditional epidemiology and molecular epidemiology, as well as genetic epidemiology, to a worldwide audience. The first keynote address was by Dr. Yi-Hsiang (Sean) Hsu (Hebrew SeniorLife Institute for Aging Research, Harvard University and Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, USA), who illustrated several analytical pipelines to identify targets from genome-wide association studies in a systematical manner. The discussed approaches by Dr. Hsu can identify causal variants, upstream regulators, target genes, affected tissues and cell types, gene functions, and disease mechanisms with clinical relevance and implication. One example is that machine learning can be implemented to produce gene regulatory circuits. Dr. Hsu indicated that molecular epidemiology and multiomics technology, such as three-dimensional views of the genome, can help dissect the enhancer–promoter interactions to understand more thoroughly about the development of different complex diseases, such as obesity and heart failure. The second keynote speaker was Dr. Xia Yang (Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA) who presented methodologies and applications of multitissue multiomics systems biology of complex diseases. Dr. Yang discussed how genetic and environmental risk factors interact to perturb gene networks, which, in turn, contribute to the development of a wide spectrum of complex diseases. Dr. Yang explained that gene network modelling involves multitissue multiomics integration and is a powerful approach to identify tissue- or cell-specific mechanisms. Several examples on multitissue multiomics studies were given to provide high resolution, systems level molecular, cell-cell, and tissue-tissue interaction maps to pinpoint key regulators. Dr. Yang also provided examples that systems biology approaches can guide the selection of novel therapeutic agents to normalize disease networks. In the afternoon session, Dr. Atsushi Goto (Department of Health Data Science, Graduate School of Data Science, Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan) explained to the audience about how the Mendelian randomization approach can be used to investigate the causal relation between phenotypes such as diabetes and cancer, particularly in a population-based prospective study context. Dr. Goto laid out the analytical workflow for conducting a Mendelian randomization study, such as the model assumptions that should be taken into account. Dr. Goto also illustrated the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective (JPHC) Study (n = 140 420 aged 40 to 69 years), which adopted a prospective cohort study design that followed participants from 1990 to 2019. The Mendelian randomization approach can improve the evidence for causal effect from observational studies. Dr. Brian Chen (University of California, San Diego, CA, USA and FOXO Technologies, Minneapolis, MN, USA) discussed how epigenetics can be used to estimate biological aging, as demonstrated through research on epigenetic clocks. He illustrated the importance of data sources, data preparation, and how machine learning has played a key role in the development of epigenetic clocks. Dr. Chen indicated that we could understand better the contributors to aging, both on a molecular and clinical level, using the epigenetic clocks. He showed that epigenetic clocks get “reset” upon induced pluripotency, have been shown to exist in multiple species from mice to whales, change in response to certain interventions, and have been associated with mortality and many other age-related traits. Results from the survey of this CC delivered a positive overall impression of the conference: 100% of attendees indicated that the quality of research presented was satisfactory; more than 75% of attendees indicated that the content presented is likely to influence their own research. Some attendees shared the opinion that the topic of this CC can be expanded by including the areas of COVID-19, oncology, neuroscience, immunology/autoimmunity, and infectious disease. Finally, approximately 90% of respondents indicated that they plan to attend this meeting again in the future, either virtually or in person.

https://openalex.org/W3177420237,"Previously, we showed that cAMP increased COX-2 expression in myometrial cells via MAPK. Here, we have extended these observations, using primary myometrial cell cultures to show that the cAMP agonist, forskolin, enhances IL-1β-driven COX-2 expression. We then explored the role of A-kinase interacting protein (AKIP1), which modulates the effect of PKA on p65 activation. AKIP1 knockdown reversed the effect of forskolin, such that its addition inhibited IL-1β-induced COX-2 mRNA expression and reduced the IL-1β-induced increase in nuclear levels of p65 and c-jun. Forskolin alone and with IL-1β increased IκBα mRNA expression suggesting that in the context of inflammation and in the presence of AKIP1, cAMP enhances p65 activation. AKIP1 knockdown reversed these changes. Interestingly, AKIP1 knockdown had minimal effect on the ability of forskolin to repress either basal OTR expression or IL-1β-stimulated OTR mRNA expression. AKIP1 was up-regulated by IL-1β, but not stretch and was repressed by cAMP. The mRNA expression of AKIP1 increased in early labour in tandem with an increase in COX-2 mRNA and protein. AKIP1 protein levels were also increased with inflammation and stretch-induced preterm labour. Our results identify a second important cAMP effector-switch occurring at term in human myometrium and suggest that a hitherto unrecognized interaction may exist between AKIP1, NFκB and AP-1. These data add to the proposition that cAMP acts as a key regulator of human myometrial contractility."
