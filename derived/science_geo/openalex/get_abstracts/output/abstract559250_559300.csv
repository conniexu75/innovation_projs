https://openalex.org/W2345813655,"Abstract Our intestinal microbiota harbours a diverse bacterial community required for our health, sustenance and wellbeing 1,2 . Intestinal colonization begins at birth and climaxes with the acquisition of two dominant groups of strict anaerobic bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla 2 . Culture-independent, genomic approaches have transformed our understanding of the role of the human microbiome in health and many diseases 1 . However, owing to the prevailing perception that our indigenous bacteria are largely recalcitrant to culture, many of their functions and phenotypes remain unknown 3 . Here we describe a novel workflow based on targeted phenotypic culturing linked to large-scale whole-genome sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and computational modelling that demonstrates that a substantial proportion of the intestinal bacteria are culturable. Applying this approach to healthy individuals, we isolated 137 bacterial species from characterized and candidate novel families, genera and species that were archived as pure cultures. Whole-genome and metagenomic sequencing, combined with computational and phenotypic analysis, suggests that at least 50–60% of the bacterial genera from the intestinal microbiota of a healthy individual produce resilient spores, specialized for host-to-host transmission. Our approach unlocks the human intestinal microbiota for phenotypic analysis and reveals how a marked proportion of oxygen-sensitive intestinal bacteria can be transmitted between individuals, affecting microbiota heritability."

https://openalex.org/W2345968315,Whether and how neurons that are present in both sexes of the same species can differentiate in a sexually dimorphic manner is not well understood. A comparison of the connectomes of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite and male nervous systems reveals the existence of sexually dimorphic synaptic connections between neurons present in both sexes. Here we demonstrate sex-specific functions of these sex-shared neurons and show that many neurons initially form synapses in a hybrid manner in both the male and hermaphrodite pattern before sexual maturation. Sex-specific synapse pruning then results in the sex-specific maintenance of subsets of these connections. Reversal of the sexual identity of either the pre- or postsynaptic neuron alone transforms the patterns of synaptic connectivity to that of the opposite sex. A dimorphically expressed and phylogenetically conserved transcription factor is both necessary and sufficient to determine sex-specific connectivity patterns. Our studies reveal new insights into sex-specific circuit development.

However, this technique, and essentially all spectroscopic methods, is limited in application to relatively small, simple molecules. Here we integrate comb spectroscopy with continuous, cold samples of molecules produced via buffer gas cooling, thus enabling the study of significantly more complex molecules. We report simultaneous gains in resolution, sensitivity, and bandwidth and demonstrate this combined capability with the first rotationally resolved direct absorption spectra in the CH stretch region of several complex molecules. These include nitromethane (CH$_3$NO$_2$), a model system that presents challenging questions to the understanding of large amplitude vibrational motion, as well as several large organic molecules with fundamental spectroscopic and astrochemical relevance, including naphthalene (C$_{10}$H$_8$), adamantane (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$), and hexamethylenetetramine (C$_{6}$N$_4$H$_{12}$). This general spectroscopic tool has the potential to significantly impact the field of molecular spectroscopy, simultaneously improving efficiency, spectral resolution, and specificity by orders of magnitude. This realization could open up new molecular species and new kinetics for precise investigations, including the study of complex molecules, weakly bound clusters, and cold chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2346349322,"Background South Africa is one of the most ‘unequal’ societies in the world. Despite apartheid ending more than 20 years ago, material inequalities remain interwoven with ethnic/racial inequalities. There is limited research on the prevalence/predictors of common mental disorders (CMD) among young people. Adolescence is a unique time-point during which intervention may lead to improved mental health and reduced social problems later. The study objective was to assess mental health disparities in a representative sample of adolescents growing up in South Africa. Methods Cross-sectional associations of race/ethnicity and material disadvantage with CMD and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were assessed in a stratified random sample representative of school-attendees, aged 14–15 years, in a large metropolitan area of Cape Town. Validated instruments assessed mental disorders; these included: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (PTSD); Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (depression); Zung self-rated anxiety scale (anxiety). Self-ascribed ethnicity was determined using procedures similar to the South African census and previous national surveys. Results Response rate was 88% (1034 of 1169 individuals). Adolescents experienced a high prevalence of depression (41%), anxiety (16%) and PTSD (21%). A gradient between material disadvantage and CMD/ PTSD was evident across all ethnic/racial groups. Respondents self-identifying as ‘black’ or ‘coloured’ were disadvantaged across most indicators. After adjusting for confounders, relative to white children, relative risk (RR) of CMD in black children was 2.27 (95% CI:1.24, 4.15) and for PTSD was RR: 2.21 (95% CI:1.73, 2.83). Relative risk of CMD was elevated in children self-identifying as ‘coloured’ (RR: 1.73, 95% CI:1.11, 2.70). Putative mediators (violence, racially motivated bullying, social support, self-esteem) partially accounted for differences in CMD and fully for PTSD. Conclusions Adolescent mental health inequalities in Cape Town are associated with material disadvantage and self-identification with historically disadvantaged groups."
https://openalex.org/W2347038127,"Microbes associated with insects can confer a wide range of ecologically relevant benefits to their hosts. Since insect-associated bacteria often increase the nutritive value of their hosts' diets, the study of bacterial communities is especially interesting in species that are important agricultural pests. We investigated the composition of bacterial communities in the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens and its variability in relation to developmental stage, diet and population (field and laboratory), using bacterial tag-encoded FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. In larvae, bacterial communities differed depending on the food plant on which they had been reared, although the within-group variation between biological replicates was high as well. Moreover, larvae originating from a field or laboratory population did not share any OTUs. Interestingly, Enterococcus sp. was found to be the dominant taxon in laboratory-reared larvae, but was completely absent from field larvae, indicating dramatic shifts in microbial community profiles upon cultivation of the moths in the laboratory. Furthermore, microbiota composition varied strongly across developmental stages in individuals of the field population, and we found no evidence for vertical transmission of bacteria from mothers to offspring. Since sample sizes in our study were small due to pooling of samples for sequencing, we cautiously conclude that the high variability in bacterial communities suggests a loose and temporary association of the identified bacteria with H. virescens."
https://openalex.org/W2345742198,"Removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and storing the carbon (C) in resistant soil organic matter (SOM) is a global priority to restore soil fertility and help mitigate climate change. Although it is widely assumed that retaining rather than removing or burning crop residues will increase SOM levels, many studies have failed to demonstrate this. We hypothesised that the microbial nature of resistant SOM provides a predictable nutrient stoichiometry (C:nitrogen, C:phosphorus and C:sulphur–C:N:P:S) to target using supplementary nutrients when incorporating C-rich crop residues into soil. An improvement in the humification efficiency of the soil microbiome as a whole, and thereby C-sequestration, was predicted. In a field study over 5 years, soil organic-C (SOC) stocks to 1.6 m soil depth were increased by 5.5 t C ha-1 where supplementary nutrients were applied with incorporated crop residues, but were reduced by 3.2 t C ha-1 without nutrient addition, with 2.9 t C ha-1 being lost from the 0–10 cm layer. A net difference of 8.7 t C ha-1 was thus achieved in a cropping soil over a 5 year period, despite the same level of C addition. Despite shallow incorporation (0.15 m), more than 50% of the SOC increase occurred below 0.3 m, and as predicted by the stoichiometry, increases in resistant SOC were accompanied by increases in soil NPS at all depths. Interestingly the C:N, C:P and C:S ratios decreased significantly with depth possibly as a consequence of differences in fungi to bacteria ratio. Our results demonstrate that irrespective of the C-input, it is essential to balance the nutrient stoichiometry of added C to better match that of resistant SOM to increase SOC sequestration. This has implications for global practices and policies aimed at increasing SOC sequestration and specifically highlight the need to consider the hidden cost and availability of associated nutrients in building soil-C."
https://openalex.org/W2346754698,"Restrictive nosebands are common in equestrian sport. This is concerning, as recent evidence suggests that very tight nosebands can cause a physiological stress response, and may compromise welfare. The objective of the current study was to investigate relationships that noseband tightness has with oral behavior and with physiological changes that indicate a stress response, such as increases in eye temperature (measured with infrared thermography) and heart rate and decreases in heart rate variability (HRV). Horses (n = 12) wearing a double bridle and crank noseband, as is common in dressage at elite levels, were randomly assigned to four treatments: unfastened noseband (UN), conventional area under noseband (CAUN) with two fingers of space available under the noseband, half conventional area under noseband (HCAUN) with one finger of space under the noseband, and no area under the noseband (NAUN). During the tightest treatment (NAUN), horse heart rate increased (P = 0.003), HRV decreased (P < 0.001), and eye temperature increased (P = 0.011) compared with baseline readings, indicating a physiological stress response. The behavioral results suggest some effects from bits alone but the chief findings are the physiological readings that reflect responses to the nosebands at their tightest. Chewing decreased during the HCAUN (P < 0.001) and NAUN (P < 0.001) treatments. Yawning rates were negligible in all treatments. Similarly, licking was eliminated by the NAUN treatment. Following the removal of the noseband and double bridle during the recovery session, yawning (P = 0.015), swallowing (P = 0.003), and licking (P < 0.001) significantly increased compared with baseline, indicating a post-inhibitory rebound response. This suggests a rise in motivation to perform these behaviors and implies that their inhibition may place horses in a state of deprivation. It is evident that a very tight noseband can cause physiological stress responses and inhibit the expression of oral behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2346226609,"Fractures, particularly at the lower extremities and hip, are a complication of diabetes. In both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), fracture risk is disproportionately worse than that predicted from the measurement of bone mineral density. Although an explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of organic matrix abnormalities, it has not been fully elucidated how advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) relate to bone deterioration at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels. We hypothesized that there would be a relationship between skeletal AGE levels (determined by Raman microspectroscopy at specific anatomical locations) and bone macroscopic and microscopic properties, as demonstrated by the biomechanical measures of crack growth and microindentation respectively. We found that in OVE26 mice, a transgenic model of severe early onset T1D, AGEs were increased by Raman (carboxymethyl-lysine [CML] wildtype (WT): 0.0143 ±0.0005 vs T1D: 0.0175 ±0.0002, p = 0.003) at the periosteal surface. These differences were associated with less tough bone in T1D by fracture mechanics (propagation toughness WT: 4.73 ± 0.32 vs T1D: 3.39 ± 0.24 NM/m1/2, p = 0.010) and by reference point indentation (indentation distance increase WT: 6.85 ± 0.44 vs T1D: 9.04 ± 0.77 μm; p = 0.043). Within T1D, higher AGEs by Raman correlated inversely with macroscopic bone toughness. These data add to the existing body of knowledge regarding AGEs and the relationship between skeletal AGEs with biomechanical indices."

Another carotenoid oxygenase, β-carotene 9′,10′-oxygenase (BCO2) catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids at the 9′-10′ bond to yield an ionone and an apo-10′-carotenoid. Previously published substrate specificity studies of BCO2 were conducted using crude lysates from bacteria or insect cells expressing recombinant BCO2. Our attempts to obtain active recombinant human BCO2 expressed in Escherichia coli were unsuccessful. We have expressed recombinant chicken BCO2 in the strain E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) and purified the enzyme by cobalt ion affinity chromatography. Like BCO1, purified recombinant chicken BCO2 catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the provitamin A carotenoids β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin. Its catalytic activity with β-carotene as substrate is at least 10-fold lower than that of BCO1. In further contrast to BCO1, purified recombinant chicken BCO2 also catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of 9-cis-β-carotene and the non-provitamin A carotenoids zeaxanthin and lutein, and is inactive with all-trans-lycopene and β-apocarotenoids. Apo-10′-carotenoids were detected as enzymatic products by HPLC, and the identities were confirmed by LC-MS. Small amounts of 3-hydroxy-β-apo-8′-carotenal were also consistently detected in BCO2-β-cryptoxanthin reaction mixtures. With the exception of this activity with β-cryptoxanthin, BCO2 cleaves specifically at the 9′-10′ bond to produce apo-10′-carotenoids. BCO2 has been shown to function in preventing the excessive accumulation of carotenoids, and its broad substrate specificity is consistent with this.

https://openalex.org/W2345817461,"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most frequent cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether paeonol protected against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Mice treated with paeonol (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) received 400 mg/kg acetaminophen intraperitoneally (i.p.) and hepatotoxicity was assessed. Pre-treatment with paeonol for 6 and 24 h ameliorated APAP-induced hepatic necrosis and significantly reduced the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in a dose-dependent manner. Post-treatment with 100 mg/kg paeonol ameliorated APAP-induced hepatic necrosis and reduced AST and ALT levels in the serum after APAP administration for 24 h. Western blot revealed that paeonol inhibited APAP-induced phosphorylated JNK protein expression but not p38 and Erk1/2. Moreover, paeonol showed anti-oxidant activities with reducing hepatic MDA contents and increasing hepatic SOD, GSH-PX and GSH levels. Paeonol dose-dependently prevented against H2O2 or APAP-induced LDH releasing and ROS production in primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes such as TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β and IL-6 in the liver were dose-dependently reduced by paeonol pre-treatment. Pre-treatment with paeonol significantly inhibited IKKα/β, IκBα and p65 phosphorylation which contributed to ameliorating APAP-induced hepatic inflammation. Collectively, the present study demonstrates paeonol has a protective ability against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and might be an effective candidate compound against drug-induced acute liver failure."
https://openalex.org/W2347179827,"Cellular senescence correlates with changes in the transcriptome. To obtain a complete view on senescence-associated transcription networks and pathways, we assessed by deep RNA sequencing the transcriptomes of five of the most commonly used laboratory strains of human fibroblasts during their transition into senescence. In a number of cases, we verified the RNA-seq data by real-time PCR. By determining cellular protein levels we observed that the age-related expression of most but not all genes is regulated at the transcriptional level. We found that 78% of the age-affected differentially expressed genes were commonly regulated in the same direction (either up- or down-regulated) in all five fibroblast strains, indicating a strong conservation of age-associated changes in the transcriptome. KEGG pathway analyses confirmed up-regulation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and down-regulation of DNA synthesis/repair and most cell cycle pathways common in all five cell strains. Newly identified senescence-induced pathways include up-regulation of endocytotic/phagocytic pathways and down-regulation of the mRNA metabolism and the mRNA splicing pathways. Our results provide an unprecedented comprehensive and deep view into the individual and common transcriptome and pathway changes during the transition into of senescence of five human fibroblast cell strains."
https://openalex.org/W2345734401,"Most research on the effects of wildfires on stream water quality has focused on suspended sediment and nutrients in streams and water bodies, and relatively little research has examined the effects of wildfires on trace elements. The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the effect of the 2009 Station Fire in the Angeles National Forest northeast of Los Angeles, CA on trace element concentrations in streams, and 2) compare trace elements in post-fire stormflow water quality to criteria for aquatic life to determine if trace elements reached concentrations that can harm aquatic life. Pre-storm and stormflow water-quality samples were collected in streams located inside and outside of the burn area of the Station Fire. Ash and burned soil samples were collected from several locations within the perimeter of the Station Fire. Filtered concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Hg and total concentrations of most trace elements in storm samples were elevated as a result of the Station Fire. In contrast, filtered concentrations of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Se and total concentrations of Cu were elevated primarily due to storms and not the Station Fire. Total concentrations of Se and Zn were elevated as a result of both storms and the Station Fire. Suspended sediment in stormflows following the Station Fire was an important transport mechanism for trace elements. Cu, Pb, and Zn primarily originate from ash in the suspended sediment. Fe primarily originates from burned soil in the suspended sediment. As, Mn, and Ni originate from both ash and burned soil. Filtered concentrations of trace elements in stormwater samples affected by the Station Fire did not reach levels that were greater than criteria established for aquatic life. Total concentrations for Fe, Pb, Ni, and Zn were detected at concentrations above criteria established for aquatic life."
https://openalex.org/W2345676484,"Banana (Musa sp.) is a vegetatively propagated, low fertility, potentially hybrid and polyploid crop. These qualities make the breeding and targeted genetic improvement of this crop a difficult and long process. The Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach is becoming widely used in crop plants and has proven efficient to detecting candidate genes for traits of interest, especially in cereals. GWAS has not been applied yet to a vegetatively propagated crop. However, successful GWAS in banana would considerably help unravel the genomic basis of traits of interest and therefore speed up this crop improvement. We present here a dedicated panel of 105 accessions of banana, freely available upon request, and their corresponding GBS data. A set of 5,544 highly reliable markers revealed high levels of admixture in most accessions, except for a subset of 33 individuals from Papua. A GWAS on the seedless phenotype was then successfully applied to the panel. By applying the Mixed Linear Model corrected for both kinship and structure as implemented in TASSEL, we detected 13 candidate genomic regions in which we found a number of genes potentially linked with the seedless phenotype (i.e. parthenocarpy combined with female sterility). An additional GWAS performed on the unstructured Papuan subset composed of 33 accessions confirmed six of these regions as candidate. Out of both sets of analyses, one strong candidate gene for female sterility, a putative orthologous gene to Histidine Kinase CKI1, was identified. The results presented here confirmed the feasibility and potential of GWAS when applied to small sets of banana accessions, at least for traits underpinned by a few loci. As phenotyping in banana is extremely space and time-consuming, this latest finding is of particular importance in the context of banana improvement."

However, high-tech industries have a chronic shortage of such indispensable professionals. Accordingly, reducing R&D personnel turnover has become a major human resource management challenge facing innovative companies. This study combined importance-performance analysis (IPA) with the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to propose an IPA-DEMATEL model. Establishing this model involved three steps. First, an IPA was conducted to measure the importance of and satisfaction gained from job satisfaction criteria. Second, the DEMATEL method was used to determine the causal relationships of and interactive influence among the criteria. Third, a criteria model was constructed to evaluate job satisfaction of high-tech R&D personnel. On the basis of the findings, managerial suggestions are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2345947791,"Large tropical and sub-tropical marine animals must meet their energetic requirements in a largely oligotrophic environment. Many planktivorous elasmobranchs, whose thermal ecologies prevent foraging in nutrient-rich polar waters, aggregate seasonally at predictable locations throughout tropical oceans where they are observed feeding. Here we investigate the foraging and oceanographic environment around Lady Elliot Island, a known aggregation site for reef manta rays Manta alfredi in the southern Great Barrier Reef. The foraging behaviour of reef manta rays was analysed in relation to zooplankton populations and local oceanography, and compared to long-term sighting records of reef manta rays from the dive operator on the island. Reef manta rays fed at Lady Elliot Island when zooplankton biomass and abundance were significantly higher than other times. The critical prey density threshold that triggered feeding was 11.2 mg m-3 while zooplankton size had no significant effect on feeding. The community composition and size structure of the zooplankton was similar when reef manta rays were feeding or not, with only the density of zooplankton changing. Higher zooplankton biomass was observed prior to low tide, and long-term (~5 years) sighting data confirmed that more reef manta rays are also observed feeding during this tidal phase than other times. This is the first study to examine prey availability at an aggregation site for reef manta rays and it indicates that they feed in locations and at times of higher zooplankton biomass."
https://openalex.org/W2347149822,"Large carnivores such as jaguars (Panthera onca) are species of conservation concern because they are suffering population declines and are keystone species in their ecosystems. Their large area requirements imply that unprotected and ever-increasing agricultural regions can be important habitats as they allow connectivity and dispersal among core protected areas. Yet information on jaguar densities across unprotected landscapes it is still scarce and crucially needed to assist management and range-wide conservation strategies. Our study provides the first jaguar density estimates of Colombia in agricultural regions which included cattle ranching, the main land use in the country, and oil palm cultivation, an increasing land use across the Neotropics. We used camera trapping across two agricultural landscapes located in the Magdalena River valley and in the Colombian llanos (47-53 stations respectively; >2000 trap nights at both sites) and classic and spatially explicit capture-recapture models with the sex of individuals as a covariate. Density estimates were 2.52±0.46-3.15±1.08 adults/100 km2 in the Magdalena valley, whereas 1.12±0.13-2.19±0.99 adults/100 km2 in the Colombian llanos, depending on analysis used. We suggest that jaguars are able to live across unprotected human-use areas and co-exist with agricultural landscapes including oil-palm plantations if natural areas and riparian habitats persist in the landscape and hunting of both jaguar and prey is limited. In the face of an expanding agriculture across the tropics we recommend land-use planning, adequate incentives, regulations, and good agricultural practices for range-wide jaguar connectivity and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2345789278,"Genetic evidence suggests that membranes rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) act as supramolecular antioxidants that capture reactive oxygen species, thereby limiting damage to proteins. This process generates lipid fragmentation products including malondialdehyde (MDA), an archetypal marker of PUFA oxidation. We observed transient increases in levels of endogenous MDA in wounded Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, raising the possibility that MDA is metabolized. We developed a rigorous ion exchange method to purify enzymatically generated (13)C- and (14)C-MDA. Delivered as a volatile to intact plants, MDA was efficiently incorporated into lipids. Mass spectral and genetic analyses identified the major chloroplast galactolipid: α-linolenic acid (18:3)-7Z,10Z,13Z-hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3)-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (18:3-16:3-MGDG) as an end-product of MDA incorporation. Consistent with this, the fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 mutant that lacks tri-unsaturated fatty acids incorporated (14)C-MDA into 18:2-16:2-MGDG. Saponification of (14)C-labeled 18:3-16:3-MGDG revealed 84% of (14)C-label in the acyl groups with the remaining 16% in the head group. 18:3-16:3-MGDG is enriched proximal to photosystem II and is likely a major in vivo source of MDA in photosynthetic tissues. We propose that nonenzymatically generated lipid fragments such as MDA are recycled back into plastidic galactolipids that, in their role as cell protectants, can again be fragmented into MDA."
https://openalex.org/W2347004364,"A versatile bioreactor suitable for dynamic suspension cell culture under tunable shear stress conditions has been developed and preliminarily tested culturing cancer cell spheroids. By adopting simple technological solutions and avoiding rotating components, the bioreactor exploits the laminar hydrodynamics establishing within the culture chamber enabling dynamic cell suspension in an environment favourable to mass transport, under a wide range of tunable shear stress conditions. The design phase of the device has been supported by multiphysics modelling and has provided a comprehensive analysis of the operating principles of the bioreactor. Moreover, an explanatory example is herein presented with multiphysics simulations used to set the proper bioreactor operating conditions for preliminary in vitro biological tests on a human lung carcinoma cell line. The biological results demonstrate that the ultralow shear dynamic suspension provided by the device is beneficial for culturing cancer cell spheroids. In comparison to the static suspension control, dynamic cell suspension preserves morphological features, promotes intercellular connection, increases spheroid size (2.4-fold increase) and number of cycling cells (1.58-fold increase), and reduces double strand DNA damage (1.5-fold reduction). It is envisioned that the versatility of this bioreactor could allow investigation and expansion of different cell types in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2347079476,"Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a widely used technique for amplification of DNA from samples containing limited amounts of DNA (e.g., uncultivable microbes or clinical samples) before whole genome sequencing. Despite its advantages of high yield and fidelity, it suffers from high amplification bias and non-specific amplification when amplifying sub-nanogram of template DNA. Here, we present a microfluidic digital droplet MDA (ddMDA) technique where partitioning of the template DNA into thousands of sub-nanoliter droplets, each containing a small number of DNA fragments, greatly reduces the competition among DNA fragments for primers and polymerase thereby greatly reducing amplification bias. Consequently, the ddMDA approach enabled a more uniform coverage of amplification over the entire length of the genome, with significantly lower bias and non-specific amplification than conventional MDA. For a sample containing 0.1 pg/μL of E. coli DNA (equivalent of ~3/1000 of an E. coli genome per droplet), ddMDA achieves a 65-fold increase in coverage in de novo assembly, and more than 20-fold increase in specificity (percentage of reads mapping to E. coli) compared to the conventional tube MDA. ddMDA offers a powerful method useful for many applications including medical diagnostics, forensics, and environmental microbiology."

https://openalex.org/W2346694739,"T17M rhodopsin expression in rod photoreceptors leads to severe retinal degeneration and is associated with the activation of ER stress related Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling. Here, we show a novel role of a UPR transcription factor, ATF4, in photoreceptor cellular pathology. We demonstrated a pro-death role for ATF4 overexpression during autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). Based on our results in ATF4 knockout mice and adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery of ATF4 to the retina, we validated a novel therapeutic approach targeting ATF4 over the course of retinal degeneration. In T17M rhodopsin retinas, we observed ATF4 overexpression concomitantly with reduction of p62 and elevation of p53 levels. These molecular alterations, together with increased CHOP and caspase-3/7 activity, possibly contributed to the mechanism of photoreceptor cell loss. Conversely, ATF4 knockdown retarded retinal degeneration in 1-month-old T17M Rhodopsin mice and promoted photoreceptor survival, as measured by scotopic and photopic ERGs and photoreceptor nuclei row counts. Similarly, ATF4 knockdown also markedly delayed retinal degeneration in 3-month-old ADRP animals. This delay was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in UPR signaling, the launching of anti-oxidant defense, initiation of autophagy, and improvement of rhodopsin biosynthesis which together perhaps combat the cellular stress associated with T17M rhodopsin. Our data indicate that augmented ATF4 signals during retinal degeneration plays a cytotoxic role by triggering photoreceptor cell death. Future ADRP therapy regulating ATF4 expression can be developed to treat retinal degenerative disorders associated with activated UPR."

This is mediated by accumulation of a pericellular matrix of hyaluronan (HA) and the HA-dependent co-localization of CD44 with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Interactions of HA with hyaladherins, such as inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), are also essential for differentiation. This study investigated the mechanisms involved. TSG-6 and α-SMA had different kinetics of induction by TGFβ1, with TSG-6 peaking before α-SMA. Si CD44 or EGFR inhibition prevented differentiation but had no effect on TSG-6 expression. TSG-6 was essential for differentiation, and mAb A38 (preventing IαI heavy chain (HC) transfer), HA-oligosaccharides, cobalt, or Si bikunin prevented TSG-6 activity, preventing differentiation. A38 also prevented the EGFR/CD44 association. This suggested that TSG-6/IαI HC interaction was necessary for the effect of TSG-6 and that HC stabilization of HA initiated the CD44/EGFR association. The newly described HC5 was shown to be the principal HC expressed, and its cell surface expression was prevented by siRNA inhibition of TSG-6 or bikunin. HC5 was released by hyaluronidase treatment, confirming its association with cell surface HA. Finally, HC5 knockdown by siRNA confirmed its role in myofibroblast differentiation. The current study describes a novel mechanism linking the TSG-6 transfer of the newly described HC5 to the HA-dependent control of cell phenotype. The interaction of HC5 with cell surface HA was essential for TGFβ1-dependent differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, highlighting its importance as a novel potential therapeutic target.

The fibroblast is the most abundant cell type in normal connective tissues. It plays a central role in the synthesis, degradation, and remodeling of extracellular matrix both in health and in disease. At sites of tissue damage and in the context of wound healing, activated fibroblasts, termed myofibroblasts, with a contractile phenotype, characterized by the expression of the smooth muscle isoform of α-actin (α-SMA), 3The abbreviations used are: α-SMAα-smooth-muscle actinEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorIαIinter-α-inhibitorTSG-6tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6HCIαI heavy chainHAhyaluronanqPCRquantitative PCRFnEDREDA isoform of fibronectinoligo-HAhyaluronan oligosaccharideITIHinter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chainRQrelative quantification. are essential for the synthesis of a collagen-rich scar, providing the force for wound contraction (1Gabbiani G.

The sequence of events leading up to this transformation is being increasingly characterized at a molecular level in an attempt to understand and eventually control this process. We have previously demonstrated that TGFβ1-mediated phenotypic activation is dependent on an increase in the synthesis of the extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) (12Meran S. Thomas D.

TGFβ1, through stimulation of EGF and subsequent activation of EGFR-associated ERK-MAPK activity, stimulates HA synthesis. This increased HA synthesis is associated with the formation of an organized pericellular HA coat, which subsequently orchestrates assembly of a CD44/EGFR receptor complex on the cell surface. Activation of ERK signaling downstream of this complex subsequently leads to a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The secreted product of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) is important in the formation and remodeling of HA-rich pericellular coats and matrices (14Simpson R.M.L. Wells A. Thomas D.

Thus, in the TGFβ1-triggered generation of the myofibroblast phenotype, we proposed that TSG-6 may play an important part in forming the HA·CD44·EGFR complex, which then signals to induce ERK activation. The mechanism of HC transfer has been elucidated by Rugg et al. (19Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. Characterization of complexes formed between TSG-6 and inter-α-inhibitor that act as intermediates in the covalent transfer of heavy chains on to hyaluronan.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TSG-6 forms an intermediate species with one of the two heavy chains from the IαI complex, which consists of the light chain bikunin and its chondroitin sulfate chain, which is bound to two heavy chains. Classically, three HCs have been described. HC1 and HC2 are known to occur bound to chondroitin sulfate to form IαI, whereas HC3 is thought to bind chondroitin sulfate/bikunin as a single chain forming an assembly known as pre-αI. Previous work (20Sanggaard K.W. Sonne-Schmidt C.S. Krogager T.P. Lorentzen K.A. Wisniewski H.-G. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. The transfer of heavy chains from bikunin proteins to hyaluronan requires both TSG-6 and HC2.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18530-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) has shown that TSG-6 is capable of transferring not only HC2 but also HC1 and HC3 from IαI (or pre-αI) onto HA but that the presence of HC2 appeared to be necessary for this enzymatic action of TSG-6 to take place. There is a fourth HC (HC4) about which less is known. It does not have the conserved cleavage site of HC1–3 that allows them to link with bikunin. It does, however, bind to and block the polymerization of actin, resulting in inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis and chemotaxis (21Choi-Miura N.H. Takahashi K. Yoda M. Saito K. Hori M. Ozaki H. Mazda T. Tomita M. The novel acute phase protein, IHRP, inhibits actin polymerization and phagocytosis of polymorphonuclear cells.Inflamm Res. 2000; 49: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The more recently described HC5 has not yet been fully characterized; nor has it been shown to complex with chondroitin sulfate to form IαI (or pre-IαI). It does, however, possess the necessary binding sites to enable it to do so (22Himmelfarb M. Klopocki E. Grube S. Staub E. Klaman I. Hinzmann B. Kristiansen G. Rosenthal A. Dürst M. Dahl E. ITIH5, a novel member of the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain family is downregulated in breast cancer.Cancer Lett. 2004; 204: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) The existence of HC6 was recently identified in GenBankTM from a report of 2003 (23Clark H.F.

In the current paper, we have examined the role of TSG-6 following TGFβ1 stimulation and highlighted HC transfer activity as being key to form a HA matrix that is anchored by CD44, leading to a CD44·EGFR signaling complex. This activity was specifically dependent on HC5. We demonstrate for the first time that HC5 has a major mechanistic role to play in the phenotypic activation of fibroblasts. All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK) unless otherwise stated. ERK (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 and EGFR inhibitor AG1478 were purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). They were prepared as stock solutions of 5 and 3 mg/ml, respectively. Oligo-HA (10 units; i.e. 10 monosaccharides) (purchased from Hyalose, Oklahoma City, OK; HYA-OLIGO10EF-1) and a hexasaccharide control (Iduron UK) were prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and were added to give a final concentration of 50 μg/ml on the cells 2 h before stimulation with TGFβ. Cobalt chloride was stored at a concentration of 500 mm in PBS. All inhibitors were diluted immediately before use and added to the cell cultures at the times given in the legends before the addition of TGFβ1. Anti-IαI heavy chain 5 antibody ab107846 and anti-IαI heavy chain 2 antibody ab118257 together with the loading control anti-GAPDH antibody ab9485 were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Primary human lung fibroblasts (AG02262; NIA Aging Cell Respiratory Corriel Institute) were cultured in DMEM and F-12 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 10% FCS (Biologic Industries Ltd., Cumbernauld, UK). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, and fresh growth medium was added to the cells every 3–4 days until confluence. Cells were growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 48 h before use in experiments, and all experiments were performed under serum-free conditions unless otherwise stated. For the induction of differentiation, cells were exposed to a single treatment of TGFβ1 at the concentrations indicated for times up to 72 h as in previous studies (12Meran S. Thomas D. Stephens P.

Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and washed with PBS, pH 7.3, before lysis with TRI Reagent and RNA purification according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and washed with 70% ethanol before being dried and resuspended in water. The concentration of RNA was determined by the absorbance at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed on 1 μg of RNA, using random primers to initiate cDNA synthesis with High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kits, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK). As a negative control, RT was performed with sterile H2O replacing the RNA sample. qPCR was carried out using a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was diluted 4-fold, and 4 μl (equivalent to 0.05 μg of the original RNA) was amplified in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of Taqman master mix (Applied Biosystems), 5 μl of H2O, and 1 μl of specific primer. The following primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems: α-SMA primer ACTA2 (catalog no. 4331182 Hs00426835_g1) and TSG-6 primer TNFAIP6 (catalog no. Hs00200180_m1). rRNA was used as the internal control for all samples, and the results are presented as the relative quantification (RQ) calculated by the ΔΔCT method using the equation, RQ = 2−(ΔCT(1) − ΔCT(2)), (where ΔCT(1) is the mean ΔCT calculated for the experimental samples and ΔCT(2) is the mean ΔCT calculated for the control samples (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK). Heavy chain amplification was carried out by qPCR of the cDNA with specific primers to each IαI heavy chain using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). In selected experiments mRNA copy number was determined by amplifying each heavy chain by conventional PCR and calculating the number of molecules present in the purified amplified product. Serial dilutions from 300,000 to 30 copies were prepared for each heavy chain, and the amplified qPCR signals of the experimental samples were read off from the standard curves produced. All oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK).

M16704/115717; Silencer® negative control No. 2 siRNA, catalog no. AM4613. Cells to be transfected were deprived of serum for 4 h before the addition of the siRNA. Briefly, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was diluted 1:50 in Opti-MEM (Gibco 31085) and allowed to stand for 5 min. This was then added to a 333 nm dilution of the siRNA prepared immediately before use from a 100 μm stock. The mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min to allow the Lipofectamine·siRNA complexes to form, and then 200 μl of this preparation was added to 800 μl of serum-free antibiotic-free medium on the cells to give a final concentration of 33 nm, and the transfection was allowed to take place overnight. Control cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA. The following day, the appropriate stimuli were added to the cells as described, without removing the siRNA complexes, and the incubation continued for a further 72 h (unless otherwise indicated) before isolating RNA. Typical knockdown ranges using these siRNAs were as follows: Si TSG-6, 51–60%; Si bikunin, 78–89%; Si CD44, 53–67%; Si HC5, 89–98%; HC2, 90–99%. Cells were cultured for 72 h under the designated conditions before total cell protein was extracted in 100 μl of lysis buffer as described previously (24Midgley A.C. Rogers M. Hallett M.B.

Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay, and 30 μg of each sample was boiled with reducing buffer for 10 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% acrylamide gel. Western blotting with rabbit anti-IαI HC5 primary antibody (Abcam, catalog no. ab136324) was performed by standard methods to detect the presence of HC5. Detection was performed with a specific anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (Abcam catalog no. 970510) and ECL reagent. Equal loading was confirmed by the use of anti GAPDH antibody (Abcam catalog no. 9485). Cells were growth-arrested before incubation with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) or serum-free medium alone in the presence or absence of anti-TSG-6 antibody A38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-65886) at 50 μg/ml. After 72 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Fixed cells were stained for EGFR (Abcam GR01, 1:30) (visualized using Alexa Fluor 488) and for CD44 (Ab A020 1:200) (Merck Millipore) (visualized with Alexa Fluor 555). The images were merged to demonstrate the co-localization of CD44 and EGFR. The unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test was used to identify statistical significance. Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism version 4.0a (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA), and p ≤ 0.05 (*) and p ≤ 0.01 (**) were considered significant. TSG-6 has been shown to be essential for the TGFβ1-dependent phenotypic activation of fibroblasts and renal epithelial cells (14Simpson R.M.L. Wells A. Thomas D. Stephens P. Steadman R. Phillips A.

Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine the temporal relationship between TSG-6 expression and induction of the myofibroblast phenotype, growth-arrested fibroblasts were stimulated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml), and mRNA was extracted at times up to 72 h. The addition of TGFβ1 led to a time-dependent induction of TSG-6 that was significant at 3 h, reached a maximum at 8 h, and was sustained to 72 h. In contrast, the induction of the phenotypic markers, α-SMA and the EDA isoform of fibronectin (fnEDA), was slower, becoming significant at 24 h and continuing to increase up to 72 h. There was no significant change in the levels of bikunin over this time course (Fig. 2). These results suggest but do not confirm in themselves a temporal separation between TSG-6 up-regulation and induction of phenotypic activation. To investigate whether the inductions of TSG-6 and α-SMA were both triggered by a CD44-dependent mechanism, siRNA was used to knockdown CD44 expression. This resulted in >50% inhibition of CD44 protein expression (Fig. 3A), which was associated with a 60% inhibition of α-SMA mRNA (Fig. 3B), as reported previously (14Simpson R.M.L. Wells A. Thomas D.

The change of phenotype in response to TGFβ1 is also, however, dependent on EGFR activation (14Simpson R.M.L. Wells A. Thomas D. Stephens P. Steadman R. Phillips A.

To confirm that TSG-6 was not induced as a result of this signaling pathway, ERK activation by MEK was inhibited using PD98059. This inhibited α-SMA induction by ∼60%, but TSG-6 was again unaffected (Fig. 3, F and G).

Although induction of HA and HA synthase is dependent on TGFβ1 activation of ERK and subsequently the EGFR, classical TGFβ1 signaling is initiated when the ligand induces assembly of a heteromeric complex of type II and type I receptors. The RII kinase then phosphorylates RI on a conserved glycine-serine-rich domain. This activates the RI kinase, which subsequently recognizes and phosphorylates members of the intracellular receptor-regulated SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3). SMAD signaling through the activation of this classical pathway has previously been implicated in phenotypic activation of fibroblasts, through the use of chemical inhibition of the ALK5 receptor (26Webber J.

These enzymes are constitutively phosphorylated, insensitive to second messengers, and have relatively low activity. Here we show that protein scaffolds not only localize but also differentially control the catalytic activity of the aPKC PKCζ, thus promoting activity toward localized substrates and restricting activity toward global substrates. Using cellular substrate readouts and scaffolded activity reporters in live cell imaging, we show that PKCζ has highly localized and differentially controlled activity on the scaffolds p62 and Par6. Both scaffolds tether aPKC in an active conformation as assessed through pharmacological inhibition of basal activity, monitored using a genetically encoded reporter for PKC activity. However, binding to Par6 is of higher affinity and is more effective in locking PKCζ in an active conformation. FRET-based translocation assays reveal that insulin promotes the association of both p62 and aPKC with the insulin-regulated scaffold IRS-1. Using the aPKC substrate MARK2 as another readout for activity, we show that overexpression of IRS-1 reduces the phosphorylation of MARK2 and enhances its plasma membrane localization, indicating sequestration of aPKC by IRS-1 away from MARK2. These results are consistent with scaffolds serving as allosteric activators of aPKCs, tethering them in an active conformation near specific substrates. Thus, signaling of these intrinsically low activity kinases is kept at a minimum in the absence of scaffolding interactions, which position the enzymes for stoichiometric phosphorylation of substrates co-localized on the same protein scaffold.

https://openalex.org/W2346492162,"Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a widely used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm to non-invasively induce synaptic plasticity in the human brain in vivo. Altered PAS-induced plasticity has been demonstrated for several diseases. However, researchers are faced with a high inter- and intra-subject variability of the PAS response. Here, we pooled original data from nine PAS studies from three centers and analyzed the combined dataset of 190 healthy subjects with regard to age dependency, the role of stimulation parameters and the effect of different statistical methods. We observed no main effect of the PAS intervention over all studies (F(2;362) = 0.44; p = 0.644). The rate of subjects showing the expected increase of motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes was 53%. The PAS effect differed significantly between studies as shown by a significant interaction effect (F(16;362) = 1.77; p = 0.034) but post-hoc testing did not reveal significant effects after correction for multiple tests. There was a trend toward increased variability of the PAS effect in older subjects. Acquisition parameters differed across studies but without systematically influencing changes in MEP-size. The use of post/baseline quotients systematically indicated stronger PAS effects than post/baseline difference or the logarithm of the post/baseline quotient. The non-significant PAS effects across studies and a wide range of responder rates between studies indicate a high variability of this method. We were thus not able to replicate findings from a previous meta-analysis showing robust effects of PAS. No pattern emerged regarding acquisition parameters that at this point could guide future studies to reduce variability and help increase response rate. For future studies, we propose to report the responder rate and recommend the use of the logarithmized post/baseline quotient for further analyses to better address the possibility that results are driven by few extreme cases."
https://openalex.org/W2346503002,"Shank3 is a postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffold protein of the Shank family. Here we use pre-embedding immunogold electron microscopy to investigate factors influencing the distribution of Shank3 at the PSD. In dissociated rat hippocampal cultures under basal conditions, label for Shank3 was concentrated in a broad layer of the PSD, ~20–80 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. Upon depolarization with high K+ (90 mM, 2 min), or application of NMDA (50 μM, 2 min), both the labeling intensity at the PSD and the median distance of label from the postsynaptic membrane increased significantly, indicating that Shank3 molecules are preferentially recruited to the distal layer of the PSD. Incubation in medium supplemented with zinc (50 μM ZnCl2, 1 hr) also significantly increased labeling intensity for Shank3 at the PSD, but this addition of Shank3 was not preferential to the distal layer. When cells were incubated with zinc and then treated with NMDA, labeling intensity of Shank3 became higher than with either treatment alone and manifested a preference for the distal layer of the PSD. Without zinc supplementation, NMDA-induced accumulation of Shank3 at the PSD was transient, reversing within 30 min after return to control medium. However, when zinc was included in culture media throughout the experiment, the NMDA-induced accumulation of Shank3 was largely retained, including Shank3 molecules recruited to the distal layer of the PSD. These results demonstrate that activity induces accumulation of Shank3 at the PSD and that zinc stabilizes PSD-associated Shank3, possibly through strengthening of Shank-Shank association."

Although the GNIP database is instrumental in developing global isoscapes, data coverage in some regions of hydrological interest (e.g., drylands) is low or non-existent thus the accuracy and relevance of global isoscapes to these regions is debatable. Capitalizing on existing literature isotope data, we generated rainfall isoscapes for Namibia (dryland) using the cokriging method and compared it to a globally fitted isoscape (GFI) downscaled to country level. Results showed weak correlation between observed and predicted isotope values in the GFI model (r2 < 0.20) while the cokriging isoscape showed stronger correlation (r2 = 0.67). The general trend of the local cokriging isoscape is consistent with synoptic weather systems (i.e., influences from Atlantic Ocean maritime vapour, Indian Ocean maritime vapour, Zaire Air Boundary, the Intertropical Convergence Zone and Tropical Temperate Troughs) and topography affecting the region. However, because we used the unweighted approach in this method, due to data scarcity, the absolute values could be improved in future studies. A comparison of local meteoric water lines (LMWL) constructed from the cokriging and GFI suggested that the GFI model still reflects the global average even when downscaled. The cokriging LMWL was however more consistent with expectations for an arid environment. The results indicate that although not ideal, for data deficient regions such as many drylands, the unweighted cokriging approach using historical local data can be an alternative approach to modelling rainfall isoscapes that are more relevant to the local conditions compared to using downscaled global isoscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2346583233,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complicated health problem that encompasses a variety of metabolic disorders. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the major biochemical parameters associated with MetS and circulating levels of microRNA (miR)-33, miR-103, and miR-155. We found that miRNA-33 levels were positively correlated with levels of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triacylglycerol, but negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol levels. In the cellular study, miR-33 levels were increased in macrophages treated with high glucose and cholesterol-lowering drugs atorvastatin and pitavastatin. miR-33 has been reported to play an essential role in cholesterol homeostasis through ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) regulation and reverse cholesterol transport. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the linkage between miR-33 and statin treatment remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether atorvastatin and pitavastatin exert their functions through the modulation of miR-33 and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. The results showed that treatment of the statins up-regulated miR-33 expression, but down-regulated ABCA1 mRNA levels in RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Statin-mediated ABCA1 regulation occurs at the post-transcriptional level through targeting of the 3'-UTR of the ABCA1 transcript by miR-33. Additionally, we found significant down-regulation of ABCA1 protein expression in macrophages treated with statins. Finally, we showed that high glucose and statin treatment significantly suppressed cholesterol efflux from macrophages. These findings have highlighted the complexity of statins, which may exert detrimental effects on metabolic abnormalities through regulation of miR-33 target genes."

The experiment indicated local adaptation in one of the two subpopulations manifested as enhanced hatching success of eggs in the native habitat, both when compared to siblings transferred to a non-native habitat, and when compared to immigrant genotypes from the other subpopulation. Gene-by-environment effects on viability of eggs and larvae were evident in both subpopulations, showing that there existed genetic variation allowing for evolutionary responses to divergent selection, and indicating a capacity for plastic responses to environmental change. Next, we tested for differences in female life-history traits. Results uncovered that females from one population invested more resources into reproduction and also produced more (but smaller) eggs in relation to their body size compared to females from the other population. We suggest that these females have adjusted their reproductive strategies as a counter-adaptation because a high amount of sedimentation on the eggs in that subpopulations spawning habitat might benefit smaller eggs. Collectively, our findings point to adaptive divergence among sympatric subpopulations that are physically separated only for a short period during reproduction and early development—which is rare. These results illustrate how combinations of translocation experiments and field studies of life-history traits might infer about local adaptation and evolutionary divergence among populations. Local adaptations in subdivided populations are important to consider in management and conservation of biodiversity, because they may otherwise be negatively affected by harvesting, supplementation, and reintroduction efforts targeted at endangered populations."
https://openalex.org/W2346278141,"Oxidative stress is a leading cause of endothelial dysfunction. The p38 MAPK pathway plays a determinant role in allowing cells to cope with oxidative stress and is tightly regulated by a balanced interaction between p38 protein and its interacting partners. By using a proteomic approach, we identified nucleophosmin (NPM) as a new partner of p38 in HUVECs. Coimmunoprecipitation and microscopic analyses confirmed the existence of a cytosolic nucleophosmin (NPM)/p38 interaction in basal condition. Oxidative stress, which was generated by exposure to 500 μM H2O2, induces a rapid dephosphorylation of NPM at T199 that depends on phosphatase PP2A, another partner of the NPM/p38 complex. Blocking PP2A activity leads to accumulation of NPM-pT199 and to an increased association of NPM with p38. Concomitantly to its dephosphorylation, oxidative stress promotes translocation of NPM to the nucleus to affect the DNA damage response. Dephosphorylated NPM impairs the signaling of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage via inhibition of the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit. Overall, these results suggest that the p38/NPM/PP2A complex acts as a dynamic sensor, allowing endothelial cells to react rapidly to acute oxidative stress.—Guillonneau, M., Paris, F., Dutoit, S., Estephan, H., Bénéteau, E., Huot, J., Corre, I.Oxidative stress disassembles the p38/NPM/PP2A complex, which leads to modulation of nucleophosmin-mediated signaling to DNA damage response.

The in vitro assays were conducted in 96-well plates to determine the optimum chemical stimulus to distinguish between live and dead SCN and RKN J2. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were evaluated for the nematode response to see if these compounds can help distinguish between viable from the dead J2. Results indicated that live SCN J2 responded equally (P ≤ 0.05) to 1 μl Na2CO3 and 10 μl NaHCO3 in 100 μl of water at pH = 10. Live SCN J2 responded by twisting their bodies in a curling shape and increasing rate of movements within 2 minutes of exposure. The twisting activity continued for up to 30 minutes. Live RKN J2 responded by increasing activity with the application of 1 μl NaOH in 100 μl of water at pH = 10 also in the 2 minutes to 30 minutes time frame.

https://openalex.org/W2345335609,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, debilitating disease for which two medications, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have only recently been approved for treatment. The cytokine TGF-β has been shown to be a central mediator in the disease process. We investigated the role of a novel kinase, MAP3K19, upregulated in IPF tissue, in TGF-β-induced signal transduction and in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. MAP3K19 has a very limited tissue expression, restricted primarily to the lungs and trachea. In pulmonary tissue, expression was predominantly localized to alveolar and interstitial macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes of the epithelium. MAP3K19 was also found to be overexpressed in bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages from IPF patients compared to normal patients. Treatment of A549 or THP-1 cells with either MAP3K19 siRNA or a highly potent and specific inhibitor reduced phospho-Smad2 & 3 nuclear translocation following TGF-β stimulation. TGF-β-induced gene transcription was also strongly inhibited by both the MAP3K19 inhibitor and nintedanib, whereas pirfenidone had a much less pronounced effect. In combination, the MAP3K19 inhibitor appeared to act synergistically with either pirfenidone or nintedanib, at the level of target gene transcription or protein production. Finally, in an animal model of IPF, inhibition of MAP3K19 strongly attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis when administered either prophylactically ortherapeutically. In summary, these results strongly suggest that inhibition of MAP3K19 may have a beneficial therapeutic effect in the treatment of IPF and represents a novel strategy to target this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2346107354,"The widespread encroachment of woody plants throughout the semi-arid grasslands in North America has largely resulted from overgrazing by domestic livestock, fire suppression, and loss of native large and small mammalian herbivores. Burrowing-herbivorous mammals, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), help control shrub encroachment through clipping of shrubs and consumption of their seedlings, but little is known about how this important ecological role interacts with and may be influenced by co-existing large herbivores, especially domestic livestock. Here, we established a long-term manipulative experiment using a 2 × 2 factorial design to assess the independent and interactive effects of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and cattle (Bos taurus) on honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) abundance and structure. We found that, after five years, mesquite abundance was three to five times greater in plots where prairie dogs were removed compared to plots where they occurred together or alone, respectively. While both prairie dogs and cattle reduced mesquite cover, the effect of prairie dogs on reducing mesquite abundance, cover, and height was significantly greater than that by cattle. Surprisingly, cattle grazing enhanced prairie dog abundance, which, in turn, magnified the effects of prairie dogs on mesquite shrubs. Mesquite canopy cover per hectare was three to five times greater where prairie dogs and cattle were absent compared to where they occurred together or by themselves; whereas, cumulative mesquite height was two times lower on sites where prairie dog and cattle occurred together compared to where they occurred alone or where neither occurred. Data from our experimental study demonstrate that prairie dogs and moderate grazing by cattle can suppress mesquite growth, and, when their populations are properly managed, they may interact synergistically to significantly limit mesquite encroachment in desert grasslands."

Inadequate food intake and infectious diseases are combined to increase further the prevalence. Malnourishment brings to muscle cells loss with development of cardiac complications, like arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and sudden death. In developed countries, malnutrition has generally a different etiology, like chronic diseases. The aim of our study was to investigate the correlation between malnutrition and left ventricular mass in an African children population. Methods 313 children were studied, in the region of Antsiranana, Madagascar, with age ranging from 4 to 16 years old (mean 7,8 ± 3 years). A clinical and echocardiographic evaluation was performed with annotation of anthropometric and left ventricle parameters. Malnutrition was defined as a body mass index (BMI) value age- and sex-specific of 16, 17 and 18,5 at the age of 18, or under the 15th percentile. Left ventricle mass was indexed by height2.7 (LVMI). Results We identified a very high prevalence of children malnutrition: 124 children, according to BMI values, and 100 children under the 15th percentile. LVMI values have shown to be increased in proportion to BMI percentiles ranging from 29,8 ± 10,8 g/m2.7 in the malnutrition group to 45 ± 15,1 g/m2.7 in >95th percentile group. LVMI values in children < 15th BMI percentile were significantly lower compared to normal nutritional status (29,8 ± 10,8 g/m2,7 vs. 32,9 ± 12,1 g/m2,7, p = 0.02). Also with BMI values evaluation, malnourished children showed statistically lower values of LVMI (29,3 ± 10,1 g/m2,7 vs. 33,6 ± 12,5 g/m2,7, p = 0.001). Conclusion In African children population, the malnourishment status is correlated with cardiac muscle mass decrease, which appears to be reduced in proportion to the decrease in body size."

Binding of either endogenous or exogenous vanilloids evokes channel and subsequent neuronal activation, leading to pain sensation.

The highly conserved tyrosine in position 511 (Tyr511) of the rat TRPV1 (rTRPV1) was the first residue to be identified as a necessary participant in the vanilloid-mediated response. rTRPV1 cryo-EM structures implicated rotation of this residue in the vanilloids bound state. Therefore, we hypothesize that the rTRPV1 Tyr511 residue entraps vanilloids in their binding site, prolonging channel activity. To test our hypothesis, we generated an array of rTRPV1 mutants, containing the whole spectrum of Tyr511 substitutions, and tested their response to both exo- and endovanilloids. Our data show that only substitutions of Tyr511 to aromatic amino acids were able to mimic, albeit partially, the vanilloid-evoked activation pattern of the wt receptor. Although these substitutions reduced the channel sensitivity to vanilloids, a maximal open-channel lifetime could be achieved. Moreover, whereas their current activation rate remains intact, receptors with Tyr511 substitutions exhibited a faster current deactivation. Our findings therefore suggest that the duration of channel activity evoked by vanilloids is regulated by the interaction between Tyr511 and the agonist.

U.S.A. 2016; 113: E137-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The solved cryo-EM structure of the rat TRPV1 (rTRPV1) showed that in the presence of vanilloids (capsaicin or resiniferatoxin), residues within the VBS are scattered around the agonist, in proximity to the intracellular domain between the receptor S3 and S4 transmembrane segments (23Cao E. Liao M. Cheng Y. Julius D. TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms.Nature. 2013; 504: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Moreover, based on this cryo-EM structure, a recent molecular docking and molecular dynamic studies proposed potential configurations of vanilloids inside the VBS (26Yang F. Xiao X. Cheng W. Yang W.

However, the VBS mechanism of action and the roles of its different residues in the vanilloid-evoked TRPV1 response are yet to be defined. The tyrosine at position 511 of the rTRPV1 was the first VBS residue to be identified as a participant in capsaicin and resiniferatoxin-evoked receptor activation (15Jordt S.E. Julius D. Molecular basis for species-specific sensitivity to “hot” chili peppers.Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), as the Y511A substitution alone was sufficient to abolish receptor activation by these exogenous vanilloids (15Jordt S.E.

The rTRPV1 cryo-EM structures in the presence of exovanilloids clearly points to a close proximity of this highly conserved residue to the agonist (23Cao E. Liao M. Cheng Y. Julius D. TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms.Nature. 2013; 504: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Moreover, these structures indicate that Tyr511 assumes two distinct rotamers in apo versus bound states, where its side chain points away either from or into the VBS, respectively (Fig. 1A). Although recent molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies point to an interaction between Tyr511 and the ligand in the bound state (Fig. 1B) (26Yang F. Xiao X. Cheng W. Yang W. Yu P. Song Z.

U.S.A. 2016; 113: E137-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), its position in the apo state suggests a limited role in the initial interaction between vanilloids and their binding site. Therefore, how this residue participates in the vanilloids-evoked TRPV1 activation remains to be determined. Taking into account the suggested rotation of the rTRPV1 Tyr511 residue (23Cao E. Liao M. Cheng Y. Julius D. TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms.Nature. 2013; 504: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and its interaction with vanilloid in the bound state (26Yang F. Xiao X. Cheng W. Yang W. Yu P. Song Z. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Zheng J. Structural mechanism underlying capsaicin binding and activation of the TRPV1 ion channel.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Darré L. Domene C. Binding of capsaicin to the TRPV1 ion channel.Mol.

U.S.A. 2016; 113: E137-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that this residue entraps the vanilloids in the VBS, thus prolonging ligand occupancy in its binding pocket and enabling full duration of channel activation. To test this hypothesis, we generated an array of rTRPV1 mutants, containing the whole spectrum of Tyr511 substitutions, and tested their response to the exovanilloid capsaicin and the endovanilloid NADA by calcium imaging and electrophysiology. Our data showed that only substitutions of Tyr511 to aromatic amino acids were able to mimic, albeit partially, the vanilloid-evoked activation pattern of the wt receptor. Although these substitutions reduced the channel sensitivity to vanilloids, indicated by the rightward shift in capsaicin dose-response, maximal open-channel lifetime was achieved. Moreover, whereas current activation rate remains intact, Tyr511 substitutions lead to a faster current deactivation. Taken together, our data clearly indicate that upon vanilloid binding, Tyr511 rotates and interacts with the ligand to enable a full duration of channel activity. Thus, Tyr511 primarily regulates the deactivation process of vanilloid-mediated TRPV1 response. Furthermore, our findings suggest that substituting this residue to small aliphatic amino acids (such in the widely used Y511A substitution) shorten the duration of ligand occupancy in the VBS, which does not allow adequate channel gating. To conclude, we propose that upon its rotation, Tyr511 binds vanilloids to stabilize ligand-receptor interaction and allow vanilloid-evoked TRPV1 activation and pain sensation. To refine the protein structure, capsaicin bound (PDB code 3j5r) (23Cao E. Liao M. Cheng Y. Julius D. TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms.Nature. 2013; 504: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and apo (PDB code 3j5p) (29Liao M. Cao E. Julius D. Cheng Y. Structure of the TRPV1 ion channel determined by electron cryo-microscopy.Nature. 2013; 504: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) rTRPV1 reconstructions were downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank, and loaded into the Maestro molecular modeling environment (Maestro, version 9.2, Schrödinger, New York). Ionizable residues were set to their normal ionization states at pH 7, and a restrained energy minimization (with a relatively higher convergence threshold of a gradient to ∼0.3 kJ/Å mol) was performed using OPLS-2005 force field. The capsaicin structure was reconstituted using the Maestro Molecular Modeling Environment 2008 (Maestro, version 9.2, Schrödinger), and energy was minimized using Macromodel minimization panel with a OPLS-2005 force field and GB/SA water model, applying a constant dielectric of 1.0. Polak-Ribiere first derivative, conjugated gradient minimization was employed with maximum of 1,000 iterations and a convergence threshold of a gradient to 0.05 kJ/Å mol. The LigPrep2.0 module of Schrodinger was used to generate possible ionization states at pH 7.0 ± 2.0. Conformers from confgen-ligprep output were then docked in an rTRPV1 VBS using the extra precision (XP) scoring mode of Glide. A grid of center of 10 × 10 × 10 Å on residues 511, 570, and 550 was constructed. Van der Waals radii of ligand and receptor were 0.8 and a partial charge cut-off of 0.15 was used. Ten docked poses were generated to sample a range of possible docking modes. An in situ refinement of the predicted protein-ligand complexes was then performed using Macromodel minimization, using the OPLS-2005 force field and GB/SA water model with a constant dielectric of 1.0. A Polak-Ribiere first derivative, conjugate gradient minimization was employed with a maximum of 5,000 iterations and convergence threshold of a gradient of 0.05 kJ/Å mol. In addition, per-residue free energy contributions (Van der Walls, Columbic, C-C nonbonding, and H bonding) and average distances for the intrinsic docking poses were analyzed. Site-directed mutagenesis of the wt rTRPV1 gene cloned into a pCDNA3.1+ plasmid was performed using a Q5® Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with primers (Sigma) designed using the NEBaseChanger software (New England Biolabs). Additionally, following digestion with the restriction enzymes HindIII and ApaI (New England Biolabs), wt rTRPV1 and Y511F, Y511M, and Y511W mutants were subcloned into the pCDNA5/FRT/TO plasmid using the T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following bacterial (TOP 10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen)) transformation, all DNA constructs were extracted using a miniprep kit (Purelink®, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and sequenced (Hy labs, Israel) to verify mutagenesis. Cell culture and transfection were carried out as described (11Bohlen C.J. Priel A. Zhou S. King D. Siemens J. Julius D.

Kumar R. Matzner H. Priel A. The pain receptor TRPV1 displays agonist-dependent activation stoichiometry.Sci. Rep. 2015; 512278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and Flp-in T-REx 293 (Invitrogen) cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA (100–500 ng of rTRPV1 expressing constructs, 200 ng of enhanced green fluorescent protein in pCDNA3.1+, and an empty pcDNA3.1+ plasmid to reach a total DNA amount of 1000 ng) using Mirus LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio) and Opti-MEM I (reduced serum medium, Invitrogen) 24 h before analysis. Co-transfection with enhanced green fluorescent protein was carried for quick identification of successful transfection (except those used in calcium imaging). Three hours before electrophysiological analysis, transfected Flp-in T-REx 293 cells were treated with doxycycline (0.2–0.7 μg/ml) to induce transgene expression. Transfected HEK293T cells were spotted at poly-d-lysine (0.2 mg/ml)-coated imaging chambers (μ-slide, 8 well, Ibidi, Germany) 3–4 h before being loaded with Fura-2AM (Invitrogen; 2 μm) dissolved in Ringer’s salt solution (in mm: 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, and 5 d-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH) for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with Ringer’s solution and incubated for 30 min. Stock solutions of 10 mm capsaicin (Tocris Bioscience, UK), 10 mm NADA (Tocris Bioscience), and 100 mm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB; Tocris Bioscience) in DMSO were dissolved in Ringer’s salt solution to obtain the desired concentrations. Using an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70, Japan), cells were illuminated with a xenon arc lamp, and excitation wavelengths (340/380 nm) were selected by a Lambda DG-4 monochromatic wavelength changer (Sutter Instrument). Fluorescence emission at >480 nm was captured with a front-illuminated interline CCD camera (Exi Blue, QImaging, BC, Canada) and the MetaFluor Fluorescence Imaging Software (Universal Imaging Corp.) that was further used for offline analysis. Background-corrected 340/380 nm ratio images were collected every 4 s. Whole cell and single channel recordings were carried out as described (25Hazan A. Kumar R. Matzner H. Priel A. The pain receptor TRPV1 displays agonist-dependent activation stoichiometry.Sci. Rep. 2015; 512278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were used for whole cell recordings and Flp-in T-REx 293 cells for single channel recordings, 24 h after transfection. Patch electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass using the P1000 Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instrument, CA) and fire polished using the microforge MF-900 (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Glass electrodes were fire polished to a resistance of 3–4 megohms for whole cell and 12–15 megohms for outside-out patch. The pipette solution constituted (mm): 130 KCl, 4 NaCl, 2 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH (estimated free Ca2+ was 17 nm, using Maxchelator software). Bath solution comprised of (mm): 140 NaCl, 2.3 KCl, 2 MgSO4, 5 HEPES, and 5 MES (pH 7.4) was adjusted with NaOH. Calcium was excluded from external solution to avoid TRPV1 desensitization (30Touska F. Marsakova L. Teisinger J. Vlachova V. A “cute” desensitization of TRPV1.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2011; 12: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Following establishment of the whole cell or outside-out configuration, cells were perfused using the ValveBank perfusion system (AutoMate Scientific, CA). Stock solutions of 10 mm capsaicin (Tocris Bioscience) or NADA (Tocris Bioscience) in DMSO were dissolved in bath solution to obtain the desired concentrations. Recordings were performed using Digidata 1440A digitizer and Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA). Whole cell currents were recorded at −40 mV, whereas outside-out patches were held at +50 mV. Data were collected and analyzed using pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). All experiments were carried out at 22–23 °C. Whole cell currents were filtered at 1 kHz using a low-pass Bessel filter and sampled at 2–5 kHz, whereas single channel currents were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz. All statistical data were calculated using SigmaPlot 11 (Systat Software, CA) and Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) software. Student's t test and ANOVA were used to determine statistical significance. To determine the ratio between protons and vanilloid-evoked responses, maximal currents (i.e. peaks) were used for quantification. Dose-responses were calculated using the sigmoidal Hill equation (Eq. 1) as follows, (Eq. 1) when I = measured current; Imax = maximal current at the relevant saturating dose (pre-measured for each construct); x = tested agonist concentration; EC50 = calculated concentration that elicits 50% of maximal current, and n = Hill coefficient. Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices) was used to calculate rates of whole cell current activation (τon) and washout (τoff), using exponential fitting (using single-exponential function from 10 to 90% of the peak) as previously described (31Priel A. Silberberg S.D. Mechanism of ivermectin facilitation of human P2X4 receptor channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Priel A. Kolleker A. Ayalon G.

For each construct, 300–1400 events were collected from 4 to 8 separate outside-out patches. To determine channel amplitude, all-point amplitude histograms were generated using data digitally filtered at 1 kHz. To determine channel open probability, traces filtered at 2 kHz were idealized using the half-amplitude threshold crossing method (25Hazan A. Kumar R. Matzner H. Priel A.

Modulation of single-channel properties of TRPV1 by phosphorylation.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 3743-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine the role tyrosine 511 plays in the activation mechanism of rTRPV1, we substituted this amino acid with all remaining amino acids by generating an array of mutated rTRPV1 constructs, and transiently expressed them in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1). We determined the sensitivity of rTRPV1 containing the various Tyr511 substitutions to capsaicin (2 μm) by calcium imaging (Fig. 1C). To verify expression, correct folding, and trafficking of the different rTRPV1 mutants, we exposed them to 2-APB (0.3 mm), a non-vanilloid TRPV1 agonist that does not require Tyr511 (34Colton C.K. Zhu M.X. 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate as a common activator of TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 channels.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2007; 179: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and analyzed their response by calcium imaging (Fig. 1C). As summarized in Fig. 1D, capsaicin-evoked TRPV1 activation was dramatically impaired in all mutants; whereas substitutions to small or charged amino acids showed the most profound effect, substitutions to the two aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine (F) and tryptophan (W), had only a moderate effect. We next assessed the activation pattern of the two most capsaicin-sensitive mutants, Y511F and Y511W, as compared with wt rTRPV1 (Fig. 2). We also determined the activation pattern of two of the least capsaicin-sensitive mutated receptors, Y511M and Y511I, which maintained sufficient sensitivity to allow current analysis. Using whole cell recordings (VH = −40 mV), the currents evoked by two capsaicin concentrations, 1 and 30 μm, were determined and normalized"

Our data indicate that the facilitates chromatin transcription complex (FACT) interacts with CKII and may facilitate PAF complex phosphorylation. Posttranslational modification analysis of affinity-isolated PAF-C shows extensive CKII phosphorylation of all five subunits of PAF-C, although CKII subunits were not detected as interacting partners. Consistent with this, recombinant CKII or FACT-associated CKII isolated from cells can phosphorylate PAF-C in vitro, whereas no intrinsic kinase activity was detected in PAF-C samples. Significantly, PAF-C purifications combined with stable isotope labeling in cells (SILAC) quantitation for PAF-C phosphorylation from wild-type and CKII temperature-sensitive strains (cka1Δ cka2–8) showed that PAF-C phosphorylation at consensus CKII sites is significantly reduced in cka1Δ cka2–8 strains. Consistent with a role of CKII in FACT and PAF-C function, we show that decreased CKII function in vivo results in decreased levels of histone H2B lysine 123 monoubiquitylation, a modification dependent on FACT and PAF-C.

Numerous protein complexes play a role in aiding RNAPII loading onto a target gene promoter through the formation of preinitiation complexes. Following initiation, RNAPII proceeds into productive transcript elongation, during which the enzyme must cope with a chromatin landscape that can have an inhibitory effect on RNAPII passage.

In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PAF-C is composed of five subunits: Cdc73, Ctr9, Leo1, Paf1, and Rtf1 (6Mueller C.L. Jaehning J.A. Ctr9, Rtf1, and Leo1 are components of the Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The human Paf1 complex contains an additional subunit, Ski8, which has been shown to be important in 3′-5′ mRNA degradation (7Zhu B. Mandal S.S. Pham A.D. Zheng Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Batra S.K.

Spt16 associates with all five subunits of yeast PAF-C as well as casein kinase II (CKII), as determined by qualitative mass spectrometry analysis (16Krogan N.J. Kim M. Ahn S.H. Zhong G. Kobor M.S.

It has been proposed that Paf1 mediates the interaction between FACT and RNAPII in yeast (18Adelman K. Wei W. Ardehali M.B. Werner J. Zhu B. Reinberg D. Lis J.T. Drosophila Paf1 modulates chromatin structure at actively transcribed genes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, human PAF-C has been shown to interact with the general transcription elongation factor Transcription factor SII, the superelongation complex, and the FACT complex, consistent with its known interactions in yeast (8Kim J.

CKII is an abundant and constitutively active serine kinase that phosphorylates many targets in yeast and mammalian cells (19Venerando A. Ruzzene M. Pinna L.A.

In mammalian cells, FACT co-purifies with CKII in a complex that phosphorylates p53 on serine 392 in response to DNA damage (24Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. A DNA damage-induced p53 serine 392 kinase complex contains CK2, hSpt16, and SSRP1.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion mutants of CKII exhibit defective transcription of specific cell-cycle genes, which results in a delay in entrance into S phase (25Tripodi F. Nicastro R. Busnelli S. Cirulli C. Maffioli E. Tedeschi G. Alberghina L. Coccetti P. Protein kinase CK2 holoenzyme promotes start-specific transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Eukaryotic Cell. 2013; 12: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of dynamic protein interactions remains a significant challenge for proteomics because transient interaction partners are obtained at substoichiometric levels relative to bait proteins (reviewed in Ref. 26Miteva Y.V. Budayeva H.G. Cristea I.M. Proteomics-based methods for discovery, quantification, and validation of protein-protein interactions.Anal. Chem. 2013; 85: 749-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we focused on the transient interactome of FACT and PAF-C and found that they are interaction partners with CKII. The use of hierarchical clustering and normalized spectra abundance factor (NSAF) values from multiple baits readily identify reciprocal interactions between FACT/CKII and PAF-C/RNAPII. In-depth mass spectrometry analysis using MudPIT of biological replicate purifications of the FACT complex (Spt16-TAP) isolated under low-salt conditions followed by significance analysis of interactome (SAINT) resulted in the identification of statistically significant interactions between FACT, CKII, PAF-C, and histones. Additionally, we show that all five subunits of PAF-C are targeted for phosphorylation by CKII in vivo. Although PAF-C is subjected to extensive phosphorylation by CKII, reciprocal interactions between CKII and PAF-C were not observed. However, reciprocal interactions were detected between CKII and FACT, suggesting that the FACT complex may facilitate CKII modification of PAF-C. In support of this idea, we show that CKII copurified with Spt16-TAP readily phosphorylates PAF-C in vitro, whereas no detectable kinase activity copurified with PAF-C through Ctr9-FLAG. In addition, we purified PAF-C from WT and CKII-defective cells using a SILAC approach and definitively show that CKII activity is required for phosphorylation of multiple residues across the subunits of PAF-C. Finally, and consistent with a role for CKII in PAF-C and FACT function, we show that temperature-sensitive mutants of CKII display reduced levels of histone H2B-K123ub1. All yeast strains are listed in supplemental Table S1. Gene deletions were performed using gene replacement (27Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A.

A versatile toolbox for PCR-based tagging of yeast genes: new fluorescent proteins, more markers and promoter substitution cassettes.Yeast. 2004; 21: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). All expression plasmids contained the endogenous gene promoter. Mutagenesis of plasmids was performed with the QuikChange Lightning Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with the primers and plasmids described in supplemental Table S2. Plasmids were transformed into deletion strains using standard methods (28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. High-efficiency yeast transformation using the LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG method.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Endogenous Paf1 and Ctr9 were C-terminally tagged with the 3×-FLAG epitope using the p3FLAG plasmid (29Gelbart M.E. Rechsteiner T.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2098-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All strains were confirmed by Western blotting and PCR. TAP-tagged cells used for standard purifications were grown to an A600 = 2.0–2.5 in yeast extract, peptone, dextrose medium and pelleted by centrifugation. For stable isotope labeling in cells (SILAC) experiments, precultures of Ctr9-FLAG WT and cka1Δ cka2–8 were grown in yeast nitrogen base 2% glucose without arginine or lysine overnight. The cka2–8 allele is a temperature-sensitive mutant with defective function at 25 °C and 37 °C (30Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.

The precultures were used to inoculate 3-liter cultures of Ctr9-FLAG WT cells in yeast nitrogen base 2% glucose containing [13C6,15N2]lysine and [13C6,15N4]arginine, referred to as heavy medium. The Ctr9-FLAG mutant cka1Δ cka2–8 was grown in YNB 2% glucose containing standard 12C,14N-containing lysine and arginine, referred to as light medium. For the SILAC experiment, cells were grown to an A600 = 1.5–2.0 at 30 °C and then subjected to a 2-h heat shock at 37 °C. Tandem affinity purifications (TAPs) were performed as essentially described by Puig et al. (33Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B.

Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 100 or 350 mm NaCl (depending upon purification), 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm Na orthovanadate, and fresh yeast protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed using glass beads in a bead beater. The resulting lysate was treated with DNaseI and heparin sulfate at room temperature for 10 min to release any chromatin-bound proteins. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 500 μl of IgG-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) beads overnight at 4 °C. The slurry was washed to remove nonspecific binding proteins, resuspended in tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage buffer, and incubated with 100 units of AcTEVTM (Invitrogen) protease overnight at 4 °C. A disposable Poly-prep chromatography column was used to separate the beads from the cleaved protein by gravity flow. The beads, retained on the column, were washed with Calmodulin binding buffer. The protein flow-through was incubated with Calmodulin-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C and eluted from the beads with Calmodulin elution buffer containing 2 mm EGTA. FLAG tag affinity purifications were performed as described above with the following changes. After clarification of the lysate by centrifugation, the lysate was incubated with 500 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the lysate/resin slurry was passed through a disposable Poly-prep chromatography column to capture the FLAG resin. The resin was then washed extensively with lysis buffer prior to 3× FLAG peptide elution. The elutions were performed by incubation of the resin with 250 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of 3× FLAG peptide resuspended in lysis buffer. Following elution, the resin was washed with an additional 250 μl of lysis buffer that was also collected with the eluate. This process was repeated three to four times. Affinity purification elutions were TCA-precipitated overnight at 4 °C, followed by overnight digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C and then another overnight digestion with Trypsin Gold (Promega) at 37 °C. All digestions were quenched with formic acid to a final concentration of ∼5%. Peptide mixtures were analyzed by MudPIT mass spectrometry as described previously (37Smith-Kinnaman W.R. Berna M.J. Hunter G.O. True J.D. Hsu P. Cabello G.I. Fox M.J. Varani G. Mosley A.L. The interactome of the atypical phosphatase Rtr1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biosyst. 2014; 10: 1730-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each sample was pressure-loaded onto a 100-μm fused-silica nanospray column pulled to an ∼5-μm tip using a P-2000 laser puller. The microcapillary columns contained two C18 reverse phases (Aqua, Phenomenex) separated by strong cation exchange resin (Luna, Phenomenex). Each MudPIT column was placed in line with the LTQ Velos ion trap or LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer, and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV was applied to the nanocolumn. The automated MudPIT cycles consisted of four to ten 120-min steps with increasing concentrations of ammonium acetate. Four-step MudPIT consisted of 8-μl injections of 50, 100, 200, and 300 mm ammonium acetate, respectively, followed by a 20-min wash with buffer A (5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and then a 90-min organic gradient of 5–80% buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) to facilitate peptide elution from the reverse-phase resin. Four MudPIT steps were used for the SILAC-labeled Ctr9-FLAG purifications. Ten-step MudPIT consisted of 8-μl injections of 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and two 350 mm ammonium acetate steps, followed by a buffer A wash and buffer B gradient as described above. Ten-step MudPIT was performed for all other AP-MS samples. Each full scan (at a resolution of 60,000 in the Orbitrap) was followed by 10–15 MS/MS scans using data-dependent acquisition in the ion trap, where the most intense precursor ions were individually fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (collision energy = 35). Database searching of the RAW files was first done with SEQUEST HT (version 1.4.1.14) in Proteome Discoverer (1.4.0.288) using trypsin as the enzyme restriction and the following parameters: two missed cleavages for trypsin, a precursor mass tolerance of 1.4 Da for ion trap data and 10 ppm for Orbitrap data, a fragment mass tolerance of 1.0 daltons, a Δ CN value of [mteq]0.15, and a fixed modification of +57 Da on cysteine residues and variable modifications of +16 Da on methionine and +80 daltons on serine, tyrosine, and threonine. The SILAC experiments were searched as above but included dynamic modifications for [13C6,15N2]lysine and [13C6,15N4]arginine. A custom S. cerevisiae FASTA database was used for a database search that contained 6631 protein sequences, including the entire yeast proteome from Uniprot (downloaded on February 27, 2014), and ∼150 common contaminant proteins, including proteolytic enzymes, human keratins, and common laboratory contaminants. Additionally, we included the peptide sequence for the TAP tag used for isolation of all protein complexes studied. The PSM counts for the TAP tag were manually added to the PSM count of the bait (i.e. TAP-tagged) subunit for subsequent quantitative analysis. The msf files from Proteome Discoverer were imported into Scaffold 4, and the peptides from Scaffold were used for subsequent quantitative and posttranslational modification analysis for SAINT. The data obtained for the SILAC experiments were analyzed by the quantitation module within Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo) to calculate the total peak area for each precursor ion and the relative ratio of heavy to light precursor ions. For posttranslational modification analysis of Cdc73-TAP, spectra were analyzed with X!Tandem with the addition of protein N-terminal acetylation (+42 Da) as a dynamic search option. Each protein is required to have at least two peptides to be considered identified. Additionally, site-specific modifications are reported from manual interpretation of spectra to confirm the fragment ion coverage of the specific phosphorylation site. Peptides used for phosphorylation mapping were also required to have ≤150 ppm from the LTQ Velos ion trap or ≤10 ppm from the LTQ Velos Orbitrap. Peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) used for protein interaction analysis were identified at a peptide false discovery rate of less than or equal to 1% as calculated by Scaffold. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed as described previously (35Mosley A.L. Sardiu M.E. Pattenden S.G. Workman J.L. Florens L. Washburn M.P.

The peptide and protein identifications for the Spt16-TAP (n = 4), and Cdc73-TAP (n = 3) purifications are available upon request. Additionally all RAW data files, Scaffold data files, and peak list files have been deposited into the MassIVE data repository under the title “FACT, PAF-C, and CKII.” The total number of PSMs passing the criteria listed above were used for relative quantitation using the following approaches. Two empirical –fold change scores were calculated (38Mellacheruvu D. Wright Z. Couzens A.L. Lambert J.P. St-Denis N.A. Li T. Miteva Y.V. Hauri S. Sardiu M.E. Low T.Y. Halim V.A. Bagshaw R.D.

https://openalex.org/W2300362210,"This manuscript describes the development of an android-based smartphone application for capturing aerial photographs and spatial metadata automatically, for use in grassroots mapping applications. The aim of the project was to exploit the plethora of on-board sensors within modern smartphones (accelerometer, GPS, compass, camera) to generate ready-to-use spatial data from lightweight aerial platforms such as drones or kites. A visual coding 'scheme blocks' framework was used to build the application ('app'), so that users could customise their own data capture tools in the field. The paper reports on the coding framework, then shows the results of test flights from kites and lightweight drones and finally shows how open-source geospatial toolkits were used to generate geographical information system (GIS)-ready GeoTIFF images from the metadata stored by the app. Two Android smartphones were used in testing-a high specification OnePlus One handset and a lower cost Acer Liquid Z3 handset, to test the operational limits of the app on phones with different sensor sets. We demonstrate that best results were obtained when the phone was attached to a stable single line kite or to a gliding drone.

We aimed at comparing levels of inflammatory and atherogenic hormones from adipose tissue in the pericardial fluid and circulation of cardiovascular disease patients.Venous plasma (P) and pericardial fluid (PF) were obtained from elective cardiothoracic surgery patients (n = 37). Concentrations of leptin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) and adiponectin (APN) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The median concentration of leptin in PF (4.3 (interquartile range: 2.8-9.1) μg/L) was comparable to that in P (5.9 (2.2-11) μg/L) and these were significantly correlated to most of the same patient characteristics. The concentration of A-FABP was markedly higher (73 (28-124) versus 8.4 (5.2-14) μg/L) and that of APN was markedly lower (2.8 (1.7-4.2) versus 13 (7.2-19) mg/L) in PF compared to P. APN in PF was unlike in P not significantly related to age, body mass index, plasma triglycerides or coronary artery disease. PF levels of APN, but not A-FABP, were related to the size of paracardial adipocytes. PF levels of APN and A-FABP were not related to the immunoreactivity of paracardial adipocytes for these proteins.In cardiac and vascular disease patients, PF is enriched in A-FABP and poor in APN. This adipokine microenvironment is more likely determined by the heart than by the circulation or paracardial adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2345886604,"The visual wulst is the telencephalic target of the avian thalamofugal visual system. It contains several retinotopically organised representations of the contralateral visual field. We used optical imaging of intrinsic signals, electrophysiological recordings, and retrograde tracing with two fluorescent tracers to evaluate properties of these representations in the zebra finch, a songbird with laterally placed eyes. Our experiments revealed that there is some variability of the neuronal maps between individuals and also concerning the number of detectable maps. It was nonetheless possible to identify three different maps, a posterolateral, a posteromedial, and an anterior one, which were quite constant in their relation to each other. The posterolateral map was in contrast to the two others constantly visible in each successful experiment. The topography of the two other maps was mirrored against that map. Electrophysiological recordings in the anterior and the posterolateral map revealed that all units responded to flashes and to moving bars. Mean directional preferences as well as latencies were different between neurons of the two maps. Tracing experiments confirmed previous reports on the thalamo-wulst connections and showed that the anterior and the posterolateral map receive projections from separate clusters within the thalamic nuclei. Maps are connected to each other by wulst intrinsic projections. Our experiments confirm that the avian visual wulst contains several separate retinotopic maps with both different physiological properties and different thalamo-wulst afferents. This confirms that the functional organization of the visual wulst is very similar to its mammalian equivalent, the visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2346109650,"Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oil crop worldwide and exhibits significant heterosis. Effective pollination control systems, which are closely linked to anther development, are a prerequisite for utilizing heterosis. The anther, which is the male organ in flowering plants, undergoes many metabolic processes during development. Although the gene expression patterns underlying pollen development are well studied in model plant Arabidopsis, the regulatory networks of genome-wide gene expression during rapeseed anther development is poorly understood, especially regarding metabolic regulations. In this study, we systematically analyzed metabolic processes occurring during anther development in rapeseed using ultrastructural observation and global transcriptome analysis. Anther ultrastructure exhibited that numerous cellular organelles abundant with metabolic materials, such as elaioplast, tapetosomes, plastids (containing starch deposits) etc. appeared, accompanied with anther structural alterations during anther development, suggesting many metabolic processes occurring. Global transcriptome analysis revealed dynamic changes in gene expression during anther development that corresponded to dynamic functional alterations between early and late anther developmental stages. The early stage anthers preferentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism that are related to pollen extine formation as well as elaioplast and tapetosome biosynthesis, whereas the late stage anthers expressed genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism to form pollen intine and to accumulate starch in mature pollen grains. Finally, a predictive gene regulatory module responsible for early pollen extine formation was generated. Taken together, this analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of dynamic gene expression programming of metabolic processes in the rapeseed anther, especially with respect to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism during pollen development."
https://openalex.org/W2346854966,"Endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) is a novel gene reported to be involved in maintaining the homeostasis of ECs. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of CREG in high glucose/high palmitate-induced EC apoptosis and to decipher the upstream regulatory mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of CREG.The expression of CREG and the rate of apoptosis were assessed in lower-limb atherosclerotic lesions from patients with type 2 DM (T2DM). Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and cultured in a high glucose/high palmitate medium (25 mmol/L D-glucose, 0.4 mmol/L palmitate), and the over-expression and knock-down of CREG were performed in HUVECs to determine the role of CREG in EC apoptosis. The upstream regulatory mechanism of CREG was identified using a promoter-binding transcription-factor profiling array, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and a mutation analysis.Compared with normal arteries from non-diabetic patients, reduced CREG expression and increased apoptosis were found in the endothelium of atherosclerotic lesions from patients with T2DM. In vitro treatment of HUVECs with a high glucose/high palmitate medium also resulted in decreased CREG expression and increased apoptosis. Moreover, high glucose/high palmitate induced-HUVEC apoptosis was increased by the knock-down of CREG and rescued by the over-expression of CREG. We also demonstrated that GATA1 was able to bind to the promoter of the human CREG gene. A deletion mutation at -297/-292 in the CREG promoter disrupted GATA1 binding and reduced the activation of CREG transcription by approximately 83.3%. Finally, the overexpression of GATA1 abrogated the high glucose/high palmitate-induced apoptosis in HUVECs.The over-expression of CREG inhibits high glucose/high palmitate-induced apoptosis in HUVECs. CREG is transcriptionally upregulated by GATA1. Thus, CREG might be a potential therapeutic target for intervention of vascular complications related to diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2346769521,"Three conventional Bayesian approaches (BayesA, BayesB and BayesCπ) have been demonstrated to be powerful in predicting genomic merit for complex traits in livestock. A priori, these Bayesian models assume that the non-zero SNP effects (marginally) follow a t-distribution depending on two fixed hyperparameters, degrees of freedom and scale parameters. In this study, we performed genomic prediction in Chinese Simmental beef cattle and treated degrees of freedom and scale parameters as unknown with inappropriate priors. Furthermore, we compared the modified methods (BayesFA, BayesFB and BayesFCπ) with their corresponding counterparts using simulation datasets. We found that the modified methods with distribution assumed to the two hyperparameters were beneficial for improving the predictive accuracy. Our results showed that the predictive accuracies of the modified methods were slightly higher than those of their counterparts especially for traits with low heritability and a small number of QTLs. Moreover, cross-validation analysis for three traits, namely carcass weight, live weight and tenderloin weight, in 1136 Simmental beef cattle suggested that predictive accuracy of BayesFCπ noticeably outperformed BayesCπ with the highest increase (3.8%) for live weight using the cohort masking cross-validation."
https://openalex.org/W2347186564,"Background Growing body of literature has reported that weight status estimation pattern, including accurate-, under-, and overestimation, was associated with weight related behaviors and weight change among adolescents and young adults. However, there have been a few studies investigating the potential role of school contexts in shaping adolescents’ weight status estimation pattern among Korea adolescents. Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between weight status misperception patterns and factors at individual-, family-, and school-level, simultaneously, and whether there was significant between schools variation in the distribution of each weight status misperception pattern, underestimation and overestimation respectively, among Korean adolescents aged 12–18 years. Method Data from the Eighth Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS), 2012, a nationally representative online survey of 72,228 students (boys = 37,229, girls = 34,999) from a total of 797 middle and high schools were used. Sex stratified multilevel random intercept multinomial logistic models where adolescents (level 1) were nested within schools (level 2) were performed. Results At the school level, attending a school with higher average BMI (kg/m2) was positively associated with weight status underestimation, and inversely associated with weight status overestimation among boys and girls. Single-sex schooling was positively associated with weight status underestimation among girls. At the family level, higher household income (high/middle versus low) was inversely associated with both weight status under- and overestimation among boys and girls. Higher maternal education (equal to or more than college graduate versus equal to or less than high school graduate) was positively associated with weight status overestimation among boys, and living with both parents (compared to not living with both parents) was inversely associated with weight status underestimation among girls. At the individual level, high academic achievement (compared to low) was positively associated with weight status underestimation among boys and girls. Conclusions While further research with prospective designs and objectively measured anthropometric information is needed, school environmental factors such as sex composition and school average BMI, as well as, family contexts such as socioeconomic status need to be considered when developing and implementing obesity prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2345826220,"Connexins (Cxs) are a family of membrane-spanning proteins that form gap junction channels and hemichannels. Connexin-based channels exhibit two distinct voltage-dependent gating mechanisms termed slow and fast gating. Residues located at the C terminus of the first transmembrane segment (TM-1) are important structural components of the slow gate. Here, we determined the role of the charged residues at the end of TM-1 in voltage sensing in Cx26, Cx46, and Cx50. Conductance/voltage curves obtained from tail currents together with kinetics analysis reveal that the fast and slow gates of Cx26 involves the movement of two and four charges across the electric field, respectively. Primary sequence alignment of different Cxs shows the presence of well conserved glutamate residues in the C terminus of TM-1; only Cx26 contains a lysine in that position (lysine 41). Neutralization of lysine 41 in Cx26 increases the voltage dependence of the slow gate. Swapping of lysine 41 with glutamate 42 maintains the voltage dependence. In Cx46, neutralization of negative charges or addition of a positive charge in the Cx26 equivalent region reduced the slow gate voltage dependence. In Cx50, the addition of a glutamate in the same region decreased the voltage dependence, and the neutralization of a negative charge increased it. These results indicate that the charges at the end of TM-1 are part of the slow gate voltage sensor in Cxs. The fact that Cx42, which has no charge in this region, still presents voltage-dependent slow gating suggests that charges still unidentified also contribute to the slow gate voltage sensitivity.

Cxs 3The abbreviations used are: CxconnexinTMtransmembraneELextracellular loopGJgap junctionGJCgap junction channel. are a family of membrane-spanning proteins involved in intercellular and paracrine/autocrine cellular communication. There are 21 human Cx genes that are widely expressed in virtually all human tissues (1Söhl G. Willecke K. An update on connexin genes and their nomenclature in mouse and man.Cell Commun. Adhes. 2003; 10: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The topology of Cxs involves four transmembrane (TM) segments connected through two extracellular loops (EL) and one intracellular loop, and the N and C termini are facing the cytoplasm (2Sosinsky G.E. Nicholson B.J. Structural organization of gap junction channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3Maeda S. Nakagawa S. Suga M. Yamashita E.

Cx monomers oligomerize in hexamers, which traffic to the plasma membrane and form connexons or hemichannels that can act as plasma membrane channels or can travel to intercellular contact zones, where they form intercellular channels known as gap junctions (GJs) (4Harris A.L. Emerging issues of connexin channels: biophysics fills the gap.Q Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cx-based channels can be regulated by different mechanisms such as redox signaling (5Retamal M.A. Connexin and pannexin hemichannels are regulated by redox potential.Front. Physiol. 2014; 5: 80Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), metabolic inhibition (6Contreras J.E. Sánchez H.A. Eugenin E.A. Speidel D. Theis M. Willecke K. Bukauskas F.F. Bennett M.V. Sáez J.C.

Although the voltage sensor domain of Cxs has not been clearly established, there is evidence suggesting that residues lining the pore of the channel are involved in transjunctional voltage dependence in GJs (11Harris A.L. Spray D.C. Bennett M.V. Kinetic properties of a voltage-dependent junctional conductance.J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 95-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In Cx-based channels, two voltage-dependent gating mechanisms can be distinguished, slow or loop gating and fast or Vj gating (12González D. Gómez-Hernández J.M. Barrio L.C. Molecular basis of voltage dependence of connexin channels: an integrative appraisal.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2007; 94: 66-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The term fast gating is used to describe the transition of the channel between the open and subconductance state, supposedly related to an occlusion of the conduction pathway by the N terminus (3Maeda S. Nakagawa S. Suga M. Yamashita E. Oshima A. Fujiyoshi Y. Tsukihara T.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10034-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, in slow gating the channel transits through several intermediate conductances between the open and the fully closed states (14Trexler E.B. Bennett M.V. Bargiello T.A. Verselis V.K. Voltage gating and permeation in a gap junction hemichannel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This has been related to a turn of the 310-helix region at the end of TM-1 (3Maeda S. Nakagawa S. Suga M. Yamashita E. Oshima A. Fujiyoshi Y. Tsukihara T. Structure of the connexin 26 gap junction channel at 3.5 A resolution.Nature. 2009; 458: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 15Tang Q. Dowd T.L. Verselis V.K. Bargiello T.A.

Physiol. 2009; 133: 555-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The GJ voltage dependence varies in its magnitude and polarity among different Cxs (12González D. Gómez-Hernández J.M. Barrio L.C. Molecular basis of voltage dependence of connexin channels: an integrative appraisal.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2007; 94: 66-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For example, Cx26 GJ closes at positive potentials, and Cx32 closes at negative potentials. In heterotypic GJs formed by Cx26 and Cx32, the channel closes only when the Cx26 side is positive (16Barrio L.C. Suchyna T. Bargiello T. Xu L.X. Roginski R.S. Bennett M.V. Nicholson B.J. Gap junctions formed by connexins 26 and 32 alone and in combination are differently affected by applied voltage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 8410-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The amino acids located in the N terminus of the protein define these differences in polarity. In regard to Cx26 and Cx32, the identity of the second amino acid in the N terminus defines the polarity of closing. If the second amino acid is neutral or positively charged, closing occurs at negative potentials. Otherwise, if it is negatively charged, positive potentials close the channel (10Verselis V.K. Ginter C.S. Bargiello T.A. Opposite voltage gating polarities of two closely related connexins.Nature. 1994; 368: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Insertion of negatively charged residues up to the 10th position of the N terminus of Cx32 can reverse the polarity of the fast gate, suggesting that in this region of the N terminus there is a voltage drop that can be “sensed” by charged residues (17Purnick P.E. Oh S. Abrams C.K. Verselis V.K. Bargiello T.A. Reversal of the gating polarity of gap junctions by negative charge substitutions in the N terminus of connexin 32.Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2403-2415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The structure of Cx26 channel supports the previously proposed model, which showed that the N terminus is located inside the pore of the channel. Because of charged residues in this segment, the N terminus acts as a fast gate particle in a voltage-dependent way (3Maeda S. Nakagawa S. Suga M. Yamashita E. Oshima A. Fujiyoshi Y. Tsukihara T. Structure of the connexin 26 gap junction channel at 3.5 A resolution.Nature. 2009; 458: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 13Oshima A. Tani K. Hiroaki Y. Fujiyoshi Y. Sosinsky G.E.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10034-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Charged residues at the end of TM-1 also seem to play a role in the voltage dependence of Cx26 and Cx32 GJs (10Verselis V.K.

To determine the voltage dependence of Cx hemichannels, it could be useful to consider that in some Cxs both gates have different polarities, so they can be studied separately. Cx26, Cx46, and Cx50 are good candidates, because their conductance/voltage (G/V) relationship gives a bell-shaped curve (19Verselis V.K. Srinivas M.

Species specificity of mammalian connexin-26 to form open voltage-gated hemichannels.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The slow gating mechanism in Cx26 hemichannels has been associated with a conformational change of the TM-1/EL-1 region of the protein. This change is most likely a rotation of the helix, which would close the channel (22Verselis V.K. Trelles M.P. Rubinos C. Bargiello T.A. Srinivas M.

Chem. 2009; 284: 4484-4493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region are known to affect the voltage dependence of GJCs, but their particular effects on slow gating are unknown (10Verselis V.K. Ginter C.S. Bargiello T.A. Opposite voltage gating polarities of two closely related connexins.Nature. 1994; 368: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18Rubin J.B. Verselis V.K. Bennett M.V. Bargiello T.A. Molecular analysis of voltage dependence of heterotypic gap junctions formed by connexins 26 and 32.Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 183-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken with the purpose of defining the molecular determinants of voltage-dependent slow gating in Cx26, Cx46, and Cx50 hemichannels. In Cx26, neutralization of lysine 41 decreases the voltage dependence of the fast gate and increases that of the slow gate, and swapping lysine 41 and glutamate 42 does not change the voltage dependence of the slow gating mechanism but increases that of the fast gating mechanism. We further studied the voltage modulation mechanism by TM-1 charges in slow gating of Cx50 and Cx46, where there are one and two negatively charged glutamate residues, respectively. In Cx46, glutamate neutralization decreased the voltage dependence of the slow gate, and glutamate mutation to lysine further decreased this voltage dependence. In contrast, in Cx50 the neutralization of the glutamate residue in this region increased the voltage dependence of the slow gating, and the addition of a new glutamate residue decreased the voltage dependence. Cx42, which not contain any charged residues in this region, still presents voltage-gated slow gating. It is concluded that charged residues at the end of TM-1 are part of the voltage sensor of the slow gate of Cx hemichannels. Cx sequences were identified by performing a Delta Blast (23Boratyn G.M.

Stage V and VI oocytes were selected, defolliculated, and injected with 50–0.5 ng of the RNA, plus Cx38 antisense, to null endogenous expression of Cx38 (26White T.W. Bruzzone R. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mouse Cx50, a functional member of the connexin family of gap junction proteins, is the lens fiber protein MP70.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Oocytes were incubated at 17 °C in ND96 medium containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 1.8 CaCl2. Hemichannel currents were recorded 24–72 h after injection. Hemichannel currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique with an “oocyte clamp” amplifier (Warner Instruments). Electrodes were filled with a 3 m KCl solution and exhibited resistances between 0.5 and 2 megaohms. The bath solution contained (in mm) 88 choline chloride, 1 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4. Macroscopic currents were acquired at 1 kHz using an analog to digital converter “Digidata 1200” (Axon Instruments). The Ii(V)/Imax relation was obtained for Cx26, Cx42, Cx46, and Cx50 from the steady state of the macroscopic tail currents. In the case of Cx26, this curve was fitted with the three-state kinetic model. For this model, the equilibrium constants for the slow (Ks) and fast (Kf) gates were defined as shown in Equations 1 and 2, Ks=O1C=ezsF(V−Vs)RTEq. 1 Kf=O2O1=ezfF(V−Vf)RTEq. 2 where zs and zf are the equivalent gating charges (zδ, or the number of charges z multiplied by a fraction of the field δ they cross) of the slow and fast gates, respectively; V is the membrane voltage; Vs and Vf are the voltages at which Ks and Kf are equal to 1, respectively; and R, T, and F have their usual meanings. By using these equations we can write the relative probability of the state O1 (PO1) and O2 (PO2) as shown in Equations 3 and 4, PO1=Ks1+Ks+Ks⋅KfEq. 3 PO2=Ks⋅Kf1+Ks+Ks⋅KfEq. 4 The current I in the steady state will be given by the relative probabilities of the open states shown in Equation 5, I(V)=(V−Vrev)×(gO1PO1+gO2PO2)Eq. 5 where Vrev is the reversal potential; and gO1 and gO2 are the conductance of the O1 and O2 states. If the tail currents Ii are used and data are normalized for the maximal tail current Imax, the Ii(V)/Imax relationship would be as shown in Equation 6, Ii(V)Imax=PO1+pO2⋅gO2gO1PO1M+pO2M⋅gO2gO1Eq. 6 where Ii is the tail current of the ith trace; Imax is the maximum tail current, and PO1M and PO2M are the probabilities of the O1 and O2 states at Imax. For human Cx26, it has been observed that the relationship between the conductance of the subconductance state and the open state is about 0.11 (21González D. Gómez-Hernández J.M. Barrio L.C. Species specificity of mammalian connexin-26 to form open voltage-gated hemichannels.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because the slow gate can be easily separated from the fast gate for Cx42, Cx46, and Cx50, the Ii(V)/Imax data were fitted using two-state model. In this case the tail current data (Ii) is well fitted using the Boltzmann equation (Equation 7), Ii(V)=Imax1+eZsF(V−Vs)RTEq. 7 To analyze the current relaxation kinetics of Cx26, a monoexponential fitting of current traces was applied as shown in Equation 8, I(t)=I0e−tτ+IssEq. 8 where I(t) is the current at time t; I0 is the current at time 0; and Iss is the stationary state current. The exponential factor τ is the time constant, which in a two-state system is determined by the inverse of the sum of the forward and reverse reaction rates α and β, respectively. This is shown in Equation 9. τ=1α+βEq. 9 In a voltage-dependent channel, α and β are voltage-dependent and can be expressed as shown in Equations 10 and 11, α(V)=α0ezαFVRTEq. 10 β(V)=β0ezβFVRTEq. 11 where α0 and β0 are the values of α and β at 0 mV, and zα and zβ are the equivalent charges of α and β. Because of the differences in the kinetics of slow and fast gating, the fast gate can be approximated as a quasi-two-state process, and the voltage dependence of the fast gate in Cx26 hemichannels can be obtained. The logarithms of the time constant versus voltage data were fitted with a linear regression separately for the activation (α) or deactivation (β) of the fast gate. Voltage dependence of the rates was obtained from the slope of these fittings. Fitting of the three-state model was done with the Solver complement of Excel (Microsoft). Fitting of the current traces was done using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm built in the pClamp software (Axon). The linear fitting and graph figures were done with Prism (GraphPad). The optimization of parameters was performed by minimizing squared errors. Cx26 ionic currents were simulated with the IonChannelLab software (27Santiago-Castillo J.A. Covarrubias M.

Simulating complex ion channel kinetics with IonChannelLab.Channels. 2010; 4: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using our kinetic model. The rates and z values for the transition between O1 and O2 were taken from Table 2. Because we cannot directly determine the rates and individual z values for the slow gate (transition between C and O1), they were estimated from our data (Table 3), assuming τ = 22 s for the slow gates at −50 mV and a z for the O1 → C transition of 0.2 reported previously (28Lopez W.

Open table in a new tab As there is no experimental structure for rat Cx46 and mouse Cx50, comparative structural models were generated for this study, using the Modeler software (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar) and taking the structure of human Cx26 (Protein Data Bank code 2ZW3) as a template. To start building the models, the alignments of each target sequence and the structural template from our alignment of non-redundant Cx sequences were extracted, and gap-only regions were eliminated. Ten models were generated in each case, and those with the lowest discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar) were selected as the final models. Missing residues of human Cx26 were inserted with Modeler. This was performed by generating models of the human Cx26 structure, using the full sequence of human Cx26 as the target, and the structure of Cx26 (Protein Data Bank code 2ZW3) as a template. The backbone of the experimental Cx26 structure was fully conserved. Non-redundant Cx sequences were aligned with MAFFT, as explained under “Experimental Procedures” (481 sequences were used). From this alignment, the sequences of several Cxs with known gap junctional voltage dependence were selected (12González D. Gómez-Hernández J.M. Barrio L.C. Molecular basis of voltage dependence of connexin channels: an integrative appraisal.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2007; 94: 66-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This study specially focused on charges of the N terminus and TM-1 regions that were previously associated with voltage dependence and gating of Cxs (Fig. 1) (17Purnick P.E. Oh S. Abrams C.K. Verselis V.K. Bargiello T.A. Reversal of the gating polarity of gap junctions by negative charge substitutions in the N terminus of connexin 32.Biophys.

Nevertheless, there is no clear pattern of charges that can explain the differences in voltage dependence among these Cxs, which is clearly evident when zebrafish Cx35 and mice Cx37 were analyzed, which, despite showing little difference in the distribution of charged residues, have a voltage dependence of about 1 elementary charge (e0) and 11 e0, respectively (30McLachlan E. White T.W. Ugonabo C. Olson C. Nagy J.I. Valdimarsson G. Zebrafish Cx35: cloning and characterization of a gap junction gene highly expressed in the retina.J. Neurosci.

It is interesting to note that human Cx26 is the only Cx having a positively charged residue at the end of TM-1 (lysine 41). This lysine is conserved among different orthologs of Cx26 but is absent in all other Cx isoforms analyzed. To obtain the voltage dependence of the fast and slow gating mechanisms of Cx26, a tail current (Itail) analysis was performed (Fig. 2A). Voltage pulse steps from −60 to +60 mV were applied to oocytes expressing Cx26 from a holding potential of +30 mV. The addition of 200 μm lanthanum (La3+), which is a well known hemichannel inhibitor, completely eliminated these currents (Fig. 3A). Indeed, control oocytes injected only with the antisense oligonucleotide against the endogenous Cx38 showed currents similar to those recorded in the presence of La3+ (Fig. 3B). The I(V)/Imax curve of the WT Cx26 showed a minimal conductance at voltages lower than −60 mV. Maximal tail current amplitude was at +40 mV and then started to decrease at more positive voltages (Fig. 2L, red squares). The slow gating process was defined by the ascendant part (or steepness)"
https://openalex.org/W2346083552,"It has been observed that, historically, strains of pandemic influenza led to succeeding seasonal waves, albeit with decidedly different patterns. Recent studies suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has had an impact on the circulation patterns of seasonal influenza strains in the post-pandemic years. In this work we aim to investigate this issue and also to compare the relative transmissibility of these waves of differing strains using Taiwan influenza surveillance data before, during and after the pandemic.We make use of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Prevention influenza surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed subtyping of samples and a mathematical model to determine the waves of circulating (and co-circulating) H1, H3 and B virus strains in Taiwan during 2008-2014; or namely, short before, during and after the 2009 pandemic. We further pinpoint the turning points and relative transmissibility of each wave, in order to ascertain whether any temporal pattern exists.For two consecutive years following the 2009 pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in Taiwan (as in most of Northern Hemisphere), sometimes co-circulating with AH3. From the evolution point of view, A(H1N1)pdm09 and AH3 were able to sustain their circulation patterns to the end of 2010. In fact, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated in six separate waves in Taiwan between summer of 2009 and spring of 2014. Since 2009, a wave of A(H1N1)pmd09 occurred every fall/winter influenza season during our study period except 2011-2012 season, when mainly influenza strain B circulated. In comparing transmissibility, while the estimated per capita weekly growth rates for cumulative case numbers (and the reproduction number) seem to be lower for most of the influenza B waves (0.06~0.26; range of 95% CIs: 0.05~0.32) when compared to those of influenza A, the wave of influenza B from week 8 to week 38 of 2010 immediately following the fall/winter wave of 2009 A(H1N1) pdm09 was substantially higher at r = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.28), in fact highest among all the waves detected in this study. Moreover, when AH3 or A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibit high incidence, reported cases of subtype B decreases and vice versa. Further modeling analysis indicated that during the study period, Taiwan nearly experienced at least one wave of influenza epidemic of some strain every summer except in 2012.Estimates of R for seasonal influenza are consistent with that of temperate and tropical-subtropical regions, while estimate of R for A(H1N1)pdm09 is comparatively less than countries in Europe and North America, but similar to that of tropical-subtropical regions. This offers indication of regional differences in transmissibility of influenza virus that exists only for pandemic influenza. Despite obvious limitations in the data used, this study, designed to qualitatively compare the temporal patterns and transmissibility of the waves of different strains, illustrates how influenza subtyping data can be utilized to explore the mechanism for various influenza strains to compete or to circulate, to possibly provide predictors of future trends in the evolution of influenza viruses of various subtypes, and perhaps more importantly, to be of use to future annual seasonal influenza vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2345555621,"In Inner Mongolia, steppe grasslands face desertification or degradation because of human overuse and abandonment after inappropriate agricultural management. The soils in these abandoned croplands exist in heterogeneous environments characterized by widely fluctuating microbial growth. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of microbial genes encoding proteins involved in the nitrogen cycle was used to study Azotobacter species, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers in the soils from steppe grasslands and croplands abandoned for 2, 6, and 26 years. Except for nitrifying archaea and nitrous oxide-reducing bacteria, the relative genotypic abundance of microbial communities involved in nitrogen metabolism differed by approximately 2- to 10-fold between abandoned cropland and steppe grassland soils. Although nitrogen-cycle gene abundances varied with abandonment time, the abundance patterns of nitrogen-cycle genes separated distinctly into abandoned cropland versus light-grazing steppe grassland, despite the lack of any cultivation for over a quarter-century. Plant biomass and plant diversity exerted a significant effect on the abundance of microbial communities that mediate the nitrogen cycle (P < 0.002 and P < 0.03, respectively). The present study elucidates the ecology of bacteria that mediate the nitrogen cycle in recently abandoned croplands."
https://openalex.org/W2345626617,"Rationale Perioperative myocardial ischemia is common in high-risk patients. The use of interventional revascularisation or even thrombolysis is limited in this patient subset due to exceedingly high bleeding risks. Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) with lidocaine had been suggested to reduce infarct size and cardiomyocyte cell death in ischemia/reperfusion models. However, the impact of lidocaine on cardiac function during sustained ischemia still remains unclear. Methods Sustained myocardial ischemia was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending artery in 12–16 weeks old male BALB/c mice. Subcutaneous lidocaine (30 mg/kg) was used to block VGSC. Cardiac function was quantified at baseline and at 72h by conventional and speckle-tracking based echocardiography to allow high-sensitivity in vivo phenotyping. Infarct size and cardiomyocyte cell death were assessed post mortem histologically and indirectly using troponin measurements. Results Ischemia strongly impaired both, global systolic and diastolic function, which were partially rescued in lidocaine treated in mice. No differences regarding infarct size and cardiomyocyte cell death were observed. Mechanistically, and as shown with speckle-tracking analysis, lidocaine specifically improves residual contractility in the ischemic but not in the remote, non-ischemic myocardium. Conclusion VGSC blockade with lidocaine rescues function of ischemic myocardium as a potential bridging to revascularisation in the setting of perioperative myocardial ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2346561278,"The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein hijacks host cells via direct interactions with many key cellular proteins, such as KAT2B, also known as PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor). E1A binds the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of KAT2B to repress its transcriptional activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which E1A inhibits the HAT activity is not known. Here we demonstrate that a short and relatively conserved N-terminal motif (cNM) in the intrinsically disordered E1A protein is crucial for KAT2B interaction, and inhibits its HAT activity through a direct competition with acetyl-CoA, but not its substrate histone H3. Molecular modeling together with a series of mutagenesis experiments suggests that the major helix of E1A cNM binds to a surface of the acetyl-CoA pocket of the KAT2B HAT domain. Moreover, transient expression of the cNM peptide is sufficient to inhibit KAT2B-specific H3 acetylation H3K14ac in vivo Together, our data define an essential motif cNM in N-terminal E1A as an acetyl-CoA entry blocker that directly associates with the entrance of acetyl-CoA binding pocket to block the HAT domain access to its cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W2346816366,"A monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the leukocyte common antigen CD45 (RT7 in rats) could facilitate bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study in rats evaluates a depletive rat anti-RT7a mAb as isolated tool for BMT conditioning without using irradiation or any chemotherapeutic / immunosuppressive agent.The model used a CD45 di-allelic polymorphism (RT7a/RT7b). The anti-RT7a mAb was intravenously administered to LEW.1W rats (RT1uRT7a) at 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. 1x10(8) BM cells of MHC syngeneic (RT1u), MHC disparate (RT1l) or MHC haploidentical (RT1u/l) donors were transplanted. All BM donor strains carried the RT7b allele so that their CD45+ cells were not affected by the anti-RT7a mAb. Recipients were monitored for reconstitution and donor-chimerism in blood leukocytes.mAb dosages of 5 or 10 mg/kg were myelosuppressive, whereas 15 mg/kg was myeloablative. Multi-lineage donor-chimerism at day 100 indicated engraftment of MHC syngeneic BM after any used mAb dosage (5 mg/kg: 46+/-7%; 10 mg/kg: 62+/-5%; 15 mg/kg: 80+/-4%). MHC disparate BM resulted in autologous reconstitution after conditioning by 10 mg/kg of the mAb and caused transient chimerism ending up in death associated with aplasia after conditioning by 15 mg/kg of the mAb. MHC haploidentical BM (F1 to parental) engrafted only after conditioning by 15 mg/kg (chimerism at day 100: 78+/-7%). Abandonment of α/β TCR+ cell depletion from BM grafts impaired the engraftment process after conditioning using 15 mg/kg of the mAb in the MHC syngeneic setting (2 of 6 recipients failed to engraft) and the MHC haploidentical setting (3 of 6 recipients failed).This depletive anti-RT7a mAb is myelosuppressive and conditions for engraftment of MHC syngeneic BM. The mAb also facilitates engraftment of MHC haploidentical BM, if a myeloablative dose is used. RT7b expressing, BM-seeded α/β TCR+ cells seem to impair the engraftment process after myeloablative mAb conditioning."
