Here, we assess the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) on binding, neutralizing, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–competing antibodies elicited by the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine mRNA-1273 over 7 months. Cross-reactive neutralizing responses were rare after a single dose. At the peak of response to the second vaccine dose, all individuals had responses to all variants. Binding and functional antibodies against variants persisted in most subjects, albeit at low levels, for 6 months after the primary series of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Across all assays, B.1.351 had the lowest antibody recognition. These data complement ongoing studies to inform the potential need for additional boost vaccinations."

We analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. Total expenditure increased with fat-free mass in a power-law manner, with four distinct life stages. Fat-free mass-adjusted expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to ~50% above adult values at ~1 year; declines slowly to adult levels by ~20 years; remains stable in adulthood (20 to 60 years), even during pregnancy; then declines in older adults. These changes shed light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the life span."

Abel et al . show that optimal pairing of a bromomethyl ether and indium or zinc Lewis acid produces polydioxolane with high tensile strength that may be advantageous for packaging applications. Heating this plastic in strong acid easily breaks it back down to its acetal monomer, which can then be recovered by distillation from mixed plastic waste streams in high yield. —JSY"

We conducted a single-arm open-label phase 1 trial ( NCT03215810 ) of TILs administered with nivolumab in 20 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer following initial progression on nivolumab monotherapy. The primary end point was safety and secondary end points included objective response rate, duration of response and T cell persistence. Autologous TILs were expanded ex vivo from minced tumors cultured with interleukin-2. Patients received cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion, TIL infusion and interleukin-2, followed by maintenance nivolumab. The end point of safety was met according to the prespecified criteria of ≤17% rate of severe toxicity (95% confidence interval, 3-29%). Of 13 evaluable patients, 3 had confirmed responses and 11 had reduction in tumor burden, with a median best change of 35%. Two patients achieved complete responses that were ongoing 1.5 years later. In exploratory analyses, we found T cells recognizing multiple types of cancer mutations were detected after TIL treatment and were enriched in responding patients. Neoantigen-reactive T cell clonotypes increased and persisted in peripheral blood after treatment. Cell therapy with autologous TILs is generally safe and clinically active and may constitute a new treatment strategy in metastatic lung cancer."

Here, we present par-seqFISH (parallel sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization), a transcriptome-imaging approach that records gene expression and spatial context within microscale assemblies at a single-cell and molecule resolution. We applied this approach to the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, analyzing about 600,000 individuals across dozens of conditions in planktonic and biofilm cultures. We identified numerous metabolic- and virulence-related transcriptional states that emerged dynamically during planktonic growth, as well as highly spatially resolved metabolic heterogeneity in sessile populations. Our data reveal that distinct physiological states can coexist within the same biofilm just several micrometers away, underscoring the importance of the microenvironment. Our results illustrate the complex dynamics of microbial populations and present a new way of studying them at high resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3188937682,"A Western-style, high-fat diet promotes cardiovascular disease, in part because it is rich in choline, which is converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by the gut microbiota. However, whether diet-induced changes in intestinal physiology can alter the metabolic capacity of the microbiota remains unknown. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we show that chronic exposure to a high-fat diet escalates Escherichia coli choline catabolism by altering intestinal epithelial physiology. A high-fat diet impaired the bioenergetics of mitochondria in the colonic epithelium to increase the luminal bioavailability of oxygen and nitrate, thereby intensifying respiration-dependent choline catabolism of E. coli In turn, E. coli choline catabolism increased levels of circulating trimethlamine N-oxide, which is a potentially harmful metabolite generated by gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3189464306,Potato pectin falls to Phytophthora Phytophthora infestans is a plant oomycete pathogen that drove the potato famines of the 1800s and continues to afflict potato fields today. The polysaccharide pectin makes up about a third of the cell wall in potatoes. Sabbadin et al . identified a family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LMPOs) that cleave pectin and are upregulated in P. infestans during infection. Silencing the relevant LMPO gene successfully inhibited P. infestans infections. These findings open doors for disease intervention targets and for biotech applications. —PJH
https://openalex.org/W3190866268,"The origin of human metaplastic states and their propensity for cancer is poorly understood. Barrett's esophagus is a common metaplastic condition that increases the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and its cellular origin is enigmatic. To address this, we harvested tissues spanning the gastroesophageal junction from healthy and diseased donors, including isolation of esophageal submucosal glands. A combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, in silico lineage tracing from methylation, open chromatin and somatic mutation analyses, and functional studies in organoid models showed that Barrett's esophagus originates from gastric cardia through c-MYC and HNF4A-driven transcriptional programs. Furthermore, our data indicate that esophageal adenocarcinoma likely arises from undifferentiated Barrett's esophagus cell types even in the absence of a pathologically identifiable metaplastic precursor, illuminating early detection strategies."

MXenes are a family of materials made of layers of inorganic transition metal carbides and nitrides that are a few atoms thick and are manufactured by selective etching. Attempts to make similar boridene materials have been challenging because of the reactive nature of boride phases and because the parent materials tend to dissolve rather than selectively etch.

https://openalex.org/W3187229495,"In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the occurrence of myocardial fibrosis is associated with adverse outcome. Whether pirfenidone, an oral antifibrotic agent without hemodynamic effect, is efficacious and safe for the treatment of HFpEF is unknown. In this double-blind, phase 2 trial ( NCT02932566 ), we enrolled patients with heart failure, an ejection fraction of 45% or higher and elevated levels of natriuretic peptides. Eligible patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance and those with evidence of myocardial fibrosis, defined as a myocardial extracellular volume of 27% or greater, were randomly assigned to receive pirfenidone or placebo for 52 weeks. Forty-seven patients were randomized to each of the pirfenidone and placebo groups. The primary outcome was change in myocardial extracellular volume, from baseline to 52 weeks. In comparison to placebo, pirfenidone reduced myocardial extracellular volume (between-group difference, -1.21%; 95% confidence interval, -2.12 to -0.31; P = 0.009), meeting the predefined primary outcome. Twelve patients (26%) in the pirfenidone group and 14 patients (30%) in the placebo group experienced one or more serious adverse events. The most common adverse events in the pirfenidone group were nausea, insomnia and rash. In conclusion, among patients with HFpEF and myocardial fibrosis, administration of pirfenidone for 52 weeks reduced myocardial fibrosis. The favorable effects of pirfenidone in patients with HFpEF will need to be confirmed in future trials."

Here we show that programmed mitochondrial removal, a hallmark of mammalian erythropoiesis, is defective in SLE. Specifically, we demonstrate that during human erythroid cell maturation, a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated metabolic switch is responsible for the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which precedes and is necessary for the autophagic removal of mitochondria. A defect in this pathway leads to accumulation of red blood cells (RBCs) carrying mitochondria (Mito+ RBCs) in SLE patients and in correlation with disease activity. Antibody-mediated internalization of Mito+ RBCs induces type I interferon (IFN) production through activation of cGAS in macrophages. Accordingly, SLE patients carrying both Mito+ RBCs and opsonizing antibodies display the highest levels of blood IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signatures, a distinctive feature of SLE. Emerging evidence supports that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Here we show that programmed mitochondrial removal, a hallmark of mammalian erythropoiesis, is defective in SLE. Specifically, we demonstrate that during human erythroid cell maturation, a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated metabolic switch is responsible for the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which precedes and is necessary for the autophagic removal of mitochondria.

Accordingly, SLE patients carrying both Mito+ RBCs and opsonizing antibodies display the highest levels of blood IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signatures, a distinctive feature of SLE. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is considered a prototype “type I interferonopathy.” Thus, recombinant interferon (IFN) induces a lupus-like syndrome indistinguishable from spontaneous SLE (Rönnblom et al., 1991Rönnblom L.E. Alm G.V. Oberg K.E. Autoimmunity after alpha-interferon therapy for malignant carcinoid tumors.Ann. Intern.

Neutralizing interferon alpha as a therapeutic approach to autoimmune diseases.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) transcriptional signature is present in the blood of a large fraction of patients (Banchereau et al., 2017Banchereau R. Cepika A.M. Banchereau J. Pascual V. Understanding Human Autoimmunity and Autoinflammation Through Transcriptomics.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35: 337-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) highlighted the contribution to SLE susceptibility of genes encoding molecules involved in nucleic acid (NA) degradation and sensing, as well as type I IFN signaling pathways (Langefeld et al., 2017Langefeld C.D. Ainsworth H.C. Cunninghame Graham D.S. Kelly J.A. Comeau M.E. Marion M.C. Howard T.D. Ramos P.S. Croker J.A. Morris D.L. et al.Transancestral mapping and genetic load in systemic lupus erythematosus.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 16021Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to SLE pathogenesis. Thus, SLE neutrophils extrude oxidized mitochondrial DNA (ox mtDNA), a potent interferogenic stimulus (Caielli et al., 2016Caielli S. Athale S. Domic B. Murat E. Chandra M. Banchereau R. Baisch J. Phelps K. Clayton S.

Kaplan M.J. Neutrophil extracellular traps enriched in oxidized mitochondrial DNA are interferogenic and contribute to lupus-like disease.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Moreover, accumulation of succinate-driven mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a feature of a unique CD4+ T cell helper subpopulation expanded in children with SLE (Caielli et al., 2019Caielli S. Veiga D.T. Balasubramanian P. Athale S. Domic B. Murat E. Banchereau R. Xu Z. Chandra M. Chung C.H. et al.A CD4+ T cell population expanded in lupus blood provides B cell help through interleukin-10 and succinate.Nat. Med. 2019; 25: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction affects other cell lineages in SLE, we studied the life cycle of red blood cells (RBCs), because mitochondrial clearance is a feature of their maturation (An et al., 2015An X. Schulz V.P. Mohandas N. Gallagher P.G. Human and murine erythropoiesis.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2015; 22: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using both small molecule inhibitors and cells from patients with genetically defined defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) function (chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature syndrome [CANDLE]) (Brehm et al., 2015Brehm A. Liu Y. Sheikh A. Marrero B. Omoyinmi E. Zhou Q. Montealegre G. Biancotto A. Reinhardt A. Almeida de Jesus A. et al.Additive loss-of-function proteasome subunit mutations in CANDLE/PRAAS patients promote type I IFN production.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 4196-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated metabolic switch regulates the activation of the UPS, which is upstream of mitophagy, during human erythroid cell maturation. Furthermore, we show that a defect in this pathway prevents the activation of the UPS and subsequently blocks mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of interferogenic Mito+ RBCs, in SLE patients. Programmed mitochondrial removal takes place during normal development in both lens epithelial and the erythroid lineage (Zhang and Ney, 2010Zhang J. Ney P.A. Reticulocyte mitophagy: monitoring mitochondrial clearance in a mammalian model.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Erythroid cell differentiation evolves through morphologically distinct nucleated precursor stages prior to enucleation and final maturation of reticulocytes into RBCs, when mitochondria are completely removed. Surprisingly, using MitoTracker deep red (MTDR), we observed up to 37.2% of mature (CD235a+ CD71−) RBCs containing mitochondria (Mito+ RBCs) in a fraction (69.2%, n = 26) of SLE patients (Figure 1A). These cells were not present in either healthy donors (HD; n = 8) or patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM; n = 8) (Figure 1A). MitoTracker signal was abolished by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupling agent, supporting the specificity of the staining (Figure 1A). Accordingly, both immunohistochemistry for the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (COXIV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses confirmed the presence of mitochondria-like organelles in a fraction of mature SLE RBCs (Figures 1B and 1C). The percentage of circulating Mito+ RBCs did not correlate with either anemia, a condition that could drive immature erythroid precursors into the circulation (Kim and Nemeth, 2015Kim A. Nemeth E. New insights into iron regulation and erythropoiesis.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2015; 22: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), ethnicity, or treatment (Figure 1D; Table S1). Importantly, it correlated with disease activity as measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) (Gladman et al., 2002Gladman D.D. Ibañez D. Urowitz M.B. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000.J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29: 288-291PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 1E). Because this index is a composite score evaluating multiple parameters, we further assessed whether the presence of Mito+ RBCs correlated with a particular SLEDAI component. Thus, patients were classified into four groups according to the following components: no SLEDAI parameters (“none”), serological/hematological parameters only (H/S), connective tissue involvement and serological/hematological parameters (CT+H/S), or kidney involvement and serological/hematological parameters (K+H/S), reflecting increasing levels of disease severity (Banchereau et al., 2016Banchereau R. Hong S. Cantarel B. Baldwin N. Baisch J. Edens M. Cepika A.M. Acs P. Turner J. Anguiano E. et al.Personalized Immunomonitoring Uncovers Molecular Networks that Stratify Lupus Patients.Cell. 2016; 165: 551-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mito+ RBCs were especially enriched in the latter group, supporting their association with disease activity (Figure 1F). Adult erythropoiesis takes place in the bone marrow via three stages: early erythropoiesis, terminal erythroid differentiation, and reticulocyte maturation. Early erythropoiesis involves the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into proerythroblasts. Terminal erythroid differentiation consists of a stepwise transition from proerythroblasts to enucleated reticulocytes. Finally, reticulocytes mature into RBCs upon removing organelle remnants (An et al., 2015An X. Schulz V.P. Mohandas N. Gallagher P.G. Human and murine erythropoiesis.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2015; 22: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of mitochondrial removal during human terminal erythroid differentiation, we generated proerythroblasts starting from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (van den Akker et al., 2010van den Akker E. Satchwell T.J. Pellegrin S. Daniels G. Toye A.M. The majority of the in vitro erythroid expansion potential resides in CD34(-) cells, outweighing the contribution of CD34(+) cells and significantly increasing the erythroblast yield from peripheral blood samples.Haematologica. 2010; 95: 1594-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As previously described, at the end of the expansion phase (0 h), most cells in these cultures displayed a proerythroblast phenotype characterized by high CD36, CD71, and CD49d expression and low CD235a and CD233 expression (Figures 2A–2C). Proerythroblasts were then allowed to mature in the presence of high-dose erythropoietin, which induced progressive loss of CD71, CD36, and CD49d coupled with gradual increased expression of CD235a and CD233 (Figures 2B and 2C). As maturation progressed, cells accumulated RBC-specific membrane proteins (GYPA, EBP42, EBP41, SLC4A1, SLC2A1), enzymes (CA2, PRDXs, BLVRB, SOD1, CA1, BPGM), as well as different hemoglobins (HB) (Figures 2D and 2E). Furthermore, we observed an increase in expression of erythroid-associated transcription factors (GATA1 and KLF1) and a concomitant decrease in expression of HSPC-associated transcription factors (GATA2 and ETV6) (Figure 2F; Love et al., 2014Love P.E. Warzecha C. Li L. Ldb1 complexes: the new master regulators of erythroid gene transcription.Trends Genet. 2014; 30: 1-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Overall, our data support that this in vitro system accurately recapitulates the human erythroid maturation process. Mitophagy is involved in the removal of mitochondria during the final stage of murine reticulocyte maturation (Sandoval et al., 2008Sandoval H. Thiagarajan P. Dasgupta S.K. Schumacher A. Prchal J.T. Chen M. Wang J. Essential role for Nix in autophagic maturation of erythroid cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar; Schweers et al., 2007Schweers R.L. Zhang J. Randall M.S. Loyd M.R. Li W. Dorsey F.C. Kundu M. Opferman J.T. Cleveland J.L. Miller J.L. Ney P.A. NIX is required for programmed mitochondrial clearance during reticulocyte maturation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19500-19505Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, its role in human terminal erythroid differentiation has not been completely elucidated (Betin et al., 2013Betin V.M. Singleton B.K. Parsons S.F. Anstee D.J. Lane J.D. Autophagy facilitates organelle clearance during differentiation of human erythroblasts: evidence for a role for ATG4 paralogs during autophagosome maturation.Autophagy. 2013; 9: 881-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using immunoblotting analysis, we monitored the levels of mitochondrial proteins during the final stage of human proerythroblast maturation. We expected to observe the synchronized degradation of all mitochondrial proteins because the content of autophagosomes is non-selectively degraded via acidic lysosomal hydrolases during mitophagy (Pickles et al., 2018Pickles S. Vigié P. Youle R.J. Mitophagy and Quality Control Mechanisms in Mitochondrial Maintenance.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: R170-R185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our results showed that mitochondrial proteins fell into two major groups according to their degradation rate. Thus, although a group of proteins was rapidly removed during the differentiation process (rapidly removed mitochondrial proteins [RRMPs]), another group remained unaffected until later time points (slowly removed mitochondrial proteins [SRMPs]; Figure 3A). This suggests that mitophagy might not be the only mechanism that regulates mitochondrial degradation during human erythropoiesis. A growing body of evidence shows that selected mitochondrial proteins are rapidly degraded by the UPS before mitochondrial remnants are removed through mitophagy (Wei et al., 2017Wei Y. Chiang W.C. Sumpter Jr., R. Mishra P. Levine B. Prohibitin 2 Is an Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Mitophagy Receptor.Cell. 2017; 168: 224-238.e10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar; Yoshii et al., 2011Yoshii S.R.

Chem. 2011; 286: 19630-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Consistently, the degradation of RRMPs was sensitive to UPS inhibitors (MG132 or bortezomib) but not to autophagy inhibitors (Bafilomycin A1 or E-64d/Pepstatin) (Figures 3B and S1A). In contrast, autophagy blockade significantly reduced the elimination of SRMPs (Figures 3B and S1A). Indeed, although the RRMP COXIV never associated with lysosomes, the SRMP ATP5A co-localized with LAMP1+ compartments before being degraded (Figures 3C and S1B). In addition, RRMPs shared the degradation pattern with ribosomes, which have been shown to be exclusively removed by the UPS (Nguyen et al., 2017Nguyen A.T. Prado M.A. Schmidt P.J. Sendamarai A.K. Wilson-Grady J.T. Min M. Campagna D.R. Tian G. Shi Y. Dederer V. et al.UBE2O remodels the proteome during terminal erythroid differentiation.Science. 2017; 357: eaan0218Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; Figures 3A, 3B, and S1A). All together, these results suggest that RRMPs are degraded in a UPS-dependent autophagy-independent manner, while SRMPs are removed by mitophagy. In support of being activated upstream of mitophagy, the UPS activity reached maximum values during the earlier stages of proerythroblast differentiation, while autophagic flux increased only at later time points (Figures 3D, 3E, and S1C). Consistently, the appearance of swollen mitochondria, reminiscent of depolarized organelles degraded by the UPS (Yoshii et al., 2011Yoshii S.R. Kishi C. Ishihara N. Mizushima N.

Indeed, although UPS inhibition did not affect the number of autophagic vacuoles (Figure S2B), it significantly decreased the incorporation of mitochondria into autophagosomes (Figure S2C) and blocked the removal of SRMPs by autophagy (Figures 3B and S1A). These results indicate that proteasomal degradation of selected mitochondrial proteins is critical to trigger mitophagy in human proerythroblasts. Of note, mtDNA is removed by autophagy as its degradation (1) follows the kinetics of SRMPs and (2) is sensitive to both UPS and autophagy inhibitors (Figures S2D and S2E). To further confirm these results, we obtained blood samples from three patients with CANDLE syndrome carrying different additive loss-of-function mutations in UPS subunits (Brehm et al., 2015Brehm A. Liu Y. Sheikh A. Marrero B. Omoyinmi E. Zhou Q. Montealegre G. Biancotto A. Reinhardt A. Almeida de Jesus A. et al.Additive loss-of-function proteasome subunit mutations in CANDLE/PRAAS patients promote type I IFN production.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 4196-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar; Table S2). Similar to MG132-treated cells, proerythroblasts generated from CANDLE patients’ PBMCs displayed defective mitochondrial removal in the absence of a concomitant maturation delay and in correlation with in vitro reduced UPS activity (Figures 3F, S2F, and S2G). Interestingly, a significant fraction (55%) of Mito+ RBCs were detected in the blood of the patient whose proerythroblasts showed the lowest UPS activity in vitro (Figure 3G). Studies in rabbit reticulocytes highlighted that intramitochondrial proteins, including inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and matrix proteins, can be degraded by the cytosolic UPS through the effect of 15-lipoxygenase (encoded by ALOX15 gene). This enzyme permeabilizes mitochondrial membranes and permits the cytosolic proteolytic machinery to access the matrix compartment (Grüllich et al., 2001Grüllich C. Duvoisin R.M. Wiedmann M. van Leyen K. Inhibition of 15-lipoxygenase leads to delayed organelle degradation in the reticulocyte.FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar; van Leyen et al., 1998van Leyen K. Duvoisin R.M. Engelhardt H. Wiedmann M. A function for lipoxygenase in programmed organelle degradation.Nature. 1998; 395: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Accordingly, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated ALOX15 knockdown abrogated the degradation of both luminal RRMPs (COXIV) and SRMPs (HSP60) without affecting the removal of RRMPs facing the cytosol (TOMM40) (Figures 3H and S2H). Similar results were obtained with the ALOX15 inhibitor eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) (Figure S2I). These data support a role of ALOX15 in granting the cytosolic UPS access to luminal proteins, a necessary step to complete mitophagy. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as they differentiate (Ito and Suda, 2014Ito K. Suda T. Metabolic requirements for the maintenance of self-renewing stem cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of glucose and mitochondrial metabolism during proerythroblast differentiation. Hints that UPS activity might be regulated by cell metabolism have recently emerged (Jagoe et al., 2002Jagoe R.T. Lecker S.H. Gomes M. Goldberg A.L.

O-GlcNAc modification is an endogenous inhibitor of the proteasome.Cell. 2003; 115: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We then explored whether proerythroblasts, similar to PSCs, undergo a metabolic switch from glycolysis toward OXPHOS as they differentiate and if this process is required to increase UPS activity. Consistent with a preference for anaerobic respiration, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), both basal and after oligomycin treatment (glycolytic reserve [GR]), and lactate production were highest in proerythroblasts (0 h) and decreased upon differentiation (24 h) (Figures 4A and 4B ). Accordingly, ECAR in differentiating proerythroblasts responded minimally to glucose (Figure S3A). To assess mitochondrial respiration, we exposed the cells to oligomycin and FCCP; this reveals the maximal respiratory capacity (MRC). Differentiating proerythroblasts showed high MRC and spare respiratory capacity, measured as the difference between basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) after FCCP, as well as OCR/ECAR ratio, which are all indicative of increased commitment to OXPHOS (Figures 4C and 4D).Figure S3HIF-2α-mediated metabolic reprogramming is upstream of proteasome activation during human erythropoiesis, related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) ECAR response to glucose in human proerythroblasts before (0 h) and after (24 h) differentiation.

We show that this GABAergic projection exclusively synapses on to cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the ventral NAc shell, thereby serving a specialized function in modulating reinforced reward behavior through the inhibition of ventral NAc shell CINs. These findings highlight the diversity in the structural and functional topography of VTA GABAergic projections, and their neuromodulatory interactions across the dorsoventral gradient of the NAc shell.

Although numerous SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes have been identified, the molecular basis underpinning T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells remains unknown. The T cell response directed toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-derived S269-277 peptide presented by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A∗02:01 allomorph (hereafter the HLA-A2S269-277 epitope) is, to date, the most immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitope found in individuals bearing this allele. As HLA-A2S269-277-specific CD8+ T cells utilize biased TRAV12 gene usage within the TCR α-chain, we sought to understand the molecular basis underpinning this TRAV12 dominance. We expressed four TRAV12+ TCRs which bound the HLA-A2S269-277 complex with low micromolar affinity and determined the crystal structure of the HLA-A2S269-277 binary complex, and subsequently a ternary structure of the TRAV12+ TCR complexed to HLA-A2S269-277. We found that the TCR made extensive contacts along the entire length of the S269-277 peptide, suggesting that the TRAV12+ TCRs would be sensitive to sequence variation within this epitope. To examine this, we investigated cross-reactivity toward analogous peptides from existing SARS-CoV-2 variants and closely related coronaviruses. We show via surface plasmon resonance and tetramer studies that the TRAV12+ T cell repertoire cross-reacts poorly with these analogous epitopes. Overall, we defined the structural basis underpinning biased TCR recognition of CD8+ T cells directed at an immunodominant epitope and provide a framework for understanding TCR cross-reactivity toward viral variants within the S269-277 peptide."

Here, we found that NDRG1 enhanced the sensitivity of CTX in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. Afterwards, we determined the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. We demonstrated that NDRG1 inhibited the expression of EGFR; blocked EGFR phosphorylation and reduced the EGFR distribution in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. And then, NDRG1 suppressed the EGFR downstream signaling: RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3k/AKT/mTOR pathways. Moreover, we discovered that NDRG1 attenuated the endocytosis and degradation of EGFR induced by caveolin-1 (Cav1). Additionally, our findings were further observed in an animal model and human tissues.

Here we demonstrate that mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene lead to colonic epithelial cell resistance to CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity by induction of PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, this occurs as a result of the β-catenin/TCF4 complex binding to the PD-L1 promoter, leading to increased transcription.

Despite structural and functional similarity, the MIF homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (also called MIF-2) has low sequence identity (35%), prompting the question of whether this dynamic regulatory network is conserved. Here, we establish the structural basis of an allosteric site in MIF-2, showing with solution NMR that dynamic communication is preserved in MIF-2 despite differences in the primary sequence. X-ray crystallography and NMR detail the structural consequences of perturbing residues in this pathway, which include conformational changes surrounding the allosteric site, despite global preservation of the MIF-2 fold. Molecular simulations reveal MIF-2 to contain a comparable hydrogen bond network to that of MIF, which was previously hypothesized to influence catalytic activity by modulating the strength of allosteric coupling. Disruption of the allosteric relay by mutagenesis also attenuates MIF-2 enzymatic activity in vitro and the activation of the cluster of differentiation 74 receptor in vivo, highlighting a conserved point of control for nonoverlapping functions in the MIF superfamily."

https://openalex.org/W3192758171,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) trafficking is regulated by a number of complex mechanisms. Among them are the transmembrane protein Robo4 and the vascular cell adhesion molecule, VCAM1. Endothelial VCAM1 is a well-known regulator of hematopoietic cell trafficking, and our previous studies revealed that germline deletion of Robo4 led to impaired HSC trafficking, with an increase in vascular endothelial cell (VEC) numbers and downregulation of VCAM1 protein on sinusoidal VECs. Here, we utilized two Robo4 conditional deletion models in parallel with Robo4 germline knockout mice (R4 KO ) to evaluate the effects of acute and endothelial cell-specific Robo4 deletion on HSC trafficking. Strikingly similar to the R4 KO , the acute deletion of Robo4 resulted in altered HSC distribution between the bone marrow and blood compartments, despite normal numbers of VECs and wild-type levels of VCAM1 cell surface protein on sinusoidal VECs. Additionally, consistent with the R4 KO mice, acute loss of Robo4 in the host perturbed long-term engraftment of donor wild-type HSCs and improved HSC mobilization to the peripheral blood. These data demonstrate the significant role that endothelial Robo4 plays in directional HSC trafficking, independent of alterations in VEC numbers and VCAM1 expression."

The lower thermal threshold for the development was estimated at 10.0°C, with a thermal constant ( k ) of 333.3-degree days, while the maximum temperature threshold was estimated at 33.69°C. Fecundity was highest at 25°C, with 177.3 eggs per female. Temperature significantly affected the population growth parameters of D . longicaudata , and the maximum value of the intrinsic rate of increase ( r m ) was 0.145 at 27°C. Results indicate that D . longicaudata could successfully establish in tropical and sub-tropical regions under current and future climatic conditions. However, a slight change in the suitable areas is expected by the year 2050 due to a slight and gradual rise in temperature. Our findings provide important information for further release of this parasitoid in Africa as well as designing pest management strategies to limit the spread and reduce the impact of fruit flies sustainably."
https://openalex.org/W3190665029,"Background Social relationships are powerful determinants of health and inequalities in social relationships across socioeconomic status (SES) groups may contribute to social inequalities in health. This study investigates inequalities in social relationships in an international sample of persons with spinal cord injury and explores whether social gradients in relationships are moderated by the countries’ socioeconomic development (SED). Methods Data from 12,330 participants of the International SCI Community Survey (InSCI) performed in 22 countries were used. We regressed social relationships (belongingness, relationship satisfaction, social interactions) on individual SES (education, income, employment, financial hardship, subjective status) and countries’ SED (Human Development Index) using multi-level models (main effects). To test potential moderation of the SED, interaction terms between individual SES and countries’ SED were entered into multi-level models. Results Paid work, absence of financial hardship and higher subjective status were related to higher belongingness (OR, 95% CI: 1.50, 1.34–1.67; 1.76, 1.53–2.03; 1.16, 1.12–1.19, respectively), higher relationship satisfaction (OR, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.15–1.42; 1.97, 1.72–2.27; 1.20, 1.17–1.24, respectively) and fewer problems with social interactions (Coeff, 95% CI: 0.96, 0.82–1.10; 1.93, 1.74–2.12; 0.26, 0.22–0.29, respectively), whereas associations with education and income were less consistent. Main effects for countries’ SED showed that persons from lower SED countries reported somewhat higher relationship satisfaction (OR, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.94–0.99) and less problems with social interactions (Coeff, 95% CI: -0.04, -0.09- -0.003). Results from moderation analysis revealed that having paid work was more important for relationships in lower SED countries, while education and subjective status were more important for relationships in higher SED countries (interaction terms p &lt; 0 . 05 ). Conclusion Social relationships in persons with spinal cord injury are patterned according to individual SES and the countries’ SED and larger socioeconomic structures partly moderate associations between individual SES and social relationships."

https://openalex.org/W3190050653,"Along with the major impact on public health, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused unprecedented concerns ranging from sudden loss of employment to mental stress and anxiety. We implemented a survey-based data collection platform to characterize how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the socio-economic, physical and mental health conditions of individuals. We focused on three broad areas, namely, changes in social interaction during home confinement, economic impact and their health status. We identified a substantial increase in virtual interaction among individuals, which might be a way to alleviate the sudden unprecedented mental health burden, exacerbated by general awareness about viral infections or other manifestations associated with them. The majority of participants (85%) lived with one or more companions and unemployment issues did not affect 91% of the total survey takers, which was one of the crucial consequences of the pandemic. Nevertheless, measures such as an increased frequency of technology-aided distant social interaction, focus on physical fitness and leisure activities were adopted as coping mechanisms during this period of home isolation. Collectively, these metrics provide a succinct and informative summary of the socio-economic and health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the individuals. Findings from our study reflect that continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide. Given the limitations of analyzing the large number of variables, we have made the raw data publicly available on the OMF ME/CFS Data Center server to facilitate further analyses ( https://igenomed.stanford.edu/dataset/survey-study-on-lifestyle-changes-during-covid-19-pandemic )."
https://openalex.org/W3190979021,"The CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 and UDP-galactose transporter SLC35A2 are two well-characterized nucleotide sugar transporters with distinctive substrate specificities. Mutations in either induce congenital disorders of glycosylation. Despite the biomedical relevance, mechanisms of substrate specificity are unclear. To address this critical issue, we utilized a structure-guided mutagenesis strategy and assayed a series of SLC35A2 and SLC35A1 mutants using a rescue approach. Our results suggest that three pockets in the central cavity of each transporter provide substrate specificity. The pockets comprise (1) nucleobase (residues E52, K55, and Y214 of SLC35A1; E75, K78, N235, and G239 of SLC35A2); (2) middle (residues Q101, N102, and T260 of SLC35A1; Q125, N126, Q129, Y130, and Q278 of SLC35A2); and (3) sugar (residues K124, T128, S188, and K272 of SLC35A1; K148, T152, S213, and K297 of SLC35A2) pockets. Within these pockets, two components appear to be especially critical for substrate specificity. Y214 (for SLC35A1) and G239 (for SLC35A2) in the nucleobase pocket appear to discriminate cytosine from uracil. Furthermore, Q129 and Q278 of SLC35A2 in the middle pocket appear to interact specifically with the β-phosphate of UDP while the corresponding A105 and A253 residues in SLC35A1 do not interact with CMP, which lacks a β-phosphate. Overall, our findings contribute to a molecular understanding of substrate specificity and coordination in SLC35A1 and SLC35A2 and have important implications for the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with mutations or dysregulations of these two transporters."

https://openalex.org/W3188019514,"Recombinant antibodies with well-characterized epitopes and known conformational specificities are critical reagents to support robust interpretation and reproducibility of immunoassays across biomedical research. For myocilin, a protein prone to misfolding that is associated with glaucoma and an emerging player in other human diseases, currently available antibodies are unable to differentiate among the numerous disease-associated protein states. This fundamentally constrains efforts to understand the connection between myocilin structure, function, and disease. To address this concern, we used protein engineering methods to develop new recombinant antibodies that detect the N-terminal leucine zipper structural domain of myocilin and that are cross-reactive for human and mouse myocilin. After harvesting spleens from immunized mice and in vitro library panning, we identified two antibodies, 2A4 and 1G12. 2A4 specifically recognizes a folded epitope while 1G12 recognizes a range of conformations. We matured antibody 2A4 for improved biophysical properties, resulting in variant 2H2. In a human IgG1 format, 2A4, 1G12, and 2H2 immunoprecipitate full-length folded myocilin present in the spent media of human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, and 2H2 can visualize myocilin in fixed human TM cells using fluorescence microscopy. These new antibodies should find broad application in glaucoma and other research across multiple species platforms."
https://openalex.org/W3189536450,"I pride myself on coming from a place of “yes.” So it was uncharacteristic that, when my department head asked me to share my experiences of homophobia at a recent virtual diversity town hall for faculty, my first reaction was to decline. He did not know what had happened to me just the week before. I was out for a run when an SUV pulled up next to me. A young man rolled down his window, hung his head out, yelled “faggot”[*][1] at me, and laughed as the SUV drove away. I said nothing. I wish I had shouted, “This kind of bullying is the reason 20% of gay teens attempt suicide” in the hope that it might help him understand the implications of his actions. But in that moment, I wasn't Dr. Mustanski, leader of an LGBTQ health research institute. I was just the same Brian who had been called “fag” countless times—and had learned in such situations it was safer to keep quiet.



> “I put up walls because that feels safer than to risk looking vulnerable.” 

In my work, it's a different story. I have dedicated my career to research advancing the health and well-being of the LGBTQ community, including documenting the physical and mental health effects of bullying and victimization. I talk passionately about my research to policymakers and journalists, and in public forums. Still, I rarely discuss my own experiences. I've always thought, “Who wants to hear about me when I can share the voices of thousands of research participants?”

Our faculty meetings are typically dedicated to announcing new grants and departmental policies, not telling harrowing personal stories. So, I asked my department head, “Why would I ever share such experiences at a faculty meeting?” He offered that it might make me seem more approachable. The comment both stung and resonated. Like many minority individuals, I put up walls because that feels safer than to risk looking vulnerable, which can be a lure for harassment and abuse. Why would I take off this armor?

But in the end I decided to prepare an essay to read, hoping that opening up and showing my vulnerability could break us out of academia's typical dispassionate and intellectualized discussions about discrimination and diversity. I described how the slur was yelled at me. I told a story of a customs agent at the airport refusing to process me and my then-husband together; instead of demanding the agent accept our civil union or asking to speak to his boss, I remained silent, too afraid of what could happen if I complained and too exhausted from 8 hours on a plane and a lifetime of homophobia to protest. I shared how I was advised to hide being gay during graduate school interviews because being open could risk my chance of admission, being harassed at academic conferences, being told not to mention the words “gay” or “bisexual” in grant applications, and having interviewers on a faculty search committee literally walk out of the room when they heard about the LGBTQ focus of my work. Sharing these stories only took about 10 minutes, but it felt like a grueling hour.

When I finished, supportive and appreciative text messages, emails, and Zoom chats started to pour in, and continued for days. One particularly stuck with me: “Your essay was deeply moving, and I appreciate that you were willing to be vulnerable and give voice to what many can't say.”

In the months since that meeting, I have had mixed feelings. I believe it is unfair to ask marginalized people to take on the burden of educating others about the -isms that plague academia and beyond. Yet I saw the motivating power of sharing vulnerability with the right audience, and I have noticed other faculty and staff feeling newly empowered to share their personal experiences. Will such inspiration be enough to advance the hard work of making structural changes to increase equity and inclusion? I honestly don't know. But I do know that, although the young man who called me a “faggot” probably won't read this essay, the scientific community is in my—and our—sphere of influence. And by opening up, perhaps I can help spur change.
