https://openalex.org/W2009031556,"The efficiency with which a variety of ingested elements (Ag, Am, C, Cd, P, S, Se, and Zn) were assimilated in marine calanoid copepods fed uniformly radiolabeled diatoms ranged from 0.9% for Am to 97.1% for Se. Assimilation efficiencies were directly related to the cytoplasmic content of the diatoms. This relation indicates that the animals obtained nearly all their nutrition from this source. The results suggest that these zooplankton, which have short gut residence times, have developed a gut lining and digestive strategy that provides for assimilation of only soluble material. Because the fraction of total cellular protein in the cytoplasm of the diatoms increased markedly with culture age, copepods feeding on senescent cells should obtain more protein than those feeding on rapidly dividing cells. Elements that are appreciably incorporated into algal cytoplasm and assimilated in zooplankton should be recycled in surface waters and have longer oceanic residence times than elements bound to cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1967460214,"A high-pressure phase of TiO(2), which had been observed by shock-wave experiments and remained unresolved, has been studied by in situ x-ray diffraction. The single phase was formed at 20 gigapascals and 770 degrees C with the use of sintered-diamond multianvils; it has the same structure as baddeleyite, the stable phase of ZrO(2) at ambient conditions. The coordination number of Ti increases from six to seven across the rutile to baddeleyite transition, and the volume is reduced by approximately 9 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2004402855,"A modulated structure has been fabricated from high transition temperature superconductors where the individual CuO(2) planes are composed of alternating superconducting and insulating strips. This structure is made by growing a-axis-oriented YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7)/PrBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) superlattices by 90 degrees off-axis sputtering on (100)SrTiO(3) and (100)LaAlO(3) substrates. Superlattice modulation is observed to a modulation wavelength of 24 angstroms (12 angstroms-YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7)/12 angstroms-PrBa(2)Cu(3)O(7)), both by x-ray diffraction and by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy indicates a high degree of crystalline perfection with a channeling minimum yield of 3 percent. Quasi-one-dimensional conductivity should be obtainable in these structures."
