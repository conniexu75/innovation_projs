https://openalex.org/W2029284848,"IN a recent communication1, the preparation of apple seed extracts capable of stimulating the development of unfertilized tomato ovaries was described. Treatment of the seeds with water at 100Â° C. for 15 minutes gave, on cooling, a crystalline substance which preliminary tests indicated was possibly glycosidic in nature. While not possessing the fructigenic activity shown by the aqueous filtrate, this compound disappeared at the stage when the extracts were no longer active, and consequently further investigation was indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2441034108,"In 1943 it became known (1) that pantoyltaurylamide (SN 3279) showed antimalarial activity when administered intravenously to chicks infected
with Plasmodium gallinaceum. When subsequently phenyl pantothenone (I) (SN 12610), prepared by Woolley and Collyer (2), was tested and shown to possess activity when given orally, it was decided to examine compounds which might be regarded as sulfur analogues of I. Accordingly l-pantolactone was condensed with a series of amines to give the five derivatives of butyramide II to VI."
https://openalex.org/W1990156945,"THE y-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane ('Gammexane') is toxic to Paramecium caudatum when introduced into the cultures at a rate of 10 parts per million down to 1 per million. The action of the poison is slow and cumulative, the organisms continuing to feed until near death. Nuclear division is inhibited, and so they become hypertrophied, increasing in length and breadth up to 50 percent beyond normal. There is a threshold concentration of the drug somewhere between 1 and 0.5 parts per million where some normal division occurs, but a proportion of the hypertrophied cells divide as to the nuclei but not as to the body of the cell itself. Consequently, Siamese-twin forms are produced which feed and live a long time without making further progress, except that a small lateral outgrowth sometimes suggests that they might produce buds. Complete budding has not been observed in the Gammexane-treated medium."

https://openalex.org/W2089455805,"IN our earliest studies on the tryptophanase complex1 active non-viable suspensions of E. coli were used. These had been sterilized by shaking with chloroform, 1 volume to 2 volumes of suspension. The mixture was shaken vigorously to 200 r.p.m. for 4 hours."

https://openalex.org/W1991928402,"USING a powerful polonium source and an especially well-defined geometry, we have recently obtained 850 expansion-chamber photographs showing 90 proton tracks produced on the disintegration of nitrogen by ?-particle bombardment. Our arrangement, therefore, gave on the average one disintegration for every ten photographs, thus greatly reducing both the expense of the photographic materials used and the labour of the examination of the photographs."
