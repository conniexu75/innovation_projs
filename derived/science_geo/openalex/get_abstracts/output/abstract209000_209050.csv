https://openalex.org/W2096592126,Inhibition with either 5-fluorodeoxyuridine or deoxyadenosine for specified periods during the division cycle of the HeLa S3 cell shows that the mid-interphase peak in sensitivity occurs just before DNA replication begins. Sensitivity subsequently decreases only after synthesis of DNA is resumed. One interpretation of the relation between fluctuations in sensitivity and in DNA synthesis is that the lethal radiation damage to these cells occurs in DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2062863869,Chlorpromazine or imipramine disrupts a pigeon's performance on a discrimination between a vertical and horizontal line only if the discrimination was learned with errors. Errorless learning is obtained if training starts with an easy-to-learn discrimination of color and shifts progressively to the more difficult horizontal-vertical discrimination.

https://openalex.org/W2077924489,"Two substances, one promoting growth (promine) of ascites tumors in mice and the other inhibiting it (retine) have both been found in several tissues, namely, thymus, aorta, muscle, and tendon. In spite of similar solubilities in the solvents used for their extraction, the substances could be roughly separated. The value of the ratio between these substances in the same tissue may be significant."

Peptides, which appear to have been derived from the binding region of the rabbitantibody molecule directed against pazobenzenearsonate, have been isolated. The particular polypeptide chain from which these peptides are derived has now been identified as the B chain described by Fleischman, Pain, and Porter."

https://openalex.org/W2127829687,The relative volumes of major body fluids of freshwater and marine sharks are remarkably similar in spite of the differences in external medium and in osmotic pressure of body fluids. The small differences detected are in agreement with differences reported in comparisons of freshwater and marine teleosts: a slightly higher total water content and a smiller ratio of extracellular to intracellular fluids in freshwater forms.
https://openalex.org/W2085632640,"A sleep phase similar to feline ""activated"" sleep was found to occur regularly in normally sleeping rats. However, at these, times the electroencephalogram differed from the waking or ""activated"" pattern in being dominated by 6-to 8-per-second waves. Instead of assuming a very relaxed posture, as cats in ""activated"" sleep do, the rats tended to undergo shifts in muscle tone, occasionally of considerable magnitude."

https://openalex.org/W2085222380,The principal effect of x-irradiated Schistosoma mansoni cercariae may be to slow the migration and development of the worms of a challenge infection. This would account for the smaller number of worms found in the portal system in the early weeks and the delayed accumulation of recoverable worms and eggs.

https://openalex.org/W2083339094,"THE effect of adrenalectomy on the metabolism of histamine in the rat has been investigated by several workers, but with conflicting results. Though it has been established that after adrenalectomy the histamine contents of some rat tissues are raised1–4, there is considerable discrepancy regarding how the rise is brought about and the conditions under which it occurs. For example, increased levels of tissue histamine in adrenalectomized rats have been attributed by different workers to: (1) increased uptake of histamine from the gut2; (2) increased rate of tissue histamine formation5; (3) increased ability of tissues to bind histamine4; (4) decreased activity of histaminase1. Some workers have reported that the increases in histamine-levels after adrenalectomy are greater if the animals are given water to drink than if they are given saline1, while others have found that in animals given saline increases in the tissue levels of this amine do not occur3."

Results of the procedures used indicate that although imprinting occurred with forced following, it was not as strong as it is when the following is voluntary."
