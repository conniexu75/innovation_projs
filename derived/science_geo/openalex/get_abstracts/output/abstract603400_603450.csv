https://openalex.org/W2782974471,"The genus Oryza is a model system for the study of molecular evolution over time scales ranging from a few thousand to 15 million years. Using 13 reference genomes spanning the Oryza species tree, we show that despite few large-scale chromosomal rearrangements rapid species diversification is mirrored by lineage-specific emergence and turnover of many novel elements, including transposons, and potential new coding and noncoding genes. Our study resolves controversial areas of the Oryza phylogeny, showing a complex history of introgression among different chromosomes in the young ‘AA’ subclade containing the two domesticated species. This study highlights the prevalence of functionally coupled disease resistance genes and identifies many new haplotypes of potential use for future crop protection. Finally, this study marks a milestone in modern rice research with the release of a complete long-read assembly of IR 8 ‘Miracle Rice’, which relieved famine and drove the Green Revolution in Asia 50 years ago. Genome assemblies of 13 domesticated and wild rice relatives reveal salient features of genome evolution across the genus Oryza, especially rapid species diversification and turnover of transposons. This study also releases a complete long-read assembly of IR 8 ‘Miracle Rice’."

We explored how the microbiota was sensed by the immune system and the defining properties of such responses. Here, we show that a skin commensal can induce T cell responses in a manner that is restricted to non-classical MHC class I molecules. These responses are uncoupled from inflammation and highly distinct from pathogen-induced cells. Commensal-specific T cells express a defined gene signature that is characterized by expression of effector genes together with immunoregulatory and tissue-repair signatures. As such, non-classical MHCI-restricted commensal-specific immune responses not only promoted protection to pathogens, but also accelerated skin wound closure. Thus, the microbiota can induce a highly physiological and pleiotropic form of adaptive immunity that couples antimicrobial function with tissue repair. Our work also reveals that non-classical MHC class I molecules, an evolutionarily ancient arm of the immune system, can promote homeostatic immunity to the microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2783742719,"As in eukaryotes, bacterial genomes are not randomly folded. Bacterial genetic information is generally carried on a circular chromosome with a single origin of replication from which two replication forks proceed bidirectionally toward the opposite terminus region. Here, we investigate the higher-order architecture of the Escherichia coli genome, showing its partition into two structurally distinct entities by a complex and intertwined network of contacts: the replication terminus (ter) region and the rest of the chromosome. Outside of ter, the condensin MukBEF and the ubiquitous nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) HU promote DNA contacts in the megabase range. Within ter, the MatP protein prevents MukBEF activity, and contacts are restricted to ∼280 kb, creating a domain with distinct structural properties. We also show how other NAPs contribute to nucleoid organization, such as H-NS, which restricts short-range interactions. Combined, these results reveal the contributions of major evolutionarily conserved proteins in a bacterial chromosome organization."
https://openalex.org/W2783758534,"To characterize the genetic determinants of resistance to antituberculosis drugs, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 6,465 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from more than 30 countries. A GWAS approach within a mixed-regression framework was followed by a phylogenetics-based test for independent mutations. In addition to mutations in established and recently described resistance-associated genes, novel mutations were discovered for resistance to cycloserine, ethionamide and para-aminosalicylic acid. The capacity to detect mutations associated with resistance to ethionamide, pyrazinamide, capreomycin, cycloserine and para-aminosalicylic acid was enhanced by inclusion of insertions and deletions. Odds ratios for mutations within candidate genes were found to reflect levels of resistance. New epistatic relationships between candidate drug-resistance-associated genes were identified. Findings also suggest the involvement of efflux pumps (drrA and Rv2688c) in the emergence of resistance. This study will inform the design of new diagnostic tests and expedite the investigation of resistance and compensatory epistatic mechanisms. A GWAS of multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis using 6,465 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from more than 30 countries identifies novel mutations associated with resistance. The capacity to detect resistance in particular to ethionamide, pyrazinamide, capreomycin, cycloserine and paraaminosalicylic acid was enhanced by inclusion of insertions and deletions."
https://openalex.org/W2785695887,"Abstract The sea lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus ) serves as a comparative model for reconstructing vertebrate evolution. To enable more informed analyses, we developed a new assembly of the lamprey germline genome that integrates several complementary data sets. Analysis of this highly contiguous (chromosome-scale) assembly shows that both chromosomal and whole-genome duplications have played significant roles in the evolution of ancestral vertebrate and lamprey genomes, including chromosomes that carry the six lamprey HOX clusters. The assembly also contains several hundred genes that are reproducibly eliminated from somatic cells during early development in lamprey. Comparative analyses show that gnathostome (mouse) homologs of these genes are frequently marked by polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) in embryonic stem cells, suggesting overlaps in the regulatory logic of somatic DNA elimination and bivalent states that are regulated by early embryonic PRCs. This new assembly will enhance diverse studies that are informed by lampreys’ unique biology and evolutionary/comparative perspective."

https://openalex.org/W2793120378,"Cortical sensory maps are remodeled during early life to adapt to the surrounding environment. Both sensory and contextual signals are important for induction of this plasticity, but how these signals converge to sculpt developing thalamocortical circuits remains largely unknown. Here we show that layer 1 (L1) of primary auditory cortex (A1) is a key hub where neuromodulatory and topographically organized thalamic inputs meet to tune the cortical layers below. Inhibitory interneurons in L1 send narrowly descending projections to differentially modulate thalamic drive to pyramidal and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) cells in L4, creating brief windows of intracolumnar activation. Silencing of L1 (but not VIP-expressing) cells abolishes map plasticity during the tonotopic critical period. Developmental transitions in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) sensitivity in these cells caused by Lynx1 protein can be overridden to extend critical-period closure. Notably, thalamocortical maps in L1 are themselves stable, and serve as a scaffold for cortical plasticity throughout life. The authors show that inhibitory interneurons in cortical layer 1 integrate topographically organized thalamic and neuromodulatory inputs to sculpt sound frequency maps in primary auditory cortex during a developmental critical period."
https://openalex.org/W2785791409,"Transcription factors (TFs) direct developmental transitions by binding to target DNA sequences, influencing gene expression and establishing complex gene-regultory networks. To systematically determine the molecular components that enable or constrain TF activity, we investigated the genomic occupancy of FOXA2, GATA4 and OCT4 in several cell types. Despite their classification as pioneer factors, all three TFs exhibit cell-type-specific binding, even when supraphysiologically and ectopically expressed. However, FOXA2 and GATA4 can be distinguished by low enrichment at loci that are highly occupied by these factors in alternative cell types. We find that expression of additional cofactors increases enrichment at a subset of these sites. Finally, FOXA2 occupancy and changes to DNA accessibility can occur in G1-arrested cells, but subsequent loss of DNA methylation requires DNA replication. Investigation of FOXA2, GATA4 and OCT4 binding across several cell types provides insights into the genetic determinants and epigenetic effects of pioneer-factor occupancy. The data suggest that FOXA2 samples most of its potential binding sites but is stabilized at only a subset of targets."

https://openalex.org/W2782818730,"Non-coding regions containing hundreds of consecutive bases of perfect sequence conservation across mammalian genomes can function as distant-acting enhancers. However, initial deletion studies in mice revealed that loss of such extraordinarily constrained sequences had no immediate impact on viability. Here, we show that ultraconserved enhancers are required for normal development. Focusing on some of the longest ultraconserved sites genome wide, located near the essential neuronal transcription factor Arx, we used genome editing to create an expanded series of knockout mice lacking individual or combinations of ultraconserved enhancers. Mice with single or pairwise deletions of ultraconserved enhancers were viable and fertile but in nearly all cases showed neurological or growth abnormalities, including substantial alterations of neuron populations and structural brain defects. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of ultraconserved enhancers and indicate that remarkably strong sequence conservation likely results from fitness deficits that appear subtle in a laboratory setting."

Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine. A better understanding of how endogenous chromatin remodeling leads to pluripotency induction is of significant interest. Conventionally, differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by ectopic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18864) Google Scholar). Overexpressed Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 initially bind to and globally remodel endogenous loci across the genome (Soufi et al., 2012Soufi A. Donahue G. Zaret K.S. Facilitators and impediments of the pluripotency reprogramming factors’ initial engagement with the genome.Cell. 2012; 151: 994-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), ultimately leading to establishment of pluripotent regulatory circuitry. However, it is largely unknown what precise remodeling events on endogenous chromatin trigger reprogramming toward pluripotency. First of all, whether simultaneous remodeling of a large number of pluripotency-related loci is necessary or precise remodeling of a single locus is sufficient for iPSC induction is not clear. Besides, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 target the distal elements of many genes required for reprogramming (Soufi et al., 2012Soufi A. Donahue G. Zaret K.S. Facilitators and impediments of the pluripotency reprogramming factors’ initial engagement with the genome.Cell. 2012; 151: 994-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), but how the remodeling of these distal elements would affect pluripotency induction is poorly understood. Furthermore, epigenetic remodeling is the central mechanism of cellular reprogramming (Smith et al., 2016Smith Z.D. Sindhu C. Meissner A. Molecular features of cellular reprogramming and development.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but it has not been determined whether iPSC induction can be initiated by epigenetic manipulation of any defined endogenous loci. Single-cell analysis and computational modeling suggested that activation of endogenous Sox2 gene marked a deterministic event to pluripotency, likely triggering reprogramming toward iPSCs (Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y. Faddah D.A. Cheng A.W. Itskovich E. Markoulaki S. Ganz K. Klemm S.L. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Single-cell expression analyses during cellular reprogramming reveal an early stochastic and a late hierarchic phase.Cell. 2012; 150: 1209-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, due to the methodological limitations, there is no direct evidence of whether pluripotency can be induced by precise remodeling of Sox2 locus. Recently, the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat and Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system from bacteria was repurposed as a powerful tool for genome editing in mammalian cells (Cong et al., 2013Cong L.

A deactivated form of Cas9, dead Cas9 (dCas9), has been engineered as programmable synthetic transcription factors when fused with transactivation domains, which is termed the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system (Chavez et al., 2015Chavez A.

This system reportedly can function as a pioneer factor to target the silenced chromatin locus with high precision and promote downstream gene transcription (Polstein et al., 2015Polstein L.R.

Moreover, Hilton and colleagues showed that dCas9-p300core fusion protein can be used to manipulate the histone acetylation of targeted genomic sites (Hilton et al., 2015Hilton I.B. D’Ippolito A.M.

Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). With these features, the CRISPRa system provides an advantageous tool to precisely remodel endogenous chromatin loci for cellular reprogramming (Black et al., 2016Black J.B. Adler A.F. Wang H.G.

In this study, using CRISPR activation, the SunTag system, we demonstrated that precise remodeling of endogenous Oct4 or Sox2 gene locus was sufficient to induce pluripotency. To determine whether and how remodeling of endogenous loci initiate reprogramming toward pluripotency, we used the SunTag system to precisely remodel endogenous pluripotency gene loci in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). dCas9-SunTag-VP64 was chosen for its enhanced chromatin-remodeling activity by recruiting multiple VP64 to one targeting site (Figure 1A) (Tanenbaum et al., 2014Tanenbaum M.E. Gilbert L.A. Qi L.S. Weissman J.S. Vale R.D. A protein-tagging system for signal amplification in gene expression and fluorescence imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). dCas9 expression was controlled by a Tet-On promoter. Oct4 and Sox2 loci were selected as targets because of their central roles in pluripotency induction and maintenance. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target the Oct4 and Sox2 promoters, as well as the Oct4 enhancer. Besides the activation effect of sgRNAs, multiple factors were considered, regarding the genomic sequences targeted, including their proximity to but no overlapping with the binding sites of pluripotent factor and transcription machinery, histone H3K27 acetylation in pluripotent stem cells, and their potential to form promoter-enhancer loops mediated by Mediator complex (Figures S1A–S1C). We first examined transcriptional activation of target genes with each designed Oct4 and Sox2 sgRNA delivered by lentivirus in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Figure S1D). Mouse ESCs were first transduced with dCas9-SunTag-VP64 system and sgRNAs. Because Oct4 and Sox2 are highly expressed in ESCs, we induced ESC differentiation with 1 μM retinoic acid (RA). Meanwhile, the dCas9-SunTag-VP64 system was induced with doxycycline. Analysis of Oct4 expression showed that sgRNAs targeting a narrow promoter region close to the transcription start site (TSS), and a 200-bp region of distal enhancer can enhance the transcription (Figure S1E). As for the Sox2 promoter, sgRNA activity showed a remarkable tendency for higher gene activation with sgRNAs closer to the TSS (Figure S1E). Selected sgRNAs and the dCas9-SunTag-VP64 were also transduced into MEFs (Figure S1F). sgRNAs O-127 and O-71 targeting 127- and 71-bp upstream of Oct4 TSS were combined to target the promoter. Similarly, O-1965, O-2066, and O-2135 were combined to target the Oct4 enhancer; and separately, S-84, S-136, and S-148 were combined for Sox2 promoter targeting. After 4 days of dCas9 induction by doxycycline, targeting the Oct4 promoter led to about a 100-fold increase in Oct4 transcription, and targeting the enhancer resulted in modest activation (Figure S1G). For Sox2 promoter, about 15-fold activation was detected (Figure S1G). This suggests that, guided by specific sgRNAs, dCas9-SunTag-VP64 can activate the silenced Oct4 and Sox2 in MEFs. We next sought to determine whether pluripotency network can be fully reactivated and established in MEFs. We optimized the SunTag reprogramming system in two ways. First, more gene promoters were targeted by adding the corresponding sgRNAs. Klf4, c-Myc (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

C/EBPα poises B cells for rapid reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2014; 506: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were selected. For each promoter, 4–10 sgRNAs were designed and tested in differentiating ESCs (Figure S1E). 1–3 sgRNAs for each promoter were included in the previous Oct4/Sox2 sgRNA pool (Table S1). Second, a small-molecule cocktail, consisting of Parnate, Chir99021, A83-01, and Forskolin (PCAF), was added into our reprogramming medium. This chemical cocktail further increased Oct4 and Sox2 transcription by 3–4 times on day 4 (Figure S1H). To monitor the reactivation of pluripotency network, we used OG2 MEF cells that harbor a stable Oct4-EGFP reporter and exhibit intense EGFP signal when endogenous Oct4 is actively transcribed (Szabó et al., 2002Szabó P.E. Hübner K. Schöler H. Mann J.R. Allele-specific expression of imprinted genes in mouse migratory primordial germ cells.Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). After transduction of dCas9-SunTag-VP64 and the sgRNA pool (18 sgRNAs in total, Table S1), the MEF medium was changed to reprogramming medium with doxycycline. This was denoted as day 0 (Figure 1B). Since day 4, transcription of Oct4 and Sox2 became more and more robust (Figure 1D). By day 7, reprogramming clusters appeared, and after 2 weeks, EGFP-positive colonies were visible (Figure 1C). Those colonies were also positive for Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA-1 (Figure 1F). Then, EGFP-positive colonies were expanded on feeder cells to generate CRISPR iPSC lines. Those CRISPR iPSCs formed typical mouse ES-like domed colonies with a strong EGFP signal (Figure 1E). A panel of pluripotency genes, including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb, Nr5a2, and Utf1, was highly expressed (Figure 1G). These cells can be passaged for more than 20 passages without any sign of losing the EGFP signal or ES morphology (Figure 1E). These data demonstrate that pluripotency has been established in these CRISPR iPSCs. To identify the essential loci required for CRISPR iPSC generation, we removed sgRNAs targeting each individual locus one by one from the pool. In this 18-sgRNA pool, removal of sgRNAs targeting the Oct4, Sox2, or Glis1 promoter or the Oct4 enhancer led to a sharp decrease in the number of EGFP-positive colonies (Figure S2A), indicating potential roles for these loci in pluripotency induction. Next, we determined whether targeting of Oct4, Sox2, and Glis1 promoters together was sufficient to generate iPSCs. Since single sgRNAs could achieve gene activation at the level of 60% to even 180% of their corresponding two- or three-sgRNA combinations (Figure S2B), we selected one sgRNA to target each promoter, O-127 for Oct4, S-84 for Sox2, and G-215 for Glis1. This simplified our system and potentially decreased off-target effect. The combination of OSG (O-127, S-84, and G-215) could activate the three genes properly (Figure S2C). After 2 weeks, EGFP-positive colonies were observed, and iPSC lines could be established (Figures S2D and S2E). During OSG reprogramming, we surprisingly noticed that EGFP-positive colonies appeared when S-84 alone was used (Figure S2F), suggesting that targeting Sox2 promoter alone may be sufficient for pluripotency induction. To rule out the possibility of an off-target effect from S-84, we examined the top 10 predicted targets of S-84, and only the Sox2 gene was significantly activated (Figure S2G). Sox2 protein was also detected on day 4 (Figure 2B). Besides, we repeated the reprogramming tests with another two Sox2 sgRNAs, S-136 and S-148 (Figure 2A). These two sgRNAs individually activated endogenous Sox2 transcription (Figure 2C), and EGFP-positive colonies were obtained (Figure 2D). Then, we examined whether the iPSCs were authentic pluripotent. Within these EGFP-positive colonies, Nanog and SSEA-1 protein was also detected, and CRISPR iPSC lines were established (Figures 2E and 2F). For line S-17, expression of key pluripotent factors was similar to that in R1 cells (Figure 2G). These cells were also karyotypically normal (Figure 2H). A more stringent assay for pluripotency was performed. S-17 cells were injected into the blastocysts of B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J (B6-albino) background, and EGFP-positive cells were found in the gonadal regions of 71.4% (5 out of 7) E13.5 embryos (Figure 2I). Live-born chimeras were generated (Figure 2J), and the rate was 46.2% (6 out of 13). More importantly, the S-17 cells were also germline competent (Figure 2K). With these data, we concluded that single-locus targeting of the Sox2 promoter by one sgRNA was sufficient to reprogram MEFs into authentic pluripotent stem cells. With the lentiviral transduction, the reprogramming efficiency was relatively low and variable in both OG2 and 129 background MEFs (0%–0.013%) (Figures 2C, S2A, S2F, and S3A–C). This may be from inefficient delivery of SunTag components and random copy numbers of the components delivered in single cells. This was reflected by the varied copy numbers of sgRNA cassette in the genomes of established iPSC lines, and one to five copies were found per cell among 12 lines (Figure S3D). To decrease the variability and enhance the efficiency, we decided to generate secondary MEFs using a CRISPR iPSC line that was derived from single colony. S-17 iPSCs were labeled with blue fluorescence protein (BFP) and injected into B6 blastocysts, and secondary MEFs were derived from the E13.5 embryos (Figure 3A). About half of the MEFs (52.4%) were originated from the S-17 iPSCs revealed by flow cytometry (Figure S3E), and these secondary MEF cells were termed S-17 MEFs. With doxycycline, endogenous Sox2 was readily detected by both qPCR and immune-fluorescent staining, but no Sox2 was detected without doxycycline (Figures 3B and 3D). No off-target genes were dramatically elevated (Figure S3G). These data demonstrate that the SunTag system functioned properly to activate Sox2 in S-17 MEFs. Then the S-17 MEFs were examined if they were reprogrammable. Sox2 transcription was significantly upregulated on day 4 and increased quickly to R1 mouse ES level by day 8 (Figure 3B). Following Sox2 upregulation, other core pluripotent factors, Oct4, Nanog, and Rex1, were also activated. Their transcription was detected on day 8 and elevated dramatically after that (Figure 3G). Meanwhile, morphological changes were observed from day 4, and EGFP-positive colonies were visible on day 7 (Figure 3E). iPSC lines could also be established (Figure 3E). With S-17 MEFs, the reprogramming efficiency (0.1%) increased by 40-fold over the lentivirus method (Figure 3F). As expected, much less variability was observed (Figure S3H). We also tested whether more differentiated tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs) were reprogrammable. We derived S-17 TTFs from the 14-month-old chimeric mouse. In presence of doxycycline, TTFs underwent morphological changes, and EGFP-positive colonies were obtained in 2 weeks (Figure S3L). These observations show that S-17 MEFs and TTFs were reprogrammable. Without doxycycline, we could not see the activation of Sox2, and no colonies were obtained (Figures 3B and 3J). When the PCAF cocktail was removed, EGFP-positive colonies were still generated (Figure S3I), although with lower efficiency. Based on this, we concluded that endogenous Sox2 activation was the trigger for S-17 MEF reprogramming. Then, we examined whether the reprogramming was dose dependent on Sox2 level. Sox2 was activated with a series of doxycycline concentrations (e.g., 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/mL). We noticed that Sox2 level showed a positive correlation with the dox concentrations, and the reprogramming efficiency was clearly dependent on Sox2 level (Figure 3J). VP64 promotes gene transcription and chromatin remodeling by recruiting multiple epigenetic modifiers (Hirai et al., 2010Hirai H. Tani T. Kikyo N. Structure and functions of powerful transactivators: VP16, MyoD and FoxA.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2010; 54: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), so we tested how the SunTag system epigenetically remodeled the Sox2 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed with H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) antibody against the Sox2 promoter. As early as day 4, the H3K27ac level was already elevated 2-fold, and it further increased on days 8 and 12 (Figure 3C). This indicates that the SunTag targeting caused gradual and constant epigenetic remodeling at the Sox2 promoter. We also checked the promoters of Oct4, Nanog, and Rex1, and their H3K27ac levels increased significantly with a 4-day latency, similar to the gene transcription (Figures 3G and 3H). Interestingly, the enhancers of Oct4 showed simultaneous elevation of H3K27ac level (Figure 3I). These data suggest that activation of Sox2 facilitated following induction of other key genes for pluripotency establishment. We then tested whether additional targeting of the Oct4 promoter in S-17 MEFs would promote the reprogramming efficiency. Transduction of O-127 led to a significant increase of Oct4 transcription, and the reprogramming efficiency was enhanced too (Figure 3K). This synergistic effect supported the idea that Oct4 and Sox2 cooperated in pluripotency induction. We also compared the S-17 MEF reprogramming to traditional reprogramming using overexpressed factors. Unlike S-17 MEFs, the overexpressed factors failed to epigenetically remodel the Sox2 promoter on day 4 (Figure S3J), and no Sox2 transcription from the endogenous loci was effectively detected on days 4 and 12 (Figure 3L). After 3 weeks, overexpressed Oct4 or Sox2 failed to generate any colonies, and overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK) generated EGFP-positive colonies slightly more than S-17 MEFs with more variation between experiments (Figures 3M and S3K). Previously, we noted that remodeling of both the Oct4 promoter and enhancer is important for pluripotency induction and that targeting the promoter alone is not sufficient for the generation of EGFP-positive colonies (Figures S2A and 2C). Given the fact that key pluripotency factors as well as p300 and the Mediator complex are enriched at the Oct4 distal enhancer in mouse ESCs (Figure 4A), we hypothesize that simultaneous remodeling of the Oct4 promoter and enhancer is required for pluripotency induction. To test that, we used a dual-sgRNA cassette that transcribed two sgRNAs targeting different sites (Figure S4A). The O-127-2066 cassette targets the Oct4 promoter (O-127) and enhancer (O-2066) at a single-cell level. This led to simultaneous remodeling of promoter and enhancer with elevated levels of H3K27ac (Figure 4B). The gene transcription with O-127-2066 was similar to O-127 at days 4 and 8 (Figure 4C). However, after day 8, Oct4 transcription was further elevated in O-127-2066 culture. Particularly, when we replated the cells on days 7 and 11 to allow cell expansion, the overall Oct4 expression in the population dramatically increased (Figure 4C). For O-127 and O-2066 cultures, weak Oct4 expression largely stayed unchanged after day 8 (Figure 4C). Accordingly, by day 12, EGFP-positive colonies were observed in the O-127-2066 culture, and those colonies also expressed Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA-1, indicating the acquired core pluripotency network (Figures 4E and 4F). iPSC lines could be derived from these colonies (Figure 4E). Meanwhile, no colonies were found in the O-127 or O-2066 culture (Figure 4D). The activation of potential off-targets was checked. The top 10 predicted targets for sgRNAs O-127 and O-2066 were examined, and no dramatically activation for off-target genes was seen (Figure S4C). We also tested another two dual sgRNA cassettes O-127-1965 and O-127-2135 in parallel, and similar results were observed (Figure 4D). These data strongly supported that pluripotency was induced by simultaneous remodeling of endogenous Oct4 promoter and enhancer. An authentic pluripotent stem cell line was also achieved. The D-9 line showed similar expression of pluripotency genes to R1 cells and a normal karyotype (Figures 4G and 4H). After injection of D-9 cells into B6-albino blastocysts, live-born chimeric mice were generated at the rate of 60% of the offspring pups (6 out 10) (Figure 4J). This line significantly contributed to the gonadal regions of 75% E13.5 embryos (6 out of 8) (Figure 4I), and germline transmission was confirmed in 50% of male pups (2 out of 4) (Figure 4K). The chromatin remodeling by VP64 is caused by its primary function in recruiting the transcription machinery. To more strictly determine whether epigenetic remodeling is sufficient to initiate reprogramming, we sought to increase the histone acetylation of the Oct4 promoter and enhancer by specific manipulations. Histone acetylation was manipulated because histone H3K27 acetylation synchronously marks the Oct4 promoter and enhancer regions (Figure 4A). p300core only has the acetyltransferase activity domain of p300 and was proved to enhance the targets’ histone acetylation (Hilton et al., 2015Hilton I.B. D’Ippolito A.M. Vockley C.M. Thakore P.I. Crawford G.E. Reddy T.E. Gersbach C.A. Epigenome editing by a CRISPR-Cas9-based acetyltransferase activates genes from promoters and enhancers.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). So we replaced VP64 and generated a dCas9-SunTag-p300core system (Figure S4E). Reprogramming experiments were performed with this dCas9-SunTag-p300core system. We found that p300core culture exhibited similar H3K27ac level to the VP64 counterpart at Oct4 promoter and enhancer, but only 1/30 of the Oct4 transcription was detected in p300core culture at day 5 (Figures S4F and S4G). This can be explained by p300core’s inability to recruit transcription machinery. Cultures were then passaged on days 9 and 14. Interestingly, by day 10, Oct4 levels were comparable in the VP64 and p300core conditions (Figure S4G). Accordingly, EGFP-positive colonies were produced in the p300core cultures, and iPSC lines were generated (Figures S4H and S4I). These observations indicate that the manipulation of histone acetylation with p300core led to chromatin remodeling similar to VP64, although with a noticeable latency in transcriptional activation. Together, our results show that the epigenetic remodeling of Oct4 promoter and enhancer, either through VP64 or p300core, is sufficient to trigger reprogramming toward pluripotency. In this study, we reported that iPSCs were generated with CRISPRa system by targeting single genes, Oct4 or Sox2. The activation of endogenous pluripotent genes had been examined previously with CRISPRa systems, but no iPSCs were established. Several groups succeeded in activating endogenous OCT4 and SOX2 in human 293T cells by targeting the promoter, and murine cells were also tested in some cases (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng A.W. Wang H.

SMC rings make vital contributions to numerous chromosomal functions, including mitotic chromosome condensation, sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. They are thought to do so by establishing interactions between more than one DNA. Here, we demonstrate DNA-DNA tethering by the purified fission yeast cohesin complex. DNA-bound cohesin efficiently and topologically captures a second DNA, but only if that is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Like initial double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) embrace, second ssDNA capture is ATP-dependent, and it strictly requires the cohesin loader complex. Second-ssDNA capture is relatively labile but is converted into stable dsDNA-dsDNA cohesion through DNA synthesis. Our study illustrates second-DNA capture by an SMC complex and provides a molecular model for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion."

Despite substantial progress in our understanding of auxin biology, delineating specific auxin response remains a major challenge. Auxin regulates transcriptional response via its receptors, TIR1 and AFB F-box proteins. Here we report an engineered, orthogonal auxin-TIR1 receptor pair, developed through a bump-and-hole strategy, that triggers auxin signaling without interfering with endogenous auxin or TIR1/AFBs. A synthetic, convex IAA (cvxIAA) hijacked the downstream auxin signaling in vivo both at the transcriptomic level and in specific developmental contexts, only in the presence of a complementary, concave TIR1 (ccvTIR1) receptor. Harnessing the cvxIAA-ccvTIR1 system, we provide conclusive evidence for the role of the TIR1-mediated pathway in auxin-induced seedling acid growth. The cvxIAA-ccvTIR1 system serves as a powerful tool for solving outstanding questions in auxin biology and for precise manipulation of auxin-mediated processes as a controllable switch."

It has also been documented that AR is expressed in more than 60% of breast tumors, which promotes the growth of estrogen receptor-negative (ER-)/AR-positive (AR+) breast cancer cells. Thus, AR might be a potential therapeutic target for AR-positive/ER-negative breast cancer patients. Previously we reported that in prostate cancer cells proteasome-associated deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) stabilized AR protein level by removing its ubiquitin chain. In the current study, we studied the USP14-AR protein interaction and cell proliferation status after USP14 reduction or inhibition in breast cancer cells, and our results support the conclusion that targeting USP14 is a novel strategy for treating AR-responsive breast cancer. We found that inhibition of USP14 accelerated the K48-ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of AR protein. Additionally, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of USP14 significantly suppressed cell proliferation in AR-responsive breast cancer cells by blocking G0/G1 to S phase transition and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, AR overexpression inhibited USP14 inhibition-induced events, suggesting that AR deubiquitination by USP14 is critical for breast cancer growth and USP14 inhibition is a possible strategy to treat AR-positive breast cancer."

In the Great Lakes, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), an invasive benthic fish from the Black Sea, has spread to encompass all five lakes and many tributaries, outcompeting or consuming native species; however, estimates of round goby abundance are confounded by behavior and habitat preference, which impact reliable methods for estimating their population. By integrating eDNA into round goby monitoring, improved estimates of biomass may be obtainable. We conducted mesocosm experiments to estimate rates of goby DNA shedding and decay. Further, we compared eDNA with several methods of traditional field sampling to compare its use as an alternative/complementary monitoring method. Environmental DNA decay was comparable to other fish species, and first-order decay was lower at 12°C (k = 0.043) than at 19°C (k = 0.058). Round goby eDNA was routinely detected in known invaded sites of Lake Michigan and its tributaries (range log10 4.8–6.2 CN/L), but not upstream of an artificial fish barrier. Traditional techniques (mark-recapture, seining, trapping) in Lakes Michigan and Huron resulted in fewer, more variable detections than eDNA, but trapping and eDNA were correlated (Pearson R = 0.87). Additional field testing will help correlate round goby abundance with eDNA, providing insight on its role as a prey fish and its impact on food webs."

Methods We conducted an open-label randomised controlled trial. A total of 151 adults (76% women, mean age 52.5) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c≥8%), treated in the diabetes consultation units of two secondary health centres in Bamako, were allocated to peer-led structured patient education (n = 76) or conventional care alone (n = 75). The intervention group received 1 year of culturally tailored structured patient education (3 courses of 4 sessions) delivered in the community by five trained peer educators. Both groups underwent conventional diabetes monitoring and follow-up. Primary outcome was the mean absolute change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months. Results 177 education sessions were delivered to the intervention group. Patient attrition was 8%. From baseline to 12 months, the decrease in HbA1c levels was 1.05% (SD = 2.0; CI95%: 1.54;-0.56) in the intervention group compared with 0.15% (SD = 1.7; CI95%: -0.56; 0.26) in the control group, p = 0.006. Mean BMI change was -1.65 kg/m2 (SD = 2.5; CI95%: -2.25; -1.06) in the intervention group and +0.05 kg/m2 (SD = 3.2; CI95%: -0.71; 0.81) in the control group, p = 0.0005. Mean waist circumference decreased by 3.34 cm (SD = 9.3; CI95%: -5.56;-1.13) in the intervention group and increased by 2.65 cm (SD = 10.3; CI95%: 0.20; 5.09) in the control group, p = 0.0003. Conclusions Peer-led structured patient education delivered over 1 year to patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in Mali yielded substantial improvements in glycaemic control and anthropometric parameters.

https://openalex.org/W2785682811,"Aquaculture has grown rapidly over the last three decades expanding at an average annual growth rate of 5.8% (2005–2014), down from 8.8% achieved between 1980 and 2010. The sector now produces 44% of total food fish production. Increasing demand and consumption from a growing global population are driving further expansion of both inland and marine aquaculture (i.e., mariculture, including marine species farmed on land). However, the growth of mariculture is dependent on the availability of suitable farming areas for new facilities, particularly for open farming practices that rely on the natural oceanic environmental parameters such as temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll etc. In this study, we estimated the marine areas within the exclusive economic zones of all countries that were suitable for potential open ocean mariculture activities. To this end, we quantify the environmental niche and inferred the global habitat suitability index (HSI) of the 102 most farmed marine species using four species distribution models. The average weighted HSI across the four models suggests that 72,000,000 km2 of ocean are to be environmentally suitable to farm one or more species. About 92% of the predicted area (66,000,000 km2) is environmentally suitable for farming finfish, 43% (31,000,000 km2) for molluscs and 54% (39,000,000 km2) for crustaceans. These predictions do not consider technological feasibility that can limit crustaceans farming in open waters. Suitable mariculture areas along the Atlantic coast of South America and West Africa appear to be most under-utilized for farming. Our results suggest that factors other than environmental considerations such as the lack of socio-economic and technological capacity, as well as aqua feed supply are currently limiting the potential for mariculture expansion in many areas."

A doubled haploid (DH) population of the cross RL4452/‘AC Domain’ was used to study the genetic basis of seed shape. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses were conducted on a total of 18 traits: 14 grain shape traits, flour yield (Fyd), and three agronomic traits (Plant height [Plht], 1000 Grain weight [Gwt], Test weight [Twt]), using data from trial locations at Glenlea, Brandon, and Morden in Manitoba, Canada, between 1999 and 2004. Kernel shape was studied through digital image analysis with an Acurum® grain analyzer. Plht, Gwt, Twt, Fyd, and grain shape QTL were correlated with each other and QTL analysis revealed that QTL for these traits often mapped to the same genetic locations. The most significant QTL for the grain shape traits were located on chromosomes 4B and 4D, each accounting for up to 24.4% and 53.3% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. In addition, the most significant QTL for Plht, Gwt, and Twt were all detected on chromosome 4D at the Rht-D1 locus. Rht-D1b decreased Plht, Gwt, Twt, and kernel width relative to the Rht-D1a allele. A narrow genetic interval on chromosome 4B contained significant QTL for grain shape, Gwt, and Plht. The ‘AC Domain’ allele reduced Plht, Gwt, kernel length and width traits, but had no detectable effect on Twt. The data indicated that this variation was inconsistent with segregation at Rht-B1. Numerous QTL were identified that control these traits in this population."

We tested the prediction by comparing hippocampus place cells in wild-type and FXS-model mice. Experience-driven CA1 synaptic function and synaptic plasticity changes are excessive in Fmr1-null mice, but CA1 place fields are normal. However, Fmr1-null discharge relationships to local field potential oscillations are abnormally weak, stereotyped, and homogeneous; also, discharge coordination within Fmr1-null place cell networks is weaker and less reliable than wild-type. Rather than disruption of single-cell neural codes, these findings point to invariant tuning of single-cell responses and inadequate discharge coordination within neural ensembles as a pathophysiological basis of cognitive inflexibility in FXS.

We demonstrate that RAF-the original intended sorafenib target-and MKNK kinases function as pharmacological liabilities because of inhibitor-induced transactivation and negative feedback, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2784800060,"Derepression of chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression of paternal and maternal genomes is considered the first major step that initiates zygotic gene expression after fertilization. The histone variant H3.3 is present in both male and female gametes and is thought to be important for remodeling the paternal and maternal genomes for activation during both fertilization and embryogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using our H3.3B-HA–tagged mouse model, engineered to report H3.3 expression in live animals and to distinguish different sources of H3.3 protein in embryos, we show here that sperm-derived H3.3 (sH3.3) protein is removed from the sperm genome shortly after fertilization and extruded from the zygotes via the second polar bodies (PBII) during embryogenesis. We also found that the maternal H3.3 (mH3.3) protein is incorporated into the paternal genome as early as 2 h postfertilization and is detectable in the paternal genome until the morula stage. Knockdown of maternal H3.3 resulted in compromised embryonic development both of fertilized embryos and of androgenetic haploid embryos. Furthermore, we report that mH3.3 depletion in oocytes impairs both activation of the Oct4 pluripotency marker gene and global de novo transcription from the paternal genome important for early embryonic development. Our results suggest that H3.3-mediated paternal chromatin remodeling is essential for the development of preimplantation embryos and the activation of the paternal genome during embryogenesis."

MEC is specifically associated with a unique t(11;19) translocation and the resulting CRTC1-MAML2 fusion is a major oncogenic driver for MEC initiation and maintenance. However, the molecular basis underlying the CRTC1-MAML2 oncogenic functions remains elusive. Through gene expression profiling analysis, we observed that LINC00473, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was the top down-regulated target in CRTC1-MAML2-depleted human MEC cells. LncRNAs belong to a new class of non-coding RNAs with emerging roles in tumorigenesis and progression, but remain poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the role of LINC00473 in mediating CRTC1-MAML2 oncogenic activity in human MEC. We found that LINC00473 transcription was significantly induced in human CRTC1-MAML2-positive MEC cell lines and primary MEC tumors, and was tightly correlated with the CRTC1-MAML2 RNA level. LINC00473 induction was dependent on the ability of CRTC1-MAML2 to activate CREB-mediated transcription. Depletion of LINC00473 significantly reduced the proliferation and survival of human MEC cells in vitro and blocked the in vivo tumor growth in a human MEC xenograft model. RNA in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated a predominantly nuclear localization pattern for LINC00473 in human MEC cells. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed that LINC00473 depletion resulted in differential expression of genes important in cancer cell growth and survival. LINC00473 likely regulates gene expression in part through its ability to bind to a cAMP signaling pathway component NONO, enhancing the ability of CRTC1-MAML2 to activate CREB-mediated transcription. Our overall results demonstrate that LINC00473 is a downstream target and an important mediator of the CRTC1-MAML2 oncoprotein. Therefore, LINC00473 acts as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for human CRTC1-MAML2-positive MECs."
https://openalex.org/W2784943238,"Targeting the PI3K pathway has achieved limited success in cancer therapy. One reason for the disappointing activity of drugs that interfere with molecules that are important player in this pathway is the induction of multiple feedback loops that have been only partially understood. To understand these limitations and develop improved treatment strategies, we comprehensively characterized molecular mechanisms of PI3K pathway signaling in bladder cancer cell lines upon using small molecule inhibitors and RNAi technologies against all key molecules and protein complexes within the pathway and analyzed functional and molecular consequences. When targeting either mTORC1, mTOR, AKT or PI3K, only S6K1 phosphorylation was affected in most cell lines examined. Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 required combined inhibition of PI3K and mTORC1, independent from AKT, and resulted in a robust reduction in cell viability. Long-term inhibition of PI3K however resulted in a PDK1-dependent, PIP3 and mTORC2 independent rephosphorylation of AKT. AKT rephosphorylation could also be induced by mTOR or PDK1 inhibition. Combining PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with AKT or PDK1 inhibitors suppressed this rephosphorylation, induced apoptosis, decreased colony formation, cell viability and growth of tumor xenografts. Our findings reveal novel molecular mechanisms that explain the requirement for simultaneous targeting of PI3K, AKT and mTORC1 to achieve effective tumor growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2785263092,"The genetic diversity of African pigs, whether domestic or wild has not been widely studied and there is very limited published information available. Available data suggests that African domestic pigs originate from different domestication centers as opposed to international commercial breeds. We evaluated two domestic pig populations in Western Kenya, in order to characterize the genetic diversity, breed composition and admixture of the pigs in an area known to be endemic for African swine fever (ASF). One of the reasons for characterizing these specific populations is the fact that a proportion of indigenous pigs have tested ASF virus (ASFv) positive but do not present with clinical symptoms of disease indicating some form of tolerance to infection. Pigs were genotyped using either the porcine SNP60 or SNP80 chip. Village pigs were sourced from Busia and Homabay counties in Kenya. Because bush pigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) and warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.) are known to be tolerant to ASFv infection (exhibiting no clinical symptoms despite infection), they were included in the study to assess whether domestic pigs have similar genomic signatures. Additionally, samples representing European wild boar and international commercial breeds were included as references, given their potential contribution to the genetic make-up of the target domestic populations. The data indicate that village pigs in Busia are a non-homogenous admixed population with significant introgression of genes from international commercial breeds. Pigs from Homabay by contrast, represent a homogenous population with a ""local indigenous' composition that is distinct from the international breeds, and clusters more closely with the European wild boar than African wild pigs. Interestingly, village pigs from Busia that tested negative by PCR for ASFv genotype IX, had significantly higher local ancestry (>54%) compared to those testing positive, which contained more commercial breed gene introgression. This may have implication for breed selection and utilization in ASF endemic areas. A genome wide scan detected several regions under preferential selection with signatures for pigs from Busia and Homabay being very distinct. Additionally, there was no similarity in specific genes under selection between the wild pigs and domestic pigs despite having some broad areas under similar selection signatures. These results provide a basis to explore possible genetic determinants underlying tolerance to infection by ASFv genotypes and suggests multiple pathways for genetically mediated ASFv tolerance given the diversity of selection signatures observed among the populations studied."

To overcome this limitation we developed ViroFind, an in-solution target-enrichment platform for virus detection and discovery in clinical samples. ViroFind comprises 165,433 viral probes that cover the genomes of 535 selected DNA and RNA viruses that infect humans or could cause zoonosis. The ViroFind probes are used in a hybridization reaction to enrich viral sequences and therefore enhance the detection of viral genomes via deep sequencing. We used ViroFind to detect and analyze all viral populations in the brain of 5 patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and of 18 control subjects with no known neurological disease. Compared to direct deep sequencing, by using ViroFind we enriched viral sequences present in the clinical samples up to 127-fold. We discovered highly complex polyoma virus JC populations in the PML brain samples with a remarkable degree of genetic divergence among the JC virus variants of each PML brain sample. Specifically for the viral capsid protein VP1 gene, we identified 24 single nucleotide substitutions, 12 of which were associated with amino acid changes. The most frequent (4 of 5 samples, 80%) amino acid change was D66H, which is associated with enhanced tissue tropism, and hence likely a viral fitness advantage, compared to other variants. Lastly, we also detected sparse JC virus sequences in 10 of 18 (55.5%) of control samples and sparse human herpes virus 6B (HHV6B) sequences in the brain of 11 of 18 (61.1%) control subjects. In sum, ViroFind enabled the in-depth analysis of all viral genomes in PML and control brain samples and allowed us to demonstrate a high degree of JC virus genetic divergence in vivo that has been previously underappreciated. ViroFind can be used to investigate the structure of the virome with unprecedented depth in health and disease state."
https://openalex.org/W2794341160,"The widely used organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is often detected in food. CPF inhibits acetylcholinesterase and can modify muscle contractility and respiratory patterns. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to CPF on respiratory parameters and diaphragm contractility in 21- and 60-days old rats. Pregnant rats were exposed to oral CPF (1 or 5 mg/ kg /day: CPF-1 or CPF-5 groups vs vehicle: controls) from gestation onset up to weaning of the pups that were individually gavaged (CPF or vehicle) thereafter. Two developmental time points were studied: weaning (day 21) and adulthood (day 60). Whole-body plethysmography was used to score breathing patterns and apnea index during sleep. Then, diaphragm strips were dissected for the assessment of contractility and acetylcholinesterase activity. Results showed that the sleep apnea index was higher in CPF-exposed rats than in controls. In adult rats, the expiratory time and tidal volume were higher in CPF-exposed animals than in controls. At both ages, the diaphragm's amplitude of contraction and fatigability index were higher in the CPF-5 group, due to lower acetylcholinesterase activity. We conclude that chronic exposure to CPF is associated with higher sleep apnea index and diaphragm contractility, and modifies respiratory patterns in sleeping juvenile and adult rats."
https://openalex.org/W2785253223,"Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related proteins (ORPs) constitute a large family of proteins that mainly function in lipid transport and sensing. ORP5 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored protein implicated in lipid transfer at the contact sites between the ER and other membranes. Recent studies indicate that ORP5 is also involved in cancer cell invasion and tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanism underlying ORP5's involvement in cancer is unclear. Here, we report that ORP5 promotes cell proliferation and motility of HeLa cells, an effect that depends on its functional OSBP-related domain (ORD). We also found that ORP5 depletion or substitutions of key residues located within ORP5–ORD and responsible for interactions with lipids interfered with cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. ORP5 interacted with the protein mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and this interaction also required ORP5–ORD. Of note, whereas ORP5 overexpression induced mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, ORP5 down-regulation had the opposite effect. Finally, ORP5-depleted cells exhibited impaired mTOR localization to lysosomes, which may have accounted for the blunted mTORC1 activation. Together, our results suggest that ORP5 expression is positively correlated with mTORC1 signaling and that ORP5 stimulates cell proliferation, at least in part, by activating mTORC1."
https://openalex.org/W2786494588,"The impact of socioeconomic disparities on surgical outcome in the absence of healthcare inequality remains unclear. Therefore, we set out to determine the association between socioeconomic status (SES), reflected by household income, and overall survival after surgery in the Dutch setting of equal access and provision of care. Additionally, we aim to assess whether SES is associated with cause-specific survival and major 30-day complications.Patients undergoing surgery between March 2005 and December 2006 in a general teaching hospital in the Netherlands were prospectively included. Adjusted logistic and cox regression analyses were used to assess the independent association of SES-quantified by gross household income-with major 30-day complications and long-term postoperative survival.A total of 3929 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Low household income was associated with worse survival in continuous analysis (HR: 1.05 per 10.000 euro decrease in income, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10) and in income quartile analysis (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.08-2.31, first [i.e. lowest] quartile relative to the fourth quartile). Similarly, low income patients were at higher risk of cardiovascular death (HR: 1.26 per 10.000 decrease in income, 95% CI: 1.07-1.48, first income quartile: HR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.04-9.22). Household income was not independently associated with cancer-related mortality and major 30-day complications.Low SES, quantified by gross household income, is associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality risks among surgical patients. Considering the equality of care provided by this study setting, the associated survival hazards can be attributed to patient and provider factors, rather than disparities in healthcare. Increased physician awareness of SES as a risk factor in preoperative decision-making and focus on improving established SES-related risk factors may improve surgical outcome of low SES patients."

https://openalex.org/W2784522387,"The human brain is known to contain several functional networks that interact dynamically. Therefore, it is desirable to analyze the temporal features of these networks by dynamic functional connectivity (dFC). A sliding window approach was used in an event-related fMRI (visual stimulation using checkerboards) to assess the impact of repetition time (TR) and window size on the temporal features of BOLD dFC. In addition, we also examined the spatial distribution of dFC and tested the feasibility of this approach for the analysis of interictal epileptiforme discharges. 15 healthy controls (visual stimulation paradigm) and three patients with epilepsy (EEG-fMRI) were measured with EPI-fMRI. We calculated the functional connectivity degree (FCD) by determining the total number of connections of a given voxel above a predefined threshold based on Pearson correlation. FCD could capture hemodynamic changes relative to stimulus onset in controls. A significant effect of TR and window size was observed on FCD estimates. At a conventional TR of 2.6 s, FCD values were marginal compared to FCD values using sub-seconds TRs achievable with multiband (MB) fMRI. Concerning window sizes, a specific maximum of FCD values (inverted u-shape behavior) was found for each TR, indicating a limit to the possible gain in FCD for increasing window size. In patients, a dynamic FCD change was found relative to the onset of epileptiform EEG patterns, which was compatible with their clinical semiology. Our findings indicate that dynamic FCD transients are better detectable with sub-second TR than conventional TR. This approach was capable of capturing neuronal connectivity across various regions of the brain, indicating a potential to study the temporal characteristics of interictal epileptiform discharges and seizures in epilepsy patients or other brain diseases with brief events."
https://openalex.org/W2793895891,"Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most burdensome infectious illness in Canada. Current screening strategies miss a significant proportion of cases, leaving many undiagnosed. Elevated HCV prevalence in those born between 1945 and 1965 has prompted calls for birth-cohort screening in this group. However, Canada lacks population-level data to support this recommendation. We performed a serosurvey to obtain population-based HCV prevalence estimates in Ontario residents born between 1945–1974, to generate evidence for birth-cohort screening recommendations. Methods We tested anonymized residual sera in five-year age-sex bands from Ontario for anti-HCV antibody. We performed descriptive epidemiological analysis and used a logistic regression model to determine HCV risk-factors. Results Of 10,006 sera analyzed, 155 (1.55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32, 1.81) were positive for HCV antibody. Individuals born between 1950–1964 had a significantly higher combined prevalence of 1.92% (95% CI 1.56, 2.34) compared to 1.14% (95% CI 0.69, 1.77) (p = 0.04) for those born between 1970–1974. For males, comprising 107/155 (69.03%) of positive samples, the highest prevalence was 3.00% (95% CI 1.95, 4.39) for the 1960–1964 birth-cohort. For females, the highest prevalence was 1.56% (95% CI 0.83, 2.65) for those born between 1955–1959. Male sex was significantly associated with positive HCV serostatus. Interpretation HCV prevalence in Ontario is highest among those in this birth cohort, and higher than previous estimates. The prevalence estimates presented in our study provide important data to underpin birth-cohort screening recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2795043051,"The present study aimed to compare a range of cooling methods possibly utilised by occupational workers, focusing on their effect on body temperature, perception and manual dexterity.Ten male participants completed eight trials involving 30 min of seated rest followed by 30 min of cooling or control of no cooling (CON) (34°C, 58% relative humidity). The cooling methods utilised were: ice cooling vest (CV0), phase change cooling vest melting at 14°C (CV14), evaporative cooling vest (CVEV), arm immersion in 10°C water (AI), portable water-perfused suit (WPS), heliox inhalation (HE) and ice slushy ingestion (SL). Immediately before and after cooling, participants were assessed for fine (Purdue pegboard task) and gross (grip and pinch strength) manual dexterity. Rectal and skin temperature, as well as thermal sensation and comfort, were monitored throughout.Compared with CON, SL was the only method to reduce rectal temperature (P = 0.012). All externally applied cooling methods reduced skin temperature (P<0.05), though CV0 resulted in the lowest skin temperature versus other cooling methods. Participants felt cooler with CV0, CV14, WPS, AI and SL (P<0.05). AI significantly impaired Purdue pegboard performance (P = 0.001), but did not affect grip or pinch strength (P>0.05).The present study observed that ice ingestion or ice applied to the skin produced the greatest effect on rectal and skin temperature, respectively. AI should not be utilised if workers require subsequent fine manual dexterity. These results will help inform future studies investigating appropriate pre-cooling methods for the occupational worker."
https://openalex.org/W2792380420,"This study investigated for the first time the molecular effectiveness of 'aroma' from three small molecules including a phenol (phenyl ethyl alcohol; PEA) and an aldehyde (cinnamaldehyde; Cin) both containing an aromatic ring, and a diamine (N,N,N,N'- Tetramethylethylenediamine; TEMED) at two different amounts (small; S and large; L) in preventing hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) amyloid fibril formation using Thioflavin T and Nile red fluorescence assays, circular dichroism spectroscopy, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering and HEWL activity test. Interestingly, the results revealed that (1) the aroma of PEA, identified as an active constituent of Rosa damascena, prevented fibril formation since PEA-L was able to trap the oligomeric form of HEWL in contrast to PEA-S where protofibrils but not mature fibrils were formed; (2) Cin, previously shown to prevent fibril formation in the liquid form, was also shown to do so in the aroma form by producing protofibrils and not mature fibrils in both Cin- L and Cin-S aroma forms and (3) the aroma of TEMED-L was able to retain HEWL's native structure completely and prevented both aggregation and fibril formation, while TEMED-S prevented HEWL fibril formation and instead directed the pathway towards amorphous aggregate formation. Furthermore, the ability to trap oligomeric species (by PEA-L aroma) is of great importance for further research as it provides routes for preventing the formation of toxic oligomeric intermediates along the fibrillation pathway. Last but not least, the novelty of this in vitro study on the effect of aroma at the molecular level with a unique experimental set-up using HEWL as a model protein in assessing amyloid fibril formation paves the way for more and detailed studies on the importance of aroma producing molecules and their effects."
https://openalex.org/W2784900008,"CD300 molecules (CD300s) belong to paired activating and inhibitory receptor families, which mediate immune responses. Human CD300e (hCD300e) is expressed in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells and transmits an immune-activating signal by interacting with DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12). However, the CD300e ortholog in mice (mCD300e) is poorly characterized. Here, we found that mCD300e is also an immune-activating receptor. We found that mCD300e engagement triggers cytokine production in mCD300e-transduced bone marrow–derived mast cells (BMMCs). Loss of DAP12 and another signaling protein, FcRγ, did not affect surface expression of transduced mCD300e, but abrogated mCD300e-mediated cytokine production in the BMMCs. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that mCD300e physically interacts with both FcRγ and DAP12, suggesting that mCD300e delivers an activating signal via these two proteins. Binding and reporter assays with the mCD300e extracellular domain identified sphingomyelin as a ligand of both mCD300e and hCD300e. Notably, the binding of sphingomyelin to mCD300e stimulated cytokine production in the transduced BMMCs in an FcRγ- and DAP12-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis with an mCD300e-specific Ab disclosed that mCD300e expression is highly restricted to CD115+Ly-6Clow/int peripheral blood monocytes, corresponding to CD14dim/+CD16+ human nonclassical and intermediate monocytes. Loss of FcRγ or DAP12 lowered the surface expression of endogenous mCD300e in the CD115+Ly-6Clow/int monocytes. Stimulation with sphingomyelin failed to activate the CD115+Ly-6Clow/int mouse monocytes, but induced hCD300e-mediated cytokine production in the CD14dimCD16+ human monocytes. Taken together, these observations indicate that mCD300e recognizes sphingomyelin and thereby regulates nonclassical and intermediate monocyte functions through FcRγ and DAP12."
https://openalex.org/W2785226476,"The most frequently used oral anti-coagulant warfarin has been implicated in inducing calcification of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs), whereas the mechanism is not fully understood. The low-level activation of p53 is found to be involved in osteogenic transdifferentiation and calcification of AVICs. Whether p53 participates in warfarin-induced AVIC calcification remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of low-level p53 overexpression in warfarin-induced porcine AVIC (pAVIC) calcification. Immunostaining, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting revealed that p53 was expressed in human and pAVICs and that p53 expression was slightly increased in calcific human aortic valves compared with non-calcific valves. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining indicated that apoptosis slightly increased in calcific aortic valves than in non-calcific valves. Warfarin treatment led to a low-level increase of p53 mRNA and protein in both pAVICs and mouse aortic valves. Low-level overexpression of p53 in pAVICs via an adenovirus vector did not affect pAVIC apoptosis but promoted warfarin-induced calcium deposition and expression of osteogenic markers. shRNA-mediated p53 knockdown attenuated the pAVIC calcium deposition and osteogenic marker expression. Moreover, ChIP and luciferase assays showed that p53 was recruited to the slug promoter and activated slug expression in calcific pAVICs. Of note, overexpression of Slug increased osteogenic marker Runx2 expression, but not pAVIC calcium deposition, and Slug knockdown attenuated pAVIC calcification and p53-mediated pAVIC calcium deposition and expression of osteogenic markers. In conclusion, we found that p53 plays an important role in warfarin induced pAVIC calcification, and increased slug transcription by p53 is required for p53-mediated pAVIC calcification."

Methods A total of sixty cardiovascular patients scheduled for PCI with clear anxiety and depression screened by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were randomly divided into an experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 30) group. The participants in the experimental group received cognitive therapy, relaxation therapy and emotional support. Self-reported questionnaires, including the Self-Report Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and the Medical Coping Mode Questionnaire (MCMQ), and levels of IL-2 and cortisol were collected at baseline and the day before discharge. Results Compared with the controls, patients in the intervention group had a better mental state and coping style (confrontation), higher levels of IL-2 and lower levels of cortisol (all P<0.05). Conclusions The psychological intervention programme effectively improved mental state, reduced negative coping styles, increased levels of IL-2, and decreased cortisol levels in patients undergoing PCI.

The underlying pathophysiology of migraine is as yet unclear. We explored key proteins related to the pathogenesis of migraine here. Serum was collected from two patients with migraine with aura (MA) and seven patients with migraine without aura (MO) during attack-free periods and migraine attacks. Samples were analyzed using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Nineteen protein spots were altered between the attack-free versus migraine attack periods. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed to identify the proteins within each of the 19 altered spots. Thirty-six proteins were significantly altered in samples collected during attack-free periods versus migraine attacks. The protein with the statistically most significant MASCOT/Mowse score (268±112) among lipoproteins was apolipoprotein (ApoE). In the MA and MO groups, ApoE protein levels were significantly higher during migraine attack than during the attack-free period (p<0.05). ApoE protein levels were also significantly increased in the MA group during the attack-free period compared to healthy controls and patients with tension type headaches (p<0.01). Migraine alters ApoE levels, especially in MA. ApoE might play an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine, and may act as a diagnostic biomarker of migraine."

The proposed design can process operands of different size using the same datapath, which exhibits a significant reduction in area without loss of efficiency if compared to representative state of the art designs. For example, our design uses 96% less standard logic than a similar design optimized for performance, and 46% less resources than other design optimized for area. Even using fewer area resources, our design still performs better than its embedded software counterparts (190x and 697x)."
https://openalex.org/W2793948477,"Background 
Although concern exists regarding the adverse effects and rate of zolpidem use, especially long-term use, limited information is available concerning patterns of zolpidem use.


Objective 
To examine the prevalence and correlates of zolpidem exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans (IAVs).


Methods 
A retrospective cohort study of zolpidem prescriptions was performed with National Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data. We gathered national VA inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy data files for IAV’s who received VA care between fiscal years (FY) 2013 and 2014. The VA pharmacy database was used to identify the prevalence of long term (>30 days), high-dose zolpidem exposure (>10mg immediate-release; >12.5mg extended-release) and other medications received in FY14. Baseline characteristics (demographics, diagnoses) were identified in FY13. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to examine the demographic, clinical, and medication correlates of zolpidem use.


Results 
Of 493,683 IAVs who received VHA care in FY 2013 and 2014, 7.6% (n = 37,422) were prescribed zolpidem in FY 2014. Women had lower odds of high-dose zolpidem exposure than men. The majority (77.3%) of IAVs who received zolpidem prescriptions had long-term use with an average days’ supply of 189.3 days and a minority (0.9%) had high-dose exposure. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with long-term zolpidem exposure included age greater than 29 years old, PTSD, insomnia, Selim Index, physical 2–3 conditions, opioids, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, and stimulants. High dose exposure was associated with PTSD, depression, substance use disorder, insomnia, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, and stimulant prescriptions.


Conclusion 
The current practices of insomnia pharmacotherapy in IAVs fall short of the clinical guidelines and may reflect high-risk zolpidem prescribing practices that put Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans at risk for adverse effects of zolpidem and poor health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2789444642,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tow duration on catch per unit of swept area (CPUE), trawl catch performance, and the proportion of the species caught in a trawl survey. Longer tows are expected to have a greater probability of catching species. An average of 26 species were caught in the first 30 minutes, whereas only about one additional species was caught in the next 30 minutes in longer tows. The shorter tows involved a decrement in catch weight for 11 of the 12 target species sampled, demonstrating that tow duration did affect catch per unit of swept area CPUE. The shorter tows were associated with a significant reduction of the overall CPUE in terms of weight of the main target species and of the total catch (circa 60%). The same strong reduction of around 70% was found in particular for European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and surmullet (Mullus spp) and 50% for Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus). The shorter tows were less efficient in catching large-sized hake, surmullet, Nephrops, Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), and poor cod (Trisopterus minutus), even though the difference was significant only for Nephrops. Regardless of the p-value statistic, these findings suggest that the continuity of survey time series would be severely impaired by changing tow duration. Further work is required to explore a way to reduce tow duration without reducing CPUE."
https://openalex.org/W2790473078,"A mechanical intestinal obstruction (MIO) can generate intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) that is life threatening. The intestines are very sensitive to IAH since the low splanchnic perfusion causes intestinal hypoxia, local acidosis and bacterial translocations. This may lead to acute intestinal distress syndrome (AIDS). The identification of intestinal injuries during IAH and its correlation with clinical parameters as the abdominal perfusion pressure (APP), the gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) and lactic acid (Lc) are still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the sequence of intestinal histopathological findings in an MIO model and to analyze potential relationships with parameters currently used in clinical practice (APP, pHi and Lc).Twenty pigs were divided into three groups: a control group (n = 5) and two experimental groups with 20 mmHg (G1, n = 10) and 30 mmHg (G2, n = 5) of IAH by MIO. The pressures were maintained for 3 hours, except in 5 animals in G1 where it was maintained for 5 hours. The APP, pHi and LA were recorded and biopsies of the terminal ileum were taken every 30 minutes in all groups. The intestinal damage was graded according to the Park Score.Intestinal injuries were found in 42.9% of pigs in the experimental groups. The lesions were independent of the level and duration of IAH. Although APP and pHi were slightly lower in injured animals (I +) of G1 and G2, there were no significant differences among those uninjured (I-). Lc was significantly increased in all I+ pigs from the onset of IAH.The IAH by MIO causes intestinal lesions from the first 30 minutes with concurrent decreases in APP and pHi and increases in Lc. Lc could be the best clinical parameter related to intestinal damages with a clear difference between I + and I- animals."

These effects are modulated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). To further study changes in signal transduction suggested by mRNA data, we used kinase substrate arrays to identify composite kinase activities induced by lysates from a primary human monocyte model system. Cell lysates were prepared from monocytes treated with the following experimental conditions: 106 N. meningitidis/mL, 25 ng/mL IL-10, 106 N. meningitidis/mL in combination with 25 ng/mL IL-10, and vehicle. Lysates were subjected to kinase activity profiling with Tyrosine Kinase PamChip® arrays containing 144 kinase peptide substrates. In our experimental model, we were not able to detect a statistically significant large-scale change in ex vivo array peptide phosphorylation by lysates from monocytes treated for 15 minutes. Targets of the IL-10 anti-inflammatory response were not identified. A profound inhibition of array peptide phosphorylation by monocytes treated for 60 minutes was identified, suggesting low activity of a large number of kinases associated with different signaling pathways and immune cell functions, including STAT3 activity, Nf-κB and VEGF signaling, and PTEN signaling activity. The peptide representing ZBTB16, which was reduced in phosphorylation by lysates from all three experimental conditions, was in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified to be linked to reduced cytokine release and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and CXCL10. Further studies should investigate changes in tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction in human immune cells, in order to evaluate the potential clinical application of kinome profiling in the study of systemic inflammatory responses to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2784391196,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) mediates sodium absorption in lung, kidney, and colon epithelia. Channels in the ENaC/degenerin family possess an extracellular region that senses physicochemical changes in the extracellular milieu and allosterically regulates the channel opening. Proteolytic cleavage activates the ENaC opening, by the removal of specific segments in the finger domains of the α- and γ ENaC-subunits. Cleavage causes perturbations in the extracellular region that propagate to the channel gate. However, it is not known how the channel structure mediates the propagation of activation signals through the extracellular sensing domains. Here, to identify the structure-function determinants that mediate allosteric ENaC activation, we performed MD simulations, thiol modification of residues substituted by cysteine, and voltage-clamp electrophysiology recordings. Our simulations of an ENaC heterotetramer, α1βα2γ, in the proteolytically cleaved and uncleaved states revealed structural pathways in the α-subunit that are responsible for ENaC proteolytic activation. To validate these findings, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to introduce cysteine substitutions in the extracellular domains of the α-, β-, and γ ENaC-subunits. Insertion of a cysteine at the α-subunit Glu557 site, predicted to stabilize a closed state of ENaC, inhibited ENaC basal activity and retarded the kinetics of proteolytic activation by 2-fold. Our results suggest that the lower palm domain of αENaC is essential for ENaC activation. In conclusion, our integrated computational and experimental approach suggests key structure-function determinants for ENaC proteolytic activation and points toward a mechanistic model for the allosteric communication in the extracellular domains of the ENaC/degenerin family channels."
