https://openalex.org/W2127558096,"To explore the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, we have used two in vitro model systems involving coculture of endothelial cells with colon carcinoma cells. COX-2-overexpressing cells produce prostaglandins, proangiogenic factors, and stimulate both endothelial migration and tube formation, while control cells have little activity. The effect is inhibited by antibodies to combinations of angiogenic factors, by NS-398 (a selective COX-2 inhibitor), and by aspirin. NS-398 does not inhibit production of angiogenic factors or angiogenesis induced by COX-2-negative cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with aspirin or a COX-1 antisense oligonucleotide inhibits COX-1 activity/expression and suppresses tube formation. Cyclooxygenase regulates colon carcinoma-induced angiogenesis by two mechanisms: COX-2 can modulate production of angiogenic factors by colon cancer cells, while COX-1 regulates angiogenesis in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011030679,"A variety of cytokines mediate the activation of Janus protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks). The Jaks then phosphorylate cellular substrates, including members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) family of transcription factors. Among the Stats, the two highly related proteins, Stat5a and Stat5b, are activated by a variety of cytokines. To assess the role of the Stat5 proteins, mutant mice were derived that have the genes deleted individually or together. The phenotypes of the mice demonstrate an essential, and often redundant, role for the two Stat5 proteins in a spectrum of physiological responses associated with growth hormone and prolactin. Conversely, the responses to a variety of cytokines that activate the Stat5 proteins, including erythropoietin, are largely unaffected."

https://openalex.org/W1981437331,"During development, distinct classes of neurons are specified in precise locations along the dorso–ventral and anterior–posterior axes of the neural tube. We provide evidence that intersections of Shh, which is expressed along the ventral neural tube, and FGF8, which is locally produced at the mid/hindbrain boundary and in the rostral forebrain, create induction sites for dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and forebrain. The same intersection, when preceded by a third signal, FGF4, which is expressed in the primitive streak, defines an inductive center for hindbrain 5-HT neurons. These findings illustrate that cell patterning in the neural plate is a multistep process in which early inducers, which initially divide the neural plate into crude compartments, are replaced by multiple local organizing centers, which specify distinct neuronal cell types within these compartments."

The stimulation requires a protein secretion system (type III) that translocates bacterial proteins into the host cell. We show that SopE, a substrate of this secretion system, stimulates cytoskeletal reorganization and JNK activation in a CDC42- and Rac-1-dependent manner. A lambda gt11 cDNA library screen for proteins that interact with SopE identified Rac-1 and CDC42. Furthermore, purified SopE was shown to stimulate GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange in several Rho GTPases in vitro, including Rac-1 and CDC42. These findings establish a paradigm for microbial stimulation of cellular responses in which the pathogen induces signaling events by directly engaging the signaling machinery within the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W2149517464,"In budding yeast, the Sec6/8p complex is essential for generating cell polarity by specifying vesicle delivery to the bud tip. We show that Sec6/8 homologs are components of a cytosolic, approximately 17S complex in nonpolarized MDCK epithelial cells. Upon initiation of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, approximately 70% of Sec6/8 is rapidly (t(1/2) approximately 3-6 hr) recruited to sites of cell-cell contact. In streptolysin-O-permeabilized MDCK cells, Sec8 antibodies inhibit delivery of LDL receptor to the basal-lateral membrane, but not p75NTR to the apical membrane. These results indicate that lateral membrane recruitment of the Sec6/8 complex is a consequence of cell-cell adhesion and is essential for the biogenesis of epithelial cell surface polarity."
https://openalex.org/W1996073092,"Genomic rearrangement of the antigen receptor loci is initiated by the two lymphoid-specific proteins Rag-1 and Rag-2. Null mutations in either of the two proteins abrogate initiation of V(D)J recombination and cause severe combined immunodeficiency with complete absence of mature B and T lymphocytes. We report here that patients with Omenn syndrome, a severe immunodeficiency characterized by the presence of activated, anergic, oligoclonal T cells, hypereosinophilia, and high IgE levels, bear missense mutations in either the Rag-1 or Rag-2 genes that result in partial activity of the two proteins. Two of the amino acid substitutions map within the Rag-1 homeodomain and decrease DNA binding activity, while three others lower the efficiency of Rag-1/Rag-2 interaction. These findings provide evidence to indicate that the immunodeficiency manifested in patients with Omenn syndrome arises from mutations that decrease the efficiency of V(D)J recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2045655335,"In Drosophila wing imaginal discs, the Wingless (Wg) protein acts as a morphogen, emanating from the dorsal/ventral (D/V) boundary of the disc to directly define cell identities along the D/V axis at short and long range. Here, we show that high levels of a Wg receptor, Drosophila frizzled 2 (Dfz2), stabilize Wg, allowing it to reach cells far from its site of synthesis. Wg signaling represses Dfz2 expression, creating a gradient of decreasing Wg stability moving toward the D/V boundary. This repression of Dfz2 is crucial for the normal shape of Wg morphogen gradient as well as the response of cells to the Wg signal. In contrast to other ligand–receptor relationships where the receptor limits diffusion of the ligand, Dfz2 broadens the range of Wg action by protecting it from degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2118870612,"T cell activation requires the import of NF-AT transcription factors to the nucleus, a process promoted by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation and inhibited by poorly understood protein kinases. Here, we report the identification of two protein kinases that oppose NF-AT4 nuclear import. Casein kinase Iα directly binds and phosphorylates NF-AT4, resulting in the inhibiton of NF-AT4 nuclear translocation. MEKK1 indirectly suppresses NF-AT4 nuclear import by stabilizing the interaction between NF-AT4 and CKIα. CKIα thus acts to establish an intramolecular masking of the nuclear location signal on NF-AT4, while MEKK1 augments this mechanism, and may further provide a link to signal transduction pathways regulating NF-AT4."
https://openalex.org/W2036789689,"NF-κB, a key regulator of the cellular inflammatory and immune response, is activated by the HTLV-I transforming and transactivating protein Tax. We show that Tax binds to the amino terminus of the protein kinase MEKK1, a component of an IκB kinase complex, and stimulates MEKK1 kinase activity. Tax expression increases the activity of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) to enhance phosphorylation of serine residues in IκBα that lead to its degradation. Dominant negative mutants of both IKKβ and MEKK1 prevent Tax activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, recombinant MEKK1 stimulates IKKβ phosphorylation of IκBα. Thus, Tax-mediated increases in NF-κB nuclear translocation result from direct interactions of Tax and MEKK1 leading to enhanced IKKβ phosphorylation of IκBα."

https://openalex.org/W1990985549,"Architectural protein IHF modulates Tn10 transposition in vitro. IHF stimulates transposon excision. Also, separately, IHF forces transposon end/target DNA interactions into a constrained pathway, ""channeling,"" that yields only unknotted intratransposon inversion circles. Negative supercoiling influences both effects, differently. We infer that IHF is an architectural catalyst: it promotes initial transpososome assembly and is then ejected from the transpososome. IHF then rebinds, altering transpososome conformation to promote channeling. We also infer that the developing transpososome is a molecular spring: DNA provides basic elasticity; a conformational change in transposase provides force; and IHF and/or supercoiling provide conformational inputs. In vivo, IHF is a sensory transducer of chromosomal supercoiling status: with supercoiling absent, IHF is ""supercoiling relief factor""; with supercoiling present, stimulation and channeling comprise a homeostatic pair such that modest changes in chromosome condition strongly influence transpositional outcome."

https://openalex.org/W2078426621,"The spread of viruses on a homogeneous lawn of receptive hosts provides an opportunity to detect the dynamics of their evolution. We have previously found that when repeated virus passages are confined to the expanding perimeter of a growing plaque, the appearance and outgrowth of genetically diverse strains (all descended from the same parent strain) can be traced along different radii of the plaque. As a plaque grows, the random mutation and selection of new fast-growing strains reduce the roundness or circularity of the growing plaque. Here we have quantified such changes in growing plaques of bacteriophage T7 using a digital imaging system. We find that T7 populations not adapted for fast growth exhibit a broader diversity of growth rates than populations adapted for fast growth. These results provide a foundation for understanding how viruses exploit mutation and selection processes to persist in nature."
