https://openalex.org/W2771057425,"Human liver cancer research currently lacks in vitro models that can faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of the original tumor. We recently described a novel, near-physiological organoid culture system, wherein primary human healthy liver cells form long-term expanding organoids that retain liver tissue function and genetic stability. Here we extend this culture system to the propagation of primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids from three of the most common PLC subtypes: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC) tumors. PLC-derived organoid cultures preserve the histological architecture, gene expression and genomic landscape of the original tumor, allowing for discrimination between different tumor tissues and subtypes, even after long-term expansion in culture in the same medium conditions. Xenograft studies demonstrate that the tumorogenic potential, histological features and metastatic properties of PLC-derived organoids are preserved in vivo. PLC-derived organoids are amenable for biomarker identification and drug-screening testing and led to the identification of the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 as a potential therapeutic agent for primary liver cancer. We thus demonstrate the wide-ranging biomedical utilities of PLC-derived organoid models in furthering the understanding of liver cancer biology and in developing personalized-medicine approaches for the disease."

T-cell immunity has been linked to the exceptional outcome of the few long-term survivors, yet the relevant antigens remain unknown. Here we use genetic, immunohistochemical and transcriptional immunoprofiling, computational biophysics, and functional assays to identify T-cell antigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer. Using whole-exome sequencing and in silico neoantigen prediction, we found that tumours with both the highest neoantigen number and the most abundant CD8+ T-cell infiltrates, but neither alone, stratified patients with the longest survival. Investigating the specific neoantigen qualities promoting T-cell activation in long-term survivors, we discovered that these individuals were enriched in neoantigen qualities defined by a fitness model, and neoantigens in the tumour antigen MUC16 (also known as CA125). A neoantigen quality fitness model conferring greater immunogenicity to neoantigens with differential presentation and homology to infectious disease-derived peptides identified long-term survivors in two independent datasets, whereas a neoantigen quantity model ascribing greater immunogenicity to increasing neoantigen number alone did not. We detected intratumoural and lasting circulating T-cell reactivity to both high-quality and MUC16 neoantigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer, including clones with specificity to both high-quality neoantigens and predicted cross-reactive microbial epitopes, consistent with neoantigen molecular mimicry. Notably, we observed selective loss of high-quality and MUC16 neoantigenic clones on metastatic progression, suggesting neoantigen immunoediting. Our results identify neoantigens with unique qualities as T-cell targets in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. More broadly, we identify neoantigen quality as a biomarker for immunogenic tumours that may guide the application of immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2767891987,"Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies enable the host immune system to recognize and destroy tumour cells. Their clinical activity has been correlated with activated T-cell recognition of neoantigens, which are tumour-specific, mutated peptides presented on the surface of cancer cells. Here we present a fitness model for tumours based on immune interactions of neoantigens that predicts response to immunotherapy. Two main factors determine neoantigen fitness: the likelihood of neoantigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and subsequent recognition by T cells. We estimate these components using the relative MHC binding affinity of each neoantigen to its wild type and a nonlinear dependence on sequence similarity of neoantigens to known antigens. To describe the evolution of a heterogeneous tumour, we evaluate its fitness as a weighted effect of dominant neoantigens in the subclones of the tumour. Our model predicts survival in anti-CTLA-4-treated patients with melanoma and anti-PD-1-treated patients with lung cancer. Importantly, low-fitness neoantigens identified by our method may be leveraged for developing novel immunotherapies. By using an immune fitness model to study immunotherapy, we reveal broad similarities between the evolution of tumours and rapidly evolving pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2768810688,"Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a central role in nonshivering thermogenesis in brown fat; however, its role in beige fat remains unclear. Here we report a robust UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism in beige fat that involves enhanced ATP-dependent Ca2+ cycling by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2). Inhibition of SERCA2b impairs UCP1-independent beige fat thermogenesis in humans and mice as well as in pigs, a species that lacks a functional UCP1 protein. Conversely, enhanced Ca2+ cycling by activation of α1- and/or β3-adrenergic receptors or the SERCA2b-RyR2 pathway stimulates UCP1-independent thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. In the absence of UCP1, beige fat dynamically expends glucose through enhanced glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid metabolism and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity for ATP-dependent thermogenesis through the SERCA2b pathway; beige fat thereby functions as a 'glucose sink' and improves glucose tolerance independently of body weight loss. Our study uncovers a noncanonical thermogenic mechanism through which beige fat controls whole-body energy homeostasis via Ca2+ cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2769628390,"The Cre-loxP recombination system is the most widely used technology for in vivo tracing of stem or progenitor cell lineages. The precision of this genetic system largely depends on the specificity of Cre recombinase expression in targeted stem or progenitor cells. However, Cre expression in nontargeted cell types can complicate the interpretation of lineage-tracing studies and has caused controversy in many previous studies. Here we describe a new genetic lineage tracing system that incorporates the Dre-rox recombination system to enhance the precision of conventional Cre-loxP-mediated lineage tracing. The Dre-rox system permits rigorous control of Cre-loxP recombination in lineage tracing, effectively circumventing potential uncertainty of the cell-type specificity of Cre expression. Using this new system we investigated two topics of recent debates-the contribution of c-Kit+ cardiac stem cells to cardiomyocytes in the heart and the contribution of Sox9+ hepatic progenitor cells to hepatocytes in the liver. By overcoming the technical hurdle of nonspecific Cre-loxP-mediated recombination, this new technology provides more precise analysis of cell lineage and fate decisions and facilitates the in vivo study of stem and progenitor cell plasticity in disease and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2768114066,"The coarse-grained Martini model is employed extensively to study membrane protein oligomerization. While this approach is exceptionally promising given its computational efficiency, it is alarming that a significant fraction of these studies demonstrate unrealistic protein clusters, whose formation is essentially an irreversible process. This suggests that the protein–protein interactions are exaggerated in the Martini model. If this held true, then it would limit the applicability of Martini to study multi-protein complexes, as the rapidly clustering proteins would not be able to properly sample the correct dimerization conformations. In this work we first demonstrate the excessive protein aggregation by comparing the dimerization free energies of helical transmembrane peptides obtained with the Martini model to those determined from FRET experiments. Second, we show that the predictions provided by the Martini model for the structures of transmembrane domain dimers are in poor agreement with the corresponding structures resolved using NMR. Next, we demonstrate that the first issue can be overcome by slightly scaling down the Martini protein–protein interactions in a manner, which does not interfere with the other Martini interaction parameters. By preventing excessive, irreversible, and non-selective aggregation of membrane proteins, this approach renders the consideration of lateral dynamics and protein–lipid interactions in crowded membranes by the Martini model more realistic. However, this adjusted model does not lead to an improvement in the predicted dimer structures. This implicates that the poor agreement between the Martini model and NMR structures cannot be cured by simply uniformly reducing the interactions between all protein beads. Instead, a careful amino-acid specific adjustment of the protein–protein interactions is likely required."
https://openalex.org/W2767296751,"The metal abundance of the hot plasma that permeates galaxy clusters represents the accumulation of heavy elements produced by billions of supernovae. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy of the intracluster medium provides an opportunity to investigate the nature of supernova explosions integrated over cosmic time. In particular, the abundance of the iron-peak elements (chromium, manganese, iron and nickel) is key to understanding how the progenitors of typical type Ia supernovae evolve and explode. Recent X-ray studies of the intracluster medium found that the abundance ratios of these elements differ substantially from those seen in the Sun, suggesting differences between the nature of type Ia supernovae in the clusters and in the Milky Way. However, because the K-shell transition lines of chromium and manganese are weak and those of iron and nickel are very close in photon energy, high-resolution spectroscopy is required for an accurate determination of the abundances of these elements. Here we report observations of the Perseus cluster, with statistically significant detections of the resonance emission from chromium, manganese and nickel. Our measurements, combined with the latest atomic models, reveal that these elements have near-solar abundance ratios with respect to iron, in contrast to previous claims. Comparison between our results and modern nucleosynthesis calculations disfavours the hypothesis that type Ia supernova progenitors are exclusively white dwarfs with masses well below the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The observed abundance pattern of the iron-peak elements can be explained by taking into account a combination of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass type Ia supernova systems, adding to the mounting evidence that both progenitor types make a substantial contribution to cosmic chemical enrichment."

https://openalex.org/W2769640901,"Autophagy is a quality-control mechanism that helps to maintain cellular homeostasis by removing damaged proteins and organelles through lysosomal degradation. During autophagy, signaling events lead to the formation of a cup-shaped structure called the phagophore that matures into the autophagosome. Recruitment of the autophagy-associated Atg12-5-16L1 complex to Wipi2-positive phagophores is crucial for producing microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II), which is required for autophagosome formation. Here, we explored the role of the autophagy receptor optineurin (Optn) in autophagosome formation. Fibroblasts from Optn knock-out mouse showed reduced LC3-II formation and a lower number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes during both basal and starvation-induced autophagy. However, the number of Wipi2-positive phagophores was not decreased in Optn-deficient cells. We also found that the number of Atg12/16L1-positive puncta and recruitment of the Atg12-5-16L1 complex to Wipi2-positive puncta are reduced in Optn-deficient cells. Of note, Optn was recruited to Atg12-5-16L1–positive puncta, and interacted with Atg5 and also with Atg12-5 conjugate. A disease-associated Optn mutant, E478G, defective in ubiquitin binding, was also defective in autophagosome formation and recruitment to the Atg12-5-16L1–positive puncta. Moreover, we noted that Optn phosphorylation at Ser-177 was required for autophagosome formation but not for Optn recruitment to the phagophore. These results suggest that Optn potentiates LC3-II production and maturation of the phagophore into the autophagosome, by facilitating the recruitment of the Atg12-5-16L1 complex to Wipi2-positive phagophores."

However, the mechanism underlying the generation of the exosomal multivesicular endosome (MVE) is one of the mysteries in the field of endosome research. Although sphingolipid metabolites such as ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are known to play important roles in MVE formation and maturation, the detailed molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that Rho family GTPases, including Cdc42 and Rac1, are constitutively activated on exosomal MVEs and are regulated by S1P signaling as measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based conformational changes. Moreover, we detected S1P signaling-induced filamentous actin (F-actin) formation. A selective inhibitor of Gβγ subunits, M119, strongly inhibited both F-actin formation on MVEs and cargo sorting into exosomal intralumenal vesicles of MVEs, both of which were fully rescued by the simultaneous expression of constitutively active Cdc42 and Rac1. Our results shed light on the mechanism underlying exosomal MVE maturation and inform the understanding of the physiological relevance of continuous activation of the S1P receptor and subsequent downstream G protein signaling to Gβγ subunits/Rho family GTPases-regulated F-actin formation on MVEs for cargo sorting into exosomal intralumenal vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W2770626138,"Early detection of relapsed lymphoma improves response and survival. Current tools lack power for detection of early relapse, while being cumbersome and expensive. We searched for sensitive biomarkers that precede clinical relapse, and serve for further studies on therapy response and relapse. We recruited 20 healthy adults, 14 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and 11 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients at diagnosis. Using small-RNA sequencing we identified in DLBCL patients increased plasma levels of miR-124 and miR-532-5p, and decreased levels of miR-425, miR-141, miR-145, miR-197, miR-345, miR-424, miR-128 and miR-122. In the HL group, we identified miR-25, miR-30a/d, miR-26b, miR-182, miR-186, miR-140* and miR-125a to be up-regulated, while miR-23a, miR-122, miR-93 and miR-144 were down-regulated. Pathway analysis of potential mRNAs targets of these miRNA revealed in the DLBCL group potential up-regulation of STAT3, IL8, p13k/AKT and TGF-B signaling, and potential down-regulation of the PTEN and p53 pathways; while in the HL group we have found the cAMP-mediated pathway and p53 pathway to be potentially down-regulated. Survival analyses revealed that plasma levels of miR-20a/b, miR-93 and miR-106a/b were associated with higher mortality. In conclusion, we identified sets of dysregulated circulating miRNA that might serve as reliable biomarkers for relapsed lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2770966699,"Reliable recognition of pain is difficult in ferrets as many currently available parameters are non-specific, inconsistent and/or impractical. Grimace scales have successfully been applied to assess pain in different animal species and might also be applicable to ferrets. To compose a Ferret Grimace Scale (FGS), we studied the facial musculature of ferrets and compared lateral photographs of 19 ferret faces at six time points before and after intraperitoneal telemetry probe implantation. We identified the Action Units (AUs) orbital tightening, nose bulging, cheek bulging, ear changes and whisker retraction as potential indicators of pain in ferrets. To evaluate whether these AUs could reliably be used to identify photographs taken before and after surgery, the photographs were scored 0, 1 or 2 (not, moderately or obviously present) by 11 observers that were blinded to the treatment and timing of the photographs. All AU-scores assigned to the photographs taken five hours after surgery were significantly higher compared to their time-matched baseline scores. Further analysis using the weights that were obtained using a Linear Discriminant Analysis revealed that scoring orbital tightening alone was sufficient to make this distinction with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Including weighted scores for nose bulging, cheek bulging and ear change did not change this. As these AUs had more missing values than orbital tightening, their descriptions should be re-evaluated. Including whisker retraction, which had a negative weight, resulted in lower accuracy and should therefore in its current form be left out of the FGS. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the FGS and the AU orbital tightening in particular could be useful in a multifactorial pain assessment protocol for ferrets. However, before applying the FGS in practice, it should be further validated by incorporating more time points before and after applying (different) painful stimuli, and different levels of analgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2770895541,"Among therapeutic approaches for amyloid-related diseases, attention has recently turned to the use of natural products as effective anti-aggregation compounds. Although a wealth of in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates some common inhibitory activity of these compounds, they don’t generally suggest the same mechanism of action. Here, we show that taxifolin, a ubiquitous bioactive constituent of foods and herbs, inhibits formation of HEWL amyloid fibrils and their related toxicity by causing formation of very large globular, chain-like aggregates. A range of amyloid-specific techniques were employed to characterize this process. We found that taxifolin exerts its effect by binding to HEWL prefibrillar species, rather than by stabilizing the molecule in its native-like state. Furthermore, it’s binding results in diverting the amyloid pathway toward formation of very large globular, chain-like aggregates with low β-sheet content and reduced solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches. ThT fluorescence measurements show that the binding capacity of taxifolin is significantly reduced, upon generation of large protofibrillar aggregates at the end of growth phase. We believe these results may help design promising inhibitors of protein aggregation for amyloid-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2770776342,"This study is the first to comprehensively characterize m6A patterns in the Arabidopsis chloroplast and mitochondria transcriptomes based on our open accessible data deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus with GEO Series accession number of GSE72706. Over 86% of the transcripts were methylated by m6A in the two organelles. Over 550 and 350 m6A sites were mapped, with ~5.6 to ~5.8 and ~4.6 to ~4.9 m6A sites per transcript, to the chloroplast and mitochondria genome, respectively. The overall m6A methylation extent in the two organelles was greatly higher than that in the nucleus. The m6A motif sequences in the transcriptome of two organelles were similar to the nuclear motifs, suggesting that selection of the m6A motifs for RNA methylation was conserved between the nucleus and organelle transcriptomes. The m6A patterns of rRNAs and tRNAs in the organelle were similar to those in the nucleus. However, the m6A patterns in coding RNAs were distinct between the nucleus and the organelle, suggesting that that regulation of the m6A methylation patterns may be different between the nuclei and the organelles. The extensively methylated transcripts in the two organelles were mainly associated with rRNA, ribosomal proteins, photosystem reaction proteins, tRNA, NADH dehydrogenase and redox. On average, 64% and 79% of the transcripts in the two organelles showed differential m6A methylation across three organs of the leaves, flowers and roots. The m6A methylation extent in the chloroplast was higher than that in the mitochondria. This study provides deep insights into the m6A methylation topology and differentiation in the plant organelle transcriptomes."
https://openalex.org/W2768139241,"High-elevation cold deserts in Tibet and Himalaya are one of the most extreme environments. One consequence is that the diversity of macrofauna in this environment is often limited, and soil microorganisms have a more influential role in governing key surface and subsurface bioprocesses. High-elevation soil microfauna represent important components of cold ecosystems and dominant consumers of microbial communities. Still little is known about their diversity and distribution on the edge of their reproductive and metabolic abilities. In this study, we disentangle the impact of elevation and soil chemistry on diversity and distribution of rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades and their most frequent feeding strategies (microbial filter-feeders, bacterivores, fungivores, root-fungal feeders, omnivores) along two contrasting altitudinal gradients in Indian NW Himalaya (Zanskar transect from 3805 to 4714 m a.s.l.) and southwestern Tibet (Tso Moriri transect from 4477 to 6176 m a.s.l.), using a combination of multivariate analysis, variation partitioning and generalized additive models. Zanskar transect had higher precipitation, soil moisture, organic matter and available nutrients than dry Tso Moriri transect. In total, 40 species of nematodes, 19 rotifers and 1 tardigrade were discovered. Species richness and total abundance of rotifers and nematodes showed mid-elevation peaks in both investigated transects. The optimum for rotifers was found at higher elevation than for nematodes. Diversity and distribution of soil microfauna was best explained by soil nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter. More fertile soils hosted more diverse and abundant faunal communities. In Tso Moriri, bacterivores represented 60% of all nematodes, fungivores 35%, root-fungal feeders 1% and omnivores 3%. For Zanskar the respective proportions were 21%, 13%, 56% and 9%. Elevational optima of different feeding strategies occurred in Zanskar in one elevation zone (4400–4500 m), while in Tso Moriri each feeding strategy had their unique optima with fungivores at 5300 m (steppes), bacterivores at 5500 m (alpine grassland), filter-feeders at 5600 m and predators and omnivores above 5700 m (subnival zone). Our results shed light on the diversity of microfauna in the high-elevation cold deserts and disentangle the role of different ecological filters in structuring microfaunal communities in the rapidly-warming Himalayas."
https://openalex.org/W2768859499,"Digitized species occurrence data provide an unprecedented source of information for ecologists and conservationists. Species distribution model (SDM) has become a popular method to utilise these data for understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of species, and for modelling biodiversity patterns. Our objective is to study the impact of noise in species occurrence data (namely sample size and positional accuracy) on the performance and reliability of SDM, considering the multiplicative impact of SDM algorithms, species specialisation, and grid resolution. We created a set of four ‘virtual’ species characterized by different specialisation levels. For each of these species, we built the suitable habitat models using five algorithms at two grid resolutions, with varying sample sizes and different levels of positional accuracy. We assessed the performance and reliability of the SDM according to classic model evaluation metrics (Area Under the Curve and True Skill Statistic) and model agreement metrics (Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient and geographic niche overlap) respectively. Our study revealed that species specialisation had by far the most dominant impact on the SDM. In contrast to previous studies, we found that for widespread species, low sample size and low positional accuracy were acceptable, and useful distribution ranges could be predicted with as few as 10 species occurrences. Range predictions for narrow-ranged species, however, were sensitive to sample size and positional accuracy, such that useful distribution ranges required at least 20 species occurrences. Against expectations, the MAXENT algorithm poorly predicted the distribution of specialist species at low sample size."

We evaluated whether exercise also generates circulating signals that protect human and rodent β cells against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis. For this purpose, we obtained serum from humans or mice before and after an 8 wk training period. Exposure of human islets or mouse or rat β cells to human or rodent sera, respectively, obtained from trained individuals reduced cytokine (IL-1β+IFN-γ)- or chemical ER stressor-induced β-cell ER stress and apoptosis, at least in part via activation of the transcription factor STAT3. These findings indicate that exercise training improves human and rodent β-cell survival under diabetogenic conditions and support lifestyle interventions as a protective approach for both type 1 and 2 diabetes.-Paula, F.

https://openalex.org/W2768606076,"Callose is a plant-specific polysaccharide (β-1,3-glucan) playing an important role in angiosperms in many developmental processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Callose is synthesised at the plasma membrane of plant cells by callose synthase (CalS) and, among others, represents the main polysaccharide in the callose wall surrounding the tetrads of developing microspores and in the growing pollen tube wall. CalS proteins involvement in spore development is a plesiomorphic feature of terrestrial plants, but very little is known about their evolutionary origin and relationships amongst the members of this protein family. We performed thorough comparative analyses of callose synthase family proteins from major plant lineages to determine their evolutionary history across the plant kingdom. A total of 1211 candidate CalS sequences were identified and compared amongst diverse taxonomic groups of plants, from bryophytes to angiosperms. Phylogenetic analyses identified six main clades of CalS proteins and suggested duplications during the evolution of specialised functions. Twelve family members had previously been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. We focused on five CalS subfamilies directly linked to pollen function and found that proteins expressed in pollen evolved twice. CalS9/10 and CalS11/12 formed well-defined clades, whereas pollen-specific CalS5 was found within subfamilies that mostly did not express in mature pollen vegetative cell, although were found in sperm cells. Expression of five out of seven mature pollen-expressed CalS genes was affected by mutations in bzip transcription factors. Only three subfamilies, CalS5, CalS10, and CalS11, however, formed monophyletic, mostly conserved clades. The pairs CalS9/CalS10, CalS11/CalS12 and CalS3 may have diverged after angiosperms diversified from lycophytes and bryophytes. Our analysis of fully sequenced plant proteins identified new evolutionary lineages of callose synthase subfamilies and has established a basis for understanding their functional evolution in terrestrial plants."
https://openalex.org/W2769091965,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most commonly inherited neurologic disorder, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. One variant of CMT, 2F, is characterized by mutations in heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). As bioactive sphingolipids have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, we sought to determine if their dysregulation is involved in CMT. Here, we show that Hsp27 knockout mice demonstrated decreases in ceramide in peripheral nerve tissue and that the disease-associated Hsp27 S135F mutant demonstrated decreases in mitochondrial ceramide. Given that Hsp27 is a chaperone protein, we examined its role in regulating ceramide synthases (CerSs), an enzyme family responsible for catalyzing generation of the sphingolipid ceramide. We determined that CerSs colocalized with Hsp27, and upon the presence of S135F mutants, CerS1 lost its colocalization with mitochondria suggesting that decreased mitochondrial ceramides result from reduced mitochondrial CerS localization rather than decreased CerS activity. Mitochondria in mutant cells appeared larger with increased interconnectivity. Furthermore, mutant cell lines demonstrated decreased mitochondrial respiratory function and increased autophagic flux. Mitochondrial structural and functional changes were recapitulated by blocking ceramide generation pharmacologically. These results suggest that mutant Hsp27 decreases mitochondrial ceramide levels, producing structural and functional changes in mitochondria leading to neuronal degeneration.—Schwartz, N.

https://openalex.org/W2769852035,"Background Mental illness-related stigma is common, and is associated with poorer outcomes in people with mental illness. This study evaluated the attitudes of primary care nurses towards people with mental illness and its associated factors; and the effectiveness of a short video-based contact intervention (VBCI) in improving these attitudes using a Malay version of the 15-item Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Healthcare Providers (OMS-HC-15-M). Methods A 5-minute VBCI was developed comprising elements of psychoeducation and interviews of people with mental illness and the people they interact with, relating to experience of mental illness and recovery. A pre-post cross-sectional study was conducted on 206 randomly selected primary care nurses in Penang, Malaysia. The OMS-HC-15-M questionnaire was administered before and immediately after participants viewed the VBCI. The difference in mean pre-post VBCI scores using paired t-tests, effect size and standardised response mean (SRM) were obtained. Factors correlating to attitudes were obtained using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results Differences in pre-post VBCI score were statistically significant (p<0.001) with a 14% score reduction, a moderate effect size and SRM at 0.97 (0.85–0.11) and 1.1 (0.97–1.2) respectively. By factoring in the Minimal Detectable Change statistic of 7.76, the VBCI produced a significant improvement of attitudes in 30% of the participants. Factors associated with less stigmatising attitudes at baseline were previous psychiatry-related training, desiring psychiatric training, and positive contact with people with mental illness. Conclusions This is the first study in Malaysia to show that a brief VBCI is effective in improving attitudes of primary care nurses towards people with mental illness in the immediate term. Further studies are needed to determine if these results can be sustained in the longer term and generalizable to other health care professionals. Qualitative studies are warranted to provide insight to the factors correlating to these attitudes. (300 words)"
https://openalex.org/W2770790720,"Development projects in west Central Africa are proceeding at an unprecedented rate, often with little concern for their effects on biodiversity. In an attempt to better understand potential impacts of a road development project on the anuran amphibian community, we conducted a biodiversity assessment employing multiple methodologies (visual encounter transects, auditory surveys, leaf litter plots and pitfall traps) to inventory species prior to construction of a new road within the buffer zone of Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. Because of difficulties in morphological identification and taxonomic uncertainty of amphibian species observed in the area, we integrated a DNA barcoding analysis into the project to improve the overall quality and accuracy of the species inventory. Based on morphology alone, 48 species were recognized in the field and voucher specimens of each were collected. We used tissue samples from specimens collected at our field site, material available from amphibians collected in other parts of Gabon and the Republic of Congo to initiate a DNA barcode library for west Central African amphibians. We then compared our sequences with material in GenBank for the genera recorded at the study site to assist in identifications. The resulting COI and 16S barcode library allowed us to update the number of species documented at the study site to 28, thereby providing a more accurate assessment of diversity and distributions. We caution that because sequence data maintained in GenBank are often poorly curated by the original submitters and cannot be amended by third-parties, these data have limited utility for identification purposes. Nevertheless, the use of DNA barcoding is likely to benefit biodiversity inventories and long-term monitoring, particularly for taxa that can be difficult to identify based on morphology alone; likewise, inventory and monitoring programs can contribute invaluable data to the DNA barcode library and the taxonomy of complex groups. Our methods provide an example of how non-taxonomists and parataxonomists working in understudied parts of the world with limited geographic sampling and comparative morphological material can use DNA barcoding and publicly available sequence data (GenBank) to rapidly identify the number of species and assign tentative names to aid in urgent conservation management actions and contribute to taxonomic resolution."

Results showed that child sex, maternal mental health, socio-economic status (family income, maternal education, neighbourhood disadvantage), maternal hostility, and child temperament (persistence, sociability, reactivity) are all independent contributors to child mental health at age 4. These effects largely persist over time, with the effects of maternal mental health increasing slightly over time. Persistence of these effects suggests the need for early intervention and supports. The independent contribution of these factors to child mental health suggests that multi-faceted approaches to child and maternal mental health are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2768800416,"Objectives To assess potential risk factors for vertigo and dizziness in adolescents and to evaluate their variability by different vertigo types. The role of possible risk factors for vertigo and dizziness in adolescents and their population relevance needs to be addressed in order to design preventive strategies. Study design The study population consisted of 1482 school-children between the age of 12 and 19 years, who were instructed to fill out a questionnaire on different vertigo types and related potential risk factors. The questionnaire specifically asked for any vertigo, spinning vertigo, swaying vertigo, orthostatic dizziness, and unspecified dizziness. Further a wide range of potential risk factors were addressed including gender, stress, muscular pain in the neck and shoulder region, sleep duration, migraine, coffee and alcohol consumption, physical activity and smoking. Results Gender, stress, muscular pain in the neck and shoulder region, sleep duration and migraine were identified as independent risk factors following mutual adjustment: The relative risk was 1.17 [1.10–1.25] for female sex, 1.07 [1.02–1.13] for stress, 1.24 [1.17–1.32] for muscular pain, and 1.09 [1.03–1.14] for migraine. The population attributable risk explained by these risk factors was 26%, with muscular pain, stress, and migraine accounting for 11%, 4%, and 3% respectively. Conclusion Several established risk factors in adults were also identified in adolescents. Risk factors amenable to prevention accounted for 17% of the total population risk. Therefore, interventions targeting these risk factors may be warranted."

The landmark discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells has provided a promising in vitro system for modeling hereditary cardiac arrhythmias as well as drug development and toxicity testing. Nowadays, nutraceuticals are frequently used as supplements for cardiovascular therapy. Here we studied the cardiac effects of hawthorn ( Crataegus pentagyna) leaf extract using cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from healthy human embryonic stem cells, long QT syndrome type 2 (LQTS2), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia type 1 (CPVT1) patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The hydroalcoholic extract resulted in a dose-dependent negative chronotropic effect in all CM preparations leading to a significant reduction at 1000 µg/ml. This was accompanied by prolongation of field potential durations, although with different magnitudes in CMs from different human embryonic stem cell and iPSC lines. Hawthorn further prolonged field potential durations in LQTS2 CMs but reduced the beating frequencies and occurrence of immature field potentials triggered by β1-adrenergic stimulation in CPVT1 CMs at 300 and 1000 µg/ml. Furthermore, isoquercetin and vitexin flavonoids significantly slowed down isoproterenol (5 µM)-induced beating frequencies at 3 and 10 µg/ml. Therefore, C. pentagyna leaf extract and its isoquercetin and vitexin flavonoids may be introduced as a novel nutraceutical with antiarrhythmic potential for CPVT1 patients.-Pahlavan, S., Tousi, M.

https://openalex.org/W2770632705,"Sweet potato production is constrained by Fusarium wilt, which is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. batatas (Fob). The identification of genes related to disease resistance and the underlying mechanisms will contribute to improving disease resistance via sweet potato breeding programs. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling of sweet potato challenged with Fob using Illumina HiSeq technology. In total, 89,944,188 clean reads were generated from 12 samples and assembled into 101,988 unigenes with an average length of 666 bp; of these unigenes, 62,605 (61.38%) were functionally annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database by BLASTX with a cutoff E-value of 10-5. Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations were examined to explore the unigenes' functions. We constructed four DGE libraries for the sweet potato cultivars JinShan57 (JS57, highly resistant) and XinZhongHua (XZH, highly susceptible), which were challenged with pathogenic Fob. Genes that were differentially expressed in the four libraries were identified by comparing the transcriptomes. Various genes that were differentially expressed during defense, including chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), WRKY, NAC, MYB, and ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF), as well as resistance genes, pathogenesis-related genes, and genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways, were identified. These data represent a sequence resource for genetic and genomic studies of sweet potato that will enhance the understanding of the mechanism of disease resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2605539036,"Hypofrontality is a state of decreased cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex during executive function performance; it is commonly observed in patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction, as well as the psychological symptoms of schizophrenia, influences the ability of patients to reintegrate into society. The current study investigated the effects of an interactive sports video game (IVG; Nintendo Wii™ Sports Resort) on frontal lobe function of patients with schizophrenia. A sample of eight patients (6 male and 2 female; mean age = 46.7 years, standard deviation (SD) = 13.7) engaged in an IVG every week for 3 months in a controlled, single-blind, crossover study. Before and after the intervention we examined frontal lobe blood-flow volume using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and assessed functional changes using the Frontal Assessment Battery, Health-Related Quality of Life scale, and behaviorally-assessed physical function tests. fNIRS revealed that prefrontal activity during IVG performance significantly increased in the IVG period compared with the control period. Furthermore, significant correlations between cerebral blood flow changes in different channels were observed during IVG performance. In addition, we observed intervention-related improvement in health-related quality of life following IVG. IVG intervention was associated with increased prefrontal cortex activation and improved health-related quality of life performance in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with chronic schizophrenia are characterized by withdrawal and a lack of social responsiveness or interest in others. Interventions using IVG may provide a useful low-cost rehabilitation method for such patients, without the need for specialized equipment."

The sample included 117 middle-school students (45.3% girls; mean age = 12.4 years) who filled in a peer nomination questionnaire and individually performed a computerized emotion recognition task. Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models showed a complex picture, in which type and intensity of emotions, students’ behavior and gender interacted in explaining recognition accuracy. Results were discussed with a particular focus on negative emotions and suggesting a “neutral” nature of emotion recognition ability, which does not necessarily lead to moral behavior but can also be used for pursuing immoral goals."

The PHS resistance variation and haplotype polymorphism of the wheatgrass ThVp-1 and wheat TaVp-1B genes orthologues of Vp-1 was revealed in the studied collection. Four haplotypes of ThVp-1 were revealed: ThVp-1a (41% of the entries), ThVp-1b (13%), ThVp-1c (29%), and ThVp-1d (15%). The association between the allelic state of ThVp-1 and PHS resistance in the wheat-wheatgrass hybrids was shown: haplotype ThVp-1d of the wheatgrass Vp-1 gene is significantly associated with reduced PHS in the wheat-wheatgrass hybrids (mean SS 0.33, mean GI 0.64). The resistant entries may be perspective as a source of PHS resistance in the development of commercial cultivars of perennial wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2769873230,"ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels uniquely link cellular energy metabolism to membrane excitability and are exρressed in diverse cell tyρes that range from the endocrine pancreas to neurons and smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle. A decrease in the surface exρression of KATP channels has been linked to various disorders, including dysregulated insulin secretion, abnormal blood pressure, and impaired resistance to cardiac injury. In contrast, up-regulation of KATP channel surface expression may be protective, for example, by mediating the beneficial effect of ischemic preconditioning. Molecular mechanisms that regulate KATP channel trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we used cellular assays with immunofluorescence, surface biotinylation, and ρatch clamping to demonstrate that Eps15 homology domain-containing protein 2 (EHD2) is a novel positive regulator of KATP channel trafficking to increase surface KATP channel density. EHD2 had no effect on cardiac Na+ channels (Nav1.5). The effect is specific to EHD2 as other members of the EHD family—EHD1, EHD3, and EHD4—had no effect on KATP channel surface expression. EHD2 did not directly affect KATP channel properties as unitary conductance and ATP sensitivity were unchanged. Instead, we observed that the mechanism by which EHD2 increases surface expression is by stabilizing KATP channel-containing caveolar structures, which results in a reduced rate of endocytosis. EHD2 also regulated KATP channel trafficking in isolated cardiomyocytes, which validated the physiologic relevance of these observations. Pathophysiologically, EHD2 may be car- dioprotective as a dominant-negative EHD2 mutant sensitized cardiomyocytes to ischemic damage. Our find- ings highlight EHD2 as a potential pharmacologic target in the treatment of diseases with KATP channel trafficking defects.—Yang, H. Q., Jana, K., Rindler, M. J., Coetzee, W. A.

https://openalex.org/W2768520066,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a chronic disease with an incidence increasing steeply by age and affecting more than 11 million patients in Europe and the United States. Diagnosing AF is essential for the prevention of stroke by oral anticoagulation. Opportunistic screening for AF in patients ≥65 years of age is recommended by the European and Danish Societies of Cardiology. The study aim was to examine the detection rate of AF in consecutively screened patients in the primary care setting in Denmark. In an open, non-interventional, cluster, multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study patients ≥65 years of age entering consecutively into general practice clinics were invited to nurse-assisted opportunistic screening for AF. The General Practice (GP) clinics participating were randomized to patient inclusion in three age groups: 65-74, 75-84, and ≥85 years respectively. All patients underwent pulse palpation followed by 12-led electrocardiogram in case of irregular pulse. Two cardiologists validated all electrocardiogram examinations. Forty-nine general practice clinics recruited in total 970 patients split into three age groups; 480 patients (65-74 years), 372 (75-84 years), and 118 patients ≥85 years of age. Co-morbidities increased by age with hypertension being most frequent. Eighty-seven patients (9%) were detected with an irregular pulse, representing 4.4%, 10.5% and 22.9%, respectively in the three age groups. Assessment of electrocardiograms by the GP showed suspicion of AF in 13 patients with final verification of electrocardiograms by cardiologists revealing 10 AF-patients. The highest detection rate of AF was found in the ≥85 age group (3.39%) followed by the 65-74 age group (0.83%) and the 75-84 age group (0.54%). Opportunistic screening of AF in primary care is feasible and do result in the detection of new AF-patients. Close collaboration with cardiologists is advisable to avoid false positive screening results."
https://openalex.org/W2768753969,"Objective Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by an increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). Chemotherapy of MPNST is still insufficient. In this study, we investigated whether human tumor Schwann cells derived from NF1 associated MPNST respond to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We analyzed effects of ATRA and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) combination therapy. Methods MPNST cell lines S462, T265, NSF1 were treated with ATRA and MEKi U0126 and PD0325901. We assessed cell viability, proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation as well as mRNA expression of RAR and RXR subtypes and ATRA target genes such as CRABP2, CYP26A1, RARB and PDK1. We also analyzed CRABP2 methylation in cell lines and performed immunohistochemistry of human MPNST specimens. Results ATRA therapy reduced viability and proliferation in S462 and T265 cells, accompanied by differentiation, apoptosis and reduced migration. NSF1 cells which lacked RXRG expression did not respond to ATRA. We furthermore demonstrated that ATRA signaling was functional for common targets, and that mRNA expression of CRABP2 and its targets was raised by ATRA therapy, whereas alternative pathways via FABP5 were not induced. Finally, combination of ATRA and MEKi demonstrated additively reduced viability of T265 and S462 cells. Conclusions We observed therapeutic effects in two of three MPNST cell lines pronounced by combination therapy. These data point to a potentially successful treatment of MPNST by combined application of ATRA and MEK inhibitors such as U0126 or PD0325901."
https://openalex.org/W2770652065,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are important gene delivery tools for the treatment of many recessively inherited retinal diseases. For example, a wild-type (WT) AAV5 vector can deliver a full-length Cnga3 (cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha-3) cDNA to target cells of the cone photoreceptor function loss 5 (cpfl5) mouse, a spontaneous animal model of achromatopsia with a Cnga3 mutation. Gene therapy restores cone-mediated function and blocks cone degeneration in the mice. However, since transgene expression delivered by an AAV vector shows relatively short-term effectiveness, this cannot be regarded as a very successful therapy. AAV2 and AAV8 vectors with capsid mutations have significantly enhanced transduction efficiency in retinas compared to WT AAV controls. In this study, AAV8 (Y447, 733F+T494V)-treated cpfl5 retinas showed greater preservation of short-term cone electroretinogram (ERG) responses than AAV8 (Y447, 733F)- or AAV2 (Y272, 444, 500, 730F+T491V)-mediated treatments. To explore the long-term rescue effect, AAV8 (Y447, 733F+T494V)-treated cpfl5 retinas were evaluated at 9 months following postnatal day 14 (P14) treatment. Rescued ERG responses in the cones of treated cpfl5 eyes decreased with increasing age, but still maintained more than 60% of the WT mouse responses at the oldest time point examined. Expression of CNGA3 and M/S-opsins was maintained in cone outer segments of the treated cpfl5 eyes and was equal to expression in age-matched WT retinas. Near-normal cone-mediated water maze behavior was observed in the treated cpfl5 mice. As these are the longest follow-up data reported thus far, AAV8 with capsid Y-F and T-V mutations may be one of the most effective AAV vectors for long-term treatment in a naturally occurring mouse model of CNGA3 achromatopsia."
https://openalex.org/W2768428682,"Diabetes affects large and small vessels through mechanisms only partially known. In the present study, we evaluated the function of capillaries and large arteries in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to study the effect of chronic hyperglycemia in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors. Twenty-five subjects with T1DM and 12 healthy age-matched controls were enrolled. Nine patients had mild or moderate retinopathy. Contrast enhanced ultrasound was used to measure perfusion of the deep forearm flexor muscle of the non-dominant arm at rest (baseline) and after an ischemic stimulus (reactive hyperemia). Perfusion was expressed as Video Intensity (VI) in arbitrary unit (a.u.)/mm2. The time to reach peak VI after ischemia was also recorded. The function of large arteries was evaluated using flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). VI was significantly lower in T1DM compared to control subjects both at baseline (0.22±0.16 vs 0.44±0.35 a.u./mm2, p<0.05), and after ischemia (0.33±0.24 vs 0.68±0.46 a.u./mm2, p<0.05). The time to reach peak VI after ischemia was markedly longer in T1DM (5.6±2.2 vs 4.0±1.7 seconds, p<0.02). These differences were more marked in T1DM subjects with retinopathy. FMD was lower in TIDM patients compared to controls (5.4±6.4 vs 10.7±4.5%, p<0.01). The present findings demonstrate that T1DM patients have defective peripheral skeletal muscle perfusion both at rest and after ischemia compared with control subjects. Low muscle perfusion associates with low FMD of the brachial artery. Furthermore, T1DM subjects with retinopathy have the least muscle perfusion and blunted response to hyperemia compared to T1DM without retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2770794909,"Background and purpose Aneurysms in various arterial beds have common risk- and genetic factors. Data on the correlation of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAA) with aneurysms in other vascular territories are lacking. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of ECAA in patients with an intracranial aneurysm (IA). Methods We used prospectively collected databases of consecutive patients registered at the University Medical Center Utrecht with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) or aneurysmal Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The medical files of patients included in both databases were screened for availability of radiological reports, imaging of the brain and of the cervical carotid arteries. All available radiological images were then reviewed primarily for the presence of an ECAA and secondarily for an extradural/cavernous carotid or vertebral artery aneurysm. An ECAA was defined as a fusiform dilation ≥150% of the normal internal or common carotid artery or a saccular distention of any size. Results We screened 4465 patient records (SAH database n = 3416, UIA database n = 1049), of which 2931 had radiological images of the carotid arteries available. An ECAA was identified in 12/638 patients (1.9%; 95% CI 1.1–3.3) with completely imaged carotid arteries and in 15/2293 patients (0.7%; 95% CI 0.4–1.1) with partially depicted carotid arteries. Seven out of 27 patients had an additional extradural (cavernous or vertebral artery) aneurysm. Conclusions This comprehensive study suggests a prevalence for ECAA of approximately 2% of patients with an IA. The rarity of the disease makes screening unnecessary so far. Future registry studies should study the factors associated with IA and ECAA to estimate the prevalence of ECAA in these young patients more accurately."
https://openalex.org/W2768442592,"In trypanosomatids, the kinetoplast is the portion of the single mitochondrion that is connected to the basal body and contains the kDNA, a network composed by circular and interlocked DNA. The kDNA packing is conducted by Kinetoplast Associated Proteins (KAPs), which are similar to eukaryotic histone H1. In symbiont-harboring trypanosomatids (SHTs) such as Angomonas deanei and Strigomonas culicis, a ß-proteobacterium co-evolves with the host in a mutualistic relationship. The prokaryote confers nutritional benefits to the host and affects its cell structure. Atomic force microscopy showed that the topology of isolated kDNA networks is quite similar in the two SHT species. Ultrastructural analysis using high-resolution microscopy techniques revealed that the DNA fibrils are more compact in the kinetoplast region that faces the basal body and that the presence of the symbiotic bacterium does not interfere with kDNA topology. However, RT-PCR data revealed differences in the expression of KAPs in wild-type protozoa as compared to aposymbiotic cells. Immunolocalization showed that different KAPs present distinct distributions that are coincident in symbiont-bearing and in symbiont-free cells. Although KAP4 and KAP7 are shared by all trypanosomatid species, the expanded repertoire of KAPs in SHTs can be used as phylogenetic markers to distinguish different genera."

Crossostephium chinensis (Linnaeus) Makino is often cultivated along the southeast coast of China for its desirable ornamental qualities and high salt tolerance. However, little is known about the genomic background of the salt tolerance mechanism in C. chinensis. In the present study, we used Illumina paired-end sequencing to systematically investigate leaf transcriptomes derived from C. chinensis seedlings grown under normal conditions and under salt stress. A total of 105,473,004 bp of reads were assembled into 163,046 unigenes, of which 65,839 (40.38% of the total) and 54,342 (33.32% of the total) were aligned in Swiss-Prot and Nr protein, respectively. A total of 11,331 (6.95%) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among three comparisons, including 2,239 in ‘ST3 vs ST0’, 5,880 in ‘ST9 vs ST3’ and 9,718 in ‘ST9 vs ST0’, and they were generally classified into 26 Gene Ontology terms and 58 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway terms. Many genes encoding important transcription factors (e.g., WRKY, MYB, and AP2/EREBP) and proteins involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, amino acid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interactions and carbohydrate metabolism, among others, were substantially up-regulated under salt stress. These genes represent important candidates for studying the salt-response mechanism and molecular biology of C. chinensis and its relatives. Our findings provide a genomic sequence resource for functional genetic assignments in C. chinensis. These transcriptome datasets will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for salt-stress tolerance in C. chinensis and facilitate the breeding of new stress-tolerant cultivars for high-saline areas using this valuable genetic resource."
https://openalex.org/W2770403474,"We examined Sarcocystis spp. in giant snakes from the Indo-Australian Archipelago and Australia using a combination of morphological (size of sporocyst) and molecular analyses. We amplified by PCR nuclear 18S rDNA from single sporocysts in order to detect mixed infections and unequivocally assign the retrieved sequences to the corresponding parasite stage. Sarcocystis infection was generally high across the study area, with 78 (68%) of 115 examined pythons being infected by one or more Sarcocystis spp. Among 18 randomly chosen, sporocyst-positive samples (11 from Southeast Asia, 7 from Northern Australia) the only Sarcocystis species detected in Southeast Asian snakes was S. singaporensis (in reticulated pythons), which was absent from all Australian samples. We distinguished three different Sarcocystis spp. in the Australian sample set; two were excreted by scrub pythons and one by the spotted python. The sequence of the latter is an undescribed species phylogenetically related to S. lacertae. Of the two Sarcocystis species found in scrub pythons, one showed an 18S rRNA gene sequence similar to S. zamani, which is described from Australia for the first time. The second sequence was identical/similar to that of S. nesbitti, a known human pathogen that was held responsible for outbreaks of disease among tourists in Malaysia. The potential presence of S. nesbitti in Australia challenges the current hypothesis of a snake-primate life cycle, and would have implications for human health in the region. Further molecular and biological characterizations are required to confirm species identity and determine whether or not the Australian isolate has the same zoonotic potential as its Malaysian counterpart. Finally, the absence of S. nesbitti in samples from reticulated pythons (which were reported to be definitive hosts), coupled with our phylogenetic analyses, suggest that alternative snake hosts may be responsible for transmitting this parasite in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W2768283794,"Patients suffering from Refsum's disease show mutations in the enzyme necessary for the degradation of phytanic acid. Accumulation of this tetramethyl-branched fatty acid in inner organs leads to severe neurological and cardiac dysfunctions which can even result in death. Thus, patients with Refsum's disease have to follow a specific diet resigning foods with high levels of phytanic acid and trans-phytol like products from ruminant animals with a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ≤ 10 mg/d. We recently reported the occurrence of phytyl fatty acid esters (PFAE, trans-phytol esterified with a fatty acid) in bell pepper with trans-phytol amounts of up to 5.4 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW). In this study we carried out in vitro-digestion experiments of PFAE with artificial digestion fluids. Our results demonstrate that PFAE actually are a source for bioavailable trans-phytol and thus add to the TDI. Eating only one portion of bell pepper (∼150 g) could therefore lead to exploitation of the TDI of up to 81%. Analysis of additional vegetable matrices showed that also rocket salad with up to 4.2 mg/100 g FW trans-phytol bound in PFAE represents a risk-relevant food for patients with Refsum's disease and should therefore be taken into account."

We enrolled 15,876 South Korean participants (4,010 postmenopausal females, 4,836 premenopausal females, and 7,016 males, all aged 20 years or older). BMD was measured using dual-energy radiography absorptiometry at the femoral neck (NK), lumbar spine (LSP), and total femur (TFM). Mental health status data were obtained from a self-report questionnaire that assessed psychological stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation. Psychological stress was negatively correlated with BMD in the LSP, NK, and TFM for the male group. Depressed mood was associated with lower BMD in the LSP, NK and TFM for the premenopausal female group, and in the LSP for the male group. Suicidal ideation was associated with lower BMD in the NK and TFM for the male group. Mental health problems were associated with lower BMD, especially in premenopausal females and males. Future investigations should focus on the shared pathophysiology between mental health problems and BMD, and the interrelationship between increased BMD and recovery from mental health problems."
https://openalex.org/W2768830691,"In this article, we propose a new data mining algorithm, by which one can both capture the non-linearity in data and also find the best subset model. To produce an enhanced subset of the original variables, a preferred selection method should have the potential of adding a supplementary level of regression analysis that would capture complex relationships in the data via mathematical transformation of the predictors and exploration of synergistic effects of combined variables. The method that we present here has the potential to produce an optimal subset of variables, rendering the overall process of model selection more efficient. This algorithm introduces interpretable parameters by transforming the original inputs and also a faithful fit to the data. The core objective of this paper is to introduce a new estimation technique for the classical least square regression framework. This new automatic variable transformation and model selection method could offer an optimal and stable model that minimizes the mean square error and variability, while combining all possible subset selection methodology with the inclusion variable transformations and interactions. Moreover, this method controls multicollinearity, leading to an optimal set of explanatory variables."

Thus, we sought to determine the genetic diversity of PspA to explore its potential as a vaccine candidate. Among the 190 invasive pneumococcal isolates collected from Korean children between 1991 and 2016, two (1.1%) isolates were found to have no pspA by multiple polymerase chain reactions. The full length pspA genes from 185 pneumococcal isolates were sequenced. The length of pspA varied, ranging from 1,719 to 2,301 base pairs with 55.7–100% nucleotide identity. Based on the sequences of the clade-defining regions, 68.7% and 49.7% were in PspA family 2 and clade 3/family 2, respectively. PspA clade types were correlated with genotypes using multilocus sequence typing and divided into several subclades based on diversity analysis of the N-terminal α-helical regions, which showed nucleotide sequence identities of 45.7–100% and amino acid sequence identities of 23.1–100%. Putative antigenicity plots were also diverse among individual clades and subclades. The differences in antigenicity patterns were concentrated within the N-terminal 120 amino acids. In conclusion, the N-terminal α-helical domain, which is known to be the major immunogenic portion of PspA, is genetically variable and should be further evaluated for antigenic differences and cross-reactivity between various PspA types from pneumococcal isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2768663948,"There is debate about the current population trends and predicted short-term fates of the endangered forest birds, Hawai`i Creeper (Loxops mana) and Hawai`i `Ākepa (L. coccineus). Using long-term population size estimates, some studies report forest bird populations as stable or increasing, while other studies report signs of population decline or impending extinction associated with introduced Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) increase. Reliable predictors of impending population collapse, well before the collapse begins, have been reported in simulations and microcosm experiments. In these studies, statistical indicators of critical slowing down, a phenomenon characterized by longer recovery rates after population size perturbation, are reported to be early warning signals of an impending regime shift observable prior to the tipping point. While the conservation applications of these metrics are commonly discussed, early warning signal detection methods are rarely applied to population size data from natural populations, so their efficacy and utility in species management remain unclear. We evaluated two time series of state-space abundance estimates (1987-2012) from Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawai`i to test for evidence of early warning signals of impending population collapse for the Hawai`i Creeper and Hawai`i `Ākepa. We looked for signals throughout the time series, and prior to 2000, when white-eye abundance began increasing. We found no evidence for either species of increasing variance, autocorrelation, or skewness, which are commonly reported early warning signals. We calculated linear rather than ordinary skewness because the latter is biased, particularly for small sample sizes. Furthermore, we identified break-points in trends over time for both endangered species, indicating shifts in slopes away from strongly increasing trends, but they were only weakly supported by Bayesian change-point analyses (i.e., no step-wise changes in abundance). The break-point and change-point test results, in addition to the early warning signal analyses, support that the two populations do not appear to show signs of critical slowing down or decline."

Methods A lifetime Markov model (1-month cycle) was developed to estimate the cost per quality adjusted life years (QALY) for a 1- and 3-year delay in starting cART (as compared to starting immediately at linkage to care) lifetime costs, clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Patients were categorized into having asymptomatic HIV, AIDS, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, and non-AIDS defining condition. Mortality rates and utility values were obtained from published literature. The number of new infected persons was estimated on the basis of sexual orientation, the number of sexual partners per year, the number of sex acts per month, frequency of condom use and use of cART. For the input Test and Keep in Care (TAK) project cohort data were used. Costs of care, cART and potential life-years lost were based on estimated total costs and the difference in expected QALY gained between an HIV-positive and an average person in Polish population. Costs were based on real expenditures of the Ministry of Health, National Health Fund, available studies and experts’ opinion. Costs and effects were discounted at rates of 5% and 3.5%, respectively. Results Input data were available for 141 patients form TAK cohort. The estimated number of new HIV infections in low, medium and high risk transmission groups were 0.28, 0.61, 2.07 with 1 and 0.82, 1.80, 6.11 with a 3-year delay, respectively. This reflected QALY loss due to cART delay of 0.52, 1.13, 3.84 and 2.02, 4.43, 15.03 for a 1- and 3-year delay, respectively. If additional costs of treatment and potential life-years lost due to new HIV infections were not taken into account, initiating cART immediately at linkage to care was not cost-saving irrespective of cART delay. Otherwise, when additional costs and QALY lost due to new HIV infections were included, immediate cART initiation was cost-saving regardless of the chosen scenarios. Conclusions If new HIV infections are not taken into account, then starting cART immediately does not dominate comparing to delaying cART. When taking into account HIV transmission in cost–effectiveness analysis, immediate initiation of HIV treatment is a profitable decision from the public payer’s perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2770686414,"Background Continuous infusion of doxorubicin has been a strategy to reduce cardiotoxicity. Epirubicin is another anthracycline in common clinical use. However, evidence is lacking regarding whether this strategy can reduce cardiotoxicity of epirubicin without compromising antineoplastic efficacy. Design and methods Healthy rats were randomized into groups: epirubicin (8 mg/kg) delivered intraperitoneally via micro osmotic pumps (MOP), epirubicin (8 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) bolus injection, and placebo control. Blood samples were collected for analyzing biomarkers of myocardial injury and pharmacokinetics. At chosen times, sub-groups of animals were sacrificed for histopathology. A mouse breast cancer cell line (4T1), stably transfected with luciferase, was orthotopically allografted in female mice, and treated in three groups as described above for the rats. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor size as well as bioluminescence. Results Delivery by IP bolus and by MOP achieved essentially the same area under the curve of epirubicin plasma concentration time profile. Blood biomarkers showed that the degree of myocardial injury in MOP group was lower than that of IP group. Histopathology showed that there was less eosinophilic enhancement, interstitial hemorrhage and necrotizing muscle atrophy in MOP group than IP group. In the orthotopic breast cancer allograft mouse model, the antineoplastic effect of epirubicin by MOP was not different from that by IP as measured by tumor weights or by in vivo bioluminescence. Conclusion Slow delivery of epirubicin by MOP reduced cardiotoxicity without compromising the antineoplastic effect compared to IP bolus delivery. These in vivo data support our previous clinical data that continuous intravenous infusion of epirubicin using micro infusion pumps over 48–96 hours had less cardiotoxicity than intravenous bolus injections. However, whether multiple doses of epirubicin given by MOP result in a lower magnitude of long term cardiomyopathy remains to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2769848628,"18Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake in the artery wall correlates with active inflammation. However, in part due to the low spatial resolution of PET, variation in the apparent arterial wall signal may be influenced by variation in blood FDG activity that cannot be fully corrected for using typical normalization strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the current common methods to normalize for blood activity and to investigate alternative methods for more accurate quantification of vascular inflammation.The relationship between maximum FDG aorta wall activity and mean blood activity was evaluated in 37 prospectively enrolled subjects aged 55 years or more, treated for hyperlipidemia. Target maximum aorta standardized uptake value (SUV) and mean background reference tissue activity (blood, spleen, liver) were recorded. Target-to-background ratios (TBR) and arterial maximum activity minus blood activity were calculated. Multivariable regression was conducted, predicting uptake values based on variation in background reference and target tissue FDG uptake; adjusting for gender, age, lean body mass (LBM), blood glucose, blood pool activity, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), where appropriate.Blood pool activity was positively associated with maximum artery wall SUV (β = 5.61, P<0.0001) as well as mean liver (β = 6.23, P<0.0001) and spleen SUV (β = 5.20, P<0.0001). Artery wall activity divided by blood activity (TBRBlood) or subtraction of blood activity did not remove the statistically significant relationship to blood activity. Blood pool activity was not related to TBRliver and TBRspleen (β = -0.36, P = NS and β = -0.58, P = NS, respectively).In otherwise healthy individuals treated for hyperlipidemia, blood FDG activity is associated with artery wall activity. However, variation in blood activity may mask artery wall signal reflective of inflammation, which requires normalization. Blood-based TBR and subtraction do not sufficiently adjust for blood activity. Warranting further investigation, background reference tissues with cellular uptake such as the liver and spleen may better adjust for variation in blood activity to improve assessment of vascular activity."
https://openalex.org/W2769305929,"Background It is unclear whether common genetic variants of the RET proto-oncogene contribute to disease susceptibility, clinical severity, and thyroid function in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Methods A total of 300 DTC patients and 252 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Seven RET tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using the KASPar platform. Results Subgroup analysis showed that concomitant thyroid benign diseases were less likely to occur in DTC subjects with the rs1799939 AG or AG plus AA genotypes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.93 and 1.88, P = 0.009 and 0.011, respectively). A rare haplotype, CGGATAA, was associated statistically with a reduced risk of DTC (OR = 0.18, P = 0.001). Concerning the aggressive features of DTC, higher level of N stage was more likely to occur in subjects carrying the wild-type genotypes at rs1800860 site (for dominant model: OR = 0.48, P = 0.008). Another rare haplotype, CAAGCGT, conferred increased risk for the occurrence of distant metastasis (OR = 7.57, P = 0.009). Notably, higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels and lower parathyroid hormone levels were found in patients with rs2075912, rs2565200, and rs2742240 heterozygotes and rare homozygotes; similar results were observed between PTH levels and rs1800858. Conclusion This study provided useful information on RET variants that should be subjected to further study."
https://openalex.org/W2770114044,"To improve the traditional smart home system, its electric wiring, networking technology, information transmission and facility control are studied. In this paper, we study the electric wiring, networking technology, information transmission and facility control to improve the traditional smart home system. First, ZigBee is used to replace the traditional electric wiring. Second, a network is built to connect lots of wireless sensors and facilities, thanks to the capability of ZigBee self-organized network and Genetic Algorithm-Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (GA-PSOA) to search for the optimal route. Finally, when the smart home system is connected to the internet based on the remote server technology, home environment and facilities could be remote real-time controlled. The experiments show that the GA-PSOA reduce the system delay and decrease the energy consumption of the wireless system."
https://openalex.org/W2768162895,"Biomass reconstructions to pre-assessment periods for commercially important and exploitable fish species are important tools for understanding long-term processes and fluctuation on stock and ecosystem level. For some stocks only fisheries statistics and fishery dependent data are available, for periods before surveys were conducted. The methods for the backward extension of the analytical assessment of biomass for years for which only total catch volumes are available were developed and tested in this paper. Two of the approaches developed apply the concept of the surplus production rate (SPR), which is shown to be stock density dependent if stock dynamics is governed by classical stock-production models. The other approach used a modified form of the Schaefer production model that allows for backward biomass estimation. The performance of the methods was tested on the Arctic cod and North Sea herring stocks, for which analytical biomass estimates extend back to the late 1940s. Next, the methods were applied to extend biomass estimates of the North-east Atlantic mackerel from the 1970s (analytical biomass estimates available) to the 1950s, for which only total catch volumes were available. For comparison with other methods which employs a constant SPR estimated as an average of the observed values, was also applied. The analyses showed that the performance of the methods is stock and data specific; the methods that work well for one stock may fail for the others. The constant SPR method is not recommended in those cases when the SPR is relatively high and the catch volumes in the reconstructed period are low."
https://openalex.org/W2769142837,"Approaches used to early and accurately characterize epidemiologic patterns of disease incidence in a temporal and spatial series are becoming increasingly important. Cluster tests are generally designed for retrospective detection of epidemiologic anomalies in a temporal or space-time series. Timely identification of anomalies of disease or poisoning incidence during ongoing surveillance or an outbreak requires the use of sensitive statistical methods that recognize an incidence pattern at the time of occurrence. This report describes 2 novel analytical methods that focus on detecting anomalies of incidence at the time of occurrence in a temporal and space-time series. The first method describes the paucity of incidence at the time of occurrence in an ongoing surveillance and is designed to evaluate whether a decline in incidence occurs on the single current day or during the most recent few days. The second method provides an overall assessment of current clustering or paucity of incidence in a space-time series, allowing for several space regions. We illustrate the application of these methods using a subsample of a temporal series of data on the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan in 2015 since World War II and demonstrate that they are useful to efficiently monitor incoming data for current clustering and paucity of incidence in a temporal and space-time series. In light of the recent global emergence and resurgence of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya infection, these approaching for detecting current anomalies of incidence in the ongoing surveillance of disease are particularly desired and needed."
