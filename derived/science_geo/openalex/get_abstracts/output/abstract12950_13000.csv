https://openalex.org/W2026969539,"Vision is not required in order for fish to school. Five individual saithe, Pollachius virens, were able to join schools of 25 normal saithe swimming in an annular tank, while blinded with opaque eye covers. Test fish maintained position within the school indefinitely and responded to short-term movements of individuals within the school, although quantitative differences in reaction time and schooling behavior were noted. Five fish with lateral lines cut at the opercula were unable to school when wearing opaque eye covers. Although it is unlikely that blind saithe could school in the wild, the constraints of the apparatus permitted a demonstration of a role of the lateral line organ in schooling."

Vesicles have a unique composition of proteins and lipids. They show enrichment of cholesterol and sphingomyelin content and a seven-to tenfold enrichment of 5'-nucleotidase activity. Vesicles also contain intramembranous particles and show a trilamellar unit membrane and no ultrastructural evidence of contamination with other cytoplasmic organelles. The technique is proposed as a novel method for isolating plasma membrane vesicles from cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2051811640,"The interrelationships between sleep, ecological, and constitutional variables were assessed statistically for 39 mammalian species. Slow-wave sleep is negatively associated with a factor related to body size, which suggests that large amounts of this sleep phase are disadvantageous in large species. Paradoxical sleep is associated with a factor related to predatory danger, which suggests that large amounts of this sleep phase are disadvantageous in prey species."
https://openalex.org/W1544245820,"Highly purified alpha-actinin can be made by using the low ionic strength extraction procedure previously described (Arakawa N., Robson, R. M., and Goll, D. E. (1970) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 200, 284-295) and then subjecting the crude alpha-actinin fraction obtained with this extraction procedure to successive chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite. Hydrozyapatite chromatography specifically removes a protein having a subunit molecular weight of 42,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hydroxyapatite-purified alpha-actinin sediments entirely as a 6.21 S boundary in the analytical ultracentrifuge with no trace of the small 9 to 10 S boundary seen in earlier alpha-actinin preparations purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. In 100 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, hydroxyapatite-purified alpha-actinin has a diffusion coefficient (D020,w) of 2.71 X 10(-7) cm2-s-1, an intrinsic viscosity of 20.6 ml-g-1, a molecular weight of 201,000 +/- 4,300 (plus or minus least squares standard error) as determined by sedimentation equilibrium, and a molecular weight of 210,000 as determined by sedimentation diffusion. In 6 M guanidine HCl, hydroxyapatite-purified alpha-actinin has a molecular weight of 106,000 +/- 6,300 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium and a molecular weight of 100,000 as determined by a calibrated 4% agarose gel permeation column. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gives a molecular weight of 96,000 to 100,000 for hydroxyapatite-purified alpha-actinin. Rod-shaped particles 44 X 390 to 400 A are seen in electron micrographs of negatively stained alpha-actinin. By assuming 45% hydration and a molecular weight of 206,000, dimensions of approximately 40 X 500 A can be calculated for the alpha-actinin molecule by using either s 020, w, D 020, w, intrinsic viscosity, or a calibrated 6% agarose gel permeation column. Hydroxyapatite-purified alpha-actinin has an alpha-helical content of 74% as measured by circular dichroism at 208 nm."

https://openalex.org/W2067817117,"Nitrous oxide produced a dose-related ""analgesia"" in mice (median effective dose, 55 percent). The analgesia was evaluated by means of a phenylquinone writhing test. Narcotic antagonists or chronic morphinization reduced nitrous oxide analgesia. Either nitrous oxide releases an endogenous analgesic or narcotic antagonists have analgesic antagonist properties heretofore unappreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2054815209,The binding of benzo[a]pyrene to DNA in cultured human bronchus was measured in specimens from 37 patients. The binding values ranged from 2 to 151 picomoles of benzo[a]pyrene per milligram of DNA with an overall mean +/- standard error of 34.2 +/- 5.2. This 75-fold interindividual variation in the binding of benzo[a]pyrene to DNA is similar in magnitude to that found in pharmacogenetic studies of drug metabolism. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase is also inducible by benz[a]anthracene in the bronchial mucosa.
https://openalex.org/W1998263463,"A single injection of 10 microliters of antiserum to total brain ganglioside onto (and into) the sensorimotor cortex of the rat resulted in recurrent spiking in the cortical electroencephalogram, lasting from 7 to 17 days. Absorption of antibody with pure monosialoganglioside (GM1) completely abolished the effect. Spiking was reactivated after 4 weeks by intramuscular injection of pentylenetetrazole."
https://openalex.org/W2052164996,"When brain synaptosomes are obtained from animals that have been injected intravenously with [2H4]choline 1 minute before being killed, their high affinity [3H] choline uptake is correlated inversely with their acetylcholine content and directly with the rate at which they synthesize [2H4]acetylcholine. The control of such choline uptake by the cytoplasmic acetylcholine concentration is proposed as a mechanism regulating acetylcholine synthesis in cholinergic nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2002437321,"Creatine kinase has three isoenzymes designated MM, MB, and BB, with BB being the grain form and MM the muscle form. Antibodies to BB creatine kinase were obtained by immunization of rabbits with human BB creatine kinase. The antibodies demonstrated specificity for BB and MB creatine kinase (myocardial isoenzyme) but no cross-reactivity with MM creatine kinase. With the use of this antibody, a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay capable of measuring picomolar amounts of MB creatine kinase has been developed. Clinical application of this method should provide a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction."

https://openalex.org/W2020994494,"The nucleoside analog 5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) at 75 to 150 micromolar concentrations inhibits the synthesis of nuclear heterogeneous RNA (hnRNA) in HeLa cells by 60 to 70 percent. The sedimentation profile of hnRNA labeled with (3H)uridine for 45 seconds after brief treatment (45, 90, or 180 seconds) with DRB showed a progressive decrease in the labeling of shorter hnRNA molecules relative to longer molecules. Prior exposure of the cells to actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA chain elongation, did not alter the sedimentation profile of hnRNA. These results suggest that DRB preferentially inhibits the initiation of hnRNA chains so that after exposure to DRB for a brief period the longer nascent chains still remain to be finished and thus incorporate a greater share of the pulse label. By progressively increasing the time of exposure to DRB, and measuring the rate of increase in the average size of the labeled, nascent RNA, it was estimated that the chains were growing at rates between 50 and 100 nucleotides per second."
https://openalex.org/W2085388180,"Plasma samples from peripheral and ovarian veins were obtains from women at cesarean section. A peptide that immunologically cross-reacts with a specific antiserum to porcine relaxin is present in all samples. Its concentration is four times higher in the ovarian vein draining the ovary, which contains the corpus luteum of pregnancy, than in either the peripheral vein or the contralateral ovarian vein. Secretion of ovarian relaxin correlates with secretion of ovarian progesterone, thus providing another index of luteal function."
https://openalex.org/W2080121447,"After glycosidic cleavage of the water-soluble vitamin D-like principle of the calcinogenic plant Solanum malacoxylon, the active lipophilic portion was purified by column chromatography and analyzed by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. It was identified as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active form of vitamin D. Thus this active metabolite of vitamin D exists in the plant world, and its presence probably accounts for pathologic calcification in grazing animals ingesting Solanum malacoxylon."
https://openalex.org/W2066379637,"The complexes 1,10-phenanthrolineethylenediamineplatinum(II) and 2,2'-bipyridineethylenediamineplatinum(II) have a planar, aromatic ligand system that facilitates intercalation, as shown by their ability to unwind closed circular duplex DNA. Nonbonded steric interactions can rotate the pryidine ligands out of the coordination plane in bis(pyridine)ethylenediamineplatinum(II), thus preventing intercalation. Fiber x-ray diffraction patterns of the two metallointeracalators indicate that the binding is governed by the neighbor exclusion principle."
https://openalex.org/W2083332526,"The incidence of enteric communicable diseases in 77 kibbutzim (agricultural communal settlements) practicing wastewater spray irrigation with partially treated nondisinfected oxidation pond effluent is compared with that in 130 kibbutzim practicing no form of wastewater irrigation. The incidence of shigellosis, salmonellosis, typhoid fever, and infectious hepatitis is two to four times higher in communities practicing wastewater irrigation. No significant differences are found for the incidence of streptococcal infections, tuberculosis, and laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. Nor are differences found for enteric disease rates during the winter nonirrigation season. Strong wastewater treatment measures, including effective bacterial and viral inactivation through disinfection, are recommended for all cases of sewage irrigation or land disposal near residential areas in light of the potential public health risks involved."
https://openalex.org/W1992874070,Granule cells of the rat dentate gyrus which are denervated by unilateral destruction of the entorhinal cortex are reinnervated in part by proliferation of surviving pathways from the contralateral entorhinal cortex. The cells of origin of these lesion-induced projections were identified by retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase and were the same cell type which normally project to the ipsilateral dentate gyrus
https://openalex.org/W2013619811,"When one eye of a rat is removed at birth, axons from the remaining eye form an excess of branches which are directed to both sides of the brain. This finding, which is based on a novel application of cobalt tracing methods, provides an explanation for previous reports of expanded uncrossed projections after early eye removal."
https://openalex.org/W2082825472,A model chromosome number of 120 was obtained for the ancient fish. Polyodon spathula (Pisces: Chondrostei). The karyotype consists of 48 macrochromosomes and 72 microchromosomes. The microchromosomes are like those found in certain other primitive fishes as well as in reptiles and birds. The possiblity that Polyodon is a species of tetraploid origin is strongly suggested by the fact that the 120 chromosomes are easily arranged into 30 groups of four homologs each. Evolutionary comparisons are made with other primitive fish groups.
https://openalex.org/W2011982178,"Cats injected with LSD (d-lysergic acid diethylamide) exhibit a group of behaviors that appear to be specific to hallucinogenic drugs. Two of these behaviors, limb flick and abortive grooming, have an extremely low frequency of occurrence in normal cats, but often dominate the behavior of LSD-treated cats. The frequency of occurrence of this group of behaviors is related to the dose of LSD. The behavioral changes are long-lasting following a single injection of LSD, and exhibit tolerance following the repeated administration of LSD. They are not elicited by a variety of control drugs, but are elicited by other indole nucleus hallucinogens. Because the behavioral effects are specific, reliable, easy to score, and quantifiable, they represent an animal model that can be used in studies of the effects of LSD and related hallucinogens."

https://openalex.org/W2049655713,A single 2-hour exposure to auditory stimulation at any point during the final 3 days of incubation accelerates the hatching of Japanese quail. The 3-day sensitive period includes both prenatal and perinatal stages of incubation. So far as is known these results provide the first unequivocal evidence that short-term prenatal sensory stimulation can affect the development of an avian embryo.
https://openalex.org/W2087148879,"Cultures of L-929 and WI-38 cells, frozen to 4.2 degrees K and exposed for 4 to 8 hours to 5000-oersted magnetic fields, were markedly inhibited in their growth as compared to controls. In cultures grown on cover slips, approximately 7 days after exposure, morphologically distinct cells emerged and were propagated from generation to generation; 3 weeks later, in flask cultures, contact inhibition was abolished. It is concluded that under certain experimental conditions, strong magnetic fields induce morphological and physiological transformations of target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975583375,"When charcoal-broiled beef was fed to human volunteers, who were then given phenacetin orally, the concentration of phenacetin in the plasma was lowered, but its half-life in the plasma was not changed. The data suggest that feeding charcoal-broiled beef enhances the metabolism of orally administered phenacetin in the intestine or during its first pass through the liver, or both."
https://openalex.org/W2074538813,A population of New Zealand White rabbits has been found to exhibit behavioral convulsions when given low intravenous doses of psychoactive cannabinoids of marijuana. The behavioral convulsions decrease in severity and then disappear after the long-term administration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The extreme sensitivity of these rabbits to the stimulant action of cannabinoids suggests that the population might serve as a model in studies of the stimulant action of cannabinoids.
https://openalex.org/W2062734195,"A paper clip applied to the tails of rats induced gnawing and eating, which decreased in latency and increased in duration with experience. With sustained pressure to the tail, rats learned a new habit in order to gain access to wood chips on which to gnaw. That these are also properties of behavior elicited by electrical brain stimulation suggests that both manipulations may act through the same mechanism. These results support the hypothesis that a nonspecific arousing stimulus can be a sufficient condition for establishing learned habits."

https://openalex.org/W1994296792,"Blood flow to the ear pinnae is curtailed at ambient temperatures of between 1.4 degrees and 24 degrees C, which minimizes heat loss across the pinnae and allows the surfaces of erect pinnae to approach ambient temperature. The pinnae are warmed by steady or pulsatile vasodilation in some animals when the ambient temperature is between 1 degree and 9 degrees C below body temperature, a response favoring heat loss. When ambient temperature exceeds body temperature by 4 degrees to 5 degrees C, the pinnae are circulated with blood cooler than ambient temperature; this response favors heat influx."

https://openalex.org/W2045169923,"The biting louse Trinoton anserinum serves as the intermediate host in the life cycle of the filarial heartworm, Sarconema eurycerca. Microfilariae, second-, and third-stage larvae were dissected from 39 of 89 lice infesting whistling swans, Cygnus columbianus columbianus, in North America and mute swans, Cygnus olor, in the Black Sea, U.S.S.R. Infective third-stage larvae obtained from lice collected from heartworm-parasitized whistling swans were injected subcutaneously into each of two hand-reared, nonparasitized mute swan cygnets. Both of these birds developed heartworm infections, one becoming microfilaremic at 14 weeks. The results of this study provide conclusive evidence that a mallophagan serves as a natural cyclodevelopmental vector of a filarial parasite."

This apparent increase in order occurs at the same temperature as an increase in order in aqueous solution and as a change in the volume expansion coefficient of fibrous elastin."
https://openalex.org/W2033953139,"High-angle x-ray diffraction provides direct evidence that amianthoid change, occurring during aging of costal cartilage, corresponds to a transformation from an isotropic to a marked anisotropic distribution of collagen fibrils. Low-angle x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy show that the fibrils have the customary 67-nanometer axial periodicity. Electron microscopy shows that wide amianthoid collagen fibrils consist of smaller parallel fibrils fused together. Similarities between amianthoid change and tendon morphogenesis are briefly discussed. Amianthoid change is remarkable in that aging is accompanied by increased order."

https://openalex.org/W2083229475,"PHAGE Xp12 on Xanthomonas oryzae was isolated from the irrigation water of a rice field. In the DNA of this phage, cytosine is completely replaced by 5-methylcytosine1. Isotope tracing studies on the biosynthesis of this unusual pyrimidine demonstrated that methylation of this cytosine is different from that of the 5-methylcytosine which is found in trace amounts in most plant and animal DNAs. The latter is methylated by methionine. On the other hand, the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine residues of Xp12 is derived from the 3-carbon of serine and not from the thiomethyl carbon of methionine2. In this investigation, the synthesis of deoxy-5-methylcytidylic acid (d5MCMP) was found to take place at the level of nucleotide, with deoxycytidylic acid (dCMP) and formaldehyde as substrates in the presence of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA) and an enzyme preparation from X. oryzae infected with Xp12 phage. This reaction seems to account for the synthesis of the unique pyrimidine, 5-methylcytosine, which occurs in the DNA of phage Xp12."

https://openalex.org/W1972636850,"Hydra hymanae, a hermaphroditic freshwater coelenterate, reproduces asexually at 24°C and sexually at 15°C. The appearance of gonads begins 12 days after transfer from 24° to 15°C and is complete 35 days after the temperature transition. Testes appear before eggs. Fifty percent of the mature embryos maintained at 15°C hatch by day 61, but they have a low level of survival. Fifty percent of the mature embryos pretreated for from 5 to 25 days at 4°C hatch by about day 45, and these have a high level of survival. Embryos maintained at 4°C for longer periods (55 to 85 days) accumulate in a prehatching state and hatch with a high degree of synchrony approximately 7.5 days after return to 15°C. Populations derived from newly hatched polyps are refractory to sex induction for approximately 120 days. The system is well adapted to ensure a regular alternation of reproductive modes in the natural environment."
