https://openalex.org/W2922798588,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic antigen receptors that reprogram T cell specificity, function and persistence1. Patient-derived CAR T cells have demonstrated remarkable efficacy against a range of B-cell malignancies1-3, and the results of early clinical trials suggest activity in multiple myeloma4. Despite high complete response rates, relapses occur in a large fraction of patients; some of these are antigen-negative and others are antigen-low1,2,4-9. Unlike the mechanisms that result in complete and permanent antigen loss6,8,9, those that lead to escape of antigen-low tumours remain unclear. Here, using mouse models of leukaemia, we show that CARs provoke reversible antigen loss through trogocytosis, an active process in which the target antigen is transferred to T cells, thereby decreasing target density on tumour cells and abating T cell activity by promoting fratricide T cell killing and T cell exhaustion. These mechanisms affect both CD28- and 4-1BB-based CARs, albeit differentially, depending on antigen density. These dynamic features can be offset by cooperative killing and combinatorial targeting to augment tumour responses to immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2924485771,"Differences in the presence of even a few genes between otherwise identical bacterial strains may result in critical phenotypic differences. Here we systematically identify microbial genomic structural variants (SVs) and find them to be prevalent in the human gut microbiome across phyla and to replicate in different cohorts. SVs are enriched for CRISPR-associated and antibiotic-producing functions and depleted from housekeeping genes, suggesting that they have a role in microbial adaptation. We find multiple associations between SVs and host disease risk factors, many of which replicate in an independent cohort. Exploring genes that are clustered in the same SV, we uncover several possible mechanistic links between the microbiome and its host, including a region in Anaerostipes hadrus that encodes a composite inositol catabolism-butyrate biosynthesis pathway, the presence of which is associated with lower host metabolic disease risk. Overall, our results uncover a nascent layer of variability in the microbiome that is associated with microbial adaptation and host health. The authors systematically characterize structural variation in the genomes of gut microbiota and show that they are associated with bacterial fitness and with host risk factors, and that examining genes coded in these regions facilitates investigation of mechanisms that may underlie these associations."

https://openalex.org/W2925187261,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains recalcitrant to all forms of cancer treatment and carries a five-year survival rate of only 8%1. Inhibition of oncogenic KRAS (hereafter KRAS*), the earliest lesion in disease development that is present in more than 90% of PDACs, and its signalling surrogates has yielded encouraging preclinical results with experimental agents2-4. However, KRAS*-independent disease recurrence following genetic extinction of Kras* in mouse models anticipates the need for co-extinction strategies5,6. Multiple oncogenic processes are initiated at the cell surface, where KRAS* physically and functionally interacts to direct signalling that is essential for malignant transformation and tumour maintenance. Insights into the complexity of the functional cell-surface-protein repertoire (surfaceome) have been technologically limited until recently and-in the case of PDAC-the genetic control of the function and composition of the PDAC surfaceome in the context of KRAS* signalling remains largely unknown. Here we develop an unbiased, functional target-discovery platform to query KRAS*-dependent changes of the PDAC surfaceome, which reveals syndecan 1 (SDC1, also known as CD138) as a protein that is upregulated at the cell surface by KRAS*. Localization of SDC1 at the cell surface-where it regulates macropinocytosis, an essential metabolic pathway that fuels PDAC cell growth-is essential for disease maintenance and progression. Thus, our study forges a mechanistic link between KRAS* signalling and a targetable molecule driving nutrient salvage pathways in PDAC and validates oncogene-driven surfaceome annotation as a strategy to identify cancer-specific vulnerabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2924166998,"Access to adequate housing is a fundamental human right, essential to human security, nutrition and health, and a core objective of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals1,2. Globally, the housing need is most acute in Africa, where the population will more than double by 2050. However, existing data on housing quality across Africa are limited primarily to urban areas and are mostly recorded at the national level. Here we quantify changes in housing in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2015 by combining national survey data within a geostatistical framework. We show a marked transformation of housing in urban and rural sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2015, with the prevalence of improved housing (with improved water and sanitation, sufficient living area and durable construction) doubling from 11% (95% confidence interval, 10-12%) to 23% (21-25%). However, 53 (50-57) million urban Africans (47% (44-50%) of the urban population analysed) were living in unimproved housing in 2015. We provide high-resolution, standardized estimates of housing conditions across sub-Saharan Africa. Our maps provide a baseline for measuring change and a mechanism to guide interventions during the era of the Sustainable Development Goals."
https://openalex.org/W2924145382,"Satiation is the process by which eating and drinking reduce appetite. For thirst, oropharyngeal cues have a critical role in driving satiation by reporting to the brain the volume of fluid that has been ingested1-12. By contrast, the mechanisms that relay the osmolarity of ingested fluids remain poorly understood. Here we show that the water and salt content of the gastrointestinal tract are precisely measured and then rapidly communicated to the brain to control drinking behaviour in mice. We demonstrate that this osmosensory signal is necessary and sufficient for satiation during normal drinking, involves the vagus nerve and is transmitted to key forebrain neurons that control thirst and vasopressin secretion. Using microendoscopic imaging, we show that individual neurons compute homeostatic need by integrating this gastrointestinal osmosensory information with oropharyngeal and blood-borne signals. These findings reveal how the fluid homeostasis system monitors the osmolarity of ingested fluids to dynamically control drinking behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2924873324,"During gastrulation, physical forces reshape the simple embryonic tissue to form the complex body plans of multicellular organisms1. These forces often cause large-scale asymmetric movements of the embryonic tissue2,3. In many embryos, the gastrulating tissue is surrounded by a rigid protective shell4. Although it is well-recognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces that are generated by tissue-intrinsic contractility5,6, it is not known whether interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that affect gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope that surrounds the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts tissue-intrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. This localized attachment depends on an αPS2 integrin (inflated), and the knockdown of this integrin leads to a gastrulation phenotype that is consistent with complete loss of attachment. Furthermore, analysis of another integrin (the αPS3 integrin, scab) in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline envelope. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism through which the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to the vitelline envelope provides controllable, counteracting forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2931264320,"In the Eriksen flanker task as well as in the Simon task irrelevant activation produces a response conflict that has to be resolved by mental control mechanisms. Despite these similarities, however, the tasks differ with respect to their delta functions, which express how the congruency effects develop with response time. The slope of the delta function is mostly positive for the flanker task, but negative for the Simon task. Much effort has been spent to explain this difference and to investigate whether it results from task-specific control. A prominent account is that the temporal overlap between irrelevant and relevant response activation is larger in the flanker task than in the Simon task. To test this hypothesis, we increased the temporal distance in a flanker task by presenting the flankers ahead of the target. This not only produced negatively sloped delta functions but also caused reversed congruency effects. We also conducted a Simon-task experiment in which we varied the proportion of congruent stimuli. As a result, the delta function was negatively sloped only if the proportion was low. These results demonstrate that a long temporal distance is necessary but not sufficient for observing negatively sloped delta functions. Finally, we modeled the data with drift-diffusion models. Together, our results show that differently sloped delta functions can be produced with both tasks. They further indicate that activation suppression is an important control mechanism that can be adapted rather flexibly to the control demands."
https://openalex.org/W2923163401,"Sodium is the main cation in the extracellular fluid and it regulates various physiological functions. Depletion of sodium in the body increases the hedonic value of sodium taste, which drives animals towards sodium consumption1,2. By contrast, oral sodium detection rapidly quenches sodium appetite3,4, suggesting that taste signals have a central role in sodium appetite and its satiation. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms of chemosensory-based appetite regulation remain poorly understood. Here we identify genetically defined neural circuits in mice that control sodium intake by integrating chemosensory and internal depletion signals. We show that a subset of excitatory neurons in the pre-locus coeruleus express prodynorphin, and that these neurons are a critical neural substrate for sodium-intake behaviour. Acute stimulation of this population triggered robust ingestion of sodium even from rock salt, while evoking aversive signals. Inhibition of the same neurons reduced sodium consumption selectively. We further demonstrate that the oral detection of sodium rapidly suppresses these sodium-appetite neurons. Simultaneous in vivo optical recording and gastric infusion revealed that sodium taste—but not sodium ingestion per se—is required for the acute modulation of neurons in the pre-locus coeruleus that express prodynorphin, and for satiation of sodium appetite. Moreover, retrograde-virus tracing showed that sensory modulation is in part mediated by specific GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-producing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. This inhibitory neural population is activated by sodium ingestion, and sends rapid inhibitory signals to sodium-appetite neurons. Together, this study reveals a neural architecture that integrates chemosensory signals and the internal need to maintain sodium balance. Sodium appetite in mice is driven by a neural circuit that is focused on neurons of the pre-locus coeruleus and integrates the sensory detection of sodium and internal signals."

https://openalex.org/W2933058414,"Surgical microscopes are vital tools for ophthalmic surgeons. The recent development of an integrated OCT system for the first time allows to look at tissue features below the surface. Hence, these systems can drastically improve the quality and reduce the risk of surgical interventions. However, current commercial OCT-enhanced ophthalmic surgical microscopes provide only one additional cross sectional view to the standard microscope image and feature a low update rate. To present volumetric data at a high update rate, much faster OCT systems than the ones applied in today’s surgical microscopes need to be developed. We demonstrate live volumetric retinal OCT imaging, which may provide a sufficiently large volume size (330x330x595 Voxel) and high update frequency (24.2 Hz) such that the surgeon may even purely rely on the OCT for certain surgical maneuvers. It represents a major technological step towards the possible application of OCT-only surgical microscopes in the future which would be much more compact thus enabling many additional minimal invasive applications. We show that multi-MHz A-scan rates are essential for such a device. Additionally, advanced phase-based OCT techniques require 3D OCT volumes to be detected with a stable optical phase. These techniques can provide additional functional information of the retina. Up to now, classical OCT was to slow for this, so our system can pave the way to holographic OCT with a traditional confocal flying spot approach. For the first time, we present point scanning volumetric OCT imaging of the posterior eye with up to 191.2 Hz volume rate. We show that this volume rate is high enough to enable a sufficiently stable optical phase to a level, where remaining phase errors can be corrected. Applying advanced post processing concepts for numerical refocusing or computational adaptive optics should be possible in future with such a system."
https://openalex.org/W2930854879,"The disease of freshwater sponges was first discovered in 2011, when pink samples were found in the Central Basin of Lake Baikal. Subsequently, the visible signs of the disease have changed, and now sponges appear with various symptoms of damage to the body, such as discoloration, tissue necrosis, the formation of brown patches and dirty-purple biofilms on some branches. These signs of the disease are accompanied by the mass death of sponges. We identified differences in microbiomes by sequencing 16S rRNA genes and found changes in the consortium of microorganisms of freshwater Baikal sponges. We found that the observed imbalance in the studied microbial communities of diseased sponges is caused by several different conditionally pathogenic microorganisms that increase their negative effect by acting together and in concert, which leads to the death of photosynthetic microalgae and sponges. Sponges are an important component of coastal communities, and the massive loss of sponges can obviously affect the structure of benthic communities and the purity of water."
https://openalex.org/W2931046029,"Objectives Following two studies conducted in 2005 and 2011, a third prevalence survey of multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO) was organised in Belgian nursing homes (NHs) using a similar methodology. The aim was to measure the prevalence of carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in NH residents. Risk factors for MDRO carriage were also explored. Methods Up to 51 randomly selected residents per NH were screened for MDRO carriage by trained local nurses between June and October 2015. Rectal swabs were cultured for ESBLE, CPE and VRE, while pooled samples of nose, throat and perineum and chronic wound swabs were obtained for culture of MRSA. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, molecular detection of resistance genes and strain genotyping were performed. Significant risk factors for MDRO colonization MDRO was determined by univariate and multivariable analysis. Results Overall, 1447 residents from 29 NHs were enrolled. The mean weighted prevalence of ESBLE and MRSA colonization was 11.3% and 9.0%, respectively. Co-colonization occurred in 1.8% of the residents. VRE and CPE carriage were identified in only one resident each. Impaired mobility and recent treatment with fluoroquinolones or with combinations of sulphonamides and trimethoprim were identified as risk factors for ESBLE carriage, while for MRSA these were previous MRSA carriage/infection, a stay in several different hospital wards during the past year, and a recent treatment with nitrofuran derivatives. Current antacid use was a predictor for both ESBL and MRSA carriage. Conclusions In line with the evolution of MRSA and ESBL colonization/infection in hospitals, a decline in MRSA carriage and an increase in ESBLE prevalence was seen in Belgian NHs between 2005 and 2015. These results show that a systemic approach, including surveillance and enhancement of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship programs is needed in both acute and chronic care facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2928323355,"Interfacing anatomically conformal electronic components, such as sensors, with biology is central to the creation of next-generation wearable systems for health care and human augmentation applications. Thus, there is a need to establish computer-aided design and manufacturing methods for producing personalized anatomically conformal systems, such as wearable devices and human-machine interfaces (HMIs). Here, we show that a three-dimensional (3D) scanning and 3D printing process enabled the design and fabrication of a sensor-integrated anatomical human-machine interface (AHMI) in the form of personalized prosthetic hands that contain anatomically conformal electrode arrays for children affected by amniotic band syndrome, a common birth defect. A methodology for identifying optimal scanning parameters was identified based on local and global metrics of registered point cloud data quality. This method identified an optimal rotational angle step size between adjacent 3D scans. The sensitivity of the optimization process to variations in organic shape (i.e., geometry) was examined by testing other anatomical structures, including a foot, an ear, and a porcine kidney. We found that personalization of the prosthetic interface increased the tissue-prosthesis contact area by 408% relative to the non-personalized devices. Conformal 3D printing of carbon nanotube-based polymer inks across the personalized AHMI facilitated the integration of electronic components, specifically, conformal sensor arrays for measuring the pressure distribution across the AHMI (i.e., the tissue-prosthesis interface). We found that the pressure across the AHMI exhibited a non-uniform distribution and became redistributed upon activation of the prosthetic hand’s grasping action. Overall, this work shows that the integration of 3D scanning and 3D printing processes offers the ability to design and fabricate wearable systems that contain sensor-integrated AHMIs."
https://openalex.org/W2925687607,"Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks.) is a fungal disease of wheat (Triticum spp.), which causes considerable yield loss. Adult plant resistance (APR) is one of the most sustainable approaches to control leaf rust. In this study, field-testing was carried out across ten different locations, followed by molecular screening, to detect the presence of APR genes, Lr34+, Lr46+, Lr67+ and Lr68 in Indian wheat germplasm. In field screening, 190 wheat accessions were selected from 6,319 accessions based on leaf tip necrosis (LTN), disease severity and the average coefficient of infection. Molecular screening revealed that 73% of the accessions possessed known APR genes either as single or as a combination of two or three genes. The occurrence of increased LTN intensity, decreased leaf rust severity and greater expression of APR genes were more in relatively cooler locations. In 52 lines, although the presence of the APR genes was not detected, it still displayed high levels of resistance. Furthermore, 49 accessions possessing either two or three APR genes were evaluated for stability across locations for grain yield. It emerged that eight accessions had wider adaptability. Resistance based on APR genes, in the background of high yielding cultivars, is expected to provide a high level of race non-specific resistance, which is durable."
https://openalex.org/W2934050847,"Methoxyfenozide is an insect growth regulator (IGR) commonly used in agriculture to simultaneously control pests and preserve beneficial insect populations; however, its impact on honey bees in not fully understood. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to investigate bee health in response to field-relevant concentrations of this pesticide. Significant effects were observed in honey bee colony flight activity and thermoregulation after being exposed over 9 weeks to supplemental protein patty containing methoxyfenozide. Compared to bee colonies in the control group, colonies fed pollen patty with 200 ppb methoxyfenozide (as measured by residue analysis) had: 1) a significantly reduced rate of weight loss due to forager departure in the morning; and 2) higher temperature variability during the winter. Colonies in the 100 ppb (as measured by residue analysis) treatment group had values between the 200 ppb group and control for both response variables. The dusk break point, which is the time associated with the end of forager return, differed among all treatment groups but may have been confounded with direction the hives were facing. Bee colony metrics of adult bee mass and brood surface area, and measurements of bee head weight, newly-emerged bee weight, and hypopharyngeal gland size were not significantly affected by methoxyfenozide exposure, suggesting that there may be significant effects on honey bee colony behavior and health in the field that are difficult to detect using standard methods for assessing bee colonies and individuals. The second experiment was continued into the following spring, using the same treatment groups as in the fall. Fewer differences were observed among groups in the spring than the fall, possibly because of abundant spring forage and consequent reduced treatment patty consumption. Residue analyses showed that: 1) observed methoxyfenozide concentrations in treatment patty were about 18-60% lower than the calculated concentrations; 2) no residues were observed in wax in any treatment; and 3) methoxyfenozide was detected in bee bread only in the 200 ppb treatment group, at about 1-2.5% of the observed patty concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2933840957,"Background The mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear, and clinical biomarkers are not yet available for ASD. Differences in dysregulated proteins in ASD have shown little reproducibility, which is partly due to ASD heterogeneity. Recent studies have demonstrated that subgrouping ASD cases based on clinical phenotypes is useful for identifying candidate genes that are dysregulated in ASD subgroups. However, this strategy has not been employed in proteome profiling analyses to identify ASD biomarker proteins for specific subgroups. Methods We therefore conducted a cluster analysis of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) scores from 85 individuals with ASD to predict subgroups and subsequently identified dysregulated genes by reanalyzing the transcriptome profiles of individuals with ASD and unaffected individuals. Proteome profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines from these individuals was performed via 2D-gel electrophoresis, and then mass spectrometry. Disrupted proteins were identified and compared to the dysregulated transcripts and reported dysregulated proteins from previous proteome studies. Biological functions were predicted using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program. Selected proteins were also analyzed by Western blotting. Results The cluster analysis of ADI-R data revealed four ASD subgroups, including ASD with severe language impairment, and transcriptome profiling identified dysregulated genes in each subgroup. Screening via proteome analysis revealed 82 altered proteins in the ASD subgroup with severe language impairment. Eighteen of these proteins were further identified by nano-LC-MS/MS. Among these proteins, fourteen were predicted by IPA to be associated with neurological functions and inflammation. Among these proteins, diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis to be expressed at significantly decreased levels in the ASD subgroup with severe language impairment, and the DBI expression levels were correlated with the scores of several ADI-R items. Conclusions By subgrouping individuals with ASD based on clinical phenotypes, and then performing an integrated transcriptome-proteome analysis, we identified DBI as a novel candidate protein for ASD with severe language impairment. The mechanisms of this protein and its potential use as an ASD biomarker warrant further study."

Trained optometrists, ophthalmic nurses and ophthalmic officer collected the data using a pretested data abstraction form. The descriptive and analytic statistics was carried out. Results A total of 773 patients (549 males and 224 females) were included in the study. Closed globe injury was more common in males (P = 0.019) and open globe injury was significantly common in children (P < 0.001). Corneal tear was the most frequently observed finding (39.33%). Surgery, secondary to trauma, was common in open globe injury (P < 0.001). About 98% of the patients presented after 6 hours post trauma. Among 84.61% patients whose visual acuity (VA) was recorded at presentation, 12.23% had VA of 6/6 and 65.90% had VA of <3/60. Conclusion Ocular trauma was more common in males and children. Majority of patients (98%) presented after 6 hours post trauma. Cornea was the most commonly affected ocular structure by trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2928069646,"Plant phenology (e.g. timing of spring green-up, flowering) is among the most sensitive indicator of ecological response to ongoing climate variability and change. While previous studies have documented changes in the timing of spring green-up and flowering across different parts of the world, empirical evidence regarding how such ongoing ecological changes impact allergic disease burden at population level is lacking. Because earlier spring green-up may increase season length for tree pollen, we hypothesized that early onset of spring (negative anomaly in start of season (SOS)) will be associated with increased hay fever burden. To test this, we first calculated a median cardinal date for SOS for each county within the contiguous US for the years 2001–2013 using phenology data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We categorized yearly deviations in SOS for each county from their respective long-term averages as: very early (>3 wks early), early (1–3 wks early), average (within 1 wk), late (1–3 wks late) and very late (> 3 wks late). We linked these data to 2002–2013 National Health Interview Survey data, and investigated the association between changes in SOS and hay fever prevalence using logistic regression. We observed that adults living in counties with a very early onset of SOS had a 14% higher odds of hay fever compared to the reference group, i.e. those living in counties where onset of spring was within the normal range (Odds Ratios (OR): 1.14. 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.03–1.27). Likewise, adults living in counties with very late onset of SOS had a 18% higher odds hay fever compared to the reference group (OR: 1.18, CI: 1.05–1.32). Our data provides the first-ever national scale assessment of the impact of changing plant phenology–linked to ongoing climate variability and change–on hay fever prevalence. Our findings are likely tied to changes in pollen dynamics, i.e early onset of spring increases the duration of exposure to tree pollen, while very late onset of spring increases the propensity of exposure because of simultaneous blooming."
https://openalex.org/W2951714130,"We propose and theoretically study an approach to massively parallel single molecule peptide sequencing, based on single molecule measurement of the kinetics of probe binding (Havranek, et al., 2013) to the N-termini of immobilized peptides. Unlike previous proposals, this method is robust to both weak and non-specific probe-target affinities, which we demonstrate by applying the method to a range of randomized affinity matrices consisting of relatively low-quality binders. This suggests a novel principle for proteomic measurement whereby highly non-optimized sets of low-affinity binders could be applicable for protein sequencing, thus shifting the burden of amino acid identification from biomolecular design to readout. Measurement of probe occupancy times, or of time-averaged fluorescence, should allow high-accuracy determination of N-terminal amino acid identity for realistic probe sets. The time-averaged fluorescence method scales well to weakly-binding probes with dissociation constants of tens or hundreds of micromolar, and bypasses photobleaching limitations associated with other fluorescence-based approaches to protein sequencing. We argue that this method could lead to an approach with single amino acid resolution and the ability to distinguish many canonical and modified amino acids, even using highly non-optimized probe sets. This readout method should expand the design space for single molecule peptide sequencing by removing constraints on the properties of the fluorescent binding probes."
https://openalex.org/W2929271080,"While treatment for testicular cancer (TC) has become standardized after the 1980s with an associated significant improvement in patient survival, this has been accompanied by an increased risk of second primary cancers (SPCs). Patients were identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry spanning the years from 1980 to 2015, including 8788 individuals with primary TC and their SPCs. Relative risks (RRs) for SPC were calculated using the generalized Poisson regression model. SPCs were diagnosed in 9.4% of patients with TC and half of them were late onset cancers not common in the population in their 40s. Overall RR of SPCs (excluding second TC) was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.20–1.40), including high risks for seven solid cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia. Second TC was the most common SPC and the RR of 17.19 (95%CI: 14.89–19.85) was the highest recorded. Cancers known to be fatal as first primary cancers were also fatal as SPC in TC patients. Survival at 30 years of follow-up was approximately 80% for TC patients without SPC but it decreased to 40% for patients with SPC. The unexpected finding that half of the identified SPCs were typical late onset cancers in the middle-aged population raises concerns that therapy may facilitate premature aging. The risks of SPC are clinically important for the long-term management of TC patients and the high-mortality calls for a future management strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2952344082,"Serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by diacylglycerol that is released from membrane lipids by phospholipase C in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases. PKC isoforms are particularly relevant for proliferation and differentiation of cells including osteoblasts. Osteoblasts/osteocytes produce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone regulating renal phosphate and vitamin D handling. PKC activates NFκB, a transcription factor complex controlling FGF23 expression. Here, we analyzed the impact of PKC on FGF23 synthesis. Fgf23 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in UMR106 osteoblast-like cells and in IDG-SW3 osteocytes, and FGF23 protein was measured by ELISA. Phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, up-regulated FGF23 production. In contrast, PKC inhibitors calphostin C, Gö6976, sotrastaurin and ruboxistaurin suppressed FGF23 formation. NFκB inhibitor withaferin A abolished the stimulatory effect of PMA on Fgf23. PKC is a powerful regulator of FGF23 synthesis, an effect which is at least partly mediated by NFκB."
https://openalex.org/W2931118930,"Qiu et al. made a security analysis about the protocols of Chaudhry et al. and Kumari et al. in 2018, and they pointed out that there are many security weaknesses in the protocols. To improve the security, Qiu et al. proposed an advanced authentication scheme for Session Initiation Protocol on the basis of the previous protocols and claimed that their own protocol was very secure and practical. However, we demonstrate that the protocol of Qiu et al. has a serious mistake which causes their protocol cannot be executed normally. Beyond that, we also find out that their protocol cannot withstand insider attack and denial service attack. In order to remove these weaknesses, we propose an efficient provably secure mutual authentication scheme. Furthermore, our scheme provides security analysis with the help of Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. Compared with their protocol, ours has greater security and better performance."
https://openalex.org/W2933518039,"The purpose of this study was to examine associations between the Walk Score and physical activity in young, overweight/obese urban women. Project Health included 45 White or African American women (BMI 31.5±3.9 kg/m2; age 26.5±4.6 years; 62% African American) living in the Boston area. An accelerometer estimated steps/day and mins/day in light physical activity (100-2019 counts-per-minute) and moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity (≥2020 cpm). Walk Score was used to estimate the walkability of home address by analyzing proximity to nearby amenities. General linear regression models estimated associations between total Walk Score and physical activity (light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity, steps, total activity counts, METs), adjusting for body mass index, age, race/ethnicity, seasonality, wear time, employment and student status. For physical activity variables that had significant associations with Walk Score (steps/day and steps/min), regression models were estimated for Walk Score sub-scores (parks, grocery, errands, shopping, dining/drinking, culture/entertainment and schools). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of meeting the guidelines for steps (≥10,000/day) and moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity (≥150mins MVPA/week) based on Walk Score. Participants had a Walk Score of 63.9±26.4, took 14,143±3,934 steps/day, and spent 206.2±66.0 mins/day in light physical activity and 46.7±17.5 mins/day in moderate-to-vigorous- physical activity. Walk Score was significantly and positively associated with steps/day (β = 51.4, p = 0.01) and steps/min (β = 0.06, p = 0.009) but was not associated with mins/day of light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity, total activity counts or METs. Parks, grocery, errands, shopping, dining/drinking, and culture/entertainment Walk Score sub-scores were significantly associated with steps and steps/min (all p<0.05), but not significantly associated for schools. Participants who lived in higher Walk Score neighborhoods were more likely to meet the step guidelines (OR, 95% CI: 1.59, 1.04-2.99) and moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity guidelines (1.63, 1.06-3.02), respectively, per 10-unit increase in Walk Score. These results indicate that living in a more walkable neighborhood may support walking behavior in young, urban-dwelling overweight/obese women and provide further evidence for the expanded use of urban planning and transportation policies to improve the walkability of urban neighborhoods."
https://openalex.org/W2927488387,"Introduction Health interventions implemented with self-help groups (SHGs) enhance the relevance and acceptability of the health services. The Parivartan program was implemented in eight districts of Bihar with women’s self-help groups to increase adoption of maternal and newborn health behaviors through layering health behavior change communication. This study estimates the cost and cost-effectiveness of a health behavior change program with SHGs in Bihar. Methods Cost analysis was conducted from a provider’s perspective. All costs have been presented in US dollars for the purpose of international comparisons and converted to constant values. The effectiveness estimate was based on the reported changes in select newborn care practices. A decision model approach was used to estimate the potential number of neonatal deaths averted based on adoption of key newborn care practices. Using India’s life expectancy of 65 years, cost per life year saved was calculated. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted using the upper and lower estimates for various variables in the model, and functionality of SHGs. Results The cost of forming an SHG group was US$254 and that of reaching a woman within the group was US$19. The unit cost for delivering health interventions through the Parivartan program was US$148 per group and US$11 per woman reached. During an 18 months period, Parivartan program reached around 17,120 SHGs and an estimated 20,544 pregnant women resulting in an estimated prevention of 23 neonatal deaths at a cost of US$3,825 per life year saved. Conclusion SHGs can be an effective platform to increase uptake of women’s health interventions and follow-up care, and also to broaden their utility beyond microfinance, particularly when they operate at a larger scale."
https://openalex.org/W2927674898,"Previous studies reported that secreted frizzled-related protein-5 (Sfrp5) decreases beta cell proliferation and increases fasting insulin levels, but studies on direct effects of Sfrp5 on insulin secretion and its underlying mechanisms are missing. This study examined effects of Sfrp5 on (i) beta cell viability and proliferation, (ii) basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and (iii) canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways. We incubated rat INS-1E cells with 0.1, 1 or 5 μg/ml recombinant Sfrp5 for 24h. We measured basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at glucose concentrations of 2.5 and 20 mmol/l. Phosphorylated and total protein content as well as mRNA levels of markers of cell proliferation, canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways were examined using Western blotting and real-time PCR. Differences between treatments were analysed by repeated measurement one-way ANOVA or Friedman's test followed by correction for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. At 5 μg/ml, Sfrp5 reduced mRNA levels of cyclin-B1 by 25% (p<0.05). At 1 and 5 μg/ml, Sfrp5 increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 24% and by 34% (both p<0.05), respectively, but had no impact on basal insulin secretion. Sfrp5 reduced the phosphorylation of the splicing forms p46 and p54 of JNK by 39% (p<0.01) and 49% (p<0.05), respectively. In conclusion, Sfrp5 reduced markers of cell proliferation, but increased in parallel dose-dependently glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1E cells. This effect is likely mediated by reduced JNK activity, an important component of the non-canonical Wnt signalling pathway."

However, its success is highly dependent on the quality of bowel preparation. The objective of this study was to compare the bowel preparation efficacy of picosulfate/magnesium citrate (PMC) vs polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a one-day vs two-day split dose regimen. Methods A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at the Forzani & MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre in Calgary, Canada. 171 colonoscopy outpatients were randomized to split-dose PMC or PEG lavage as well as into one-day split or two-day split regimens in blocks of eight. Bowel preparation quality was recorded in a blinded manner by the endoscopist using the Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS) prior to washing or suctioning. The scale results were analyzed using a two-factor analysis of variance. Results 141 patients received complete colonoscopies (PMC-71; PEG-70). PEG was found to be superior to PMC (mean OBPS: 4.14 ± 2.64 vs 5.11 ± 3.44, p = 0.019), when adjusted for administration regimen, leading to significantly more adequate bowel preparations (79.7% vs 59.7%, p = 0.007). A two-day split dose was superior to a one-day split dose regimen (mean OBPS: 3.68± 2.82 vs 5.69 ± 3.06, p<0.001). Two-day split dosing also resulted in a better right colon cleanliness score (right bowel OBPS 1.27±0.11 vs 2.10±0.12 for one-day split, P<0.001). Conclusions Optimal bowel preparation was achieved with the use of PEG lavage when administered in a two-day split dose regimen. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT01415687."
https://openalex.org/W2928355711,"Background Some case-control studies reported that mitochondrial haplogroups could be associated with the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but the literature regarding this topic is limited. We aimed to investigate whether any mitochondrial haplogroup carried a higher or lower risk of CVD in a large cohort of North American people affected by knee osteoarthritis or at high risk for this condition. Materials and methods A longitudinal cohort study including individuals from the Osteoarthritis Initiative was done. Haplogroups were assigned through a combination of sequencing and PCR-RFLP techniques. All the mitochondrial haplogroups have been named following this nomenclature: HV, JT, UK, IWX, and superHV/others. The strength of the association between mitochondrial haplogroups and incident CVD was evaluated through a Cox’s regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, and reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Overall, 3,288 Caucasian participants (56.8% women) with a mean age of 61.3±9.2 years without CVD at baseline were included. During a median follow-up of 8 years, 322 individuals (= 9.8% of baseline population) developed a CVD. After adjusting for 11 potential confounders at baseline and taking those with the HV haplotype as reference (the most frequent), those with JT carried a significant lower risk of CVD (HR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.54–0.96; p = 0.03). Participants with the J haplogroup had the lowest risk of CVD (HR = 0.71; 95%CI: 0.46–0.95; p = 0.02). Conclusions The presence of JT haplogroups (particularly J) may be associated with a reduced risk of CVD. However, this result was not based on a high level of statistical significance. Thus, future research with larger sample size is needed to assess whether our results can be corroborated."
https://openalex.org/W2901001776,"Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) is an essential transcription factor for erythroid development, as demonstrated by Klf1 knockout mice which die around E14 due to severe anemia. In humans, >140 KLF1 variants, causing different erythroid phenotypes, have been described. The KLF1 Nan variant, a single amino acid substitution (p.E339D) in the DNA binding domain, causes hemolytic anemia and is dominant over wildtype KLF1. Here we describe the effects of the KLF1 Nan variant during fetal development. We show that Nan embryos have defects in erythroid maturation. RNA-sequencing of the KLF1 Nan fetal liver cells revealed that Exportin 7 (Xpo7) was among the 782 deregulated genes. This nuclear exportin is implicated in terminal erythroid differentiation; in particular it is involved in nuclear condensation. Indeed, KLF1 Nan fetal liver cells had larger nuclei and reduced chromatin condensation. Knockdown of XPO7 in wildtype erythroid cells caused a similar phenotype. We propose that reduced expression of XPO7 is partially responsible for the erythroid defects observed in KLF1 Nan erythroid cells."

From negotiating an uneven surface, to mounting an immune response, we continually infer the limits of our body. The current investigation considered the impact that the inferred consequences of action has on the placement of limits. We hypothesised that the performance of individuals in a novel, sprint task would reflect both their ability to accurately detect changes in bodily arousal (Interoceptive Accuracy) and the inferred consequences associated with heightened arousal signals (Anxiety Sensitivity). We found that individuals who demonstrated accuracy associated with physiological arousal changes, and who showed a heightened fear of the consequences of arousal symptoms, modified their actions by decreasing their power output (mean Watts•kg-1) in a sprint task (ΔR2 = 0.19; F(1,34) = 19.87); p<0.001). These findings provide a basis for understanding the varying actions taken as we encounter bodily perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2928285283,"Peanut seeds are ideal bioreactors for the production of foreign recombinant proteins and/or nutrient metabolites. Seed-Specific Promoters (SSPs) are important molecular tools for bioreactor research. However, few SSPs have been characterized in peanut seeds. The mining of Seed-Specific Candidate Genes (SSCGs) is a prerequisite for promoter cloning. Here, we described an approach for the genome-wide mining of SSCGs via comparative gene expression between seed and nonseed tissues. Three hundred thirty-seven SSCGs were ultimately identified, and the top 108 SSCGs were characterized. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that some SSCGs were involved in seed development, allergens, seed storage and fatty acid metabolism. RY REPEAT and GCN4 motifs, which are commonly found in SSPs, were dispersed throughout most of the promoters of SSCGs. Expression pattern analysis revealed that all 108 SSCGs were expressed specifically or preferentially in the seed. These results indicated that the promoters of the 108 SSCGs may perform functions in a seed-specific and/or seed-preferential manner. Moreover, a novel SSP was cloned and characterized from a paralogous gene of SSCG29 from cultivated peanut. Together with the previously characterized SSP of the SSCG5 paralogous gene in cultivated peanut, these results implied that the method for SSCG identification in this study was feasible and accurate. The SSCGs identified in this work could be widely applied to SSP cloning by other researchers. Additionally, this study identified a low-cost, high-throughput approach for exploring tissue-specific genes in other crop species."
https://openalex.org/W2932411505,"Reducing delays in hospital discharge is important to improve transition processes and reduce health care costs. The recently proposed post-acute care discharge score focusing on the self-care abilities before hospital admission allows early identification of patients with a need for post-acute care. New limitations in self-care abilities identified during hospitalization may also indicate a risk. Our aim was to investigate whether the addition of the post-acute care discharge score and a validated self-care instrument would improve the prognostic accuracy to predict post-acute discharge needs in unselected medical inpatients.We included consecutive adult medical and neurological inpatients. Logistic regression models with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated to study associations of post-acute discharge score and self-care index with post-acute discharge risk. We calculated joint regression models and reclassification statistics including the net reclassification index and integrated discrimination improvement to investigate whether merging the self-care index and the post-acute discharge score leads to better diagnostic accuracy.Out of 1342 medical and 402 neurological patients, 150 (11.18%) and 94 (23.38%) have reached the primary endpoint of being discharged to a post-acute care facility. Multivariate analysis showed that the self-care index is an outcome predictor (OR 0.897, 95%CI 0.864-0.930). By combining the self-care index and the post-acute care discharge score discrimination for medical (from area under the curve 0.77 to 0.83) and neurological patients (from area under the curve 0.68 to 0.78) could be significantly improved. Reclassification statistics also showed significant improvements with regard to net reclassification index (14.2%, p<0.05) and integrated discrimination improvement (4.83%, p<0.05).Incorporating an early assessment of patients' actual intrahospital self-care ability to the post-acute care discharge score led to an improved prognostic accuracy for identifying adult, medical and neurological patients at risk for discharge to a post-acute care facility."
https://openalex.org/W2951684015,"Since their inception, several tools have been developed for cluster analysis and heatmap construction. The application of such tools to the number and types of genome-wide data available from next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies requires the adaptation of statistical concepts, such as in defining a most variable gene set, and more intricate cluster analyses method to address multiple omic data types. Additionally, the growing number of publicly available datasets has created the desire to estimate the statistical significance of a gene signature derived from one dataset to similarly group samples based on another dataset. The currently available number of tools and their combined use for generating heatmaps, along with the several adaptations of statistical concepts for addressing the higher dimensionality of genome-wide NGS-derived data, has created a further challenge in the ability to replicate heatmap results. We introduce NOJAH (NOt Just Another Heatmap), an interactive tool that defines and implements a workflow for genome-wide cluster analysis and heatmap construction by creating and combining several tools into a single user interface. NOJAH includes several newly developed scripts for techniques that though frequently applied are not sufficiently documented to allow for replicability of results. These techniques include: defining a most variable gene set (a.k.a., 'core genes'), estimating the statistical significance of a gene signature to separate samples into clusters, and performing a result merging integrated cluster analysis. With only a user uploaded dataset, NOJAH provides as output, among other things, the minimum documentation required for replicating heatmap results. Additionally, NOJAH contains five different existing R packages that are connected in the interface by their functionality as part of a defined workflow for genome-wide cluster analysis. The NOJAH application tool is available at http://bbisr.shinyapps.winship.emory.edu/NOJAH/ http://shinygispa.winship.emory.edu/shinyGISPA/ with corresponding source code available at https://github.com/bbisr-shinyapps/NOJAH/."
https://openalex.org/W2934276515,"In this era of clinical genomics, the accumulation of knowledge of pharmacogenomics (PGx) is rising dramatically and attempts to utilize it in clinical practice are also increasing. However, this advanced knowledge and information have not yet been sufficiently utilized in the clinical field due to various barriers including physician factors. This study was conducted to evaluate the attitudes of physicians to PGx services by providing them their own genomic data analysis report focusing on PGx. We also tried to evaluate the clinical applicability of whole exome sequencing (WES)-based functional PGx test. In total 88 physicians participated in the study from September 2015 to August 2016. Physicians who agreed to participate in the study were asked to complete a pre-test survey evaluating their knowledge of and attitude toward clinical genomics including PGx. Only those who completed the pre-test survey proceeded to WES and were provided with a personal PGx analysis report in an offline group meeting. Physicians who received these PGx reports were asked to complete a follow-up survey within two weeks. We then analyzed changes in their knowledge and attitude after reviewing their own PGx analysis results through differences in their pre-test and post-test survey responses. In total, 70 physicians (79.5%) completed the pre-test and post-test surveys and attended an off-line seminar to review their personal PGx reports. After physicians reviewed the report, their perception of and attitude towards the PGx domain and genomics significantly changed. Physician’ awareness of the likelihood of occurrence of adverse drug reactions and genetic contribution was also changed significantly. Overall, physicians were very positive about the value and potential of the PGx test but maintained a conservative stance on its actual clinical use. Results revealed that physicians’ perception and attitude to the utility of PGx testing was significantly changed after reviewing their own WES results."
https://openalex.org/W2925895163,"Accumulating research document the needs of intervention towards mental health problems in early childhood. The general child health surveillance offers opportunities for early detection of mental health vulnerability, conditioned the availability of feasible and validated measures. The Copenhagen Infant Mental Health Questionnaire, CIMHQ, was developed to be feasible for community health nurses and comprehensive regarding the range of mental health problems seen in infancy. Previous testing of the CIMHQ has documented feasibility and face validity. The aim was to investigate the construct validity of the general population measure by using the Rasch measurement models, and to explore the differential functioning of the CIMHQ relative to a number of characteristics of the infants, local independence of items, and possible latent classes of infants. CIMHQ was tested in 2,973 infants from the general population, aged 9–10 months. The infants were assessed by community health nurses at home visits, in the period from March 2011 to December 2013. Rasch measurement models were used to investigate the construct validity of the CIMHQ. Analyses showed an overall construct valid scale of mental health problems, consisting of seven valid subscales of specific problems concerning eating, sleep, emotional reactions, attention, motor activity, communication, and language, respectively. The CIMHQ fitted a graphical loglinear Rasch model without differential item function. Analyses of local homogeneity identified two latent classes of infants. A simple model with almost no local dependency between items is proposed for infants with few problems, whereas a more complicated model characterizes infants with more problems. The measure CIMHQ differentiates between infants from the general population with few and more mental health problems, and between subgroups of problems that potentially can be targets of preventive intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2926284594,"With worldwide prevalence rates between 10% and 20%, mental illness in children and adolescents is an issue for which culturally sensitive screening tools are needed. The Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a commonly used measure that has been translated into numerous languages, although some research suggests issues with cross-cultural validity. Only four other studies have tested the Spanish-language SDQ in Latin America. In this study, we aimed to help fill this gap by assessing the factor structure of the parent or teacher version of the Spanish-language SDQ (for children ages 4-17) with 967 parent or other caregiver respondents of primary school-aged children (ages 4 to 17) in the Department of Intibucá, Honduras. When unable to find a good fitting factor model previously identified in the literature, we conducted split sample exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), along with measurement invariance testing with the best fitting EFA-extracted model based on gender for caregiver respondent and child gender. Results showed that while many EFA models had a good fit, CFI and TLI was < .90 for all extracted models when confirmed in the second sample with CFA. We then modified the best fitting extracted three-factor, 24-item model, which dropped item 15, by allowing select item residuals to correlate, increasing CFI and TLI to > .90 for female child gender. This modified three-factor model was partially invariant for configural and scalar models between child genders. Configural and scalar models would not converge for adult genders. Of note, metric models were not produced in Mplus related to items' cross-loading on more than one factor. These findings suggest that the SDQ Spanish language parent or teacher version may not perform optimally cross-culturally in this area of Honduras. Future research should confirm these findings with other Honduran populations."
https://openalex.org/W2928629371,"This paper presents the first empirical investigation that compares Euler and linear diagrams when they are used to represent set cardinality. A common approach is to use area-proportional Euler diagrams but linear diagrams can exploit length-proportional straight-lines for the same purpose. Another common approach is to use numerical annotations. We first conducted two empirical studies, one on Euler diagrams and the other on linear diagrams. These suggest that area-proportional Euler diagrams with numerical annotations and length-proportional linear diagrams without numerical annotations support significantly better task performance. We then conducted a third study to investigate which of these two notations should be used in practice. This suggests that area-proportional Euler diagrams with numerical annotations most effectively supports task performance and so should be used to visualize set cardinalities. However, these studies focused on data that can be visualized reasonably accurately using circles and the results should be taken as valid within that context. Future work needs to determine whether the results generalize both to when circles cannot be used and for other ways of encoding cardinality information."
https://openalex.org/W2929349217,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a respiratory disease that affects chickens. It is caused by the alphaherpesvirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). This virus undergoes lytic replication in the epithelial cells of the trachea and upper respiratory tract (URT) and establishes latent infection in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and trachea. Live attenuated vaccines are widely used to control ILT. At least one of these vaccines can establish latent infections in chickens, but this has not been demonstrated for all vaccines. The aim of the current study was to determine the capacity of three commercially available vaccines (SA2, A20 and Serva) and a glycoprotein G deletion mutant vaccine candidate (ΔgG ILTV) to establish latent infection in the TG of specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens. Five groups of 7-day-old SPF chickens were eye-drop vaccinated with either one of the vaccine strains or mock-vaccinated with sterile media and followed until 20 or 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). ILTV DNA was detected at 20–21 dpv in the TG of 23/40 (57.5%) vaccinated SPF chickens (SA2 = 10/10; A20 = 6/10; Serva = 3/10; ΔgG = 4/10) by PCR, but virus could not be reactivated from TG co-cultivated with primary chicken embryo kidney cells. In the birds from which ILTV DNA was detected in the TG, ILTV DNA could not be detected in the URT or trachea of 3 birds in each of the SA2, A20 and Serva vaccinated groups, and in 4 birds in the ΔgG vaccinated group, indicating that these birds were latently infected in the absence of active lytic replication and virus shedding. Results from this study demonstrate the capacity of commercial ILTV vaccines to establish latent infections and underline their importance in the epidemiology of this disease."

Materials and methods Seventeen consecutive patients with suspected spinal vascular disease were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent combined low-dose TR CE-MRA and three-dimensional single-phase HR CE-MRA at 3 Tesla, followed by conventional spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 90 days. Six patients underwent additional spinal MRA and DSA for treatment follow-up. Spinal lesions were analyzed in terms of presence, disease type, laterality, spinal level, and number of arterial feeders. Results Low-dose TR CE-MRA helped proper localization of subsequent HR CE-MRA in two patients with high or low level of the lesion. For initial detection of spinal vascular disease, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CE-MRA were 93.3% (n = 14/15), 100% (n = 3/3), and 94.4% (n = 17/18), respectively. In characterization of dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF), perimedullary AVF, spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and extraspinal AVM, CE-MRA correctly characterized in 86.7% (n = 13/15) among the positive findings, and in 88.9% (n = 16/18) among the several patients including negative results. CE-MRA showed matched per-case localization of arterial feeders within 1 vertebral level in 80% (n = 12/15), and matched per-lesion localization in 78.3% (n = 18/23). Conclusion Combined low-dose TR CE-MRA and single-phase HR CE-MRA at 3 Tesla was an effective and accurate non-invasive tool for the pre-angiographic evaluation of spinal vascular diseases in a single session."
https://openalex.org/W2934130030,"Clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have generated mixed results partially due to the poorly defined effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors in PDAC. Here, we studied a panel of PDAC cell lines to compare the IC50s of the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and cetuximab. We found that gefitinib induced biphasic inhibition in over 50% of PDAC cells, with the initial growth inhibition occurring at nanomolar concentrations and a second growth inhibition occurring outside the clinical range. In contrast to gefitinib, cetuximab produced a single phase growth inhibition in a subset of PDAC cells. Using this sensitivity data, we screened for correlations between cell morphology proteins and EGFR ligands to EGFR inhibitor sensitivity, and found that mesothelin and the EGFR ligand TGF-α have a strong correlation to gefitinib and cetuximab sensitivity. Analysis of downstream signaling pathways indicated that plc-γ1 and c-myc were consistently inhibited by EGFR inhibitor treatment in sensitive cell lines. While an inconsistent additive effect was observed with either cetuximab or gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine, the cell pathway data indicated consistent ERK activation, leading us to pursue EGFR inhibitors in combination with trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor. Both cetuximab and gefitinib in combination with trametinib produced an additive effect in all EGFR sensitive cell lines. Our results indicate that mesothelin and TGF-α can predict PDAC sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and a combination of EGFR inhibitors with trametinib could be a novel effective treatment for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2934244108,"The aim of this study was to investigate the running pace and step characteristics among various competitive-level 400-m hurdlers through inter-group and intra-athlete comparisons. We analysed spatiotemporal data involving the split time, mean step length (SL) and mean step frequency (SF) for 13 male world-class and 14 male national-level 400-m hurdlers. We analysed 16.5 ± 3.9 races for each world-class hurdler and 19.8 ± 6.0 races for each national-level hurdler (the total number of analysed runs was 491) using publicly available television and internet broadcasts. Inter-group comparisons showed that both first- and latter-halves split times of the world-class hurdlers were significantly shorter than those of the national-level hurdlers. In the latter-half phase, no significant differences of SL and SF were observed between the world-class and national level hurdlers. Intra-athlete comparisons showed that no athletes favoured only first-half phase in terms of running speed in short finish times. In contrast, finish times of all hurdlers were sensitive to running speed in the latter-half phase. In the latter half of the race, 18 of the 27 hurdlers were identified as being SF reliant during speed enhancements; running speed of the other 9 hurdlers were also sensitive to high SF. In conclusions, important findings regarding high performance in inter-group comparisons do not always corresponded with those in intra-athlete comparisons. All athletes and coaches should first prioritize maintaining high running speeds in the latter half of 400-m hurdles rather than in the first half of the race."
https://openalex.org/W2926642171,"Effective vaccine design relies on accurate knowledge of protection against a pathogen, so as to be able to induce relevant and effective protective responses against it. An ideal Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine should induce humoral as well as cellular immune responses to prevent initial infection of host cells or limit early events of viral dissemination. A Phase I HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine trial sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) was conducted in India in 2009.The trial tested a HIV-1 subtype C vaccine in a prime-boost regimen, comprising of a DNA prime (ADVAX) and Modified Vaccine Ankara (MVA) (TBC-M4) boost. The trial reported that the vaccine regimen was safe, well tolerated, and resulted in enhancement of HIV-specific immune responses. However, preliminary immunological studies were limited to vaccine-induced IFN-γ responses against the Env and Gag peptides. The present study is a retrospective study to characterize in detail the nature of the vaccine-induced cell mediated immune responses among volunteers, using Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) that were archived during the trial. ELISpot was used to measure IFN-γ responses and polyfunctional T cells were analyzed by intracellular multicolor flow cytometry. It was observed that DNA priming and MVA boosting induced Env and Gag specific bi-functional and multi-functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2. The heterologous prime-boost regimen appeared to be slightly superior to the homologous prime-boost regimen in inducing favorable cell mediated immune responses. These results suggest that an in-depth analysis of vaccine-induced cellular immune response can aid in the identification of correlates of an effective immunogenic response, and inform future design of HIV vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2930982425,"During mammalian pregnancy and lactation, the maternal demand for calcium is increased to satisfy fetus and newborn skeletal growth. In addition to the dietary intake, females use the calcium contained in their bones to supply this increased demand, leading to a decrease in maternal bone mineral content. In reproductive insectivorous female bats, bone loss has been described as a physiological cost of reproduction, due to the reported increased risk of bone fracture. This physiological cost may be the mechanism underlying the conflict between increasing litter size and maintaining wing skeletal integrity, which would help to explain the small litter size of most bat species. If bone loss is a linking cost between reproduction and survival in bats, and most bat species have small litter sizes, one would expect to find a loss of bone and an increasing probability of bone fracture during pregnancy and lactation in other non-insectivorous bats. In this study, we tested for the existence of this cost in the Great-fruit eating bat, Artibeus lituratus. We analyzed trabecular structure, bone strength and bone mineral content for the humerus bone, hypothesizing that bone loss during reproduction in females would increase the risk of fracture. Our results showed a decrease of 22–31% in bone trabecular area in lactating females, rapidly compensated following weaning. Bone strength did not differ among reproductive and non-reproductive groups and seems to be more influenced by bone organic components rather than mineral contents. Since we observed bone loss during reproduction yet the humerus strength seems to be unaffected, we suggest that bone loss may not represent a physiological cost during reproduction for this frugivorous bat."
https://openalex.org/W2927143094,"Low-rank representation-based frameworks are becoming popular for the saliency and the object detection because of their easiness and simplicity. These frameworks only need global features to extract the salient objects while the local features are compromised. To deal with this issue, we regularize the low-rank representation through a local graph-regularization and a maximum mean-discrepancy regularization terms. Firstly, we introduce a novel feature space that is extracted by combining the four feature spaces like CIELab, RGB, HOG and LBP. Secondly, we combine a boundary metric, a candidate objectness metric and a candidate distance metric to compute the low-level saliency map. Thirdly, we extract salient and non-salient dictionaries from the low-level saliency. Finally, we regularize the low-rank representation through the Laplacian regularization term that saves the structural and geometrical features and using the mean discrepancy term that reduces the distribution divergence and connections among similar regions. The proposed model is tested against seven latest salient region detection methods using the precision-recall curve, receiver operating characteristics curve, F-measure and mean absolute error. The proposed model remains persistent in all the tests and outperformed against the selected models with higher precision value."

Our device has an electron emission element that allows, for the first time, stable emission of electrons into an atmosphere. Atmospheric electrons react with gas molecules to generate radicals and negative ions, which induce a variety of biochemical reactions in the attached cell culture system. In this study, we demonstrated the effect of this new electron emission-based cell culture device on cell proliferation and differentiation using pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Electron emission stimulation (EES) was applied directly to culture medium containing plated cells, after which the number of living cells, the mRNA levels of osteogenesis-related genes, and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were evaluated. The growth rate of EES-exposed cells increased by approximately 20% in comparison with unexposed control cells. We also found the mRNA levels of osteogenic specific genes such as collagen type I α-1, core-binding factor α-1, and osteocalcin to be up-regulated following EES. ALP activity, a marker for osteogenic activity, was significantly enhanced in EES-treated cells. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species generated by EES were measured to determine their effect on MC3T3-E1 cells. These results suggest that our new electron emission-based cell culture device, while providing a relatively weak stimulus in comparison with atmospheric plasma systems, promotes cell proliferation and differentiation. This system is expected to find application in regenerative medicine, specifically in relation to bone regeneration."

Loss of these cells in glaucoma, an eye disease with loss of retinal ganglion cells as its key feature, might thus result in a change in chronotype. We aimed to compare the chronotype between glaucoma patients and healthy subjects. Methods We sent the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire to 221 glaucoma patients (response rate 81%); controls (primary control group) were primarily their spouses. After exclusion of shift workers and participants who woke-up due to an alarm clock on days off, 159 glaucoma patients (88 early, 21 moderate, 23 severe) and 163 controls remained. We calculated chronotype as the mid-sleep on days off, corrected for workweek accumulated sleep debt (MSFsc). We compared means and variances between groups using Welch’s tests and F-tests, respectively. A secondary control group was recruited from participants in a citizen-science project (n = 17073) who completed an online questionnaire. A resampling method was applied to enable an age- and gender- matched comparison with the glaucoma patients. Results Compared to the primary control group, glaucoma did not affect the mean MSFsc (controls 3:47; early, moderate, and severe glaucoma 3:40, 3:45, and 3:33, respectively [P = 0.62]). Chronotype variability seemed to increase with increasing disease severity (severe glaucoma versus controls: P = 0.023). The mean MSFsc of the secondary control group was 3:50 (95% confidence interval 3:48 to 3:52); significantly later than that of the glaucoma patients (3:40; P = 0.024). Mean MSFsc did not differ significantly between the control groups (P = 0.42). Conclusions No clear changes were found in the chronotype as determined by sleep phase in patients with glaucoma, especially not in early and moderate glaucoma. In severe glaucoma, chronotype variability seems to increase, possibly alongside a small advancement."
https://openalex.org/W2927080518,"Vasarely’s nested squares illusion shows that the corners of concentric squares, arranged in a gradient of increasing or decreasing luminance, generate illusory “corner-folds,” which appear more salient (either brighter or darker) than the adjacent flat (non- corner) regions of each individual square. The Alternating Brightness Star (ABS) illusion, based on Vasarely’s classic nested squares, further shows that the strength of these corner-folds depends on corner angle. Previous psychophysical studies showed the relationship between corner angle and perceived contrast in the ABS illusion to be linear, with sharp angles looking higher in contrast, and shallow angles lower in contrast. Center-surround difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) modeling did not replicate this linear relationship, however, suggesting that a full neural explanation of the nested squares and ABS illusions might be found in the visual cortex, rather than at subcortical stages. Here we recorded the responses from single area V1 neurons in the awake primate, during the presentation of visual stimuli containing illusory corner-folds of various angles. Our results showed stronger neural responses for illusory corner-folds made from sharper than from shallower corners, consistent with predictions from the previous psychophysical work. The relationship between corner angle and strength of the neuronal responses, albeit parametric, was apparently non-linear. This finding was in line with the previous DOG data, but not with the psychophysical data. Our combined results suggest that, whereas corner-fold illusions likely originate from center-surround retinogeniculate processes, their complete neural explanation may be found in extrastriate visual cortical areas."
