https://openalex.org/W2955321733,"Summary Knowledge abstracted from previous experiences can be transferred to aid new learning. Here, we asked whether such abstract knowledge immediately guides the replay of new experiences. We first trained participants on a rule defining an ordering of objects and then presented a novel set of objects in a scrambled order. Across two studies, we observed that representations of these novel objects were reactivated during a subsequent rest. As in rodents, human “replay” events occurred in sequences accelerated in time, compared to actual experience, and reversed their direction after a reward. Notably, replay did not simply recapitulate visual experience, but followed instead a sequence implied by learned abstract knowledge. Furthermore, each replay contained more than sensory representations of the relevant objects. A sensory code of object representations was preceded 50 ms by a code factorized into sequence position and sequence identity. We argue that this factorized representation facilitates the generalization of a previously learned structure to new objects."
https://openalex.org/W2956087440,"Accurate prediction of long-term outcomes remains a challenge in the care of cancer patients. Due to the difficulty of serial tumor sampling, previous prediction tools have focused on pretreatment factors. However, emerging non-invasive diagnostics have increased opportunities for serial tumor assessments. We describe the Continuous Individualized Risk Index (CIRI), a method to dynamically determine outcome probabilities for individual patients utilizing risk predictors acquired over time. Similar to “win probability” models in other fields, CIRI provides a real-time probability by integrating risk assessments throughout a patient’s course. Applying CIRI to patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, we demonstrate improved outcome prediction compared to conventional risk models. We demonstrate CIRI’s broader utility in analogous models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast adenocarcinoma and perform a proof-of-concept analysis demonstrating how CIRI could be used to develop predictive biomarkers for therapy selection. We envision that dynamic risk assessment will facilitate personalized medicine and enable innovative therapeutic paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W2954133571,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation is part of the neutrophil response to infections, but excessive or inappropriate NETosis may trigger the production of autoantibodies and cause organ damage in autoimmune disorders. Spontaneously netting neutrophils are not frequent and induction of NET in vitro by selected stimuli is necessary to investigate their structure. In the present work, the protein composition and post-translational modifications of NET produced under different stimuli have been studied by means of proteomic analysis. Neutrophils from healthy donors were stimulated by PMA, A23187, Escherichia coli LPS or untreated; after three hours, cells were washed, treated with DNase and supernatants collected for mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses. We identified proteins contained in NETs of any source or exclusive of one stimulus: LPS-induced and spontaneous NET diverge in protein composition, while PMA- and A23187-induced NET appear more similar. Among the post-translational modifications we examined, methionine sulfoxidation is frequent especially in PMA- and LPS-induced NETs. Myeloperoxidase is the protein more extensively modified. Thus, proteomic analysis indicates that NETs induced by different stimuli are heterogeneous in terms of both protein composition and post-translational modifications, suggesting that NET induced in different conditions may have different biological effects."

https://openalex.org/W2953886068,"Decisions occur in dynamic environments. In the framework of reinforcement learning, the probability of performing an action is influenced by decision variables. Discrepancies between predicted and obtained rewards (reward prediction errors) update these variables, but they are otherwise stable between decisions. Although reward prediction errors have been mapped to midbrain dopamine neurons, it is unclear how the brain represents decision variables themselves. We trained mice on a dynamic foraging task in which they chose between alternatives that delivered reward with changing probabilities. Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, including projections to the dorsomedial striatum, maintained persistent firing rate changes over long timescales. These changes stably represented relative action values (to bias choices) and total action values (to bias response times) with slow decay. In contrast, decision variables were weakly represented in the anterolateral motor cortex, a region necessary for generating choices. Thus, we define a stable neural mechanism to drive flexible behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2957430216,"Unplanned readmission of a hospitalized patient is an indicator of patients' exposure to risk and an avoidable waste of medical resources. In addition to hospital readmission, intensive care unit (ICU) readmission brings further financial risk, along with morbidity and mortality risks. Identification of high-risk patients who are likely to be readmitted can provide significant benefits for both patients and medical providers. The emergence of machine learning solutions to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities for developing an efficient discharge decision-making support system for physicians and ICU specialists.We used supervised machine learning approaches for ICU readmission prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the MIMIC-III to predict the ICU readmission of patients within 30 days of their discharge. We incorporate multiple types of features including chart events, demographic, and ICD-9 embeddings. We have utilized recent machine learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), by this we have been able to incorporate the multivariate features of EHRs and capture sudden fluctuations in chart event features (e.g. glucose and heart rate). We show that our LSTM-based solution can better capture high volatility and unstable status in ICU patients, an important factor in ICU readmission. Our machine learning models identify ICU readmissions at a higher sensitivity rate of 0.742 (95% CI, 0.718-0.766) and an improved Area Under the Curve of 0.791 (95% CI, 0.782-0.800) compared with traditional methods. We perform in-depth deep learning performance analysis, as well as the analysis of each feature contribution to the predictive model.Our manuscript highlights the ability of machine learning models to improve our ICU decision-making accuracy and is a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals. These data-driven solutions hold the potential for substantial clinical impact by augmenting clinical decision-making for physicians and ICU specialists. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, hospital administration, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W2956029799,"Stromal cell populations that maintain hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are generally characterized in steady-state conditions. Here, we report a comprehensive atlas of bone marrow stromal cell subpopulations under homeostatic and stress conditions using mass cytometry (CyTOF)-based single-cell protein analysis. We identified 28 subsets of non-hematopoietic cells during homeostasis, 14 of which expressed hematopoietic regulatory factors. Irradiation-based conditioning for HSPC transplantation led to the loss of most of these populations, including the LeptinR+ and Nestin+ subsets. In contrast, a subset expressing Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) was retained and a specific CD73+NGFRhigh population expresses high levels of cytokines during homeostasis and stress. Genetic ablation of CD73 compromised HSPC transplantation in an acute setting without long-term changes in bone marrow HSPCs. Thus, this protein-based expression mapping reveals distinct sets of stromal cells in the bone marrow and how they change in clinically relevant stress settings to contribute to early stages of hematopoietic regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2958682939,"This study aimed to develop and validate deep-learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting mortality of AHF (DAHF).12,654 dataset from 2165 patients with AHF in two hospitals were used as train data for DAHF development, and 4759 dataset from 4759 patients with AHF in 10 hospitals enrolled to the Korean AHF registry were used as performance test data. The endpoints were in-hospital, 12-month, and 36-month mortality. We compared the DAHF performance with the Get with the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) score, Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) score, and other machine-learning models by using the test data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the DAHF were 0.880 (95% confidence interval, 0.876-0.884) for predicting in-hospital mortality; these results significantly outperformed those of the GWTG-HF (0.728 [0.720-0.737]) and other machine-learning models. For predicting 12- and 36-month endpoints, DAHF (0.782 and 0.813) significantly outperformed MAGGIC score (0.718 and 0.729). During the 36-month follow-up, the high-risk group, defined by the DAHF, had a significantly higher mortality rate than the low-risk group(p<0.001).DAHF predicted the in-hospital and long-term mortality of patients with AHF more accurately than the existing risk scores and other machine-learning models."
https://openalex.org/W2959970591,"Purpose To develop and validate a classifier system for prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) Gleason score (GS) using radiomics and texture features of T2-weighted imaging (T2w), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) acquired using high b values, and T2-mapping (T2). Methods T2w, DWI (12 b values, 0–2000 s/mm2), and T2 data sets of 62 patients with histologically confirmed PCa were acquired at 3T using surface array coils. The DWI data sets were post-processed using monoexponential and kurtosis models, while T2w was standardized to a common scale. Local statistics and 8 different radiomics/texture descriptors were utilized at different configurations to extract a total of 7105 unique per-tumor features. Regularized logistic regression with implicit feature selection and leave pair out cross validation was used to discriminate tumors with 3+3 vs >3+3 GS. Results In total, 100 PCa lesions were analysed, of those 20 and 80 had GS of 3+3 and >3+3, respectively. The best model performance was obtained by selecting the top 1% features of T2w, ADCm and K with ROC AUC of 0.88 (95% CI of 0.82–0.95). Features from T2 mapping provided little added value. The most useful texture features were based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix, Gabor transform, and Zernike moments. Conclusion Texture feature analysis of DWI, post-processed using monoexponential and kurtosis models, and T2w demonstrated good classification performance for GS of PCa. In multisequence setting, the optimal radiomics based texture extraction methods and parameters differed between different image types."
https://openalex.org/W2955120944,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy due to the silent nature on its early onset and the rapid acquisition of drug resistance. Histologically heterogeneous, it includes several subtypes with different mutational landscapes, hampering the development of effective targeted therapies. Non-coding RNAs are emerging as potential new therapeutic targets in cancer. To search for a microRNA signature related to ovarian carcinomas and study its potential as effective targeted therapy, we examined the expression of 768 miRNA in a large collection of tumor samples and found miR-654-5p to be infraexpressed in ovarian serous carcinomas, the most common and aggressive type. Restoration of miR-654-5p levels reduced tumor cell viability in vitro and in vivo and impaired sphere formation capacity and viability of ovarian cancer patient-derived ascitic cells ex vivo. CDCP1 and PLAGL2 oncogenes were found to be the most relevant direct miR-654-5p targets and both genes convey in a molecular signature associated with key cancer pathways relevant to ovarian tumorigenesis, such as MYC, WNT and AKT pathways. Together, we unveiled the tumor suppressor function of miR-654-5p, suggesting that its restoration or co-targeting of CDCP1 and PLAGL2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2961010067,"Administrative healthcare databases are useful and inexpensive tools that can provide a comprehensive assessment of the burden of diseases in terms of major outcomes, such as mortality, hospital readmissions, and use of healthcare resources. However, a crucial issue is the reliability of information gathered. The aim of this study was to validate ICD-9 codes for several major cardiovascular conditions, i.e., acute myocardial infarction (AMI), atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF), and heart failure (HF), in order to use them for epidemiological, outcome, and health services research.Data from the centralised administrative database of the Umbria Region (890,000 residents, located in Central Italy) were considered. Patients with a first hospital discharge for AMI, AF/flutter, and HF, between 2012 and 2014, were identified using ICD-9-CM codes in primary position. A sample of cases and non-cases was randomly selected, and the corresponding medical charts reviewed by specifically trained investigators. For each disease, case ascertainment was based on all clinical, laboratory, and instrumental examinations available in medical charts. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated.We reviewed 458 medical charts, 128 for AMI, 127 for AF/flutter, 127 for HF, and 76 of non-cases for each condition. Diagnostic accuracy measures of the original discharge diagnosis were as follows. AMI: sensitivity 98% (95% CI, 94-100%), specificity 91% (95% CI, 83-97%), positive predictive value (PPV) 95% (95% CI, 89-98%), negative predictive value (NPV) 97% (95% CI, 91-100%). AF/flutter: sensitivity 95% (95% CI, 90-98%), specificity 95% (95% CI, 87-99%), PPV 97% (95% CI, 92-99%), NPV 92% (95% CI, 84-97%). HF: sensitivity 96% (95% CI, 91-99%), specificity 90% (95% CI, 81-96%), PPV 94% (95% CI, 88-97%), NPV 93% (95% CI, 85-98%).The case ascertainment for AMI, AF and flutter, and HF, showed a high level of accuracy (≥ 90%). The healthcare administrative database of the Umbria Region can be confidently used for epidemiological, outcome, and health services research."
https://openalex.org/W2962258696,"From 1 January 2018 came into force Regulation (EU) 2015/2238 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015, introducing the concept of “novel foods”, including insects and their parts. One of the most commonly used species of insects are: mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), house crickets (Acheta domesticus), cockroaches (Blattodea) and migratory locusts (Locusta migrans). In this context, the unfathomable issue is the role of edible insects in transmitting parasitic diseases that can cause significant losses in their breeding and may pose a threat to humans and animals. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate the developmental forms of parasites colonizing edible insects in household farms and pet stores in Central Europe and to determine the potential risk of parasitic infections for humans and animals. The experimental material comprised samples of live insects (imagines) from 300 household farms and pet stores, including 75 mealworm farms, 75 house cricket farms, 75 Madagascar hissing cockroach farms and 75 migrating locust farms. Parasites were detected in 244 (81.33%) out of 300 (100%) examined insect farms. In 206 (68.67%) of the cases, the identified parasites were pathogenic for insects only; in 106 (35.33%) cases, parasites were potentially parasitic for animals; and in 91 (30.33%) cases, parasites were potentially pathogenic for humans. Edible insects are an underestimated reservoir of human and animal parasites. Our research indicates the important role of these insects in the epidemiology of parasites pathogenic to vertebrates. Conducted parasitological examination suggests that edible insects may be the most important parasite vector for domestic insectivorous animals. According to our studies the future research should focus on the need for constant monitoring of studied insect farms for pathogens, thus increasing food and feed safety."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the participation and autonomy of persons with stroke, five years after a stroke, and to explore potential associations between factors and perceived restrictions in participation and autonomy.This five-year follow-up survey study included individuals diagnosed with a first-time stroke during 2009-2010, in Gothenburg. The survey included the Impact of Participation and Autonomy-questionnaire (IPA-E), which comprised five domains: Autonomy Indoor, Family Role, Autonomy Outdoor, Work & Education, and Social Life & Relationships. Logistic regression analyses were used to analyze factors associated with participation restrictions.At 5 years after a stroke, 457 patients were alive; of these, 281 responded to the follow-up survey. Participation restrictions were most pronounced in the IPA-E domains of Autonomy Outdoors, Work/Education, and Social Life and Relationships. In contrast, restrictions were less pronounced in the IPA-E domains of Autonomy Indoors and Family Role. Severe stroke, older age, and female sex predicted participation restrictions at five years after a stroke. Participation restrictions were partly explained by feelings of depression at five years after stroke. Problems associated with participation restrictions were most frequently observed in the areas of mobility, leisure, and help/support from other people.This study showed that participation and autonomy were restricted among persons with stroke at five years after the stroke. The domains perceived as most restricted were those that required high levels of physical, social, and cognitive abilities."

https://openalex.org/W2959753669,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly applied in ecological studies, including studies with the primary purpose of criminal investigation, in which eDNA from soil can be used to pair samples or reveal sample provenance. We collected soil eDNA samples as part of a large national biodiversity research project across 130 sites in Denmark. We investigated the potential for soil eDNA metabarcoding in predicting provenance in terms of environmental conditions, habitat type and geographic regions. We used linear regression for predicting environmental gradients of light, soil moisture, pH and nutrient status (represented by Ellenberg Indicator Values, EIVs) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) to predict habitat type and geographic region. eDNA data performed relatively well as a predictor of environmental gradients (R2 > 0.81). Its ability to discriminate between habitat types was variable, with high accuracy for certain forest types and low accuracy for heathland, which was poorly predicted. Geographic region was also less accurately predicted by eDNA. We demonstrated the application of provenance prediction in forensic science by evaluating and discussing two mock crime scenes. Here, we listed the plant species from annotated sequences, which can further aid in identifying the likely habitat or, in case of rare species, a geographic region. Predictions of environmental gradients and habitat types together give an overall accurate description of a crime scene, but care should be taken when interpreting annotated sequences, e.g. due to erroneous assignments in GenBank. Our approach demonstrates that important habitat properties can be derived from soil eDNA, and exemplifies a range of potential applications of eDNA in forensic ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2957548041,"In this paper, we explore the (in)efficiency of the continuum Bitcoin-USD market in the period ranging from mid 2010 to early 2019. To deal with, we dynamically analyse the evolution of the self-similarity exponent of Bitcoin-USD daily returns via accurate FD4 approach by a 512 day sliding window with overlapping data. Further, we define the memory indicator by the difference between the self-similarity exponent of Bitcoin-USD series and the self-similarity index of its shuffled series. We also carry out additional analyses via FD4 approach by sliding windows of sizes equal to 64, 128, 256, and 1024 days, and also via FD algorithm for values of q equal to 1 and 2 (and sliding windows equal to 512 days). Moreover, we explored the evolution of the self-similarity exponent of actual S&P500 series via FD4 algorithm by sliding windows of sizes equal to 256 and 512 days. In all the cases, the obtained results were found to be similar to our first analysis. We conclude that the self-similarity exponent of the BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series stands above 0.5. However, this is not due to the presence of significant memory in the series but to its underlying distribution. In fact, it holds that the self-similarity exponent of BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series is similar or lower than the self-similarity index of a random series with the same distribution. As such, several periods with significant antipersistent memory in BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series are distinguished."
https://openalex.org/W2959952884,"Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a uremic toxin associated with increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in patients with chronic kidney disease. Despite the crucial role of uremia-related immune dysfunction, a majority of studies attempting to elucidate its pathogenic role in CVD have focused on IS-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Thus, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in IS-induced production of TNF-α, a major cardiotoxic cytokine, by human macrophages. We found that crosstalk between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), NF-κB, and the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)2 is important for TNF-α production in IS-stimulated human macrophages. IS-activated AhR rapidly associates with the p65 NF-κB subunit, resulting in mutual inhibition of AhR and NF-κB and inhibition of TNF-α production at an early time point. Later, this repression of TNF-α production is alleviated when SOCS2, a negative modulator of NF-κB, is directly induced by IS-activated AhR. In addition, once free of inhibition, activated AhR induces TNF-α expression by interacting with AhR binding sites in the TNF-α gene. Lastly, we confirmed decreased AhR and increased SOCS2 expression in monocytes of patients with end-stage renal disease, indicating the activation of AhR. Taken together, our results suggest that IS-induced TNF-α production in macrophages is regulated through a complicated mechanism involving interaction of AhR, NF-κB, and SOCS2.-Kim, H. Y., Yoo, T.-H., Cho, J.-Y., Kim, H. C., Lee, W.-W. Indoxyl sulfate-induced TNF-α is regulated by crosstalk between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, NF-κB, and SOCS2 in human macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2962442907,"High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is involved in various diseases and is associated with the resistance of many types of human cancers to chemotherapy; however, its role in cancer metastasis remains unexplored. This study examined the HMGB1 status of both highly and poorly metastatic cancer cells in response to genotoxic stress. The weakly and highly metastatic mouse melanoma cell lines (B16 vs. B16-F10), human melanoma cell lines (SK-MEL-28 vs. SK-MEL-24), colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1 vs. LS174T), and wild-type (WT) vs. HMGB1 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated with doxorubicin (Dox) and camptothecin (CPT), and then cellular morphology, senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, lactate dehydrogenase release, and caspase-3 activation were used to assess cell fate. To investigate the role of HMGB1 in p21 expression, HMGB1 and p21 expressions were examined by Western blotting, and the HMGB1-mediated p21 promoter luciferase assay was performed after small interfering RNA or overexpression of HMGB1 prior to Dox treatment. Although highly metastatic mouse melanoma B16-F10 cells preferred senescence, with persistent HMGB1 expression, poorly metastatic B16 cells entered apoptosis, with decreasing HMGB1 levels via cleavage under Dox treatment. Similarly, more metastatic human melanoma SK-MEL-24 and human colon cancer LS174T cells underwent senescence, whereas fewer metastatic melanoma SK-MEL-28 and DLD-1 cells exhibited apoptosis under Dox stimulation. In senescent B16-F10, SK-MEL-24, and LS174T cells treated with Dox, p21 levels were increased by persistent HMGB1 expression. Furthermore, HMGB1 depletion caused a senescence-apoptosis shift with p21 down-regulation in B16-F10 cells, and HMGB1 overexpression switched from apoptosis to senescence concomitantly with increased p21 expression in B16 cells after Dox treatment. The same effects were observed in both cell pairs of mouse melanoma and human colon cancer cells treated with CPT, another genotoxic stressor. Indeed, although WT MEF entered senescence accompanied by p21 increase, HMGB1 KO underwent apoptosis with p21 decrease by Dox treatment. In our cell model system, we demonstrated that highly metastatic cancer cells preferentially enter senescence, whereas apoptosis predominates in weakly metastatic cancer cells under genotoxic stress, which depends on the presence or absence of HMGB1, suggesting that the HMGB1-p21 axis is required for genotoxic stress–induced senescence. These findings suggest that HMGB1 modulation of cancers with different metastatic status could be a strategy for selectively enforcing tumor suppression.—Lee, J.-J., Park, I. H., Rhee, W. J., Kim, H.

Pemt-/- mice fed a high-fat diet are protected against diet-induced obesity (DIO) and insulin resistance (IR) but develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with a decreased PC:PE ratio. We investigated whether the lack of hepatic PEMT or the lack of PEMT in other tissues (where it is expressed at low levels) is responsible for or contributes to the protection against DIO and IR in Pemt-/- mice. Furthermore, we investigated whether decreasing PEMT expression with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) would result in metabolic benefits in both lean and obese mice without negatively impacting liver health. We both restored hepatic PEMT in Pemt-/- mice via adeno-associated virus delivery and decreased hepatic PEMT with ASOs in wild-type and ob/ob mice. Weight gain, insulin sensitivity, and indices of liver function were determined. We report that the protection against DIO and IR and the development of NAFLD is dependent on hepatic PEMT activity. NAFLD, associated with a significant decrease in the hepatic PC:PE ratio, was exacerbated by PEMT deficiency in obese mice, suggesting that phospholipid insufficiency promotes NAFLD progression during obesity or overnutrition. Hepatic PEMT is critical for maintaining phospholipid balance, which is crucial for a healthy liver.-Wan, S., van der Veen, J. N., Bakala N'Goma, J.-C., Nelson, R. C., Vance, D. E., Jacobs, R. L.

However, the molecular mechanisms of membrane perturbation, as most studies are performed in model systems and in-cell structural studies, have yet to be achieved. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is a valuable technique to investigate peptide-membrane interactions and to determine the structure of peptides, but the short lifespan of bacteria, especially under magic angle spinning conditions, has not permitted in-cell structural studies. Here, we present the first dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-NMR in-cell studies of Escherichia coli bacteria incubated with the AMP maculatin 1.1 (Mac1) in combination with novel nitroxide spin-labeled peptides 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid (TOAC)-[F3W]-Mac1 (MacW) and TOAC-TOAC-MacW. The in-cell 13C and 15N signal NMR enhancements, and 1H spin-lattice T1 relaxation times showed that TOAC-MacW and TOAC-TOAC-MacW performed better than the more hydrophilic biradical AMUPol used for DNP studies. Furthermore, the pores formed by the AMP increased the signal enhancements and decreased T1 values of specifically 13C- and 15N-labeled Mac1.

https://openalex.org/W2956435003,"To date, there has been insufficient focus on age and sex differences in studies of violence amongst adolescents and young adults in low- and middle-income countries. As adolescence is a formative period during which experiencing violence can have both short- and long-term consequences, we aim to investigate experiences of violence by age and sex across five countries.Incidences of past-year violence victimization were estimated by sex across two-year age bands (13-24 years) using Violence Against Children Survey datasets from Cambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania. Analyses were conducted separately for each country. The presence of an association with age and each type of violence was identified using logistic regressions separately by sex. Sex was then added to the models as an interaction term and adjusted Wald tests were used to assess differences between males and females in age effects.Risk of physical violence by both an adult caregiver and a community member decreased with age for both sexes in all countries. In contrast, risk of IPV increased with age for both sexes in all countries. Although some countries displayed a steeper increase in risk of IPV and sexual violence with age for males, females face higher overall levels of risk for these forms of violence.Findings highlight how adolescents' and young adults' risk of violence changes with age and type of violence. The analysis underscores the importance of collecting violence data disaggregated by age and sex to best inform policies and programming.We analyzed five Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) and found age effects for physical, sexual, and intimate partner violence for adolescents 13-24 years old. Age effects for sexual violence are stronger among females than males. Future policies targeting adolescents should consider how age and gender influence risk of violence."

PPARGC1A and RORA are involved in circadian rhythm; circadian disturbances are one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. PPARGC1A is additionally linked to energy metabolism and the generation of amyloid beta plaques. RORA is involved in a variety of functions apart from circadian rhythm, such as cholesterol metabolism and inflammation. The ZNF423 gene resides in an Alzheimer’s disease-specific protein network and is likely involved with centrosomes and DNA damage repair."

The planting area of peanut is large in Henan province. Inceptisol is the main soil type in Henan Province and was used in laboratory experiments that were conducted to investigate imazapic degradation in soil under various environmental conditions. The results indicated that the imazapic degradation rate increased with an increase in temperature, soil pH, and soil moisture, and decreased with organic matter content. The use of biogas slurry as a soil amendment accelerated imazapic degradation. The half-life of imazapic in sterilized soil (364.7 d) was longer than in unsterilized soil (138.6 d), which suggested that there was a significant microbial contribution to imazapic degradation. Imazapic adsorption was also examined and was found to be well described by the Freundlich isotherm. The results indicate that soil has a certain adsorption capacity for imazapic."

In the present study, using a panel of Vietnamese rice landraces genotyped with 21,623 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for several leaf traits during the vegetative stage. Vietnamese landraces are often poorly represented in panels used for GWAS, even though they are adapted to contrasting agrosystems and can contain original, valuable genetic determinants. A panel of 180 rice varieties was grown in pots for four weeks with three replicates under nethouse conditions. Different leaf traits were measured on the second fully expanded leaf of the main tiller, which often plays a major role in determining the photosynthetic capacity of the plant. The leaf fresh weight, turgid weight and dry weight were measured; then, from these measurements, the relative tissue weight and leaf dry matter percentage were computed. The leaf dry matter percentage can be considered a proxy for the photosynthetic efficiency per unit leaf area, which contributes to yield. By a GWAS, thirteen QTLs associated with these leaf traits were identified. Eleven QTLs were identified for fresh weight, eleven for turgid weight, one for dry weight, one for relative tissue weight and one for leaf dry matter percentage. Eleven QTLs presented associations with several traits, suggesting that these traits share common genetic determinants, while one QTL was specific to leaf dry matter percentage and one QTL was specific to relative tissue weight. Interestingly, some of these QTLs colocalize with leaf- or yield-related QTLs previously identified using other material. Several genes within these QTLs with a known function in leaf development or physiology are reviewed."

Prospective cohort study of 200 medical residents and nursing students in India was conducted May 2016—December 2017. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON TB Gold Test-in-tube (QFT-GIT) were performed at study entry and 12 months. Primary outcome was incident LTBI (≥10mm TST induration and/or ≥0.35IU/mL QFT-GIT) at 12 months; secondary outcomes included baseline LTBI prevalence and risk factors for incident and prevalent LTBI using Poisson regression. Among 200, [90 nursing students and 110 medical residents], LTBI prevalence was 30% (95% CI, 24–37); LTBI incidence was 26.8 (95% CI, 18.6–37.2) cases per 100 person-years and differed by testing method (28.7 [95% CI, 20.6–38.9] vs 17.4 [95% CI, 11.5–25.4] cases per 100 person-years using TST and QFT-GIT, respectively). Medical residents had two-fold greater risk of incident LTBI than nursing students (Relative Risk, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05–4.42). During study period 6 (3%) HCWs were diagnosed with active TB disease. Overall, median number of self-reported TB exposures was 5 (Interquartile Range, 1–15). Of 60 participants with prevalent and incident LTBI who were offered free isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), only 2 participants initiated and completed IPT. High risk for LTBI was noted among medical residents compared to nursing students. Self-reported TB exposure is underreported, and uptake of LTBI prevention therapy remains low. New approaches are needed to identify HCWs at highest risk for LTBI."

This study presents the characteristics of the first documented influenza outbreak in indigenous peoples in Brazil, that occurred from 30th March to 14th April 2016 in a Guarani village in Southeast Region. Acute respiratory infections were prospectively investigated. The majority of the 73 cases were influenza-like illness (ILI) (63.0%) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (20.5%). The ILI+SARI attack rate (35.9%) decreased with increasing age. There was a high influenza vaccination rate (86.3%), but no statistically significant difference in vaccination rates between severe and non-severe cases was seen (p = 0.334). Molecular analyses of 19.2% of the cases showed 100% positivity for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and/or hRSV. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was included in the 6B.1 genetic group, a distinct cluster with 13 amino acid substitutions of A/California/07/2009-like. The hRSV were clustered in the BA-like genetic group. The early arrival of the influenza season overlapping usual hRSV season, the circulation of a drifted influenza virus not covered by vaccine and the high prevalence of risk factors for infection and severity in the village jointly can explain the high attack rate of ARI, even with a high rate of influenza vaccination. The results reinforce the importance of surveillance of respiratory viruses, timely vaccination and controlling risk factors for infection and severity of in the indigenous populations in order to preventing disease and related deaths, particularly in children."
https://openalex.org/W2956163172,"Visceral leishmaniasis is a deadly illness caused by Leishmania donovani that provokes liver and spleen inflammation and tissue destruction. In cutaneous leishmaniasis, the protein of L. major, named inhibitor of serine peptidases (ISP) 2, inactivates neutrophil elastase (NE) present at the macrophage surface, resulting in blockade of TLR4 activation, prevention of TNF-α* and IFN-β production, and parasite survival. We report poor intracellular growth of L. donovani in macrophages from knockout mice for NE (ela−/−), TLR4, or TLR2. NE and TLR4 colocalized with the parasite in the parasitophorous vacuole. Parasite load in the liver and spleen of ela−/− mice were reduced and accompanied by increased NO and decreased TGF-β production. Expression of ISP2 was not detected in L. donovani, and a transgenic line constitutively expressing ISP2, displayed poor intracellular growth in macrophages and decreased burden in mice. Infected ela−/− macrophages displayed significantly lower IFN-β mRNA than background mice macrophages, and the intracellular growth was fully restored by exogenous IFN-β. We propose that L. donovani utilizes the host NE-TLR machinery to induce IFN-β necessary for parasite survival and growth during early infection. Low or absent expression of parasite ISP2 in L. donovani is necessary to preserve the activation of the NE-TLR pathway.—Dias, B. T., Dias-Teixeira, K. L., Godinho, J. P., Faria, M.

https://openalex.org/W2959850081,"Signaling through the inducible costimulator ICOS is required for the homeostasis and function of various immune cell populations, with an outstanding role in the generation and maintenance of germinal centers. Very recently, it has been suggested that the clinical phenotype of ICOS-deficient patients is much broader than initially anticipated and the innate immune response might be also affected. However, the role of the ICOS/ICOS-Ligand axis in the homeostasis and development of innate NK cells is not known, and reports on its participation in NK cell activation are scarce. NK cells may express low levels of ICOS that are markedly enhanced upon activation. We show here that ICOS-deficient (ICOS-KO) mice present low NK cell numbers and defects in the homeostasis of these cells, with delayed maturation and altered expression of the developmental NK cell markers CD122, NK1.1, CD11b or CD27. Our experiments in mixed bone marrow chimera mice indicate that, both, cell-intrinsic defects of ICOS-KO NK and deficiencies in the milieu of these mice contribute to the altered phenotype. ICOS-deficient NK cells show impaired production of IFN-γ and cytotoxicity, and a final outcome of defects in NK cell-mediated effector function during the response to poly(I:C) or vaccinia virus infection in vivo. Interestingly, we show that murine innate cells like IL-2-cultured NK and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells can simultaneously express ICOS and ICOS-Ligand; both molecules are functional in NK intracellular signaling, enhancing early phosphorylation of Akt and Erk, or IFN-γ secretion in IL-2-activated NK cells. Our study shows the functional importance of the ICOS/ICOS-L pair in NK cell homeostasis, differentiation and activity and suggests novel therapeutic targets for NK manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2962311094,"DNA sequence plays an important role in the assembly of nucleosomes, and DNA motifs with high specificity to nucleosomes have been identified. At the same time, important questions such as how the DNA sequence changes DNA wrapping and how the DNA sequence contributes to the interaction between the nucleosomes remain unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by comparing nanoscale properties of nucleosomes assembled on the highest nucleosome positioning sequence, the 601 motif, and essentially random DNA sequences. We used atomic force microscopy to measure the nucleosome positions and the DNA wrapping. The studies showed that nucleosomes assemble on the nonspecific sequence without any preference for position on DNA, but they wrap the same DNA length as DNA of the same length with the 601 sequence. Experiments with longer DNA containing the 601 motif along with nonspecific DNA, capable of forming dinucleosomes, revealed that dinucleosomes assembled on hybrid sequences show a preference for positioning near each other, with one always assembling on the 601 motif. These findings point to the interaction between the nucleosomes and suggest that internucleosomal interactions may play a large role in nucleosome positioning.-Stormberg, T., Stumme-Diers, M., Lyubchenko, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2959452144,"Background Currently, there are many studies on the application of the 3D pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeled (3D-pcASL) perfusion MRI technique for adult brain examinations, but few studies exist on the application of the technique for child brain examinations. Purpose To explore the application of a 3D-pcASL perfusion MRI scan combined with postlabeling delay (PLD) for assessing neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Materials and methods Two-hundred neonates diagnosed with neonatal HIE were equally divided into five groups (40/group): 0- to <24-hour-old HIE group, 1- to <3-day-old HIE group, 3- to <7-day-old HIE group, 7- to <15-day-old HIE group and 15- to 28-day-old HIE group; 200 healthy neonates were equivalently divided. All 10 groups received a conventional and a 3D-pcASL perfusion MRI scan. For groups <3 days old, PLD values for the 3D-pcASL cerebral perfusion MRI scan were preset at 1025 ms; in all other groups, PLD values were preset at 1525 ms. CBF values for the 3D-pcASL cerebral perfusion MRI were compared between the HIE and corresponding control groups to determine the distinguishing characteristics of CBF values in HIE neonates. Results On the 3D-pcASL cerebral perfusion MRI scan, in the 1- to <3-day-old groups, HIE neonate CBF values were higher than those of controls in all brain regions (excluding the frontal lobe); in the 0- to <24-hour-old and 3- to <7-day-old groups, HIE neonate CBF values were lower than those of corresponding controls in all brain regions; in the 7- to <15-day-old and 15- to 28-day-old groups, there were no significant differences in the CBF values between groups in any brain regions. Conclusions The 3D-pcASL perfusion MRI scan combined with a PLD can assist in the early diagnosis of neonatal HIE, as this method more comprehensively reflects the HIE pathological process."

We describe the association between socioeconomic position and cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large rural population in north India. Methods We performed representative, community-based sampling from 2013 to 2014 of Solan district in Himachal Pradesh. We used education, occupation, household income, and household assets as indicators of socioeconomic position. We used tobacco use, alcohol use, low physical activity, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We performed hierarchical multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and clustering of the health sub-centers, to evaluate the cross-sectional association of socioeconomic position indicators and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Results Among 38,457 participants, mean (SD) age was 42.7 (15.9) years, and 57% were women. The odds of tobacco use was lowest in participants with graduate school and above education (adjusted OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.09, 0.13), household income >15,000 INR (adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.29, 0.43), and highest quartile of assets (adjusted OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.24, 0.34) compared with other groups but not occupation (skilled worker adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74, 1.16). Alcohol use was lower among individuals in the higher quartile of income (adjusted OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64, 0.88) and assets (adjusted OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59, 0.82). The odds of obesity was highest in participants with graduate school and above education (adjusted OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.85, 2.94), household income > 15,000 Indian rupees (adjusted OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.63, 2.19), and highest quartile of household assets (adjusted OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.39, 3.45). The odds of prevalent hypertension and diabetes were also generally higher among individuals with higher socioeconomic position. Conclusions Individuals with lower socioeconomic position in Himachal Pradesh were more likely to have abnormal behavioral risk factors, and individuals with higher socioeconomic position were more likely to have abnormal clinical risk factors."

This study investigates the impact of a selective S1PR1 modulator RP101075 on microvascular circulation in a mouse model of laser-induced thrombosis. The flow velocity of cortical arterioles in mice was measured in vivo under 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. Thrombosis was induced in cortical arterioles by laser irritation. At 30 min after laser-induced thrombosis, mice were treated with either RP101075 or vehicle. RP101075 did not alter the flow velocity of cortical arterioles under physiologic conditions. Laser-induced thrombosis led to a pronounced reduction of flow velocity in cortical arterioles that persisted for ≥90 min. The reduction of flow velocity in cortical arterioles following thrombosis was significantly attenuated following RP101075 treatment. RP101075 did not significantly affect coagulation time, bleeding time, heart rate, and blood pressure. In addition, RP101075 treatment reduced thrombus volume, which was accompanied by a reduction of leukocyte content in the thrombus. Our findings demonstrate that the selective S1PR1 modulator RP101075 improves microvascular circulation after thrombosis, implying a component of improved microvascular circulation to the benefit of S1PR modulation in cerebral ischemia.—Li, H., Zhou, X., Li, Y., Ma, X., Gonzales, R.

Therefore, we evaluated the DHA-1 β-lactamase induction by various antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TZB) in this study. Six strains (Enterobacter cloacae 2 strains, Citrobacter freundii 1 strain, Serratia marcescens 2 strain, and Morganella morganii 1 strain) possessing chromosomal inducible AmpC β-lactamase were used as controls. Four strains (Escherichia coli 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 strain, and C. koseri 1 strain) possessing DHA-1 β-lactamase were used. The β-lactamase activities were determined by a spectrophotometer using nitrocefin. β-lactamase induction by PIP, PIP/TZB was not observed in any strains and β-lactamase induction by third- and fourth-generation cephems was not observed in most strains. The induction ratios of the chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase in the reference group by PIP/TZB were <1.51, and those of the DHA-1 β-lactamase were <1.36, except for K. pneumoniae Rkp2004 (2.22). The β-lactamase induction by first- and second-generation cephems, flomoxef, and carbapenem differed in each strain. Cefmetazole (CMZ) strongly induced β-lactamase. This study demonstrated that the induction of DHA-1 β-lactamase was similar to that of chromosomal AmpC using various Enterobacteriaceae, although the induction of β-lactamase in both groups by PIP/TZB was low. We also reported that the induction of PIP/TZB, a β-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic, against various AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including DHA-1 producers, was low."
https://openalex.org/W2958721563,"A tumor can be regarded as a cell mass with a biologic hierarchy that is orchestrated by cancer stem cells. The specific features of cancer stem cells may result from a series of gene expression regulatory mechanisms. As important regulatory factors of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) have critical roles in the self-renewal, pluripotency, differentiation, and tumorigenicity of cancer stem cells. However, the effects of animal miRNAs on cancer stem cells have not been investigated extensively. Here, we report that miRNA of a shrimp, Marsupenαeus jαponicus (mja-miR-35-3p), which possesses antiviral activity in shrimp, could suppress the proliferation of melanoma and breast cancer stem cells, but not cancer nonstem cells, by arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase and inducing apoptosis. Shrimp mja-miR-35-3p (named mja-miR-35) targets the human peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase, never in mitosis gene a-interacting 1 (PIN1) gene, which is up-regulated in cancer stem cells. The results indicated that PIN1 silencing caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, induced apoptosis, and decreased the sphere-forming capacity of cancer stem cells, but not cancer nonstem cells, showing that PIN1 had beneficial effects against the stemness of cancer stem cells. The in vivo data revealed that shrimp mja-miR-35 suppressed the stemness of cancer stem cells in mice by inhibiting the PIN1 antiapoptotic–cell cycle pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2961803512,"Introduction The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate if remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) reduced platelet aggregation and increased fibrinolysis in cancer patients undergoing surgery and thereby reduced the risk of thrombosis. Materials and methods Head and neck cancer patients undergoing tumor resection and microsurgical reconstruction were randomized 1:1 to RIPC or sham intervention. RIPC was administered intraoperatively with an inflatable tourniquet by four cycles of 5-min upper extremity occlusion and 5-min reperfusion. The primary endpoint was collagen-induced platelet aggregation measured with Multiplate as area-under-the-curve on the first postoperative day. Secondary endpoints were markers of primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis, and fibrinolysis. Clinical data on thromboembolic and bleeding complications were prospectively collected at 30-day follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results Sixty patients were randomized to RIPC (n = 30) or sham intervention (n = 30). No patients were lost to follow-up. The relative mean [95% confidence interval] collagen-induced platelet aggregation was 1.26 [1.11;1.40] in the RIPC group and 1.17 [1.07;1.27] in the sham group on the first postoperative day reported as ratios compared with baseline (P = 0.30). Median (interquartile range) 50% fibrin clot lysis time was 517 (417–660) sec in the RIPC group and 614 (468–779) sec in the sham group (P = 0.25). The postoperative pulmonary embolism rate did not differ between groups (P = 1.0). Conclusions RIPC did not influence hemostasis and fibrinolysis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing surgery. RIPC did not reduce the rate of thromboembolic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2962551127,"Tracking individual animals with small-sized passive integrated transponder tags (PIT tags) has become a popular and widespread method, one which can be used for investigating life history traits, including dispersal patterns of small protected animals such as newts. In this study, we tested the applicability of PIT tag usage for individual marking with the Great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) as a model amphibian species, and to test the detection of the newts in nature using a passive telemetry system. Clove oil was used as an anaesthetic before surgery. We implanted PIT tags under the skin of 140 newts. The survival rate of newts was 98.57%. X-ray images were taken to check the exact positions of the PIT tags. Since approximately 15.71% of the newts were capable of expelling the tag from their bodies, tag loss has to be accounted for in future behavioural studies dealing with newts and other amphibians potentially capable of frequent tag expulsion. Lastly, we detected by passive telemetry 97 individuals out of 100 released into a natural breeding pond. Males had higher activity (13 detected males vs 7 females per hour) than females, thus males could be detected if present with more certainty. The result of the movement behaviour showed that e.g. the male of T. cristatus in a breeding pond can travel up to 20 m in 78 seconds. In summary, this promising method could allow the automatic data collection of marked newts in aquatic as well as in terrestrial biotopes, providing data on their dispersal, diurnal activity and movement behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2959261453,"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) enables accurate detection of fetal chromosomal trisomies. The majority of publicly available computational methods for sequencing-based NIPT analyses rely on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and are not applicable for targeted high-coverage sequencing data from cell-free DNA samples. Here, we present a novel computational framework for a targeted high-coverage sequencing-based NIPT analysis. The developed framework uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) in conjunction with a supplemental machine learning model, such as decision tree (DT) or support vector machine (SVM), to detect fetal trisomy and parental origin of additional fetal chromosomes. These models were developed using simulated datasets covering a wide range of biologically relevant scenarios with various chromosomal quantities, parental origins of extra chromosomes, fetal DNA fractions, and sequencing read depths. Developed models were tested on simulated and experimental targeted sequencing datasets. Consequently, we determined the functional feasibility and limitations of each proposed approach and demonstrated that read count-based HMM achieved the best overall classification accuracy of 0.89 for detecting fetal euploidies and trisomies on simulated dataset. Furthermore, we show that by using the DT and SVM on the HMM classification results, it was possible to increase the final trisomy classification accuracy to 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. We demonstrate that read count and allelic ratio-based models can achieve a high accuracy (up to 0.98) for detecting fetal trisomy even if the fetal fraction is as low as 2%. Currently, existing commercial NIPT analysis requires at least 4% of fetal fraction, which can be possibly a challenge in case of early gestational age (<10 weeks) or high maternal body mass index (>35 kg/m2). More accurate detection can be achieved at higher sequencing depth using HMM in conjunction with supplemental models, which significantly improve the trisomy detection especially in borderline scenarios (e.g., very low fetal fraction) and enables to perform NIPT even earlier than 10 weeks of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2959630254,"To date no informative biomarkers exist to accurately predict presence of lymph node metastases (LNM) in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). We studied the discriminative value of Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), an intestinal stem cell marker, in EAC. Patients who had undergone esophagectomy as single treatment modality for both advanced (pT2-4) and early (pT1b) adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction were selected for this study from an institutional database (Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Surgical resection specimens of 196 advanced and 44 early EAC were examined. OLFM4 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and categorized as low (<30%) or high (> = 30%) expression. Low OLFM4 was associated with poor differentiation grade in both advanced (60% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.001) and early EAC (39.1% vs. 9.5%, p = 0.023). LNM were present in 161 (82.1%) of advanced and 9 (20.5%) of early EAC respectively. Low OLFM4 was independently associated with the presence of LNM in advanced EAC in multivariable analysis (OR 2.7; 95% CI, 1.16-6.41; p = 0.022), but not in early EAC (OR 2.1; 95% CI, 0.46-9.84; p = 0.338). However, the difference in association with LNM between advanced (OR 2.7; 95% CI, 1.18-6.34; p = 0.019) and early (OR 2.3; 95% CI, 0.47-11.13; p = 0.302) EAC was non-significant (p = 0.844), suggesting that the lack of significance in early EAC is due to the small number of patients in this group. OLFM4 was not of significance for the disease free and overall survival. Overall, low expression of intestinal stem cell marker OLFM4 was associated with the presence of LNM. Our study suggests that OLFM4 could be an informative marker with the potential to improve preoperative assessment in patients with EAC. Further studies are needed to confirm the value of OLFM4 as a biomarker for LNM."

This study aimed to clarify the effects of psychological distress during pregnancy and exposure to stressful life events in the year before or during pregnancy on the occurrence of PA in Japanese women. Methods Using a nationwide prospective birth cohort study, we obtained data from 103,099 women between January 2011 and March 2014. Information on exposure to 14 stressful life events and psychological distress (Kessler 6 scale) was collected using a self-administered questionnaire during pregnancy. Clinical diagnoses of PA were obtained from medical records. A total of 80,799 women with singleton births were analyzed using logistic regression models that adjusted for possible confounders. Results PA was diagnosed in 335 (0.4%) women. There was no significant difference in the Kessler 6 score during pregnancy between the PA group and non-PA group. Exposure to the death of a child in the year before or during pregnancy was significantly associated with PA in multigravid women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50–8.34). A spouse’s loss of employment was significantly associated with PA in parous women (aOR 3.25; 95% CI 1.40–7.56).

https://openalex.org/W2958004633,"Background We present a new family of ECG biomarkers for assessing drug effects on ventricular repolarization. We show that drugs blocking inward (depolarizing) ion currents cause a relative increase of the T vector velocity (TVV) and accelerate repolarization, while drugs blocking outward ion currents cause a relative decrease of the TVV and delay repolarization. The results suggest a link between the TVV and the instantaneous change of the cellular action potentials that may contribute to bridge the gap between the surface ECG and myocardial cellular processes. Methods We measure TVV as the time required to reach X% of the total Trajectory length of the T vector loop, denoted as TrX. Applied to data from two FDA funded studies (22+22 subjects, 5232+4208 ECGs) which target ECG effects of various ion-channel blocking drugs, the TrX effect profiles indicate increasingly delayed electrical activity over the entire repolarization process for drugs solely reducing outward potassium current (dofetilide, moxifloxacin). For drugs eliciting block of the inward sodium or calcium currents (mexiletine, lidocaine), the TrX effect profiles were consistent with accelerated electrical activity in the initial repolarization phase. For multichannel blocking drugs (ranolazine) or drug combinations blocking multiple ion currents (dofetilide + mexiletine, dofetilide + lidocaine), the overall TrX effect profiles indicate a superposition of the individual TrX effect profiles. Results The parameter Tr40c differentiates pure potassium channel blocking drugs from multichannel blocking drugs with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.90, CI = [0.88 to 0.92]. This is significantly better than the performance of J-Tpeakc (0.81, CI = [0.78 to 0.84]) identified as the best parameter in the second FDA study. Combining the ten parameters Tr10c to Tr100c in a logistic regression model further improved the AUC to 0.94, CI = [0.92 to 0.96]. Conclusions TVV analysis substantially improves assessment of drug effects on cardiac repolarization, providing a plausible and improved mechanistic link between drug effects on ionic currents and overall ventricular repolarization reflected in the body surface ECG. TVV contributes to an enhanced appraisal of the proarrhythmic risk of drugs beyond QTc prolongation and J-Tpeakc."
https://openalex.org/W2958200938,"Marijuana is increasingly recognized for its therapeutic value in human medicine. Although most veterinary research to date has been concerned with marijuana toxicity, there is some interest in the potential therapeutic value of marijuana in veterinary medicine. With the recent legalization of marijuana for recreational use in Canada in October 2018, there is a need for veterinarians and veterinary students to be in a position to address client questions and concerns on this topic. We distributed a questionnaire to current veterinary students at the Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph, Ontario, to determine their attitude(s) towards marijuana as a potential therapeutic agent in animals. The overall response rate for the questionnaire was 43.5% (207/476). Most students felt that marijuana has potential therapeutic value in animals (53.6%; 111/207), fewer were unsure (38.6%; 80/207), and a small number of students felt that marijuana does not have potential therapeutic value in animals (7.7%; 16/207). Data generated by this questionnaire identified an important distinction between two major active compounds found in marijuana: cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Potential barriers to use in veterinary practice were also identified, including stigma and toxicity. Finally, many respondents showed an awareness of the limited scientific research regarding the safety and efficacy of marijuana in animals. Until a body of scientific literature on marijuana in animals becomes available, veterinarians may benefit from having an awareness of the different physiological and pharmacokinetic effects produced by different strains (including any adverse effects, and half-life), and a general understanding of current therapeutic applications of marijuana in humans."

The aim of this study is to assess the contribution of a range of modifiable exposures to the burden of disease due to stroke, an important public health problem in Scotland. Methods We used individual-level response data from eight waves (1995–2012) of the Scottish Health Survey linked to acute hospital discharge records from the Scottish Morbidity Record 01 (SMR01) and cause of death records from the death register. Stroke was defined using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9 codes 430–431, 433–4 and 436; and the ICD10 codes I60-61 and I63-64 and stroke incidence was defined as a composite of an individual’s first hospitalisation or death from stroke. A literature review identified exposures causally linked to stroke. Exposures were mapped to the layers of the Dahlgren & Whitehead model of the determinants of health and Population Attributable Fractions were calculated for each exposure deemed a significant causal risk of stroke from a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression model. Population Attributable Fractions were not summed as they may add to more than 100% due to the possibility of a person being exposed to more than one exposure simultaneously. Results Overall, the results suggest that socioeconomic factors explain the largest proportion of incident stroke hospitalisations and deaths, after adjustment for confounding. After DAG adjustment, low education explained 38.8% (95% Confidence Interval 26.0% to 49.4%, area deprivation (as measured by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) 34.9% (95% CI 26.4 to 42.4%), occupational social class differences 30.3% (95% CI 19.4% to 39.8%), high systolic blood pressure 29.6% (95% CI 20.6% to 37.6%), smoking 25.6% (95% CI 17.9% to 32.6%) and area deprivation (as measured by the Carstairs area deprivation Index) 23.5% (95% CI 14.4% to 31.7%), of incident strokes in Scotland after adjustment. Conclusion This study provides evidence for prioritising interventions that tackle socioeconomic inequalities as a means of achieving the greatest reduction in avoidable strokes in Scotland. Future work to disentangle the proportion of the effect of deprivation transmitted through intermediate mediators on the pathway between socioeconomic inequalities and stroke may offer additional opportunities to reduce the incidence of stroke in Scotland."

Few studies have attempted to quantify DSi utilization by these organisms and all available determinations come from laboratory measurements. Here we measured DSi consumption rates of the sponge Tethya citrina in its natural habitat, conducting 24h incubations in benthic chambers. Sponges consumed DSi at an average rate of 0.046 ± 0.018 μmol h-1 mL-1 when DSi availability in its habitat was 8.3 ± 1.8 μM. Such DSi consumption rates significantly matched the values predicted by a kinetic model elsewhere developed previously for this species through laboratory incubations. These results support the use of laboratory incubations as a suitable approach to learn about DSi consumption. During the field incubations, utilization of other dissolved inorganic nutrients by this low-microbial-abundance (LMA) sponge was also measured. The sponges were net sources of ammonium (-0.043 ± 0.031 μmol h-1 mL-1), nitrate (-0.063 ± 0.031 μmol h-1 mL-1), nitrite (-0.007 ± 0.003 μmol h-1 mL-1), and phosphate (-0.004 ± 0.005 μmol h-1 mL-1), in agreement with the general pattern in other LMA species. The detected effluxes were among the lowest reported for sponges, which agreed with the low respiration rates characterizing this species (0.35 ± 0.11 μmol-O2 h-1 mL-1). Despite relatively low flux, the dense population of T. citrina modifies the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients in the demersal water of its habitat, contributing up to 14% of nitrate and nitrite stocks. Through these effects, the bottom layer contacting the benthic communities where siliceous LMA sponges abound can be partially depleted in DSi, but can benefit from inputs of N and P dissolved inorganic nutrients that are critical to primary producers."

This multicenter retrospective study investigated the medical records of patients who underwent unilateral and bilateral TKA from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 in three hospitals. According to whether postoperative shed autologous blood reinfusion was used, the patients were divided into the control group and the shed autologous blood reinfusion group. The volume of perioperative infusion of red blood cells and plasma, the blood transfusion-related costs, and the postoperative hospital stay were compared between the two groups of patients. A total of 200 unilateral and 74 bilateral TKA were included after successful matching. Among the patients who underwent unilateral TKA, the control group and the shed autologous blood reinfusion group had 95 and 91 patients, respectively, who received allogeneic blood infusion (P = 0.268). There was no significant difference in the number of units of allogeneic red blood cells infused (P = 0.154), while the transfusion-related cost was increased (P<0.001). The same phenomena were observed over the patients underwent bilateral TKA. Shed autologous blood reinfusion does not reduce the need for infusing allogeneic red blood cells. In addition, the procedure increases patient expense and may also lead to an extended postoperative hospital stay."

A poultry feeding trial was conducted with simulated isobutanol-derived dried distillers grains with solubles (bDDGS), comprising non-fermentable corn solids and heat-inactivated Butamax modified yeast (BMY), to determine potential health effects. Simulated dried distillers grains were produced in 2 variants: bDDGS containing 10% (B10) or 50% (B50) BMY. The BMY concentrations were selected based on a conservative estimate from ethanol-derived distillers grains (eDDGS) approximating 2.5 and 12-fold margins of exposure. The B10 and B50 DDGS were evaluated in a 42-day feeding trial using male Ross 708 broiler chickens fed diets containing eDDGS, B50 DDGS, or B10 DDGS without or with isobutanol, 2,3-butanediol, and isobutyric acid metabolites each at target concentrations of 2 (B10-2), 5 (B10-5), or 10 (B10-10) times the anticipated specification limit in the commercial product. Diets were fed (n = 50 broilers/treatment) in 3 phases: starter phase with 8% DDGS and grower and finisher phases each with 15% DDGS. No statistically significant differences or diet-related effects on mortality, clinical pathology, or organ weights, and no microscopic observations associated with consumption of diets containing B10, B50, or B10 supplemented with metabolites at any targeted exposure level were observed. A lower (P < 0.05) mean absolute bursa of Fabricius weight in the B10-10 group compared to the B10 group was considered to be within the range of biological variability. A non-significant trend toward lower weight, gains, and feed intake, and higher feed:gain ratio was observed in the B10-10 group, and was considered a non-adverse palatability effect of consuming high concentrations of metabolites. These results demonstrate that consumption of phase diets containing simulated DDGS from a novel isobutanol production process was well-tolerated."

There are many tests which can be ordered in a variety of combinations. This study aimed to assess routine Hepatitis B screening practices in a tertiary care centre and determine the diagnostic and economic benefits of protocolized ordering.We evaluated all measurements of Hepatitis B total core antibodies, core IgM antibodies, surface antibodies and surface antigens performed at our institution between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. We also recorded secondary testing (envelope antigens and antibodies, and viral DNA). Costs were estimated using provincial insurance reimbursement values. Using the subset of patients who received complete testing, we developed a reflexive screening protocol to minimize costs while simultaneously improving diagnostic utility.30,335 hepatitis B tests were performed at an estimated total cost of $584,683. 53.9% of patients were screened with a single test. 29% of patients who received secondary testing had no evidence of exposure on primary testing. Using the protocol of initial testing of total core antibody and surface antibody with reflexive testing, we would save an estimated $181,632 (95% CI $154,201.90 -$208,910.50) per year while providing more complete information.Screening practices for Hepatitis B are frequently inadequate to diagnose and stage the infection and often included unnecessary testing. Protocolization of Hepatitis B testing could limit this practice while resulting in significantly lower costs."
https://openalex.org/W2962644263,"Cellular frustrated models have been developed to describe how the adaptive immune system works. They are composed by independent agents that continuously pair and unpair depending on the information that one sub-set of these agents display. The emergent dynamics is sensitive to changes in the displayed information and can be used to detect anomalies, which can be important to accomplish the immune system main function of protecting the host. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that these models could be adequate to model the immune system activation. Likewise it has been hypothesized that these models could provide inspiration to develop new artificial intelligence algorithms for data mining applications. However, computational algorithms do not need to follow strictly the immunological reality. Here, we investigate efficient implementation strategies of these immune inspired ideas for anomaly detection applications and use real data to compare the performance of cellular frustration algorithms with standard implementations of one-class support vector machines and deep autoencoders. Our results demonstrate that more efficient implementations of cellular frustration algorithms are possible and also that cellular frustration algorithms can be advantageous for semi-supervised anomaly detection applications given their robustness and accuracy."
