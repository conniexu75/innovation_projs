https://openalex.org/W2041770101,"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) function with associated proteins to effect complex structural and regulatory outcomes. To reveal the composition and dynamics of specific noncoding RNA-protein complexes (RNPs) in vivo, we developed comprehensive identification of RNA binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS). ChIRP-MS analysis of four ncRNAs captures key protein interactors, including a U1-specific link to the 3' RNA processing machinery. Xist, an essential lncRNA for X chromosome inactivation (XCI), interacts with 81 proteins from chromatin modification, nuclear matrix, and RNA remodeling pathways. The Xist RNA-protein particle assembles in two steps coupled with the transition from pluripotency to differentiation. Specific interactors include HnrnpK, which participates in Xist-mediated gene silencing and histone modifications but not Xist localization, and Drosophila Split ends homolog Spen, which interacts via the A-repeat domain of Xist and is required for gene silencing. Thus, Xist lncRNA engages with proteins in a modular and developmentally controlled manner to coordinate chromatin spreading and silencing."

In vitro experiments demonstrated that pseudogenes contribute to cell transformation through several mechanisms. However, in vivo evidence for a causal role of pseudogenes in cancer development is lacking. Here, we report that mice engineered to overexpress either the full-length murine B-Raf pseudogene Braf-rs1 or its pseudo “CDS” or “3′ UTR” develop an aggressive malignancy resembling human diffuse large B cell lymphoma. We show that Braf-rs1 and its human ortholog, BRAFP1, elicit their oncogenic activity, at least in part, as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that elevate BRAF expression and MAPK activation in vitro and in vivo. Notably, we find that transcriptional or genomic aberrations of BRAFP1 occur frequently in multiple human cancers, including B cell lymphomas. Our engineered mouse models demonstrate the oncogenic potential of pseudogenes and indicate that ceRNA-mediated microRNA sequestration may contribute to the development of cancer.

Our engineered mouse models demonstrate the oncogenic potential of pseudogenes and indicate that ceRNA-mediated microRNA sequestration may contribute to the development of cancer. Over the past few years, remarkable progress has been made in establishing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as important regulators of various biological processes. Given their critical roles, it is not surprising that aberrant expression and/or function of lncRNAs are implicated in the development of diseases such as cancer (Gutschner and Diederichs, 2012Gutschner T. Diederichs S. The hallmarks of cancer: a long non-coding RNA point of view.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Pseudogenes, a sub-class of lncRNA genes that developed from protein-coding genes but have lost the ability to produce proteins, have long been viewed as non-functional genomic relicts of evolution (Poliseno, 2012Poliseno L. Pseudogenes: newly discovered players in human cancer.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the vast majority of pseudogenes have protein-coding parental counterparts with which they share high sequence homology, which enables pseudogenes to participate in posttranscriptional regulation of their parental genes. Mechanisms of parental gene regulation include the formation of endogenous siRNAs (Tam et al., 2008Tam O.H. Aravin A.A. Stein P. Girard A. Murchison E.P. Cheloufi S. Hodges E. Anger M.

We recently proposed that the high sequence homology enables pseudogenes to compete with their parental genes for a shared pool of common microRNAs (miRNAs) (Poliseno et al., 2010Poliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P.

This mechanism is of particular relevance to cancer where pseudogenes are aberrantly expressed (Kalyana-Sundaram et al., 2012Kalyana-Sundaram S. Kumar-Sinha C. Shankar S. Robinson D.R. Wu Y.-M.

Specifically, we demonstrated that pseudogenes of the frequently mutated cancer genes PTEN and KRAS function as ceRNAs in vitro (Poliseno et al., 2010Poliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B.

While sufficient data exist to demonstrate pseudogene functions in vitro, in vivo evidence for the regulatory activity of pseudogenes—either as ceRNAs or by any of the other above-mentioned mechanisms—is lacking, and their role in disease progression is correlative. Here, we describe a causal role for the BRAF pseudogene in the development of cancer. The BRAF pseudogene (BRAFP1) is overexpressed in various tumor types (Zou et al., 2009Zou M. Baitei E.Y. Alzahrani A.S. Al-Mohanna F. Farid N.R. Meyer B. Shi Y.

We have shown that pseudogenes are able to regulate expression of their parental genes through sequestration of shared miRNAs (Poliseno et al., 2010Poliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P. A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology.Nature. 2010; 465: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), and BRAFP1-mediated elevation of BRAF may promote MAPK signaling and tumorigenesis. MiRNA predictions revealed that murine Braf-rs1 (Gm18189) and B-Raf are targeted by 54 and 114 miRNA families, respectively, 53 of which they have in common. Similarly, human BRAFP1 and BRAF are targeted by 60 and 48 miRNA families, respectively, and share 40 (Figures S1A–S1D, Table S1). Thus, the BRAF pseudogene may operate as a ceRNA for BRAF in mice and humans. Indeed, ectopic expression of Braf-rs1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and BRAFP1 in human PC9 and HeLa cancer cells elevated BRAF protein and ERK phosphorylation (Figures 1A and S1E). Importantly, B-Raf was critical for this effect, as the Braf-rs1-induced increase in pERK was negated by genetic deletion of B-Raf in B-Raffl/fl fibroblasts (Figure 1B). Moreover, expression of the BRAF pseudogene increased proliferation of NIH 3T3, PC9, and HeLa cells (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1F). Moderate B-Raf overexpression was sufficient to increase pERK expression, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Figures S1G–S1I), indicating that Braf-rs1-mediated elevation of B-Raf may be sufficient for the observed phenotype.Figure S1The BRAF Pseudogenes Regulate BRAF Expression and MAPK Signaling, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Outline of murine (upper panel) and human (lower panel) BRAF and BRAF pseudogene and their respective chromosomal locations.

To test whether the effect of the BRAF pseudogene on BRAF expression and proliferation rates was dependent on miRNAs, we utilized cell lines lacking functional Dicer1, a ribonuclease critical for miRNA biogenesis and whose deficiency results in drastically reduced levels of mature miRNAs (Cummins et al., 2006Cummins J.M. He Y. Leary R.J. Pagliarini R. Diaz Jr., L.A. Sjoblom T. Barad O. Bentwich Z. Szafranska A.E. Labourier E. et al.The colorectal microRNAome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, Ravi et al., 2012Ravi A. Gurtan A.M. Kumar M.S. Bhutkar A. Chin C. Lu V. Lees J.A. Jacks T. Sharp P.A. Proliferation and tumorigenesis of a murine sarcoma cell line in the absence of DICER1.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 848-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Braf-rs1 increased expression of B-Raf and pERK and elevated proliferation of Dicer1-proficient murine sarcoma cells, but not that of isogenic Dicer1 knockout cells (Figures 1E and 1F). Similarly, overexpression of BRAFP1 in Dicer1-proficient human HCT116 colon cancer cells increased expression of BRAF and pERK and elevated proliferation, and these effects were abrogated in isogenic Dicer1 mutant HCT116 cells (Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, the BRAF pseudogene-induced effects are dependent on BRAF and Dicer1. The finding that the BRAF pseudogene mediates its effect through mature miRNAs suggests that it may function as a ceRNA. To test this directly, we co-expressed BRAFP1 with a human BRAF-3′ UTR-luciferase reporter in Dicer1-proficient and -deficient HCT116 cells. BRAFP1 elevated the activity of the BRAF 3′ UTR-luciferase reporter in a Dicer1-dependent manner (Figure 2A), further supporting the notion that the crosstalk is mediated by mature miRNAs. To validate this result, we tested several predicted shared miRNAs in 3′ UTR-luciferase reporter assays. Three out of ten murine miRNAs (miR-134, miR-543, and miR-653) significantly repressed Braf-rs1 and B-Raf luciferase reporters (Figure 2B), suggesting that the crosstalk may be mediated at least in part by these three miRNAs. Next, we determined the ability of Braf-rs1 to decoy the dual targeting miRNAs miR-134, miR-543, and miR-653 from luciferase reporters carrying miRNA response elements (MREs). Braf-rs1 regulated the expression of the luciferase reporters, especially at lower miRNA concentrations (Figure 2C). Braf-rs1-mediated sequestration of the least potent of the three dual targeting miRNAs, miR-543, had the most robust effect on luciferase reporter activity (Figure 2C). These data suggest that both potency and abundance of the miRNAs may be important determinants for ceRNA crosstalk. In addition, Braf-rs1 was able to sequester endogenous miR-653, miR-134, and miR-543 from the respective luciferase-MRE reporters, and mutation of the MREs in Braf-rs1 abrogated this effect (Figure 2D). Similarly, four out of nine human miRNAs (miR-30a, miR-182, miR-876, and miR-590) were able to repress BRAF- and BRAFP1-luciferase reporters (Figure S2A). miR-30a, miR-182, and miR-876 were also efficiently sequestered from the respective MRE-luciferase reporters by BRAFP1, and mutation of these miRNA-binding sites reduced BRAFP1’s activity as a miRNA sponge (Figure S2B). As Braf-rs1 regulates the expression of B-Raf and MAPK signaling, we sought to investigate whether aberrant Braf-rs1 expression is oncogenic in vivo. To this end, we generated a transgenic allele containing murine Braf-rs1 under the control of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Tet-response element (TRE) and targeted it to the collagen A1 locus using Flp recombinase-mediated genomic integration (Beard et al., 2006Beard C. Hochedlinger K. Plath K. Wutz A. Jaenisch R. Efficient method to generate single-copy transgenic mice by site-specific integration in embryonic stem cells.Genesis. 2006; 44: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) (Figures S2C and S2D). We isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from TRE-Braf-rs1 (henceforth referred to as TRE-BPS) mice to confirm that expression of the Braf-rs1 allele regulates B-Raf. Infection of MEFs with a tTA-expressing retrovirus resulted in 6- to 18-fold induction of Braf-rs1 expression (Figures 2E and S2E), as well as increased levels of B-Raf and pERK (Figure 2F) and proliferation (Figure 2G), confirming that the transgenic allele elicits effects similar to ectopic expression of Braf-rs1. We used TRE-BPS MEFs to analyze the stoichiometry of B-Raf and Braf-rs1. First, we determined the absolute number of transcripts by qPCR using plasmids carrying Braf-rs1 and B-Raf as standards (Figure S2E). In TRE-BPS MEFs infected with a control retrovirus, B-Raf molecules were 13- to 26-fold more abundant than Braf-rs1, while in tTA-infected cells, the B-Raf:Braf-rs1 ratio was between 1.3 and 2.5 (Figure S2E). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis confirmed Braf-rs1 induction and found B-Raf:Braf-rs1 ratios in a range similar to that determined by qPCR (Figure S2F and data not shown). Next, we determined the number of molecules of miR-653, miR-134, and miR-543 in TRE-BPS MEFs by qPCR using standard curves. MiRNA expression was not significantly affected upon transgene induction (Figure S2G, Table S2). Mir-653 was expressed at extremely low levels, likely precluding it from Braf-rs1/B-Raf ceRNA crosstalk in MEFs. Additional predicted miRNAs that are expressed in MEFs (Table S2) but were not further validated may also contribute to crosstalk. Hence, the stoichiometry of B-Raf, transgenic Braf-rs1, and some dual-targeting miRNAs fits well within the optimal crosstalk criteria that we have recently established (Ala et al., 2013Ala U.

To induce global overexpression of Braf-rs1 in vivo, TRE-BPS mice were crossed to CAG-rtTA3 mice (Premsrirut et al., 2011Premsrirut P.K. Dow L.E. Kim S.Y. Camiolo M. Malone C.D. Miething C.

https://openalex.org/W2086509569,"Monoclonal antibodies against immune checkpoint blockade have proven to be a major success in the treatment of melanoma. The programmed death receptor-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on melanoma cells is believed to have an inhibitory effect on T cell responses and to be an important escape mechanism from immune attack. Previous studies have shown that PD-L1 can be expressed constitutively or can be induced by IFN-γ secreted by infiltrating lymphocytes. In the present study we have investigated the mechanism underlying these two modes of PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells including cells that had acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. PD-L1 expression was examined by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Specific inhibitors and siRNA knockdown approaches were used to examine the roles of the RAF/ MEK, PI3K, NF-κB, STAT3 and AP1/ c-Jun pathways. IFN-γ inducible expression of PD-L1 was dependent on NF-κB as shown by inhibition with BMS-345541, an inhibitor of IκB and the BET protein inhibitor I-BET151, as well as by siRNA knockdown of NF-κB subunits. We were unable to implicate the BRAF/MEK pathway as major regulators in PD-L1 expression on vemurafenib resistant cells. Similarly the PI3K/AKT pathway and the transcription factors STAT3 and c-Jun had only minor roles in IFN-γ induced expression of PD-L1. The mechanism underlying constitutive expression remains unresolved. We suggest these results have significance in selection of treatments that can be used in combination with monoclonal antibodies against PD1, to enhance their effectiveness and to reduce inhibitory effects melanoma cells have against cytotoxic T cell activity."

Because DNA shape is a consequence of sequence, it is difficult to dissociate these modes of recognition. Here, we tease them apart in the context of Hox-DNA binding by mutating residues that, in a co-crystal structure, only recognize DNA shape. Complexes made with these mutants lose the preference to bind sequences with specific DNA shape features. Introducing shape-recognizing residues from one Hox protein to another swapped binding specificities in vitro and gene regulation in vivo. Statistical machine learning revealed that the accuracy of binding specificity predictions improves by adding shape features to a model that only depends on sequence, and feature selection identified shape features important for recognition. Thus, shape readout is a direct and independent component of binding site selection by Hox proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2041411601,"Introduction Executive functions (EFs) training interventions aimed at ADHD-symptom reduction have yielded mixed results. Generally, these interventions focus on training a single cognitive domain (e.g., working memory [WM], inhibition, or cognitive-flexibility). However, evidence suggests that most children with ADHD show deficits on multiple EFs, and that these EFs are largely related to different brain regions. Therefore, training multiple EFs might be a potentially more effective strategy to reduce EF-related ADHD symptoms. Methods Eighty-nine children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (aged 8–12) were randomized to either a full-active-condition where visuospatial WM, inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained, a partially-active-condition where inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained and the WM-training task was presented in placebo-mode, or to a full placebo-condition. Short-term and long-term (3-months) effects of this gamified, 25-session, home-based computer-training were evaluated on multiple outcome domains. Results During training compliance was high (only 3% failed to meet compliance criteria). After training, only children in the full-active condition showed improvement on measures of visuospatial short-term-memory (STM) and WM. Inhibitory performance and interference control only improved in the full-active- and the partially-active condition. No Treatment-condition x Time interactions were found for cognitive-flexibility, verbal WM, complex-reasoning, nor for any parent-, teacher-, or child-rated ADHD behaviors, EF-behaviors, motivational behaviors, or general problem behaviors. Nonetheless, almost all measures showed main Time-effects, including the teacher-ratings. Conclusions Improvements on inhibition and visuospatial STM and WM were specifically related to the type of treatment received. However, transfer to untrained EFs and behaviors was mostly nonspecific (i.e., only interference control improved exclusively in the two EF training conditions). As such, in this multiple EF-training, mainly nonspecific treatment factors – as opposed to the specific effects of training EFs—seem related to far transfer effects found on EF and behavior.

https://openalex.org/W1964190792,"Synapses are plastic and can be modified by changes in spike timing. Whereas most studies of long-term synaptic plasticity focus on excitation, inhibitory plasticity may be critical for controlling information processing, memory storage, and overall excitability in neural circuits. Here we examine spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of inhibitory synapses onto layer 5 neurons in slices of mouse auditory cortex, together with concomitant STDP of excitatory synapses. Pairing pre- and postsynaptic spikes potentiated inhibitory inputs irrespective of precise temporal order within ∼10 ms. This was in contrast to excitatory inputs, which displayed an asymmetrical STDP time window. These combined synaptic modifications both required NMDA receptor activation and adjusted the excitatory-inhibitory ratio of events paired with postsynaptic spiking. Finally, subthreshold events became suprathreshold, and the time window between excitation and inhibition became more precise. These findings demonstrate that cortical inhibitory plasticity requires interactions with co-activated excitatory synapses to properly regulate excitatory-inhibitory balance."
https://openalex.org/W2002764043,"Transcriptional codes initiated during brain development are ultimately realized in adulthood as distinct cell types performing specialized roles in behavior. Focusing on the mouse external globus pallidus (GPe), we demonstrate that the potential contributions of two GABAergic GPe cell types to voluntary action are fated from early life to be distinct. Prototypic GPe neurons derive from the medial ganglionic eminence of the embryonic subpallium and express the transcription factor Nkx2-1. These neurons fire at high rates during alert rest, and encode movements through heterogeneous firing rate changes, with many neurons decreasing their activity. In contrast, arkypallidal GPe neurons originate from lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences, express the transcription factor FoxP2, fire at low rates during rest, and encode movements with robust increases in firing. We conclude that developmental diversity positions prototypic and arkypallidal neurons to fulfil distinct roles in behavior via their disparate regulation of GABA release onto different basal ganglia targets."
https://openalex.org/W1998880168,"The cerebellum stores associative motor memories essential for properly timed movement; however, the mechanisms by which these memories form and are acted upon remain unclear. To determine how cerebellar activity relates to movement and motor learning, we used optogenetics to manipulate spontaneously firing Purkinje neurons (PNs) in mouse simplex lobe. Using high-speed videography and motion tracking, we found that altering PN activity produced rapid forelimb movement. PN inhibition drove movements time-locked to stimulus onset, whereas PN excitation drove delayed movements time-locked to stimulus offset. Pairing either PN inhibition or excitation with sensory stimuli triggered the formation of robust, associative motor memories; however, PN excitation led to learned movements whose timing more closely matched training intervals. These findings implicate inhibition of PNs as a teaching signal, consistent with a model whereby learning leads first to reductions in PN firing that subsequently instruct circuit changes in the cerebellar nucleus."

However, the role of PRMT1 in lung cancer progression and metastasis remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we show that PRMT1 is an important regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell migration, and invasion, which are essential processes during cancer progression, and metastasis. Additionally, we have identified Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and a well-known E-cadherin repressor, as a novel PRMT1 substrate. Taken together, we show that PRMT1 is a novel regulator of EMT and arginine 34 (Arg-34) methylation of Twist1 as a unique “methyl arginine mark” for active E-cadherin repression. Therefore, targeting PRMT1-mediated Twist1 methylation might represent a novel strategy for developing new anti-invasive/anti-metastatic drugs. Moreover, methylated Twist1 (Arg-34), as such, could also emerge as a potential important biomarker for lung cancer."

In the context of Swiss 60m athletic sprinting, 7761 male athletes aged 8 - 15 years were analysed, with this study examining whether: (i) RAE prevalence changed across annual age groups and according to performance level (i.e., all athletes, Top 50%, 25% & 10%); (ii) whether the relationship between relative age and performance could be quantified, and corrective adjustments applied to test if RAEs could be removed. Part one identified that when all athletes were included, typical RAEs were evident, with smaller comparative effect sizes, and progressively reduced with older age groups. However, RAE effect sizes increased linearly according to performance level (i.e., all athletes - Top 10%) regardless of age group. In part two, all athletes born in each quartile, and within each annual age group, were entered into linear regression analyses. Results identified that an almost one year relative age difference resulted in mean expected performance differences of 10.1% at age 8, 8.4% at 9, 6.8% at 10, 6.4% at 11, 6.0% at 12, 6.3% at 13, 6.7% at 14, and 5.3% at 15.

https://openalex.org/W2341674440,"SAMHD1 is a nuclear deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase that contributes to the control of cellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool sizes through dNTP hydrolysis and modulates the innate immune response to viruses. CyclinA2-CDK1/2 phosphorylates SAMHD1 at Thr-592, but how this modification controls SAMHD1 functions in proliferating cells is not known. Here, we show that SAMHD1 levels remain relatively unchanged during the cell division cycle in primary human T lymphocytes and in monocytic cell lines. Inactivation of the bipartite cyclinA2-CDK-binding site in the SAMHD1 C terminus described herein abolished SAMHD1 phosphorylation on Thr-592 during S and G2 phases thus interfering with DNA replication and progression of cells through S phase. The effects exerted by Thr-592 phosphorylation-defective SAMHD1 mutants were associated with activation of DNA damage checkpoint and depletion of dNTP concentrations to levels lower than those seen upon expression of wild type SAMHD1 protein. These disruptive effects were relieved by either mutation of the catalytic residues of the SAMHD1 phosphohydrolase domain or by a Thr-592 phosphomimetic mutation, thus linking the Thr-592 phosphorylation state to the control of SAMHD1 dNTPase activity. Our findings support a model in which phosphorylation of Thr-592 by cyclinA2-CDK down-modulates, but does not inactivate, SAMHD1 dNTPase in S phase, thereby fine-tuning SAMHD1 control of dNTP levels during DNA replication. Background: Human sterile α motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase that is phosphorylated by cyclinA2-dependent kinases. Results: SAMHD1 mutants defective for cyclinA2 binding disrupt S phase progression, and this is alleviated by Thr-592 phosphomimetic mutation. Conclusion: CyclinA2-dependent kinases regulate SAMHD1 activity. Significance: SAMHD1 dNTP phosphohydrolase activity is regulated during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2073083846,"Summary Increasing evidence suggests that parallel plastic processes in the amygdala involve inhibitory elements to control fear and extinction memory. GABAergic medial paracapsular intercalated cells (mpITCs) are thought to relay activity from basolateral nucleus (BLA) and prefrontal cortex to inhibit central amygdala output during suppression of fear. Recently, projection diversity and differential behavioral activation of mpITCs in distinct fear states suggest additional functions. Here, we show that mpITCs receive convergent sensory thalamic and cortical inputs that undergo fear learning-related changes and are dynamically modulated via presynaptic GABA B receptors recruited by GABA released from the mpITC network. Among mpITCs, we identify cells that inhibit but are also mutually activated by BLA principal neurons. Thus, mpITCs take part in fear learning-modulated feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuits to simultaneously control amygdala input and output nuclei. Our findings place mpITCs in a unique position to gate acquired amygdala-dependent behaviors via their direct sensory inputs."

However, it is unclear whether the molecular mechanisms mediating AMPAR trafficking during homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity differ, and it is unknown how RA signaling impacts Hebbian plasticity. Here, we show that RA increases postsynaptic AMPAR abundance using an activity-dependent mechanism that requires a unique SNARE (soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor)-dependent fusion machinery different from that mediating LTP. Specifically, RA-induced AMPAR trafficking did not involve complexin, which activates SNARE complexes containing syntaxin-1 or -3, but not complexes containing syntaxin-4, whereas LTP required complexin. Moreover, RA-induced AMPAR trafficking utilized the Q-SNARE syntaxin-4, whereas LTP utilized syntaxin-3; both additionally required the Q-SNARE SNAP-47 and the R-SNARE synatobrevin-2.

Thus, RA-induced homeostatic plasticity involves a novel, activity-dependent postsynaptic AMPAR-trafficking pathway mediated by a unique SNARE-dependent fusion machinery. The ability of a neuron to change its responsiveness to synaptic inputs based on prior activity and experience is an essential feature of the nervous system. These changes can occur in the properties intrinsic to a neuron (i.e., membrane excitability) or at synapses where communication between two neurons is achieved. Long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses is thought to underlie modification of neural circuits that drive behaviors, enable learning, and encode memory. The known forms of long-term synaptic plasticity include at least two main categories: Hebbian and homeostatic. Compared to Hebbian plasticity, the mechanisms and functional significance of homeostatic synaptic plasticity are less understood. One of the main open questions is whether and how homeostatic synaptic plasticity intersects with Hebbian synaptic plasticity at the functional and molecular levels. Although operating under different computational rules and likely involving distinct molecular mechanisms, homeostatic synaptic plasticity directly impacts the basal state of synapses and is, therefore, likely to indirectly affect Hebbian plasticity. We have previously described a critical involvement of retinoic acid (RA) in a form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity that is induced by prolonged reduction in synaptic excitation (Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J. Nam C.I. Poon M.M. Ting P. Chen L.

Schroeder J. Chen L. Rapid suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission by retinoic acid.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 11440-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Acting through a distinct molecular mechanism, RA is capable of rapidly changing excitatory as well as inhibitory synaptic strength (Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J. Nam C.I. Poon M.M. Ting P. Chen L.

Thus, through its effects on both excitation and inhibition, the synaptic action of RA may impact Hebbian plasticity due to an altered synaptic excitation/inhibition balance. Indeed, vitamin A deficiency (which depletes RA) impairs hippocampal Hebbian plasticity and learning (Chiang et al., 1998Chiang M.Y. Misner D. Kempermann G. Schikorski T. Giguère V. Sucov H.M.

Moreover, a study using a dominant-negative form of RARα expressed in adult forebrain demonstrated impairments in AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission, hippocampal LTP, hippocampal-dependent social recognition, and spatial memory (Nomoto et al., 2012Nomoto M. Takeda Y. Uchida S. Mitsuda K. Enomoto H. Saito K. Choi T. Watabe A.M. Kobayashi S. Masushige S. et al.Dysfunction of the RAR/RXR signaling pathway in the forebrain impairs hippocampal memory and synaptic plasticity.Mol. Brain. 2012; 5: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, how RA-induced increases in excitatory synaptic transmission affect Hebbian plasticity has not been investigated. At the molecular level, changes in synaptic AMPAR abundance have been described for both RA-induced and Hebbian plasticity (e.g., postsynaptic NMDA receptor [NMDAR]-dependent LTP). The molecular machinery that governs AMPAR exocytosis is just beginning to be uncovered. Similar to presynaptic-activity-dependent vesicle exocytosis (i.e., calcium-triggered neurotransmitter release) (Südhof and Rothman, 2009Südhof T.C. Rothman J.E. Membrane fusion: grappling with SNARE and SM proteins.Science. 2009; 323: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar), postsynaptic AMPAR exocytosis during LTP requires a SNARE (soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor)-dependent membrane-fusion machinery (Ahmad et al., 2012Ahmad M. Polepalli J.S. Goswami D. Yang X. Kaeser-Woo Y.J. Südhof T.C. Malenka R.C.

LTP requires a unique postsynaptic SNARE fusion machinery.Neuron. 2013; 77: 542-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Specifically, both processes require the R-SNARE synaptobrevin-2 (Syb-2) and the SNARE-activating molecule complexin (Cpx) but differ in the Q-SNAREs. Whereas calcium-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis requires the Q-SNAREs SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 (Stx-1), LTP-induced AMPAR exocytosis requires SNAP-47 and syntaxin-3 (Stx-3) (Jurado et al., 2013Jurado S.

LTP requires a unique postsynaptic SNARE fusion machinery.Neuron. 2013; 77: 542-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, questions arise regarding whether the complex formed by Syb-2, Stx-3, SNAP-47, and Cpx represents a SNARE machinery universally used for all forms of postsynaptic-activity-dependent AMPAR exocytosis and whether the similarity and/or differences in the molecular composition of the AMPAR exocytosis machinery between Hebbian and RA-induced plasticity accounts for a possible functional impact of synaptic RA signaling on Hebbian plasticity. In the present study, we examined the impact of RA on Hebbian plasticity in the hippocampus. We found that acute RA treatment impairs subsequent expression of LTP and that this impairment can be reversed by acute genetic deletion of RARα or by inhibiting protein synthesis during RA treatment. Unexpectedly, we found that, similar to what occurs during LTP, synaptic incorporation of AMPARs by RA requires synaptic activity and NMDAR activation. Thus, we examined the potential convergence of the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent AMPAR insertion between LTP and RA-induced AMPAR exocytosis. Using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based approach, we found that RA- and LTP-induced AMPAR insertions are both regulated by activity and that both require some of the same SNARE proteins, such as SNAP-47 and Syb-2, but differ in two important components of the SNARE membrane-fusion machinery. First, although Cpx is required for LTP, it does not play a role in RA-induced AMPAR exocytosis. Second, whereas Stx-3 (which interacts with Cpx) is required for LTP, Stx-4 (which does not bind Cpx) is required for RA-induced AMPAR exocytosis. Thus, our findings reveal a previously unidentified, activity-dependent AMPAR exocytosis pathway, which utilizes a unique vesicle fusion machinery that is distinct from that used during LTP or during constitutive AMPAR exocytosis at synapses. To directly investigate the impact of synaptic RA signaling on hippocampal LTP, we examined LTP induction at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses after acute RA treatment (2-4 hr) in organotypic cultured hippocampal slices. Using a classical pairing protocol, we reliably induced LTP in DMSO-treated slices but not in RA-treated slices (Figure 1A; Figure S1A) (DMSO, 269.91% ± 31.57%; RA, 113.37% ± 7.68%; measured 55–60 min after induction). Given the previously established role of RARα in synaptic RA signaling (Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J. Nam C.I. Poon M.M. Ting P. Chen L.

USA. 2008; 105: 20303-20308Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we asked whether this RA blockade of LTP is also mediated by RARα. We injected lentiviruses expressing either wild-type (active) or mutant (inactive) Cre recombinase (Cre or mCre, respectively) into the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of cultured slices obtained from conditional RARα KO mice (Chapellier et al., 2002Chapellier B. Mark M. Garnier J.M. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Ghyselinck N.B.

Schroeder J. Aoto J. Chen L. Conditional RARα knockout mice reveal acute requirement for retinoic acid and RARα in homeostatic plasticity.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2012; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), thus selectively deleting RARα in postsynaptic neurons. Deletion of RARα did not impair LTP (Figures 1B and S1B) (mCre/DMSO, 308.77% ± 27.22%; Cre/DMSO, 261.34% ± 24.2%), consistent with previous observations that RA/RARα signaling is specifically involved in homeostatic synaptic plasticity but not LTP (Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J.

Schroeder J. Aoto J. Chen L. Conditional RARα knockout mice reveal acute requirement for retinoic acid and RARα in homeostatic plasticity.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2012; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RA treatment in mCre-infected neurons, similar to that in uninfected neurons, greatly diminished LTP (Figures 1B and S1B) (mCre/RA, 152.22% ± 27.22%), whereas deletion of RARα rescued the ability of neurons to undergo LTP following RA treatment (Figures 1B and S1B) (Cre/RA, 322.67% ± 73.21%). Thus, although RA/RARα signaling is not required for LTP, RA’s action on excitatory synapses prevents subsequent induction of LTP, and this effect of RA operates by an RARα-mediated signaling pathway. RA is traditionally considered a key transcription factor during development (Maden, 2007Maden M. Retinoic acid in the development, regeneration and maintenance of the nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), but it also controls synaptic strength by regulating local protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites (Maghsoodi et al., 2008Maghsoodi B.

To test whether RA blocks LTP induction through an action that also requires protein synthesis, we examined the effect of a protein synthesis blocker, anisomycin, on LTP. Pretreating slices with anisomycin for 2 hr (which blocks the effect of RA on synaptic strength; Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J. Nam C.I. Poon M.M. Ting P. Chen L. Synaptic signaling by all-trans retinoic acid in homeostatic synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2008; 60: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) rescued LTP in RA-treated slices (Figures 1C and S1C) (RA, 129.52% ± 12.62%; anisomycin + RA, 217.22% ± 21.42%), confirming the hypothesis that RA blocks LTP via a protein synthesis-dependent process. Anisomycin treatment, however, did not affect LTP under control conditions, demonstrating that its effect is specific to the RA condition (Figures 1C and S1C) (anisomycin, 225.30% ± 21.99%; measured 55–60 min after induction). To further control for potential non-specific effects of anisomycin, we repeated the same series of experiments with another protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Similar to anisomycin, cycloheximde co-treated with RA blocked the effect of RA on LTP (Figures S1D and S1E) (RA, 110.70% ± 7.21%; cycloheximide, 242.53% ± 23.12%; cycloheximide + RA, 198.75% ± 17.50%). One interpretation for the impaired LTP after RA treatment is that RA increases excitatory synaptic strength and thereby prevents the subsequent potentiation of synapses evoked by LTP-induction protocols. Therefore, we wanted to first confirm that RA, indeed, increased synaptic excitation under our experimental conditions. Consistent with previous results (Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J. Nam C.I. Poon M.M. Ting P. Chen L. Synaptic signaling by all-trans retinoic acid in homeostatic synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2008; 60: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), RA increased the amplitude, but not the frequency, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) from hippocampal CA1 neurons (Figure 2A) (DMSO, 12.85 ± 0.33 pA, 0.78 ± 0.12 Hz; RA, 15.10 ± 0.48 pA, 0.70 ± 0.09 Hz). We previously reported that RA potentiates the mEPSC amplitude of primary cultured neurons in a multiplicative fashion (Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J. Nam C.I. Poon M.M. Ting P. Chen L. Synaptic signaling by all-trans retinoic acid in homeostatic synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2008; 60: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), similar to synaptic scaling in response to activity blockade (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). We wondered whether RA-induced potentiation of mEPSC in organotypic slices follows the same pattern. When ranked mEPSC amplitudes of RA-treated responses were plotted against those of DMSO-treated responses, we noticed that, for more than 95% of mEPSCs that exhibit mEPSC amplitudes of <30 pA, the increase in mEPSC amplitude appeared to be strictly multiplicative (i.e., scaled; Figure S2A1). However, at large mEPSC amplitudes (30–60 pA, less than 5% of the total population), supralinear and sublinear potentiation was observed (Figure S2A2). Thus, RA-mediated potentiation primarily follows a multiplicative pattern for the majority of mEPSCs. The complexity of the potentiation pattern associated with a small subset of responses at higher amplitudes may reflect RA’s heterogeneous action at a subset of synapses. We speculate that the differences in pathway/input type and the states of the synapses, which are better preserved in organotypic slices, may underlie such complexity. To test whether RA enhances both AMPAR-mediated and NMDAR-mediated components of excitatory synaptic transmission, we recorded dual-component mEPSCs in the absence of external Mg2+ (Arendt et al., 2013Arendt K.L. Sarti F. Chen L. Chronic inactivation of a neural circuit enhances LTP by inducing silent synapse formation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RA treatment did not result in any significant increase in the NMDAR-mediated component of mEPSCs (DMSO, 2.03 ± 0.22 pA; RA, 2.38 ± 0.20 pA), despite the persistent increase in the AMPAR-mediated component as measured in this analysis (DMSO, 10.56 ± 0.39 pA; RA, 12.33 ± 0.59 pA) (Figure 2B). Additionally, we examined the AMPAR/NMDAR response ratio of evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) and found that RA significantly increased the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (Figure 2C) (DMSO, 1.12 ± 0.12; RA, 1.63 ± 0.17). We did not observe any effect of RA on the paired-pulse ratio or passive membrane properties (Figures S2B and S2C). Thus, RA selectively enhances AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses due to specific promotion of AMPAR insertion (Aoto et al., 2008Aoto J. Nam C.I. Poon M.M. Ting P. Chen L. Synaptic signaling by all-trans retinoic acid in homeostatic synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2008; 60: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). AMPAR insertion during LTP requires activity and NMDAR activation (Collingridge et al., 1983Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.J. McLennan H. Excitatory amino acids in synaptic transmission in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway of the rat hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1983; 334: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L. Nicoll R.A. AMPARs and synaptic plasticity: the last 25 years.Neuron. 2013; 80: 704-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether the RA-mediated increase in the synaptic content of AMPARs also required activity and NMDAR activation. During acute RA treatment, we co-applied hippocampal slices with the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block neuronal activity. Surprisingly, TTX co-applied with RA (<4 hr) blocked the enhancement of the mEPSC amplitude by RA (Figure 2D) (DMSO, 10.58 ± 0.30 pA; RA, 12.65 ± 0.24 pA; RA + TTX, 11.24 ± 0.31 pA). Note that this protocol differs from the TTX treatment used to induce homeostatic plasticity that involves a chronic pretreatment of neurons, not an acute addition of TTX. To address whether NMDAR activity was also required for AMPAR insertion, in a manner similar to LTP, we co-applied APV acutely with RA (<4 hr) to specifically block NMDAR activation and found that this treatment also blocked the increase in mEPSC amplitude by RA (Figure 2D) (DMSO, 11.17 ± 0.28 pA; RA, 13.81 ± 0.51 pA; RA + APV, 11.31 ± 0.35 pA). Thus, similar to LTP-induced postsynaptic AMPAR insertion, the RA-mediated increase in post-synaptic AMPARs also requires NMDAR activation. In other words, RA only enhances the strength of actively used synapses, possibly as a mechanism to ensure that the RA-mediated AMPAR insertion does not occur at synapses that are not being used. LTP induction is known to not only increase the abundance of AMPARs at synapses that already contain AMPARs but also activate “silent” synapses lacking AMPARs (but containing NMDARs) by inserting AMPARs into these synapses (Isaac et al., 1995Isaac J.T. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Evidence for silent synapses: implications for the expression of LTP.Neuron. 1995; 15: 427-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, Liao et al., 1995Liao D. Hessler N.A. Malinow R. Activation of postsynaptically silent synapses during pairing-induced LTP in CA1 region of hippocampal slice.Nature. 1995; 375: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Given the similar requirement of NMDAR activation for both LTP-induced and RA-induced AMPAR insertion at synapses, we were curious as to whether RA is capable of activating silent synapses by promoting insertion of AMPARs into NMDAR-only synapses. To induce formation of silent synapses, we applied a protocol used previously in cultured hippocampal slices—prolonged silencing of neural network activity with TTX for 60 hr—that reliably induces formation of silent synapses containing only NMDARs (Arendt et al., 2013Arendt K.L. Sarti F. Chen L. Chronic inactivation of a neural circuit enhances LTP by inducing silent synapse formation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). For the detection of silent synapses, cells were clamped at their resting membrane potential (∼−60 mV), and excitatory synaptic transmission was elicited with a weak stimulus that produced failures in about 50% of trials. Epochs of 50 trials of transmission were recorded at −60 mV and +40 mV for each cell, and the failure rate at each of these two holding potentials was computed. In slices cultured under control conditions, the failure rate was comparable between the negative and the positive holding potentials (Figures 3B and 3E) (−60 mV, 55.73% ± 2.59%; +40 mV, 53.82% ± 3.83%), indicating that most synapses are active and contained both AMPARs and NMDARs at this stage of development. Consistent with previous work (Arendt et al., 2013Arendt K.L. Sarti F. Chen L. Chronic inactivation of a neural circuit enhances LTP by inducing silent synapse formation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), prolonged TTX treatment induced formation of silent synapses, indicated by the significantly higher failure rate at −60 mV than at the +40 mV holding potential (Figures 3C and 3E) (−60 mV, 49.29% ± 2.28%; +40 mV, 20.61% ± 2.74%), which suggests that a larger proportion of synapses contain only NMDARs but not AMPARs. It is important to note that acute RA treatment, per se, did not induce silent synapses (Figures 3D and 3E) (−60 mV, 49.18% ± 3.76%; +40 mV, 48.57% ± 5.10%). We then applied RA to slices that had been treated with TTX for 60 hr. Washing out TTX during RA treatment to restore network activity converted silent synapses to active synapses, as evidenced by the similar failure rates at −60 mV and +40 mV (Figure 3F) (60-hr TTX with wash + RA: −60 mV, 50.05% ± 2.38%; +40 mV, 48.82% ± 3.71%). This conversion of silent to functional synapses by RA requires intact network activity as well as NMDAR activation because the presence of TTX or APV during RA treatment prevented the activation of silent synapses (Figure 3F) (60-hr TTX with no wash + RA: −60 mV, 49.16% ± 4.12%; +40 mV, 26.76% ± 3.25%; 60-hr TTX with wash + RA + APV: −60 mV, 52.80% ± 4.30%; +40 mV, 28.51% ± 4.87%). It is important to note that simply washing out TTX without RA treatment was not sufficient to convert silent synapses into active synapses within the 4-hr time window used for our experiments (Figure 3F) (60-hr TTX with wash: −60 mV, 54.22% ± 4.00%; +40 mV, 31.68% ± 3.60%). In addition to evoked EPSCs, we also examined mEPSCs during silent-synapse activation. As expected, homeostatic synaptic plasticity induced by prolonged TTX treatment manifested as an increase in mEPSC amplitude (Figure 3G) (DMSO, 11.58 ± 0.27 pA; 60-hr TTX, 14.06 ± 0.62 pA) without changes in mEPSC frequency (Figure 3G) (DMSO, 0.43 ± 0.05 Hz; 60-hr TTX, 0.37 ± 0.05 Hz) (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). By contrast, following prolonged TTX treatment, incubation with RA (in the absence of TTX) activated silent synapses, as evidenced by a significant increase in the mEPSC frequency (Figure 3G) (60-hr TTX with wash + RA, 0.66 ± 0.07 Hz). Notably, RA treatment after prolonged TTX treatment also decreased the mEPSC amplitude (Figure 3G) (60-hr TTX with wash + RA, 12.06 ± 0.54 pA), presumably because newly activated silent synapses have smaller mEPSC amplitudes. Thus, we plotted ranked amplitudes of the three groups (Figure S3A). Indeed, while prolonged TTX treatment induced synaptic scaling, responses recorded in neurons that received RA after TTX treatments displayed a large population of small amplitudes that are not apparently potentiated, likely representing the population of newly activated silent synapses (Figure S3A). Similar to the failure rate experiments described earlier, the presence of TTX during RA treatment prevented the activation of silent synapses, as evidenced by a lack of change in mEPSC frequency (Figure 3H) (amplitude: DMSO, 10.93 ± 0.25 pA; 60-hr TTX, 13.70 ± 0.41 pA; 60-hr TTX with no wash + RA, 12.66 ± 0.51 pA; frequency: DMSO, 0.37 ± 0.04 Hz; 60-hr TTX, 0.42 ± 0.05 Hz; 60-hr TTX with no wash + RA, 0.34 ± 0.07 Hz). Ranked plots of the mEPSC amplitudes confirmed this notion in that the TTX and the TTX with no wash + RA groups showed a similar degree of potentiation of mEPSC amplitudes (Figure S3B). Moreover, we previously showed that generation of silent synapses by prolonged TTX treatment leads to a greater potentiation when LTP is induced subsequently (Arendt et al., 2013Arendt K.L. Sarti F. Chen L. Chronic inactivation of a neural circuit enhances LTP by inducing silent synapse formation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This enhancement of LTP was completely reversed to an impairment of LTP if the slices were incubated with RA after TTX washout (Figures S3C and S3D) (control, 224.21% ± 30.24%; 60-hr TTX, 406.67% ± 44.38%; 60-hr TTX with wash + RA, 142.64% ± 17.21%), which is consistent with RA’s action in converting silent synapses into functional synapses. By contrast, if RA was applied without TTX washout, the greater LTP was maintained (Figures S3C and S3D) (60-hr TTX with no wash + RA, 425.93% ± 73.96%). Taken together, the results obtained with both miniature and evoked synaptic responses strongly suggest that RA-induced AMPAR insertion into synapses shares common features with LTP-induced AMPAR insertion, in that both processes require neuronal activity and NMDAR activation. Although this finding may appear at first glance to be counterintuitive, given that RA-dependent homeostatic plasticity is induced by the inactivation of synaptic activity, not by increased synaptic activity, it is remarkable that expression of homeostatic plasticity nevertheless requires a suspension of chronic inactivity—continuous blockade of synaptic activity in fact prevents homeostatic plasticity. Intrigued by the common requirement of NMDAR activation for AMPAR insertion in the LTP and RA pathways, we sought to further dissect the steps downstream of NMDAR activation in RA-induced AMPAR insertion. Similar to presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicle release, postsynaptic vesicle exocytosis is thought to involve assembly of SNARE complexes and SNARE-binding proteins. Indeed, Cpx, an important co-factor for synaptotagmin-triggered presynaptic vesicle fusion (McMahon et al., 1995McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C.

In vertebrates, the terminal sugars of the glycocalyx are often sialic acids, 9-carbon backbone anionic sugars implicated in intermolecular and intercellular interactions. The vertebrate brain is particularly enriched in sialic acid-containing glycolipids termed gangliosides. Human congenital disorders of ganglioside biosynthesis result in paraplegia, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. To better understand sialoglycan functions in the nervous system, we studied brain anatomy, histology, biochemistry, and behavior in mice with engineered mutations in St3gal2 and St3gal3, sialyltransferase genes responsible for terminal sialylation of gangliosides and some glycoproteins. St3gal2/3 double-null mice displayed dysmyelination marked by a 40% reduction in major myelin proteins, 30% fewer myelinated axons, a 33% decrease in myelin thickness, and molecular disruptions at nodes of Ranvier. In part, these changes may be due to dysregulation of ganglioside-mediated oligodendroglial precursor cell proliferation. Neuronal markers were also reduced up to 40%, and hippocampal neurons had smaller dendritic arbors. Young adult St3gal2/3 double-null mice displayed impaired motor coordination, disturbed gait, and profound cognitive disability. Comparisons among sialyltransferase mutant mice provide insights into the functional roles of brain gangliosides and sialoglycoproteins consistent with related human congenital disorders."

Glutamate mediates the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain by activating the AMPA-subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Consequently, many studies of synaptic plasticity have focused on the mechanism of local changes in the composition and number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), with particular focus on changes that underlie the phenomena of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (Anggono and Huganir, 2012Anggono V.

LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches.Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). These potentiation protocols cause local, synapse-specific changes in postsynaptic receptors and thus modify the strength of neurotransmission. Additionally, information processing by neural circuits is dependent on maintaining an optimal strength of synaptic inputs in the face of constant perturbations. Thus, postsynaptic receptor numbers are tightly constrained by homeostatic mechanisms (Davis, 2013Davis G.W. Homeostatic signaling and the stabilization of neural function.Neuron. 2013; 80: 718-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Turrigiano, 2008Turrigiano G.G. The self-tuning neuron: synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses.Cell. 2008; 135: 422-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that maintain the optimal number of AMPARs at a given synapse are still not well understood. Even less understood is the logistical problem of maintaining AMPAR numbers at the hundreds to thousands of independently functioning synapses that are distributed along dendritic branches that can extend hundreds of microns from the neuronal cell body. We approached the question of how AMPARs are maintained at synapses using an experimental design that allowed us to integrate in vivo cell biological and electrophysiological studies in C. elegans. A subset of the 302 neurons in the C. elegans nervous system communicate by the synaptic release of glutamate and these neurons contribute to specific behaviors (de Bono and Maricq, 2005de Bono M. Maricq A.V. Neuronal substrates of complex behaviors in C. elegans.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 451-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In particular, interneurons that participate in the control of worm movement and avoidance responses express the GLR-1 AMPAR signaling complex, which is composed of multiple receptor and auxiliary subunits, and is responsible for fast postsynaptic glutamate-gated current. In mutants where a component of the complex has been disrupted, such as the GLR-1 subunit, the ratio of forward to backward movement is altered, thus disrupting foraging behavior (de Bono and Maricq, 2005de Bono M.

Recently, we demonstrated that evolutionarily conserved kinesin-1 microtubule-dependent motors mediate the delivery and removal of postsynaptic AMPARs. In unc-116 (KIF5) mutants, the active transport of GLR-1 is abolished, and the peak amplitude of glutamate-gated current greatly reduced (Hoerndli et al., 2013Hoerndli F.J. Maxfield D.A. Brockie P.J.

These findings have important implications for synaptic function and plasticity because kinesin motors, and their GLR-1 cargo, are distributed along the length of a neuronal process and can rapidly repopulate synapses with AMPARs (Hoerndli et al., 2013Hoerndli F.J. Maxfield D.A. Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Jensen E. Wang R. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V.

Indeed, each synapse is at most only a few seconds removed from motors transporting AMPAR cargo, raising the question of how neurons regulate the motor-driven delivery and removal of synaptic receptors. A candidate protein for the regulation of AMPAR transport is CaMKII, a Ca2+-dependent kinase with diverse cellular functions. With respect to synaptic transmission, CaMKII is recognized as a key synaptic protein that is required to modify the number of synaptic AMPARs in response to LTP and LTD stimulation protocols (Hell, 2014Hell J.W.

In C. elegans, the unc-43 gene encodes the sole CaMKII homolog (Reiner et al., 1999Reiner D.J. Newton E.M. Tian H. Thomas J.H.

Kaplan J.M. CaMKII regulates the density of central glutamatergic synapses in vivo.Nature. 1999; 402: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In unc-43 loss-of-function (lf) mutants, GLR-1 accumulates in neuronal cell bodies suggesting that UNC-43/CaMKII might have a role in GLR-1 transport (Rongo and Kaplan, 1999Rongo C. Kaplan J.M. CaMKII regulates the density of central glutamatergic synapses in vivo.Nature. 1999; 402: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and CaMKII regulate activity-dependent transport of synaptic AMPARs. Additionally, using an optogenetics strategy, we demonstrate the dependence of synapse-specific plasticity on CaMKII. Remarkably, we find that AMPAR transport, AMPAR-mediated currents, and the regulation of synaptic strength are all disrupted in unc-43/CaMKII mutants. Our findings indicate that the number of functional postsynaptic AMPARs is tightly regulated by CaMKII and suggest that synaptic plasticity is controlled in part by regulated motor-driven transport. To determine the role of neuronal activity in the transport of AMPARs, we used a histamine-gated chloride channel (HisCl1) and cell-specific promoters to selectively silence (hyperpolarize) neurons (Pokala et al., 2014Pokala N. Liu Q. Gordus A. Bargmann C.I. Inducible and titratable silencing of Caenorhabditis elegans neurons in vivo with histamine-gated chloride channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 2770-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using either the eat-4 or flp-18 promoter to drive HisCl1 expression, we silenced presynaptic glutamatergic neurons or postsynaptic AVA neurons (Feinberg et al., 2008Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

We recorded the transport of a functional GLR-1::GFP fusion protein in the proximal processes of the AVA neurons (Figure S1A) using in vivo streaming confocal microscopy as previously described (Hoerndli et al., 2013Hoerndli F.J. Maxfield D.A. Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Jensen E. Wang R. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. Kinesin-1 regulates synaptic strength by mediating the delivery, removal, and redistribution of AMPA receptors.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1421-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). From these movies, we generated kymographs that revealed that AMPAR transport was markedly diminished when transgenic worms that expressed HisCl1 in presynaptic neurons (eat-4 promoter) were treated with 10 mM HisCl2 (Figure 1A). We found similar defects in mutants with a loss-of-function mutation in the EAT-4 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) (Figure 1A; Figures S1B and S1D) and in transgenic worms treated with HisCl2 that expressed HisCl1 in postsynaptic AVA neurons (flp-18 promoter) (Figure 1B). Histamine treatment alone did not affect transport (Control, Figures 1A and 1B), and expression of the HisCl1 channel in neurons had no effect on AMPAR transport in the absence of HisCl2 (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that AMPAR transport is modified by changes in postsynaptic potential dependent on presynaptic glutamate release. This raised the question of how changes in postsynaptic potential regulate AMPAR transport. One possibility is that glutamatergic transmission leads to changes in the activity of VGCCs and thus the concentration of intracellular Ca2+. The α2δ subunit contributes to the function of all members of the VGCC family (Dolphin, 2013Dolphin A.C. The α2δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined AMPAR transport in unc-36/α2δ mutants and found that transport was severely disrupted (Figures 1C and 1D). This result is consistent with an earlier report of altered GLR-1::GFP distribution in unc-36 mutants (Rongo and Kaplan, 1999Rongo C. Kaplan J.M. CaMKII regulates the density of central glutamatergic synapses in vivo.Nature. 1999; 402: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We observed similar transport defects with cell-specific RNAi knockdown of unc-36 in AVA (Figures S1C and S1D). The defects were partially rescued in transgenic unc-36 mutants that specifically expressed a wild-type unc-36 transgene in AVA (unc-36(lf) AVA rescue; Figures 1C and 1D). The partial rescue was expected given the known dependence of presynaptic release on VGCCs (Südhof, 2013Südhof T.C. Neurotransmitter release: the last millisecond in the life of a synaptic vesicle.Neuron. 2013; 80: 675-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that VGCCs function in AVA to regulate AMPAR transport. Similar to vertebrates, C. elegans has three classes of VGCC α1 subunits, but each class contains only a single homolog, e.g., L-type (EGL-19), non-L-type (UNC-2), and T-type (CCA-1) (Jeziorski et al., 2000Jeziorski M.C. Greenberg R.M. Anderson P.A. The molecular biology of invertebrate voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels.J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 841-856PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that flux was significantly reduced in unc-2 and egl-19 mutants (Figures 1C and 1D). In summary, our results suggest a model where glutamatergic signaling activates postsynaptic VGCCs, thus modifying intracellular Ca2+ and consequently AMPAR transport. To learn more about this Ca2+-signaling pathway, we turned to a candidate gene approach. Because of the known dependence of UNC-43/CaMKII on Ca2+, we examined AMPAR transport in unc-43 mutants. We found a significant decrease in GLR-1 flux in unc-43 loss-of-function (lf) mutants when compared to wild-type worms (Figures 2A and 2B ), with approximately 20% of flux remaining in unc-43(lf) mutants. We did not find that the speed of transport was dramatically altered in unc-43 mutants (anterograde: WT, 1.67 ± 0.04 μm/s; unc-43(lf), 1.35 ± 0.05 μm/s; retrograde: WT, 1.76 ± 0.07 μm/s; unc-43(lf), 1.66 ± 0.17 μm/s). We could rescue the defective transport in unc-43(lf) transgenic mutants by selectively expressing a wild-type unc-43 transgene in AVA (unc-43(lf) rescue; Figures 2A and 2B), indicating that UNC-43/CaMKII has a cell-autonomous role in the transport of GLR-1. CaMKII can have non-catalytic activity in addition to its well-known kinase function (Bingol et al., 2010Bingol B. Wang C.F. Arnott D. Cheng D. Peng J. Sheng M. Autophosphorylated CaMKIIalpha acts as a scaffold to recruit proteasomes to dendritic spines.Cell. 2010; 140: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these roles, we measured GLR-1 flux in transgenic unc-43(lf) mutants that expressed an engineered “kinase-dead” variant of UNC-43 either alone (K42R) or in combination with a second mutation that partially eliminates CaMKII’s dependence on Ca2+ (K42R; T286D) (Rongo and Kaplan, 1999Rongo C. Kaplan J.M. CaMKII regulates the density of central glutamatergic synapses in vivo.Nature. 1999; 402: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Neither variant rescued GLR-1 flux, leading us to conclude that UNC-43/CaMKII kinase activity was required for transport (Figures 2A and 2B). We considered that the transport defects observed in unc-43 mutants might be a consequence of more general defects in motor-mediated transport. To address this possibility, we first examined the movement of UNC-116/KIF5 tagged with GFP and did not observe any defects in movement (Figure S2A). We also measured the rate of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of UNC-116::GFP and found no difference between unc-43(lf) and wild-type (Figure S2B). Furthermore, microtubule polymerization in AVA appeared normal in unc-43(lf) mutants (Figure S2C). Finally, we asked whether all UNC-116/KIF5-mediated cargo transport was dependent on UNC-43/CaMKII by examining the movement of VAMP/synaptobrevin, a synaptic vesicle protein previously identified to be an UNC-116/KIF5 cargo (Byrd et al., 2001Byrd D.T. Kawasaki M. Walcoff M. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Jin Y. UNC-16, a JNK-signaling scaffold protein, regulates vesicle transport in C. elegans.Neuron. 2001; 32: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We confirmed that VAMP transport was defective in unc-116 mutants but found no obvious defects in unc-43(lf) mutants (Figure S2D). To determine whether CaMKII has an evolutionarily conserved function with respect to AMPAR transport, we expressed a vertebrate (mouse) alpha-CaMKII (mCaMKII) specifically in the AVA neurons of C. elegans unc-43(lf) transgenic mutants and found that this partially rescued GLR-1 transport defects (Figures 2A and 2B). This result indicated that mCaMKII phosphorylated the relevant C. elegans substrates and played a conserved role in regulating AMPAR transport. We next asked whether the defects in AMPAR flux were associated with a change in glutamate-gated current. Voltage-clamp records from AVA revealed that peak current in response to pressure application of glutamate (Figure S1A) was dramatically decreased in unc-43(lf) mutants (Figures 2C and 2D). Current amplitude was rescued by cell-specific expression of either wild-type UNC-43 or mouse CaMKII, indicating a cell-autonomous and evolutionarily conserved role for CaMKII in the regulation of AMPARs (Figures 2C and 2D). Pressure application of glutamate activates both synaptic and extrasynaptic pools of AMPARs in the AVA neural process. To determine whether synaptic currents were modified in unc-43(lf) mutants, we measured endogenous synaptic activity in wild-type and unc-43(lf) worms and found that mEPSC amplitude was significantly reduced in unc-43 mutants (Figures 2E and 2F). Furthermore, we found no appreciable difference in acetylcholine (ACh)-gated currents between wild-type and unc-43(lf) mutants (Figures S3A and S3B), indicating that CaMKII has some specificity with respect to the regulation of ligand-gated receptors. To further characterize the signaling pathway that regulates GLR-1 transport, we examined transport in unc-43 mutants with a gain-of-function (gf) point mutation (n498sd) that modifies the kinase such that its function is partially independent of Ca2+ (Reiner et al., 1999Reiner D.J. Newton E.M. Tian H. Thomas J.H. Diverse behavioural defects caused by mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans unc-43 CaM kinase II.Nature. 1999; 402: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In these mutants, GLR-1 flux was significantly greater than in wild-type and neither presynaptic nor postsynaptic HisCl1-mediated hyperpolarization decreased the flux (Figures 3A–3D). To directly test whether the effects of unc-43(gf) on AMPAR flux were independent of VGCCs, we examined flux in unc-36(lf); unc-43(gf) double mutants. In contrast to the greatly diminished flux in unc-36(lf) single mutants (Figure 1D), flux in the double mutants was approximately the same as in the unc-43(gf) single mutants (Figures 3E and 3F). The results of this epistasis analysis are consistent with CaMKII functioning downstream of VGCCs in the control of AMPAR flux. We found extensive co-localization of GLR-1, UNC-43/CaMKII, and UNC-116/KIF5 in the AVA cell body and processes (Figures S4A and S4B). In unc-43(lf) mutants, AMPAR flux is greatly decreased despite UNC-116/KIF5 motors moving along apparently normal microtubules (Figure S2C). These results are consistent with either UNC-43/CaMKII acting upstream of UNC-116/KIF5 to promote AMPAR flux or UNC-116/KIF5 acting in a regulatory step upstream of UNC-43/CaMKII. To distinguish between these models, we generated double mutants between unc-43(gf), which has greater than normal AMPAR flux, and unc-116(RNAi). In a previous study, we found that GLR-1 flux in the AVA neurons was greatly reduced by cell-specific RNAi knockdown of unc-116 in AVA (Hoerndli et al., 2013Hoerndli F.J. Maxfield D.A. Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Jensen E. Wang R. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. Kinesin-1 regulates synaptic strength by mediating the delivery, removal, and redistribution of AMPA receptors.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1421-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We found that flux in unc-116(RNAi); unc-43(gf) double mutants was indistinguishable from that of unc-116(RNAi) single mutants (Figures 4A and 4B ). Importantly, UNC-43/CaMKII was still found at synapses in unc-116(lf) mutants (Figure S4C). In an independent test, we examined flux in double mutants between unc-43(gf) and kinesin light chain 2 (klc-2). In klc-2 single mutants, AMPAR flux is dramatically reduced (Figures 4A and 4B) (Hoerndli et al., 2013Hoerndli F.J. Maxfield D.A. Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Jensen E. Wang R. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. Kinesin-1 regulates synaptic strength by mediating the delivery, removal, and redistribution of AMPA receptors.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1421-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and AMPAR-mediated currents decreased (data not shown). Similar to unc-116(RNAi) knockdown, klc-2(lf) suppressed the increased flux observed in unc-43(gf) with unc-43(gf); klc-2(lf) double mutants showing similar defects to klc-2(lf) single mutants (Figures 4A and 4B). Additionally, KLC-2 co-localized with GLR-1 in AVA processes (Figure S5A). These results are consistent with AMPAR flux being dependent on an UNC-116–KLC-2 motor complex that functions downstream of UNC-43/CaMKII. Consistent with the effects on AMPAR flux, we found that current amplitudes in unc-43(lf) were approximately the same as those in unc-116(RNAi) mutants and indistinguishable from unc-116(RNAi); unc-43(lf) double mutants (Figures 4C and 4D). Furthermore, current amplitudes in unc-116(RNAi); unc-43(gf) were approximately the same magnitude as those in unc-116(RNAi), providing additional support for the notion that UNC-43/CaMKII acts upstream of UNC-116/KIF5 (Figures 4C and 4D). To gain additional mechanistic insight into this signaling pathway, we sought to identify potential targets of CaMKII. It is well known that AMPARs can be phosphorylated by CaMKII (Hell, 2014Hell J.W. CaMKII: claiming center stage in postsynaptic function and organization.Neuron. 2014; 81: 249-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar); however, the extent of this phosphorylation and importance for cellular processes such as LTP has recently been questioned (Granger et al., 2013Granger A.J. Shi Y. Lu W. Cerpas M. Nicoll R.A. LTP requires a reserve pool of glutamate receptors independent of subunit type.Nature. 2013; 493: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Hosokawa et al., 2015Hosokawa T. Mitsushima D. Kaneko R. Hayashi Y. Stoichiometry and phosphoisotypes of hippocampal AMPA-type glutamate receptor phosphorylation.Neuron. 2015; 85: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using multiple algorithms, we were unable to identify consensus CaMKII phosphorylation sites in the primary amino sequence of GLR-1. Additionally, a line-up of the amino acid sequence of mammalian GluA1 and C. elegans GLR-1 did not identify a site in GLR-1 that is equivalent to the GluA1 S831 CaMKII phosphorylation site. We also searched for possible consensus CaMKII phosphorylation sites in motor proteins and found three strong consensus sites in KLC-2 (T208, S240, and S276). We mutated all three sites to alanine (A) residues and expressed the modified protein, KLC-2(AAA), in transgenic worms. The mutations did not decrease the expression of KLC-2 (Figure S5B) but did dramatically reduce AMPAR flux (Figures 4E and 4F). Importantly, KLC-2(AAA) reduced flux in unc-43(gf) mutants, a finding that supports the notion that UNC-43/CaMKII functions upstream of the motor complex. We extended our analysis by evaluating single point mutations and observed decreased AMPAR flux with S276A and S240A, but not T208A, in which flux was somewhat increased (Figures 4E and 4F). We also evaluated flux in transgenic worms that expressed a phosphomimetic form of KLC-2 (where all three sites were mutated to D residues) and found that transport was indistinguishable from wild-type (Figures 4E and 4F). Importantly, KLC-2(DDD) did not restore AMPAR transport in unc-43(lf) mutants (Figures 4E and 4F). This finding indicates that CaMKII has additional targets that contribute to AMPAR transport. Together, our results are consistent with a model where UNC-43/CaMKII functions downstream of VGCCs and upstream of UNC-116 and KLC-2 to regulate AMPAR transport. In unc-116/KIF5 mutants, GLR-1 receptors can slowly diffuse to synapses in the ventral nerve cord, where they accumulate as a consequence of defective removal (Hoerndli et al., 2013Hoerndli F.J. Maxfield D.A. Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Jensen E. Wang R. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V.

https://openalex.org/W2007967900,"Low frequency fluctuations (LFFs) of the BOLD signal are a major discovery in the study of the resting brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two fMRI-based measures, functional connectivity (FC), a measure of signal synchronicity, and the amplitude of LFFs (ALFF), a measure of signal periodicity, have been proved to be sensitive to changes induced by several neurological diseases, including degenerative dementia. In spite of the increasing use of these measures, whether and how they are related to each other remains to be elucidated. In this work we used voxel-wise FC and ALFF computed in different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz; and full-band: 0.01-0.073 Hz), in order to assess their relationship in healthy elderly as well as the relevant changes induced by Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We found that in healthy elderly subjects FC and ALFF are positively correlated in anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (full-band, slow-4 and slow-5), temporal cortex (full-band and slow-5), and in a set of subcortical regions (full-band and slow-4). These correlation patterns between FC and ALFF were absent in either AD or MCI patients. Notably, the loss of correlation between FC and ALFF in the AD group was primarily due to changes in FC rather than in ALFF. Our results indicate that degenerative dementia is characterized by a loss of global connection rather than by a decrease of fluctuation amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W2003908646,"The new G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER/GPR30) plays important roles in many organ systems. The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) is essential for removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and for shaping the time courses of Ca2+-dependent activities. Here, we show that PMCA and GPER/GPR30 physically interact and functionally influence each other. In primary endothelial cells, GPER/GPR30 agonist G-1 decreases PMCA-mediated Ca2+ extrusion by promoting PMCA tyrosine phosphorylation. GPER/GPR30 overexpression decreases PMCA activity, and G-1 further potentiates this effect. GPER/GPR30 knockdown increases PMCA activity, whereas PMCA knockdown substantially reduces GPER/GPR30-mediated phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2). GPER/GPR30 co-immunoprecipitates with PMCA with or without treatment with 17β-estradiol, thapsigargin, or G-1. Heterologously expressed GPER/GPR30 in HEK 293 cells co-localizes with PMCA4b, the main endothelial PMCA isoform. Endothelial cells robustly express the PDZ post-synaptic density protein (PSD)-95, whose knockdown reduces the association between GPER/GPR30 and PMCA. Additionally, the association between PMCA4b and GPER/GPR30 is substantially reduced by truncation of either or both of their C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs. Functionally, inhibition of PMCA activity is significantly reduced by truncation of GPER/GPR30's C-terminal PDZ-binding motif.

The new G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER/GPR30) plays important roles in many organ systems. The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) is essential for removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and for shaping the time courses of Ca2+-dependent activities. Here, we show that PMCA and GPER/GPR30 physically interact and functionally influence each other. In primary endothelial cells, GPER/GPR30 agonist G-1 decreases PMCA-mediated Ca2+ extrusion by promoting PMCA tyrosine phosphorylation. GPER/GPR30 overexpression decreases PMCA activity, and G-1 further potentiates this effect. GPER/GPR30 knockdown increases PMCA activity, whereas PMCA knockdown substantially reduces GPER/GPR30-mediated phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2). GPER/GPR30 co-immunoprecipitates with PMCA with or without treatment with 17β-estradiol, thapsigargin, or G-1. Heterologously expressed GPER/GPR30 in HEK 293 cells co-localizes with PMCA4b, the main endothelial PMCA isoform. Endothelial cells robustly express the PDZ post-synaptic density protein (PSD)-95, whose knockdown reduces the association between GPER/GPR30 and PMCA. Additionally, the association between PMCA4b and GPER/GPR30 is substantially reduced by truncation of either or both of their C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs.

Despite the many actions described for GPER/GPR30, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. For example, although GPER/GPR30 has been shown to associate with Gαs (2Filardo E. Quinn J. Pang Y. Graeber C. Shaw S. Dong J. Thomas P.

In addition, although GPER/GPR30 stimulation with 17β-estradiol or GPR30 agonist G-1 has frequently been shown to induce intracellular Ca2+ signals (2Filardo E. Quinn J. Pang Y. Graeber C. Shaw S.

Biol. 2006; 2: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), the effects of GPER/GPR30 activation on the activity of the key components of Ca2+ homeostasis and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ following agonist-induced Ca2+ signals is important for cell functions by controlling the dynamics of Ca2+ signals. For example, in vascular smooth muscle cells, the enhanced rate of cytoplasmic Ca2+ removal causes faster relaxation, allowing for a more dynamic control of vascular tone (17Rinaldi G.J. Blood pressure fall and increased relaxation of aortic smooth muscle in diabetic rats.Diabetes Metab. 2005; 31: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, cytoplasmic Ca2+ removal prevents Ca2+ overload and its consequences. In the opposite direction, reductions in the rate of cytoplasmic Ca2+ removal prolong the time courses of Ca2+-dependent processes (18Tran Q.K. Black D.J. Persechini A.

Dominant affectors in the calmodulin network shape the time courses of target responses in the cell.Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) is a major Ca2+ extrusion mechanism in many cell types. In vascular endothelial cells, PMCA has been suggested to be responsible for up to 50% of the removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (20Wang X. Reznick S. Li P. Liang W. van Breemen C. Ca2+ removal mechanisms in freshly isolated rabbit aortic endothelial cells.Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PMCA4b is the predominant isoform in vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (21Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Role of alternative splicing in generating isoform diversity among plasma membrane calcium pumps.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). PMCA activity is regulated by its interactions with many other proteins. Calmodulin (CaM) tightly regulates the pump's activity through high affinity interaction with the PMCAs (22Jarrett H.W. Penniston J.T. Partial purification of the Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase activator from human erythrocytes: its similarity to the activator of 3′:5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A significant number of other proteins interact with PMCA via its PDZ-binding domain in the C terminus, including members of the MAGUKs, such as PSD-95/SAP90, SAP97/hDlg, SAP102, and PSD-93/chapsyn-110, and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (24Schuh K.

Interaction with PSD-95 facilitates plasma membrane targeting and function of PMCA4b (27Enyedi A. Strehler E.E.

It is completely unknown whether GPER/GPR30 affects cellular Ca2+ homeostasis via modulation of PMCA activity. We have begun to test the idea that significant cross-talk exists between GPER/GPR30 signaling and Ca2+ signaling via interactions between this receptor and components of the Ca2+ signaling machinery. In this study, we describe physical interactions and mutual functional influences between GPER/GPR30 and PMCA4b in the vascular endothelium. Multiple experimental paradigms performed under basal conditions, receptor agonism, and gene silencing in primary porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) or with overexpression of wild type and modified versions of GPER/GPR30 and PMCA4b in HEK 293 cells demonstrated the following: 1) GPER/GPR30 activation inhibits PMCA activity by promoting tyrosine phosphorylation of the pump; 2) GPER/GPR30 and PMCA4b constitutively and physically interact; 3) this interaction inhibits PMCA activity independently of phosphorylation but promotes GPER/GPR30 activity; and 4) interaction occurs via their C-terminal PDZ-binding domains and their association with PSD-95. The implications of these results on Ca2+-dependent activities and GPER/GPR30 signaling are discussed. PAECs were obtained as described previously (29Watanabe H. Takahashi R. Tran Q.K. Takeuchi K. Kosuge K. Satoh H. Uehara A. Terada H. Hayashi H. Ohno R. Ohashi K. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in endothelial cells by calmodulin antagonists.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intima of freshly isolated porcine thoracic aortas was gently scraped and resuspended in M-199 medium (Caisson Laboratories, Logan, UT) containing 10% newborn calf serum (Fisher) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were subsequently obtained from the same vessels as described previously (30Tran Q.K. Vermeer M. Biosensor-based approach identifies four distinct calmodulin-binding domains in the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1.PloS one. 2014; 9: e89669Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM containing 5–10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2 humidified air. The medium was frequently renewed. Total mRNA was obtained from primary PAECs, VSMCs, HEK 293 cells, and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ATCC) using Promega's ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega). cDNAs of human PMCA4b and GPER/GPR30 were then reverse-transcribed from HEK 293 cells' mRNA. A BamHI and an XbaI restriction site was introduced into the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively, of human PMCA4b and GPER/GPR30 by PCR amplification. These sequences were then incorporated in a pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector. C-terminal fusions PMCA4b-DsRed2 and GPER/GPR30-DsRed2 were then constructed by inserting DsRed2 (Clontech) via a linker (IDYDVLDYAGS) to the C-terminal end of PMCA4b and GPER/GPR30. The GPER/GPR30-ECFP fusion was constructed by replacing the EYFP moiety and the CaM-binding linker sequence of a previously published GPER/GPR30 biosensor (BSGPER(330–351)) (30Tran Q.K. Vermeer M. Biosensor-based approach identifies four distinct calmodulin-binding domains in the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1.PloS one. 2014; 9: e89669Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with the entire GPER/GPR30 sequence. The N-terminal fusions DsRed2-GPER/GPR30 and ECFP-PMCA4b were generated by inserting DsRed2 or ECFP between the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites upstream of PMCA4b or GPER/GPR30 in the pcDNA3.1 plasmids. FLAG (MDYKDDDDK) and HA (MYPYDDVPDYA) tag sequences were PCR-generated using forward and reversed primers designed to span the entire tag length, with a KpnI and a BamHI restriction site added to the N- and C-terminal ends of the tag sequences, respectively. These FLAG and HA tags were then inserted upstream of the N terminus of GPER/GPR30 or PMCA4b, respectively, in the pcDNA3.1 vector. The FLAG-tagged GPER/GPR30 and HA-tagged PMCA4b mutants with deletions of the four C-terminal residues (SSAV for GPER/GPR30 and ETSV for PMCA4b) were subsequently generated using standard molecular biology techniques. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (University of Missouri- Columbia DNA Core Facility). Oligonucleotides and plasmids encoding various wild-type or mutant constructs were transfected into primary PAECs, HEK 293 cells using the Transit-2020 or Transit-Oligo transfection kits (Mirus Bio LLC) as per the manufacturer's instructions. GPER/GPR30 was knocked down in primary PAECs using an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the porcine GPER/GPR30 sequence. For identification of transfected cells during PMCA activity measurement, GPER/GPR30 antisense and scrambled oligonucleotides were both conjugated with TAMS, a red fluorescent marker. PSD-95 antisense and scrambled sequences were based partly on previously published data, with some adjustment to match porcine sequences (31Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Specific coupling of NMDA receptor activation to nitric oxide neurotoxicity by PSD-95 protein.Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). All oligomer nucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The antisense and scrambled oligo sequences for these targets are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Antisense and scrambled oligonucleotide sequences used for knockdown of GPER/GPR30, PMCA and PSD-95GeneAntisense oligonucleotidesScrambled oligonucleotidesGPER/GPR305′-mG*mU*mU*C*ACCACCAGGATC*A*mG*mG*mA/36-TAMSp/-3′5′–mA*mC*mC*A*GTGCTAGCACGT*C*mA*mA*mG/36-TAMSp/-3′PMCA5′-mG*mA*mG*mA*mU*G*C*T*G*TCATAGACATTTCG*T*C*C*C*mC*mA*mC*mA*mU-3′5′-mA*mC*mU*mC*mA*T*T*G*T*AGCGTAGGCCGAAT*C*T*A*C*mU*mC*mC*mU*mA-3′PSD-955′-mG*mC*mU*G*AGTGGGTCAC*C*mU*mC*mC-3′5′-mC*mC*mG*C*TCTATCAAGA*G*mU*mG*mA-3′ Open table in a new tab For experiments measuring PMCA activity in GPER/GPR30 knockdown cells, transfection was performed on PAECs plated on 60-mm dishes containing number 1.5 coverslips. Two days after transfection, the coverslips were processed for imaging to measure PMCA activity, and the remaining cells on the dishes were collected for Western blotting to verify effective knockdown of GPER/GPR30. Cells on coverslips were first loaded with fura-2/AM. Following loading, cells expressing GPER/GPR30 antisense or scrambled oligo were detected and marked using TAMS fluorescence emission at λ610 nm in response to excitation at λ570 nm. Imaging cube was then switched for measurement of PMCA activity using fura-2 fluorescence on pre-marked TAMS (+) cells. After the imaging experiments, the same coverslips were washed and fixed with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by incubation overnight with a rabbit anti-GPR30 antibody (N-15, SC-48525, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The coverslips were then incubated with anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Following washing, GPER/GPR30's levels of detection were verified by FITC emission intensity at λ525 nm, with excitation at λ490 nm. In addition, remaining cells from the plates were lysed for immunoblotting for GPER/GPR30. Following electrophoresis, the membrane was cut between the levels of vinculin (130 kDa) and GPER/GPR30 (38 kDa), and the fragments were simultaneously probed, respectively, for vinculin and GPER/GPR30. Following development, the lower fragment (initially probed for GPER/GPR30) was stripped and reprobed for β-actin. Densitometric values of vinculin and β-actin were averaged and used as loading control for those from GPER/GPR30 bands. This combined approach guaranteed that PMCA activity was performed on control or GPER/GPR30-knocked down cells. Knockdown of PMCA was verified by Western blotting using anti-PMCA clone 5F10 mouse antibody (Thermo Scientific, MA3–914) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-20028). Knockdown of PSD-95 was confirmed by Western blotting (Cell Signaling Rb-PSD95 catalog no. D27E11). Rabbit IgG nonimmune isotype antibody was purchased from GeneTex (GTX35035). Mouse nonimmune IgG isotype control antibody was from Cell Signaling (5415S). Primary PAECs were plated on number 1.5 glass coverslips (Fisher) and grown in phenol red-free medium until subconfluence with or without treatments prior to experiment. Cells were incubated with 4 μm fura-2/AM (Invitrogen) in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The dye was then removed, and cells were equilibrated in Ca2+-containing modified Tyrode's buffer (composition in mm: 150 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. Excitation of fura-2 alternated between λ340 nm and λ380 nm for 50 ms each per 500-ms cycle from an ultra-high speed wavelength switcher (Lambda DG-4, Sutters Instruments). The excitation switching lapse between the two wavelengths was 1 ms. Emission light was collected at λ510 nm through an ultra-rapid filter wheel (Lambda-10B, Sutters Instruments) and processed by an electron-multiplying charge-coupled digital camera (DU-885, Andor Technology). Pairs of images were analyzed using the Imaging Workbench 6.0 software (INDEC Biosystems). The ratio of emission fluorescence intensities collected following the excitation at λ340 nm and λ380 nm was used as a measure of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. For some experimental paradigms, free intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using Equation 1,Ca2+(nm)=kd×SfSb×R−RminRmax−R(Eq.1)Eq. 1 where the Kd value is 224 nm for fura-2; R is the observed ratio fluorescent signal during the experiment. Sf and Sb represent the emission intensities collected at λ510 nm corresponding to the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound states of fura-2. We avoided potential errors associated with using fixed values for Rmin and Rmax by determining these values in individual cells in each experiment. We first determined the average relationship between Rmin, Rmax, and the basal Rbasal value, namely the R value obtained in Ca2+-free medium from unstimulated cells. Following dye loading, Rbasal values were obtained. The same cells were then incubated on stage with 20 μm BAPTA/AM (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) for 30 min to obtain Rmin values. Rmax values from the same cells were next obtained by adding 5 μm ionomycin and 10 mm CaCl2. Comparing the average (n = 100) absolute Rmin values with the observed fura-2 ratios in the same cells in Ca2+-free medium prior to addition of BAPTA/AM (Rbasal) and the average Rmax value, Equation 2 was obtained.Rmin=Rbasal−0.06×(Rmax−Rbasal)(Eq.2)Eq. 2 Similarly, Equation 3 was obtained between Sf and Sbasal, which is the fluorescence emission intensity at λ510 nm at the beginning of the experiment with cells in Ca2+-free medium in response to excitation at λ380 nm.Sf=Sbasal+0.85×(Sbasal−Sb)(Eq.3)Eq. 3 No statistical differences (n = 100 cells from five separate pilot experiments) were observed between the measured Rmin and Sf values versus the calculated Rmin and Sf values using Equations 2 and 3. Because Rbasal and Sbasal values were readily measured at the beginning of every experiment, and corresponding Rmax and Sb values were also easily obtained by the end of each imaging time course by adding high concentrations of ionomycin and Ca2+, free Ca2+ concentrations in individual cells could be calculated from Eq. 1, Eq. 2, Eq. 3 with relatively high reliability. Cells were prepared as described above in the Ca2+ imaging section. Thapsigargin (1 μm) was added to nominally Ca2+-free buffer to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum of Ca2+.

https://openalex.org/W2057056528,"Interleukin 31 receptor α (IL-31RA) is a novel Type I cytokine receptor that pairs with oncostatin M receptor to mediate IL-31 signaling. Binding of IL-31 to its receptor results in the phosphorylation and activation of STATs, MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways. IL-31 plays a pathogenic role in tissue inflammation, particularly in allergic diseases. Recent studies demonstrate IL-31RA expression and signaling in non-hematopoietic cells, but this receptor is poorly studied in immune cells. Macrophages are key immune-effector cells that play a critical role in Th2-cytokine-mediated allergic diseases. Here, we demonstrate that Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are capable of up-regulating IL-31RA expression on both peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice. Our data also demonstrate that IL-4Rα-driven IL-31RA expression is STAT6 dependent in macrophages. Notably, the inflammation-associated genes Fizz1 and serum amyloid A (SAA) are significantly up-regulated in M2 macrophages stimulated with IL-31, but not in IL-4 receptor-deficient macrophages. Furthermore, the absence of Type II IL-4 receptor signaling is sufficient to attenuate the expression of IL-31RA in vivo during allergic asthma induced by soluble egg antigen, which may suggest a role for IL-31 signaling in Th2 cytokine-driven inflammation and allergic responses. Our study reveals an important counter-regulatory role between Th2 cytokine and IL-31 signaling involved in allergic diseases. Background: IL-31RA is a novel Type I cytokine receptor that pairs with oncostatin M receptor to mediate IL-31 signaling. Results: Th2 cytokines up-regulate IL-31RA signaling in macrophages. Conclusion: We demonstrate that the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 were capable of up-regulating IL-31RA expression on macrophages. Significance: This newly identified counter-regulatory role between Th2 cytokine and the IL-31 signaling cascade may provide valuable insights into the pathobiology of allergic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2169857199,"There is unequivocal evidence that alpha-synuclein plays a pivotal pathophysiological role in neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular in synucleinopathies. These disorders present with a variable extent of cognitive impairment and alpha-synuclein is being explored as a biomarker in CSF, blood serum and plasma. Considering key events of aging that include proteostasis, alpha-synuclein may not only be useful as a marker for differential diagnosis but also for aging per se. To explore this hypothesis, we developed a highly specific ELISA to measure alpha-synuclein. In healthy males plasma alpha-synuclein levels correlated strongly with age, revealing much lower concentrations in older (avg. 58.1 years) compared to younger (avg. 27.6 years) individuals. This difference between the age groups was enhanced after acidification of the plasmas (p<0.0001), possibly reflecting a decrease of alpha-synuclein-antibody complexes or chaperone activity in older individuals. Our results support the concept that alpha-synuclein homeostasis may be impaired early on, possibly due to disturbance of the proteostasis network, a key component of healthy aging. Thus, alpha-synuclein may be a novel biomarker of aging, a factor that should be considered when analyzing its presence in biological specimens."

The aim of this study was to examine whether Saa1 aggravates T cell-mediated hepatitis by inducing chemokines in a liver-specific, Saa1-overexpressing, transgenic (TG) mouse model. We generated TG mice in which Saa1 was overexpressed specifically in liver tissue. The chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), MIP1α, MIP1β, interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and eotaxin were induced in Saa1 TG mice. After concanavalin A treatment, Saa1 expression was higher in Saa1 TG mice than in WT mice. More severe liver injury, increased hepatocyte apoptosis, and higher levels of hepatic enzymes were observed in Saa1 TG mice than in WT mice. Liver infiltration of CD4+ T cells and macrophages increased after inducing hepatitis. Activation of T cells was higher in Saa1 TG mice than in WT mice, and the populations of Th17 cells and regulatory T cells were altered by overexpressing Saa1 in TG mice. Secretion of various cytokines, such as interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 6, increased in Saa1 TG mice.

Therefore, Saa1 might be a novel inflammatory factor that acts as a chemokine modulator in hepatitis. Hepatitis can be caused by various factors, including drugs, alcohol, chemicals, viruses, genetic factors, and the immune response. The disease represents a major public health problem. In most cases, including autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis is caused by activated T cells that infiltrate and destroy the liver parenchyma, leading to liver injury (1Eggink H.F. Houthoff H.J. Huitema S. Gips C.H. Poppema S.

Concanavalin A (ConA) 3The abbreviations used are:ConAconcanavalin ASAAserum amyloid ATGtransgenicALTalanine aminotransferaseASTaspartate aminotransferaseTreg cellregulatory T cellTLRToll-like receptor. is a lectin originally purified from Canavalia brasiliensis. It has specific sugar binding sites that can bind to α-d-mannoside, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside, α-d-glucose, and methyl-α-d-glucose (2Kanellopoulos P.N. Pavlou K. Perrakis A. Agianian B. Vorgias C.E.

Biol. 1996; 116: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ConA-induced hepatitis is a well known mouse model of T cell-mediated hepatitis. After intravenous injection, ConA binds to mannose receptors on the surface of sinusoidal endothelial cells, leading to breakdown of the sinusoidal endothelial cell membrane, bleb formation, and disappearance of the cytoplasm (3Knolle P.A.

ConA induces systemic immune activation and acute liver damage. CD4+ T helper cells detect MHC class II and T cell receptors on Kupffer cells modified by ConA, resulting in their activation (4Tsui T.Y. Obed A. Siu Y.T. Yet S.F. Prantl L. Schlitt H.J. Fan S.T.

These activated T cells play an important role in ConA-induced hepatitis. Differentiated T cells infiltrate the damaged liver tissue and secrete various cytokines, such as interferon IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase response protein. Three SAA isoforms have been reported in mice. Saa1 and Saa2 isoforms are mainly expressed by hepatocytes, whereas the Saa3 isoform has been found to be induced in various tissues during inflammation (5Ray A. Schatten H. Ray B.K.

Under acute inflammatory conditions, such as infection, tissue damage, inflammation, and cancer, Saa1 and Saa2 are similarly induced, and serum SAA levels increase as much as 1000-fold (6Meek R.L. Benditt E.P. Amyloid A gene family expression in different mouse tissues.J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 2006-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Induction of the genes encoding SAA1 and SAA2 during inflammation is triggered by elevated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, into the circulation and in hepatic cells (7Ito A. Takii T. Matsumura T. Onozaki K. Augmentation of type I IL-1 receptor expression and IL-1 signaling by IL-6 and glucocorticoid in murine hepatocytes.J.

SAA functions as a proinflammatory mediator at the site of inflammation by inducing chemotaxis in neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, promoting leukocyte infiltration and neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells (9Xu L.

Chemokines are small proteins with chemotactic properties. Almost 50 chemokines have been identified (15Bromley S.K. Mempel T.R. Luster A.D. Orchestrating the orchestrators: chemokines in control of T cell traffic.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These proteins provide migratory signals to immune cells (16Weber S.N. Wasmuth H.E. Liver fibrosis: from animal models to mapping of human risk variants.Best Pract. Res. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2010; 24: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chemokine expression is up-regulated in areas of tissue injury, and their increased expression leads to infiltration of immune cells such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. Chemokines and chemokine receptors play critical roles in liver diseases such as hepatitis (17Simpson K.J. Henderson N.C. Bone-Larson C.L. Lukacs N.W. Hogaboam C.M. Kunkel S.L.

Chemokines are secreted from immune cells and primary cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells (20Saiman Y. Friedman S.L. The role of chemokines in acute liver injury.Front. Physiol. 2012; 3: 213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We investigated the relationship between Saa1 and ConA-induced hepatitis using Saa1-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice. Induction of chemokines by Saa1 increased hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, liver injury, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and T cell activation. Therefore, Saa1 might be a novel proinflammatory chemokine modulator in hepatitis. The full-length open reading frame of mouse Saa1, containing SalI and NotI sites at either end, was cloned into the pCl-neo vector under the control of the albumin promoter and enhancer. The expression cassette, which was subcloned into the vector by digestion with restriction enzymes and subsequent ligation, was used to produce transgenic mice following the methods described previously in detail by Hogan et al. (21Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantin F. Lacy E. Manipulating the mouse embryo.1994Google Scholar). The offspring produced by mating these transgenic founder mice were genotyped by PCR analysis using DNA extracted from tail lysates as the template. Animals were raised and maintained under conventional conditions in a room with a 12-h light/dark cycle, a controlled temperature of 25 °C, and 50% humidity. Animals were given free access to food and water. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal experimentation and with permission from the Animal Use and Care Committee of Kyungpook National University. For ConA-induced hepatitis, age-matched, 7- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice and Saa1-overexpressing TG mice were injected intravenously with 10 mg/kg ConA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Control mice were injected with the same volume of PBS. For inhibition of TLR2 in vivo, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3 mg/kg CU-CPT22, a TLR2 inhibitor (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) (22Cheng K. Wang X. Zhang S. Yin H. Discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of the TLR1/TLR2 complex.Angew. Chem. 2012; 51: 12246-12249Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At 0, 6, and 24 h after ConA injection, blood was collected from the eye. Serum was harvested after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The concentrations of ALT and AST in serum were measured using a Hitachi 704 autoanalyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Mice were sacrificed after 24 h of ConA treatment. Livers were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution for 2 days and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5-μm-thick) were stained with H&E or TUNEL staining using an in situ cell apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). For semiquantitative analysis, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was counted in three randomly selected fields of view in a non-necrotic area at a magnification of ×100 and ×200. The average number of cells counted in each group was presented. Twenty-four hours after ConA injection, Saa1 protein levels were measured in liver and spleen extracts. Livers and spleens were isolated from mice after sacrifice and immediately placed in PRO-PREP protein extraction solution (iNtRON, Seoul, Korea). The samples were homogenized on ice by using a homogenizer and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing 50 μg of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with goat-anti mouse Saa1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), IκBα, and phosphorylated IκBα (Ser-32/36) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and mouse monoclonal β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Single cell suspensions were prepared from the livers and spleens, from which blood was eliminated by perfusion of the heart with saline solution, and then treated with red blood cell lysis solution (0.15 m NH4Cl and 0.1 mm Na2EDTA) for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate erythrocytes. To isolate mononuclear cells, single cell suspensions were mixed with Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich), and the mixtures were centrifuged. CD4+ T cells were positively isolated to more than 95% purity by using anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody-coupled magnetic cell sorting microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, San Diego, CA). Cells were stained with fluoro-conjugated anti-mouse CD4, CD69, CD25, IL-17, FoxP3, and CXCR5 antibodies and then analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). At 0, 6, and 24 h after ConA injection, cytokine levels were measured in the serum, which was collected as described above for the assessment of hepatotoxicity. ELISA kits (R&D Systems) for mouse TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10 were used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a StepOnePlus PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNA was isolated from the liver, lung, kidney, intestine, white adipose tissue, and ankle. Tissue was harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground into a fine power. TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 60 °C for 1 h by using TOPscriptTM RT DryMIX (Enzynomics, Seoul, Korea). The β-actin gene was used as an internal control for quantification. mRNA levels were expressed as the -fold change in expression relative to expression in untreated control mice. The results were expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The significance of the differences between groups was calculated using two-tailed Student's t test. Differences with a p value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In a previous study, a proinflammatory stimulus was found to induce Saa1 expression in the liver (6Meek R.L. Benditt E.P. Amyloid A gene family expression in different mouse tissues.J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 2006-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, we created TG mice using an albumin promoter and enhancer to drive liver tissue-specific overexpression of Saa1 (Fig. 1A). We screened TG mice using genomic polymerase chain reaction with one primer pair (albumin-F and Saa1-R) (Fig. 1B). Livers from 6-week-old WT and TG mice were isolated to determine Saa1 protein expression by Western blot analysis. Saa1 expression was higher in the livers of TG mice than in any other tissue (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate the successful generation of TG mice with liver-specific overexpression of Saa1. We selected mice with the highest Saa1 expression and used them for all experiments. Saa1 has a critical role in inflammation-related cells such as macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils (9Xu L. Badolato R. Murphy W.J. Longo D.L. Anver M. Hale S. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. A novel biologic function of serum amyloid A: induction of T lymphocyte migration and adhesion.J.

Effect of serum amyloid A1 treatment on global gene expression in THP-1-derived macrophages.Inflamm. Res. 2012; 61: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, no in vivo evidence exists to support the role of Saa1 as a chemokine inducer in the liver. Therefore, we assessed the expression of various chemokines to determine the role of Saa1 in chemokine induction. The mRNA expression of MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP1β, IP-10, and eotaxin was higher in the livers of Saa1 TG mice than in those of WT mice (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that Saa1 overexpression induces hepatic chemokine expression. Two studies have reported that the levels of SAA were increased in hepatitis (23Lannergård A. Larsson A.

To determine whether Saa1 expression was altered in ConA-induced hepatitis, we induced hepatitis by injecting ConA into WT and TG mice. After 24 h, the liver was harvested, and Saa1 expression was determined. The increase in Saa1 expression was greater in TG mice than in WT mice (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that ConA-induced hepatitis increases Saa1 expression in the liver of WT mice and induces a greater increase in Saa1 expression in TG mice. We examined the area of liver injury with H&E) staining 24 h after ConA injection. The necrotic area was larger in liver sections from ConA-treated Saa1 Tg mice than in those from ConA-treated WT mice. Infiltration of mononuclear cells was greater in the livers of Saa1 TG mice than in the livers of WT mice (Fig. 2B). We performed a TUNEL assay to detect apoptotic cells in the liver. Apoptosis of hepatocytes was increased in both necrotic and non-necrotic areas of the liver sections obtained from TG mice. The increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in non-necrotic areas indicated a higher rate of apoptosis in TG mice than in WT mice (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that increased Saa1 expression induced extensive liver injury and promoted apoptosis in ConA-induced hepatitis. ALT and AST were detected a little in the liver under normal conditions. However, both of these markers were expressed in injured liver following ConA injection. We measured serum AST and ALT to evaluate liver injury 0, 6, and 24 h after ConA injection. The levels of AST and ALT were higher in Saa1 TG mice than in WT mice (Fig. 3A). Because cytokines orchestrate hepatitis (25Tilg H. Kaser A. Moschen A.R. How to modulate inflammatory cytokines in liver diseases.Liver Int. 2006; 26: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), their serum levels in WT and TG mice were examined by ELISA 0, 6, and 24 h after ConA injection. At 6 h after ConA injection, the increase in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6, was greater in Saa1 TG mice than in WT mice. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 tended to be increased following ConA injection in both WT and TG mice. However, the differences were not significant (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that increased Saa1 expression induces liver enzyme expression and contributes to the increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines during hepatitis. Because chemokine expression was induced in Saa1 TG mice (Fig. 1D), we performed a FACS analysis to determine the role of chemokines during immune cell infiltration in the liver. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the liver after heart perfusion with saline solution. Infiltration of CD4+ T cells and F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages was greater in the livers of Saa1 TG mice than in those of WT mice (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the induction of chemokines by Saa1 affects the infiltration of immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages, into the liver. T cell activation was assessed by flow cytometry by using antibodies against CD25 and CD69, which are markers of activated T cells. After ConA injection, the number of CD69+ or CD25+ among CD4+ T cells in the liver was higher in Saa1 TG mice than in WT mice (Fig. 5, A and B). We performed a FACS analysis to detect IL-17 and FoxP3, markers of Th17 and Treg cells, respectively, which contribute to T cell activation. The number of IL-17+ CD4+CD25+ cells was higher in the liver and spleen of Saa1 TG mice than in those of WT mice, but the number of FoxP3+CD4+CD25+ cells was lower in Saa1 TG mice (Fig. 5, C and D). These results indicate that overexpression of Saa1 increases T cell activation by regulating the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells, consistent with the promotion of inflammation in the liver. An interaction between TLR2 and Saa1 has been reported (26Cheng N. He R. Tian J. Ye P.P. Ye R.D. Cutting edge: TLR2 is a functional receptor for acute-phase serum amyloid A.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We used a TLR2 antagonist in Saa1 TG mice to determine whether the induction of chemokines by Saa1 in hepatocytes involved TLR2. 16 h after injection of the TLR2 antagonist, MIP1α and eotaxin mRNA levels were decreased in TLR2 antagonist-treated Saa1 TG mice (Fig. 6A). The NFκB pathway, which is downstream of TLR2 signaling, is activated by the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα. 2 h after the injection of a TLR2 antagonist, the phosphorylation of IκBα was decreased in TLR2 antagonist-treated Saa1 TG mice (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that the induction of chemokines by Saa1 is mediated by the TLR2-dependent NFκB pathway. The ConA injection method to induce T cell-mediated hepatitis is a well known mouse disease model. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Saa1 contributes to the progression of T cell-mediated hepatitis. Our results demonstrate that, following ConA injection, Saa1 TG mice had larger areas of liver injury and higher levels of ALT and AST, which are indicators of liver injury, compared with the same measurements made in WT mice. In addition, Saa1 overexpression increased the infiltration of T cells and macrophages, promoted T cell activation, modulated the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, and induced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6. Therefore, we suggest that Saa1 has a possible role in aggravating T cell-mediated hepatitis. A recent study found that virus-infected patients had increased serum SAA levels (23Lannergård A. Larsson A. Kragsbjerg P. Friman G. Correlations between serum amyloid A protein and C-reactive protein in infectious diseases.Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 2003; 63: 267-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case study of a woman with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, an existing liver nodule was diagnosed as SAA-positive by immunohistochemistry (27Kim S.R. Kondo F. Otono Y. Imoto S. Ando K. Hirakawa M.

Serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein positive nodule in alcoholic liver cirrhosis, hard to make definite diagnosis.Hepatol. Res. 2014; 44: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that hepatitis might lead to increased SAA expression and that SAA can exacerbate hepatitis. However, other studies have reported that SAA has antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus infection in cultured cells, which it exerts by binding hepatitis C virions and specifically blocking hepatitis C virus entry (28Cai Z. Cai L. Jiang J. Chang K.S. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Luo G. Human serum amyloid A protein inhibits hepatitis C virus entry into cells.J.

Therefore, further study is needed to determine the correlation between SAA1 expression and various forms of hepatitis, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis, and to establish the role of Saa1 in hepatitis.

Our results also show that Saa1 overexpression induced MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, eotaxin, and IP-10 mRNA expression in the livers of TG mice. MIP-1α acts as a proinflammatory factor in T cell-mediated hepatitis by recruiting CD4+ T cells (19Ajuebor M.N. Hogaboam C.M. Le T. Proudfoot A.E. Swain M.G.

Further studies are needed to examine the relationship between chemokine receptors and chemokine induction by SAA1. Here we showed that overexpression of Saa1 exacerbated liver injury by increasing T cell activation. The numbers of CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD69+ T cells, which express markers of T cell activation, were increased in Saa1 TG mice compared with those observed in WT mice. The number of IL-17+ cells was increased in the population of activated T cells. However, the number of FoxP3+ cells was decreased. The balance between Th17 and Treg cells mediates T cell activation (35Hanidziar D. Koulmanda M. Inflammation and the balance of Treg and Th17 cells in transplant rejection and tolerance.Curr. Opin. Organ Transplant. 2010; 15: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Su Z.J. Yu X.P. Guo R.Y. Ming D.S. Huang L.Y. Su M.L. Deng Y. Lin Z.Z. Changes in the balance between Treg and Th17 cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B.Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2013; 76: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and this mechanism plays an important role in modulating T cell activation in hepatitis. The shift in the Th17/Treg balance could contribute to the T cell activation observed in Saa1 TG mice. Regulation of T cell activation by chemokines via CC chemokine receptors on the T cell surface could also contribute to increased T cell activation (37Luther S.A. Cyster J.G. Chemokines as regulators of T cell differentiation.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Following ConA injection, Saa1 was found to be expressed not only in the liver but also in the spleen. Therefore, Saa1 could have a role in regulating inflammation in both of these tissues. Hence, we suggest that the overexpression of Saa1 might regulate T cell activation by altering chemokine expression or the balance between Th17 and Treg cells. TLRs play a major role in the innate immune system. They are expressed on immune and non-immune cells. TLR2 has a critical role in mouse hepatitis (38Zhou M. Zhu X. Ye S. Zhou B. Blocking TLR2 in vivo attenuates experimental hepatitis induced by concanavalin A in mice.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2014; 21: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that TLR2-dependent chemokine secretion is regulated by Saa1 and that the role of Saa1 in T cell-mediated hepatitis is TLR2-dependent. Further study of the interaction between SAA1 and TLR2 is needed to clarify the role of cross-talk between immune and non-immune cells. Our in vivo data show that treatment with a TLR2 antagonist decreased the induction of chemokines but did not return chemokine expression to the basal level. Previous studies have shown that Saa1 binds to TLR4, CD36, and FPRL1 (39Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Kurlander R. Chen Z. Kimelman M.L. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Thomas F. Eggerman T.L.

Med. 2009; 41: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of Saa1 overexpression in mice might be mediated by the binding of Saa1 not only to TLR2 but also to other receptors, such as TLR4, CD36, and FPRL1. In this study, Saa1 was expressed in the livers and spleens of WT mice with ConA-induced hepatitis. The substantial induction of Saa1 during hepatitis was similar to that described in a previous study (5Ray A. Schatten H. Ray B.K. Activation of Sp1 and its functional co-operation with serum amyloid A-activating sequence binding factor in synoviocyte cells trigger synergistic action of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 in serum amyloid A gene expression.J.

We generated Saa1-overexpressing TG mice in which Saa1 was expressed specifically in the liver, as shown in Fig. 1. Our Saa1 TG mouse model may be useful for studying the role of Saa1 in many diseases. For the first time, we determined that Saa1 plays a critical role in ConA-induced hepatitis by inducing chemokines and regulating T cell activation in a TLR2-dependent manner. TG mice with liver-specific overexpression of Saa1 may be a useful animal model to study metabolic diseases and other inflammatory diseases. In the future, Saa1 might be a therapeutic target for hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2045007109,"Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, the causal agent of tan spot disease of wheat, mediates disease by the production of host-selective toxins (HST). The known toxins are recognized in an ‘inverse’ gene-for-gene manner, where each is perceived by the product of a unique locus in the host and recognition leads to disease susceptibility. Given the importance of HSTs in disease development, we would predict that the loss of any of these major pathogenicity factors would result in reduced virulence and disease development. However, after either deletion of the gene encoding the HST ToxA or, reciprocally, heterologous expression of ToxA in a race that does not normally produce the toxin followed by inoculation of ToxA-sensitive and insensitive wheat cultivars, we demonstrate that ToxA symptom development can be epistatic to other HST-induced symptoms. ToxA epistasis on certain ToxA-sensitive wheat cultivars leads to genotype-specific increases in total leaf area affected by disease. These data indicate a complex interplay between host responses to HSTs in some genotypes and underscore the challenge of identifying additional HSTs whose activity may be masked by other toxins. Also, through mycelial staining, we acquire preliminary evidence that ToxA may provide additional benefits to fungal growth in planta in the absence of its cognate recognition partner in the host."
https://openalex.org/W2009053358,"Abstract Male germ cell differentiation is a subtle and complex regulatory process. Currently, its regulatory mechanism is still not fully understood. In our experiment, we performed the first comprehensive genome and transcriptome-wide analyses of the crucial genes and signaling pathways in three kinds of crucial cells (embryonic stem cells, primordial germ cell, and spermatogonial stem cells) that are associated with the male germ cell differentiation. We identified thousands of differentially expressed genes in this process, and from these we chose 173 candidate genes, of which 98 genes were involved in cell differentiation, 19 were involved in the metabolic process, and 56 were involved in the differentiation and metabolic processes, like GAL9, AMH, PLK1, and PSMD7 and so on. In addition, we found that 18 key signaling pathways were involved mainly in cell proliferation, differentiation, and signal transduction processes like TGF-β, Notch, and Jak-STAT. Further exploration found that the candidate gene expression patterns were the same between in vitro induction experiments and transcriptome results. Our results yield clues to the mechanistic basis of male germ cell differentiation and provide an important reference for further studies."

https://openalex.org/W2067859468,"Background Some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), located in Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, were reported to be associated with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections. The study was aimed to assess the correlation of SNPs at TLR4 and TLR9 genes with the occurrence of congenital cytomegaly, based on available samples. Methods Reported case-control study included both HCMV infected and non-infected fetuses and newborns. The specimens were classified to the molecular analyses, based on serological features of the recent infection and HCMV DNAemia in body fluids. TLR SNPs were studied, using multiplex nested PCR-RFLP assay, and determined genotypes were confirmed by sequencing. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed for the identified genotypes. The linkage disequilibrium was also estimated for TLR4 SNPs. A relationship between the status of TLR genotypes and congenital cytomegaly development was estimated, using a logistic regression model. Results Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was observed for almost all SNPs, both infected and non-infected patients, with exception of TLR4 896 A>G polymorphism in the control group (P≤0.050). TLR4 896 A>G and 1196 C>T SNPs were found in linkage disequilibrium in both study groups (P≤0.050). The CC genotype at TLR4 1196 SNP and the GA variant at TLR9 2848 G>A SNP were significantly associated with HCMV infection (P≤0.050). The risk of congenital cytomegaly was higher in heterozygotes at TLR9 SNP than in the carriers of other genotypic variants at the reported locus (OR 4.81; P≤0.050). The GC haplotype at TLR4 SNPs and GCA variants at TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs were significantly associated with HCMV infection (P≤0.0001). The ACA variants were more frequent among fetuses and neonates with symptomatic, rather than asymptomatic cytomegaly (P≤0.0001). Conclusions TLR4 and TLR9 polymorphisms may contribute to the development of congenital infection with HCMV in fetuses and neonates. The TLR9 2848 GA heterozygotic status possibly predisposes to HCMV infection, increasing the risk of congenital cytomegaly development."
https://openalex.org/W2128377994,"Fan aggression in football (soccer) is a societal problem that affects many countries worldwide. However, to date, most studies use an epidemiological or survey approach to explain football fan aggression. This study used a controlled laboratory study to advance a model of predictors for fan aggression. To do so, football fans (n = 74) saw a match summary in which their favorite team lost against their most important rival. Next, we measured levels of aggression with the hot sauce paradigm, in which fans were given the opportunity to administer a sample of hot sauce that a rival football supporter had to consume. To investigate if media exposure had the ability to reduce aggression, before the match fans saw a video in which fans of the rival team commented in a neutral, negative, or positive manner on their favorite team. Results showed that the media exposure did not affect aggression. However, participants displayed high levels of aggression and anger after having watched the match. Also, aggression was higher in fans with lower basal cortisol levels, which suggests that part of the aggression displayed was proactive and related to anti-social behavior. Furthermore, aggression was higher when the referee was blamed and aggression was lower when the performance of the participants’ favorite team was blamed for the match result. These results indicate that aggression increased when the match result was perceived as unfair. Interventions that aim to reduce football fan aggression should give special attention to the perceived fairness of the match result."
https://openalex.org/W2030282443,Results of previous work suggest a preference of adult observers for cute compared to less cute infants. In Study 1 we investigated whether the preference for cute infants depends on the ethnicity and species of the infant. We simultaneously presented two faces (one cute and one less cute) and asked Caucasian participants to choose the infant to whom they would rather give a toy (Task 1) and which infant they would rather adopt (Task 2). The infants were Caucasian or African human babies or dog puppies. For all face categories and in both tasks we found a strong preference for cute infants. A possible reason for preferring cute infants may be that cute infants look healthier than less cute infants. To investigate whether cuteness is associated with the assessment of health we conducted Study 2. Faces of Caucasian and African infants and dog puppies were rated for cuteness and health. The findings revealed a significant relationship between health and cuteness evaluation across all stimuli. We suggest that one reason why cute infants are preferred might be because they are perceived as being healthier.

https://openalex.org/W1967348076,"Background Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) over-expression disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the ischemic brain. The retinoid X receptor agonist bexarotene suppresses MMP-9 expression in endothelial cells and displays neuroprotective effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that bexarotene may have a beneficial effect on I/R-induced BBB dysfunction. Methods A total of 180 rats were randomized into three groups (n = 60 each): (i) a sham-operation group, (ii) a cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) group, and (iii) an I/R+bexarotene group. Brain water content was measured by the dry wet weight method. BBB permeability was analyzed by Evans Blue staining and the magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent Omniscan. MMP-9 mRNA expression, protein expression, and activity were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and gelatin zymography, respectively. Apolipoprotein E (apoE), claudin-5, and occludin expression were analyzed by Western blotting. Results After 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-I/R, several effects were observed with bexarotene administration: (i) brain water content and BBB permeability were significantly reduced; (ii) MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression as well as activity were significantly decreased; (iii) claudin-5 and occludin expression were significantly increased; and (iv) apoE expression was significantly increased. Conclusions Bexarotene decreases BBB permeability in rats with cerebral I/R injury. This effect may be due in part to bexarotene’s upregulation of apoE expression, which has been previously shown to reduce BBB permeability through suppressing MMP-9-mediated degradation of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. This work offers insight to aid future development of therapeutic agents for cerebral I/R injury in human patients."

Erythroid and myeloid progenitors are generated from a special subset of endothelial cells scattered within blood vessels called hemogenic endothelium (HE) (2Bertrand J.Y. Chi N.C. Santoso B. Teng S.

In vivo imaging of haematopoietic cells emerging from the mouse aortic endothelium.Nature. 2010; 464: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). HE undergoes endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EndHT) (4Chen M.J. Yokomizo T. Zeigler B.M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A. Runx1 is required for the endothelial to haematopoietic cell transition but not thereafter.Nature. 2009; 457: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) to generate HSCs. EndHT is predominantly regulated by RUNX1 that belongs to the Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family of proteins. The RUNX1 knock-out embryos displayed a lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis (5Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R.

Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RUNX1 can potentially modify the epigenetic status at the loci involved in hemogenic to hematopoietic transition (7Lichtinger M. Ingram R. Hannah R. Müller D. Clarke D. Assi S.A. Lie-A-Ling M. Noailles L. Vijayabaskar M.S. Wu M. Tenen D.G. Westhead D.R. Kouskoff V. Lacaud G. Göttgens B. Bonifer C. RUNX1 reshapes the epigenetic landscape at the onset of haematopoiesis.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 4318-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It can also physically interact with the histone methyltransferase to regulate hematopoiesis (8Koh C.P. Wang C.Q. Ng C.E. Ito Y. Araki M. Tergaonkar V. Huang G. Osato M. RUNX1 meets MLL: epigenetic regulation of hematopoiesis by two leukemia genes.Leukemia. 2013; 27: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of RUNX1 itself at the epigenetic level is poorly understood. Earlier, we demonstrated that HIRA-dependent histone H3.3 acetylation at lysine 56 residues could regulate the expression of endothelial specific genes (9Dutta D. Ray S. Home P. Saha B. Wang S. Sheibani N. Tawfik O. Cheng N. Paul S. Regulation of angiogenesis by histone chaperone HIRA-mediated incorporation of lysine 56-acetylated histone H3.3 at chromatin domains of endothelial genes.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41567-41577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Functionally, HIRA acts to incorporate histone variant H3.3 into chromatin in a DNA replication-independent manner (10Green E.M. Antczak A.J. Bailey A.O. Franco A.A. Wu K.J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Kaufman P.D. Replication-independent histone deposition by the HIR complex and Asf1.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2044-2049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The importance of HIRA during mammalian development is evident from the targeted mutagenesis study in mouse (11Roberts C. Sutherland H.F. Farmer H. Kimber W. Halford S. Carey A. Brickman J.M.

HIRA null mice die between E10 and E11 and display a wide range of phenotypes secondary to defective mesendodermal development (11Roberts C. Sutherland H.F. Farmer H. Kimber W. Halford S. Carey A.

E9.5 C57BL/6J mouse embryos were isolated along with the yolk sac. Yolk sacs were cleaned from the debris, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and treated as described for the immunofluorescence study.

For experiments, the cells were cultured in feeder-free conditions in ES medium composed of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen; 12440053), 15% ES qualified serum (Invitrogen; 10439024), 1% antimycotic/antibiotic (Invitrogen; 15240062), 0.0124% 1-thioglycerol (Sigma; M6145), and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen; 10378016). We maintained them in undifferentiated condition by addition of 105 units of LIF/ml (Millipore; ESG1106) (13Dutta D. Ray S. Home P. Larson M. Wolfe M.W. Paul S. Self-renewal versus lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells: protein kinase C signaling shifts the balance.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 3 × 105 control and Hira−/− ES cells were grown in ES medium for 2 days in feeder-free conditions before differentiation. To generate EBs, ES cells were grown in the absence of LIF in ES differentiation medium of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 15% FCS selected for endothelial cell differentiation (Stem Cell Technologies; 06907), 1% ascorbic acid (5 mg/ml in 100 ml; Stem Cell Technologies; 07157), and 0.0124% 1-thioglycerol for 5 days (13Dutta D.

For the differentiation of HE from undifferentiated ES cells, we followed the protocol described by Chiang and Wong (14Chiang P.M. Wong P.C. Differentiation of an embryonic stem cell to hemogenic endothelium by defined factors essential role of bone morphogenetic protein 4.Development. 2011; 138: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with few modifications. Briefly, control and Hira−/− ES cells were cultured in serum- and feeder-free N2B27 medium (15Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A.

At day 2, 5 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D Systems; 314-BP-050), 4 ng/ml activin A (R&D Systems; 338-AC-010), 12.5 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D Systems; 233-FB-025), and 3 μm CHIR99021 (Stemgent; 130-095-555) were supplemented in the medium. At day 4, cells cultured in the presence of mesodermal inducer (mentioned above) were dissociated, sorted for FLK1+ cells, and replated on 12-well plate at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well in N2B27 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml BMP4, 12.5 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml VEGF165, 0.25 mm BrcAMP (Sigma; B5386), and 4 μm ALKi (Merck; 616461). At day 6, adherent cells and floating fractions were collected by trypsinization and trituration, respectively, for further study (14Chiang P.M. Wong P.C.

Kasumi-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Himedia; AL1621) supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% antimycotic/antibiotic, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Mouse Hira cDNA (accession number BC156807; MGC premier ORF clone TOM6004) purchased from TransOMICS Technologies was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech; catalog number 6084-1) at XhoI and SalI sites. 2 × 105 control and Hira−/− ES cells were seeded in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen; 31985088) on 12-well plates. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; 11668019) and 2 μg of H3.3-Flag-tagged plasmid (Gift from Prof. James J. Bieker) and selected for 72 h with G418 (Sigma; G8168). In Hira−/− ES cells, HIRA was ectopically expressed by transfection of pEGFP-C1/Hira cDNA plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000. Transfected cells were observed for the expression of GFP and selected with G418 for 72 h. Control and Hira−/− ES cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. Pellet was washed with FACS buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 0.8% (v/v) FBS and 0.263 mm EDTA (Sigma; E9884)) twice at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The cells were suspended in the FACS buffer and incubated with 0.5 μg of fluorescent-conjugated monoclonal antibody for 30 min in dark on ice. Following incubation, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 500 μl of FACS buffer, filtered by cell strainer, and subsequently sorted by BD FACS AviaTM II. Total RNA from cells were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; 15596018); cDNA preparation was accomplished by a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (ABI; 4368814), and the expression of genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR using Sybr Green master mix (ABI, #4367659).

ESCs were cultured on coverslips under different culture conditions. Briefly, cells or yolk sacs were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Sigma; P6148) and permeabilized with 0.2% Tween 20 (Sigma; P1379) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen; 14190235). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch; 005-00-121), and cells were incubated overnight with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200. Fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568; Invitrogen; A11004 and Alexa Flour 488; Invitrogen; A11008) were used at a 1:200 dilution. Coverslips were mounted on slides and observed using a confocal microscope. We used Hoechst dye (Sigma; #B1155, 1 μg/ml) for nuclear staining. For hematopoietic precursors, slides were coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine (Sigma; 9813) for 30 min. Drops of cell culture suspension were added onto the slides and left for 4 h of incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Slides were further processed as described previously.

Lentiviral vectors containing shRNA targeting human Hira was cloned in the Plko.1 (Addgene) vector. Lentiviral supernatant was produced in HEK293T cells by transient transfection using calcium chloride (9Dutta D. Ray S. Home P. Saha B. Wang S. Sheibani N. Tawfik O. Cheng N. Paul S.

Briefly HEK293T cells were grown to 80% confluency. pRRE (gag/pol), pMD2G (VSVG), pRSV (Rev), and Hira shRNA plasmids were mixed in 0.25 m CaCl2 and equilibrated with an equal volume of 2× HEPES-buffered saline. Lentiviral particle containing supernatants were collected after 24 h of incubation. ES cells or Kasumi-1 cells were grown to 70% confluence and transfected with lentiviral soups. Transfected cells were selected by the addition of 1 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma, #P8833). After 3 days, RNA and protein were extracted for analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed the knockdown. We screened three different sets of shRNA, where sh247 (CCACAATGGCAAGCCGATT) worked best for the knockdown of Hira in Kasumi-1 cells. Protein lysates were prepared in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin) (16Ray S.

Establishment of hemogenic endothelium forms an integral part of development. At E9.5, mouse yolk sac expresses the key hemogenic marker RUNX1 in the circulation (17Samokhvalov I.M. Samokhvalova N.I. Nishikawa S. Cell tracing shows the contribution of the yolk sac to adult haematopoiesis.Nature. 2007; 446: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To explore the function of HIRA in development, we utilized the classical embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation model for the formation of EBs. During differentiation, there is no significant change of Hira at the mRNA level (Fig. 1A), whereas Western blot analysis showed that protein expression was significantly increased (Fig. 1B). To assess the requirement for HIRA during differentiation, we generated EBs from Hira−/− ESCs. In concordance with an earlier report (18Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), we observed that the expression of the developmental genes Gata4, Nestin, and Gata2 (Fig. 1, C–E) were induced in absence of HIRA. However, RUNX1 expression was significantly abrogated in absence of HIRA (Fig. 1F). This was confirmed by the down-regulation of RUNX1 protein in Hira−/− EBs (Fig. 1G). An analogous trend was observed in the Tie2 mRNA level in EBs deprived of HIRA (Fig. 1H). Next, we examined the correlation between HIRA and RUNX1 protein expression during development in mouse, specifically within the yolk sac. Immunofluorescence study revealed that RUNX1 and HIRA co-localize in E9.5 mouse yolk sac (Fig. 1I). RUNX1 drives the generation of hemogenic endothelium and is required until the emergence of HSCs (4Chen M.J. Yokomizo T. Zeigler B.M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A. Runx1 is required for the endothelial to haematopoietic cell transition but not thereafter.Nature. 2009; 457: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar); on commitment to hematopoiesis, the role of RUNX1 becomes redundant. Because we demonstrated that RUNX1 expression is modulated by HIRA, we further investigated this relationship with regard to the hemogenic to hematopoietic transition. We generated HE from control and Hira−/− ESCs following the protocol described by Chiang and Wong (14Chiang P.M. Wong P.C. Differentiation of an embryonic stem cell to hemogenic endothelium by defined factors essential role of bone morphogenetic protein 4.Development. 2011; 138: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). First, we questioned whether HIRA could influence the initial stages of differentiation of ESCs to HE. The differentiation in presence of mesodermal inducer and BMP4 induce the ESCs in endothelial lineage (14Chiang P.M. Wong P.C. Differentiation of an embryonic stem cell to hemogenic endothelium by defined factors essential role of bone morphogenetic protein 4.Development. 2011; 138: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, at day 4, we analyzed the expression of FLK1 (fetal liver kinase-1) in control and Hira−/− ES differentiated cells. FLK1+ cells are common progenitors for endothelial and hematopoietic lineage. We observed that Hira−/− cells did not demonstrate any significant alteration in the expression of Flk1 (Fig. 1, J and K). FACS analysis revealed a comparable number of FLK1+ cells arising from both control and Hira−/− ESCs (Fig. 1L). Effectively, absence of HIRA could not inhibit or influence the differentiation of ESCs till the mesoderm stage. In the next stage, during hemogenic to hematopoietic transition, the phenotype of the cells undergoes a shift first from flattened to spherical cells and then from loosely bound cells to floating cells. Control ESCs conformed to this pattern of HE colony development (Fig. 2A, upper panel), whereas Hira−/− ESCs failed to generate colonies with an analogous morphology (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The black arrows in Fig. 2A (upper panel) indicate the small clusters of cells undergoing the classical EndHT. RUNX1 expression was significantly down-regulated at the protein level in hemogenic endothelial cells derived from Hira−/− ESCs (Fig. 2B). During the differentiation of ESCs toward HE, HSC precursors repopulate the floating fraction of the culture (14Chiang P.M. Wong P.C. Differentiation of an embryonic stem cell to hemogenic endothelium by defined factors essential role of bone morphogenetic protein 4.Development. 2011; 138: 2833-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed both the adherent cells and floating cells of the HE culture. In absence of HIRA, Runx1 expression was significantly reduced in both the floating and adherent cells of the culture (Fig. 2C). We also analyzed the status of other genes associated with HE within the same samples. Sox17 has been implicated in HE formation (19Clarke R.L. Yzaguirre A.D. Yashiro-Ohtani Y. Bondue A. Blanpain C. Pear W.S. Speck N.A. Keller G. The expression of Sox17 identifies and regulates haemogenic endothelium.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and we observed that in HIRA depleted cells, there was no significant difference in its expression between the mutant and wild type HE cells (Fig. 2D). However, expression of c-Myb, a partner of RUNX1 (20Hernandez-Munain C. Krangel M.S. Regulation of the T-cell receptor delta enhancer by functional cooperation between c-Myb and core-binding factors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) induced in hematopoietic differentiation (21Soza-Ried C. Hess I. Netuschil N. Schorpp M. Boehm T. Essential role of c-myb in definitive hematopoiesis is evolutionarily conserved.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17304-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is significantly down-regulated within the Hira−/− HE (Fig. 2D). Endothelial marker Tie2 was significantly down-regulated within the floating fraction of cells in the absence of HIRA (Fig. 2D). RUNX1 is a positive modulator of definitive hematopoiesis. Along with other transcription factors, RUNX1 regulates the dynamic pattern of genes implicated in hematopoiesis. Pu.1, Gfi1, and Gfi1B are reported to be direct downstream targets of RUNX1 (22Jin H. Li L. Xu J. Zhen F. Zhu L. Liu P.P. Zhang M. Zhang W. Wen Z. Runx1 regulates embryonic myeloid fate choice in zebrafish through a negative feedback loop inhibiting Pu.1expression.Blood. 2012; 119: 5239-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Lancrin C. Mazan M. Stefanska M. Patel R. Lichtinger M. Costa G. Vargel O. Wilson N.K. Möröy T. Bonifer C. Göttgens B. Kouskoff V. Lacaud G. GFI1 and GFI1B control the loss of endothelial identity of hemogenic endothelium during hematopoietic commitment.Blood. 2012; 120: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of the transcription factors Pu.1, Gfi1, and Gfi1b (Fig. 2E) were significantly down-regulated both in HE cells and hematopoietic precursors in the absence of HIRA. We conclude that HIRA is specifically involved in the regulation of RUNX1 during hemogenic program in the hemogenic-defined circuitry. Genes that are essential for hematopoietic progenitors are also affected as evident from the expression of Gata2 (Fig. 2, F and G) or c-myb (Fig. 2E). On ectopic expression of HIRA (tagged with GFP) in Hira−/− ESCs (Fig. 3A, left panels), the expression of RUNX1 was rescued in differentiating HE cells (Fig. 3A, right panel).FIGURE 3HIRA rescues RUNX1 expression.

Monalysin has been recently identified as a β-PFT that contributes to the virulence of Pseudomonas entomophila against Drosophila. It is secreted as a pro-protein that becomes active upon cleavage. Here we report the crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structure of the pro-form of Monalysin as well as the crystal structures of the cleaved form and of an inactive mutant lacking the membrane-spanning region. The overall structure of Monalysin displays an elongated shape, which resembles those of β-pore-forming toxins, such as Aerolysin, but is devoid of a receptor-binding domain. X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and light-scattering studies show that pro-Monalysin forms a stable doughnut-like 18-mer complex composed of two disk-shaped nonamers held together by N-terminal swapping of the pro-peptides. This observation is in contrast with the monomeric pro-form of the other β-PFTs that are receptor-dependent for membrane interaction. The membrane-spanning region of pro-Monalysin is fully buried in the center of the doughnut, suggesting that upon cleavage of pro-peptides, the two disk-shaped nonamers can, and have to, dissociate to leave the transmembrane segments free to deploy and lead to pore formation. In contrast with other toxins, the delivery of 18 subunits at once, nearby the cell surface, may be used to bypass the requirement of receptor-dependent concentration to reach the threshold for oligomerization into the pore-forming complex.Background: Monalysin is a β-barrel pore-forming toxin secreted by Pseudomonas entomophila.Results: Monalysin structure belongs to the Aerolysin fold family but is devoid of receptor-binding domain; pro-Monalysin forms a stable 18-mer complex.Conclusion: The delivery of 18 subunits may bypass the requirement of receptor-dependent concentration.Significance: The functional mechanism of Monalysin differs from that of described Aerolysin family members. β-Barrel pore-forming toxins (β-PFT), a large family of bacterial toxins, are generally secreted as water-soluble monomers and can form oligomeric pores in membranes following proteolytic cleavage and interaction with cell surface receptors.

Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) 4The abbreviations used are:PFTpore-forming toxincryo-EMcryo-electron microscopySECsize exclusion chromatographyMALSmultiangle laser light scatteringRIrefractive indexr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationCPEClostridium perfringens enterotoxin. are produced by a wide range of organisms, such as bacteria, insects, marine invertebrates, poisonous reptiles, and mammals, mostly for defense, attack, or signaling (1Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Pore-forming protein toxins: from structure to function.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). PFTs are generally secreted as soluble monomers that diffuse toward the membrane of target cells. Recognition and binding to a specific receptor cause them to associate with the target membrane, form multimers, and undergo a conformational change, leading to the formation of an aqueous pore inserted in the membrane. PFTs are classified according to the type of secondary structure elements used to cross the lipid bilayer at the onset of pore formation (2Gouaux E. Channel-forming toxins: tales of transformation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Hence, these toxins are usually divided into two categories: α-PFTs and β-PFTs. pore-forming toxin cryo-electron microscopy size exclusion chromatography multiangle laser light scattering refractive index root mean square deviation Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin. The heptameric structure of the Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin pore was determined more than 15 years ago (3Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Structure of staphylococcal α-hemolysin, a heptameric transmembrane pore.Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar) and was until recently the only high resolution structure of a β-PFT in the membrane-inserted form. The ring-shaped complex resembles a mushroom, with the cap forming the extracellular domain and the stem forming the membrane-spanning region, in which each subunit contributes one β-hairpin. In the recent past, several structures of PFTs have been determined, but the structures of both the soluble and the pore forms are available for only a few: the α-PFT ClyA (4Wallace A.J.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 17314-17319Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, the structures of Aerolysin mutants in their monomeric and heptameric forms have been determined by using a combination of x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), molecular dynamics, and computational modeling (11Degiacomi M.T. Iacovache I. Pernot L. Chami M. Kudryashev M. Stahlberg H. van der Goot F.G. Dal Peraro M. Molecular assembly of the aerolysin pore reveals a swirling membrane-insertion mechanism.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It should be noted that contrary to the α-hemolysin pore, which displays a mushroom shape, the Aerolysin pore looks like a rivet with a flat disk-shaped head. In a previous study (12Opota O. Vallet-Gély I. Vincentelli R. Kellenberger C. Iacovache I. Gonzalez M.R. Roussel A. van der Goot F.G. Lemaitre B. Monalysin, a novel β-pore-forming toxin from the Drosophila pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila, contributes to host intestinal damage and lethality.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002259Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we showed that Monalysin is a β-PFT from Pseudomonas entomophila secreted as a pro-protein that should be cleaved to become fully active. Indeed cleaved Monalysin was more active than pro-Monalysin. Nevertheless at high concentration (more than 10 nm), we were able to detect cytotoxic activity with the pro-Monalysin. The pro-Monalysin may be cleaved by proteases present at the surface of the cells. Many toxins are secreted by pathogenic organisms as inactive precursors, presumably to protect the producing cells from self-destruction or to increase the efficiency of delivery to the target cells. Activation of toxin precursors often involves proteolytic processing by enzymes produced either by the pathogen itself or by the host organism. Different effects resulting from proteolytic cleavage have been described for bacterial toxins. It is noteworthy that in the case of anthrax toxin, proteolysis at a furin-sensitive cleavage site removes a 20-kDa fragment from the N terminus (13Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. Human furin is a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease that recognizes the sequence Arg-X-X-Arg and efficiently cleaves anthrax toxin protective antigen.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leaving a 63-kDa fragment bound to the receptor. In absence of the N terminus fragment, the bound fragment self-associates to form a ring-shaped heptameric prepore (14Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. Anthrax protective antigen forms oligomers during intoxication of mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following this step, a large amphipathic loop from each monomer is believed to be inserted into the membrane, forming a β-hairpin, which generates a 14-stranded β-barrel pore (15Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Identification of residues lining the anthrax protective antigen channel.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3941-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in a pH-dependent manner (16Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Structure of heptameric protective antigen bound to an anthrax toxin receptor: a role for receptor in pH-dependent pore formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13147-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Another example of proteolytic activation mechanism has been reported for Aerolysin. Pro-Aerolysin is released as a soluble dimeric precursor (17van der Goot F.G. Ausio J. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. Dimerization stabilizes the pore-forming toxin aerolysin in solution.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18272-18279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that can bind to target cells through its specific receptor-binding domain (18Gruber H.J. Wilmsen H.U. Cowell S. Schindler H. Buckley J.T. Partial purification of the rat erythrocyte receptor for the channel-forming toxin aerolysin and reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers.Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pro-Aerolysin is activated by proteolytic cleavage, which releases a C-terminal peptide (19van der Goot F.G. Hardie K.R. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. The C-terminal peptide produced upon proteolytic activation of the cytolytic toxin aerolysin is not involved in channel formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30496-30501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and promotes the formation of the oligomeric pore structure (20Cabiaux V. Buckley J.T. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M. Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Conformational changes in aerolysin during the transition from the water-soluble protoxin to the membrane channel.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15224-15232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the Aerolysin C-terminal peptide also serves as a molecular chaperone because it promotes the folding of the protein soluble state (21Iacovache I. Degiacomi M.T. Pernot L. Ho S. Schiltz M. Dal Peraro M. van der Goot F.G. Dual chaperone role of the C-terminal propeptide in folding and oligomerization of the pore-forming toxin aerolysin.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002135Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, to explore the activation mechanism of Monalysin, we determined three crystal structures of Monalysin (pro and cleaved forms and an inactive mutant) as well as the cryo-EM reconstruction of the pro-Monalysin particle. Coupled with studies in solution using light scattering (SEC/MALS/UV/RI), our findings reveal that pro-Monalysin forms a stable 18-mer complex in solution composed of two disk-shaped nonamers held together by N-terminal swapping of the pro-peptides. Expression and purification of recombinant pro-Monalysin were performed as described previously (22Blemont M. Vincentelli R. Kellenberger C. Opota O. Lemaitre B. Roussel A. Leone P. Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of monalysin, a novel β-pore-forming toxin from the entomopathogen Pseudomonas entomophila.Acta Crystallogr. Sect F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2013; 69: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Limited trypsinolysis (1:10 w/w) was performed for 15 min at room temperature, and the soluble and non-soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The sequence of the Monalysin mutant MΔ102–170, in which the membrane-spanning domain was deleted and replaced with a Gly-Ser dipeptide linker, was cloned into the pETG-20A vector using the Mega-Primer technique. The production of MΔ102–170 was performed with the same procedure as for pro-Monalysin. For crystallization trials, the purified MΔ102–170 was concentrated to 8.6 mg ml−1. For the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with on-line multiangle laser light scattering (MALS), absorbance (UV), and refractive index (RI) analysis, pure pro-Monalysin and MΔ102–170 were concentrated to 2.0 and 2.3 mg ml−1, respectively, and stored at 4 °C. Proteins were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 5 min) just before the experiment. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out on an Alliance 2695 HPLC system (Waters) using a Silica Gel KW804 column (Shodex) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl at a flow of 0.5 ml/min. Detection was performed using a triple-angle light scattering detector (Mini-DAWN TREOS, Wyatt Technology), a quasi-elastic light scattering instrument (DynaPro, Wyatt Technology), and a differential refractometer (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology). Crystallization and data collection of pro-Monalysin and tantalum derivative were performed as described previously (22Blemont M. Vincentelli R. Kellenberger C. Opota O. Lemaitre B. Roussel A. Leone P. Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of monalysin, a novel β-pore-forming toxin from the entomopathogen Pseudomonas entomophila.Acta Crystallogr. Sect F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2013; 69: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The cleaved Monalysin crystals were obtained at room temperature from drops in which pro-Monalysin was co-crystalized with 1.5 mm HgCl2, and appeared after several months contrary to pro-Monalysin crystals that appeared within a few days (22Blemont M. Vincentelli R. Kellenberger C. Opota O. Lemaitre B. Roussel A. Leone P. Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of monalysin, a novel β-pore-forming toxin from the entomopathogen Pseudomonas entomophila.Acta Crystallogr. Sect F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2013; 69: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The crystals were flash-frozen with 15% glycerol in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.7 Å resolution on beamline ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The MΔ102–170 crystals were obtained, using a Mosquito robot (TTP Labtech), from the Crystal Screens 1 condition number 20 (0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m calcium acetate, 18% PEG8000). They were flash-frozen with 10% glycerol in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.65 Å resolution on beamline ID29 at the ESRF. The data sets were integrated with XDS (23Kabsch W. Integration, scaling, space-group assignment and post-refinement.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab The structure of pro-Monalysin was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method using the tantalum derivative data set at 3.6 Å resolution. A nine-tantalum complex substructure was as described previously (22Blemont M. Vincentelli R. Kellenberger C. Opota O. Lemaitre B. Roussel A. Leone P.

Commun. 2013; 69: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The experimental phases were further improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching using SOLOMON (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Methods used in the structure determination of bovine mitochondrial F1 ATPase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and DM (27Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Density modification for macromolecular phase improvement.Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The partial model was then used for molecular replacement with the native pro-Monalysin data set at 2.85 Å resolution using MOLREP (29Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). The pro-Monalysin model was manually completed using Turbo-Frodo (30Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo.Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar). The structures of cleaved Monalysin and MΔ102–170 were solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP. Refinement was performed with autoBUSTER (31Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Refinement of severely incomplete structures with maximum likelihood in BUSTER-TNT.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) using automated non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, and the structures were corrected with COOT (32Emsley P.

Model validations were done with Molprobity (33Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Refinement statistics are reported in Table 1. Cytolytic assay was performed according to previously published protocol (34Peterson M.L. Schlievert P.M. Glycerol monolaurate inhibits the effects of Gram-positive select agents on eukaryotic cells.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2387-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). S2 cells (5.105) were washed twice and suspended in PBS and then mixed into 100 nm pro-Monalysin, 100 nm Monalysin mutant MΔ102–170, or buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl) in a 96-well plate. In a previous study (12Opota O. Vallet-Gély I. Vincentelli R. Kellenberger C. Iacovache I. Gonzalez M.R. Roussel A. van der Goot F.G. Lemaitre B. Monalysin, a novel β-pore-forming toxin from the Drosophila pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila, contributes to host intestinal damage and lethality.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002259Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we showed that pro-Monalysin displayed lysis activity at concentrations higher than 10 nm. The pro-Monalysin may be cleaved by proteases present at the surface of the cell. To assess cell lysis rate, cell density variation was monitored through measurement of OD600 nm every 5 min, after a brief shaking, during 1 h at room temperature, using a Tecan microplate reader. 3-μl samples were applied and incubated onto glow-discharged Quantifoil grids for 1 min and subsequently blotted for 3 s before plunging into liquid ethane for vitrification using a FEI Vitrobot. ∼220 CCD images were collected under low dose conditions using a Tecnai F30 microscope with a field emission gun operated at 300 kV (IGBMC, Strasbourg, France) and a FEI Eagle 4Kx4K CCD camera at a magnification of 59,000× (1.92 Å/pixel at the specimen level), and over a range of nominal defocus values comprised between −2 and −3.5 μm. Defocus estimation and contrast transfer function (CTF) correction were carried out using FINDCTF2D (TIGRIS software from Timothy Grant, Imperial College London). 50,000 particles were automatically selected using the program Boxer from the EMAN2 package (35Tang G. Peng L. Baldwin P.R. Mann D.S. Jiang W. Rees I. Ludtke S.J. EMAN2: an extensible image processing suite for electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar), extracted into boxes of 144,144, and combined into a dataset stack (Fig. 1A). The dataset was pretreated using the SPIDER package (36Shaikh T.R. Gao H. Baxter W.T. Asturias F.J. Boisset N. Leith A. Frank J. SPIDER image processing for single-particle reconstruction of biological macromolecules from electron micrographs.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1941-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and submitted to maximum likelihood classification and alignment (37Scheres S.H. Classification of structural heterogeneity by maximum-likelihood methods.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 482: 295-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the Xmipp package (38Scheres S.H.

Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The initial map was built from a visually selected class average representing a side-view imposing D9 symmetry (Fig. 1, B and C). The initial structure was then refined by three-dimensional maximum likelihood refinement and further refined by projection matching with an angular sampling of 5° using SPIDER. After refinement, a final structure was obtained at a resolution of approximately 17 Å as estimated by Fourier shell correlation and the half-bit threshold criterion (39van Heel M. Schatz M. Fourier shell correlation threshold criteria.J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The final reconstruction was built with ∼12,000 particles after removal of most particles in a top-view orientation to compensate for their large over-representation and reduce preferential views effects and three-dimensional distortions. Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with the UCSF Chimera package (Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (supported by NIGMS P41-GM103311 through the National Institutes of Health)). The model/EM map or EM map/EM map fitting was performed by the option “fit in map” of the “volume” register. The difference map was calculated using Chimera. First, the x-ray structure was converted into a density map using the option “Fit into structure,” with a target resolution and values comparable with that of the EM map. This command also fit the new map using the original EM volume. Then, maps were subtracted using the command: “vop subtract #1 #2 modelId #3” to produce the difference map presented here. The pro-Monalysin protein crystallized in space group C2 with nine molecules in the asymmetric unit and an estimated solvent content of 53.5%. The structure was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method using a tantalum derivative and was refined at 2.85 Å resolution (Table 1). Electron density was observed for residues 9–17 and 36–271 in all nine copies. The nine protomers are arranged as a disk-shaped complex resembling a conical washer. A symmetry-related disk stacks against the unique disk in the asymmetric unit, their two concave faces facing each other to form a doughnut-shaped 18-mer complex. This doughnut is 140 Å wide and ∼80 Å thick, and its internal channel diameter is 30 Å (Fig. 2A). The pro-Monalysin monomer is an elongated molecule with overall dimensions of ∼75 Å × 40 Å × 35 Å (Fig. 2B). Because an amino acid stretch was missing in the electron density map, we isolated protein samples from carefully washed crystals and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE to check the integrity of the crystallized material. A unique band corresponding to the full-length protein was observed, assessing the protein integrity (Fig. 3A, lane 1). We deduced thus that the N terminus segment (residues 9–17), visible in the electron density map (Fig. 2C), should be connected to the main protein domain through a polypeptide stretch not visible in the electron density map, probably due to disorder. However, it was not possible at this stage to determine the N terminus fragment connectivity as two residues at pos"

https://openalex.org/W2037386825,"Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors with many different subtypes. In 2014 an estimated 12,020 newly diagnosed cases and 4,740 soft tissue sarcoma related deaths can be expected in the United States. Many soft tissue sarcomas are associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic options are often limited. The evolution of precision medicine has not yet fully reached the clinical treatment of sarcomas since therapeutically tractable genetic changes have not been comprehensively studied so far. We analyzed a total of 484 adult-type malignant mesenchymal tumors by MET fluorescence in situ hybridization and MET and hepatocyte growth factor immunohistochemistry. Eleven different entities were included, among them the most common and clinically relevant subtypes and tumors with specific translocations or complex genetic changes. MET protein expression was observed in 2.6% of the cases, all of which were either undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas or angiosarcomas, showing positivity rates of 14% and 17%, respectively. 6% of the tumors showed hepatocyte growth factor overexpression, mainly seen in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and angiosarcomas, but also in clear cell sarcomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, leiomyosarcomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. MET and hepatocyte growth factor overexpression were significantly correlated and may suggest an autocrine activation in these tumors. MET FISH amplification and copy number gain were present in 4% of the tumors (15/413). Two samples, both undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, fulfilled the criteria for high level amplification of MET, one undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma reached an intermediate level copy number gain, and 12 samples of different subtypes were categorized as low level copy number gains for MET. Our findings indicate that angiosarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas rather than other frequent adult-type sarcomas should be enrolled in screening programs for clinical trials with MET inhibitors. The screening methods should include both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry."

Whether neonatal morphine exposure affects microRNA (miR) expression and thereby alters mRNA regulation is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that repeated morphine treatment in stress-exposed neonatal mice alters hippocampal mRNA and miR expression. C57BL/6 male mice were treated from postnatal day (P) 5 to P9 with morphine sulfate at 2 or 5 mg/kg ip twice daily and then exposed to stress consisting of hypoxia (100% N2 1 min and 100% O2 5 min) followed by 2h maternal separation. Control mice were untreated and dam-reared. mRNA and miR expression profiling was performed on hippocampal tissues at P9. Overall, 2 and 5 mg/kg morphine treatment altered expression of a total of 150 transcripts (>1.5 fold change, P<0.05) from which 100 unique mRNAs were recognized (21 genes were up- and 79 genes were down-regulated), and 5 mg/kg morphine affected 63 mRNAs exclusively. The most upregulated mRNAs were fidgetin, arginine vasopressin, and resistin-like alpha, and the most down-regulated were defensin beta 11, aquaporin 1, calmodulin-like 4, chloride intracellular channel 6, and claudin 2. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that morphine treatment affected pathways related to cell cycle, membrane function, signaling, metabolism, cell death, transcriptional regulation, and immune response. Morphine decreased expression of miR-204-5p, miR-455-3p, miR-448-5p, and miR-574-3p. Nine morphine-responsive mRNAs that are involved in neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, and inflammation are predicted targets of the aforementioned differentially expressed miRs. These data establish that morphine produces dose-dependent changes in both hippocampal mRNA and miR expression in stressed neonatal mice. If permanent, morphine-mediated neuroepigenetic effects may affect long-term hippocampal function, and this provides a mechanism for the neonatal morphine-related impairment of adult learning."
https://openalex.org/W2091904539,"Cytochrome P450 2W1 (CYP2W1) is expressed predominantly in colorectal and also in hepatic tumors, whereas the levels are insignificant in the corresponding normal human adult tissues. CYP2W1 has been proposed as an attractive target for colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy by exploiting its ability to activate duocarmycin prodrugs to cytotoxic metabolites. However, its endogenous function, regulation and developmental pattern of expression remain unexplored. Here we report the CYP2W1 developmental expression in the murine and human gastrointestinal tissues. The gene expression in the colon and small intestine commence at early stages of embryonic life and is completely silenced shortly after the birth. Immunohistochemical analysis of human fetal colon revealed that CYP2W1 expression is restricted to the crypt cells. The silencing of CYP2W1 after birth correlates with the increased methylation of CpG-rich regions in both murine and human CYP2W1 genes. Analysis of CYP2W1 expression in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCC2998 revealed that the gene expression can be induced by e.g. the antitumor agent imatinib, linoleic acid and its derivatives. The imatinib mediated induction of CYP2W1 suggests an adjuvant therapy to treatment with duocarmycins that thus would involve induction of tumor CYP2W1 levels followed by the CYP2W1 activated duocarmycin prodrugs. Taken together these data strongly support further exploration of CYP2W1 as a specific drug target in CRC."

To investigate the role of sHSPs in the silk-producing insect Antheraea pernyi response to microorganisms, a sHsp gene termed as Ap-sHSP21.4, was identified. This gene encoded a 21.4 kDa protein which shares the conserved structure of insect sHsps and belongs to sHSP21.4 family. Ap-sHSP21.4 was highly expressed in fat body and up-regulated in midgut and fat body of A. pernyi challenged with Escherichia coli, Beauveria bassiana and nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), which was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Meanwhile, knock down of Ap-sHSP21.4 with dsRNA result in the decrease at the expression levels of several immune response-related genes (defensin, Dopa decarboxylase, Toll1, lysozyme and Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor). Additionally, the impact of eicosanoid biosynthesis on the expression of Ap-sHSP21.4 response to NPV was determined using qPCR, inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis significantly suppress Ap-HSP21.4 expression upon NPV challenge. All together, Ap-sHSP21.4 was involved in the immunity of A. pernyi against microorganism and possibly mediated by eicosanoids pathway. These results will shed light in the understanding of the pathogen-host interaction in A. pernyi."

More importantly, post-exposure treatment with baicalin significantly increased the survival of mice poisoned by ricin. We determined the mechanism of action of baicalin by solving the crystal structure of its complex with the A chain of ricin (RTA) at 2.2 Å resolution, which revealed that baicalin interacts with two RTA molecules at a novel binding site by hydrogen bond networks and electrostatic force interactions, suggesting its role as molecular glue of the RTA. Further biochemical and biophysical analyses validated the amino acids directly involved in binding the inhibitor, which is consistent with the hypothesis that baicalin exerts its inhibitory effects by inducing RTA to form oligomers in solution, a mechanism that is distinctly different from previously reported inhibitors.

The international guidelines suggest two cut-offs, one for the percentage and one for the number of tumor cells, in order to enrich the tumor content before DNA extraction. The aim of the present work was two-fold: to evaluate to what extent a low percentage or absolute number of tumor cells can be qualified for somatic mutation testing; and to determine how assay sensitivities can guide pathologists towards a better definition of morphology-based adequacy cut-offs. We tested 1797 tumor specimens from melanomas, colorectal and lung adenocarcinomas. Respectively, their BRAF, K-RAS and EGFR genes were analyzed at specific exons by mutation-enriched PCR, pyrosequencing, direct sequencing and real-time PCR methods. We demonstrate that poorly cellular specimens do not modify the frequency distribution of either mutated or wild-type DNA samples nor that of specific mutations. This observation suggests that currently recommended cut-offs for adequacy of specimens to be processed for molecular assays seem to be too much stringent in a laboratory context that performs highly sensitive routine analytical methods. In conclusion, new cut-offs are needed based on test sensitivities and documented tumor heterogeneity."

The intra-hepatic level of expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and the rs12979860 CC genotype located within IFNL3 have been associated with sustained virological response (SVR), in patients with CHC. The aim of the study was to identify micro-RNAs associated with SVR and to build an accurate signature to predict SVR. Pre-treatment liver biopsies from 111 patients, treated with PEG-IFN plus ribavirin, were studied. Fifty-seven patients had SVR, 36 non-response (NR) and 18 relapse (RR). The expression of 851 human miRNAs and 30 selected mRNAs, including ISGs, was assessed by RT-qPCR. In the first group of patients (screen), 20 miRNAs out of the 851 studied were deregulated between NRs and SVRs. From the 4 miRNAs validated (mir-23a, mir-181a*, mir-217 and mir-99a), in the second group of patients (validation), 3 (mir-23a, mir-181a* and mir-99a) were down-regulated in NRs as compared to SVRs. The ISGs, studied, were accumulated in SVRs and IFNL3 rs12979860 CT/TT carriers compared respectively to NRs and CC carriers. Combining, clinical data together with the expression of selected genes and micro-RNAs, we identified a signature (IFI35, mir-99a and HCV genotype) to predict SVR (AUC:0.876) with a positive predictive value of 86.54% with high sensibility (80%) and specificity (80.4%). This signature may help to characterize patients with low chance to respond to PEG-IFN/ribavirin and to elucidate mechanisms of NR."
https://openalex.org/W2040513850,"Background Obesity campaign evaluations have used campaign awareness to assess impact, yet have not compared unprompted campaign recallers, with prompted recallers and those with no campaign recall. Using data from an Australian mass-media obesity prevention campaign linking waist circumference and chronic disease we examined whether those with different degrees of campaign recall are distinct groups demographically and for subsequent campaign effects. Methods A national cross-sectional telephone survey of randomly selected adults aged 18 to 65 years was conducted post- campaign (n = 2812) covering campaign recall, self-reported diet and physical activity (PA) and waist-measuring knowledge, behaviours and intentions to make lifestyle changes. Respondents were divided into three groups indicating campaign recall: Unprompted Recallers (n=1154); Prompted Recallers (n=1284); and No Recallers (n=374) and compared on demographic, knowledge, and behavioural risk factors for obesity/chronic disease. Results Unprompted Recallers were more likely to speak English at home (p<.001), be in the primary campaign target group (25-45 years with children) (p<0.001) than the other two groups and to be university educated and female than the Prompted Recall group only (p=0.001). Unprompted Recallers had better knowledge about recommended waist circumference (p<.001), fruit (p=0.004), vegetable (p<0.001) and PA guidelines (p<0.001) than both the other groups. The No Recall group was less likely than the other two to be overweight/obese (46% vs 55%, p=0.020 and 54%, p=0.037), comparable on meeting fruit consumption and PA guidelines but more likely to meet vegetable intake recommendations (than Unprompted Recallers only). Conclusions Unprompted recallers were more knowledgeable about campaign messages; behaviour change and intentions to change were stronger for the two recall groups compared with the No Recall group but not different between them. The current analysis revealed subtle differences in campaign exposure and/or attendance by different demographic subgroups that would not be apparent in a simple aware/unaware dichotomy."

Ten matched fresh-frozen and fixed breast cancer samples were profiled using the Illumina HT-12 and Ref-8 chips, respectively. The profiles obtained with Ref 8, were neither technically nor biologically reliable since they failed to yield the expected separation between estrogen receptor positive and negative samples. With the use of Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus chips on fixed samples and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction -based sample pre-assessment step, results were satisfactory in terms of biological reliability, despite the low number of present calls (M = 21%±5). Compared with the Illumina DASL WG platform, Affymetrix data showed a wider interquartile range (1.32 vs 0.57, P<2.2 E-16,) and larger fold changes. The Affymetrix chips were used to run a pilot study on 60 fixed breast cancers. By including in the workflow the sample pre-assessment steps, 96% of the samples predicted to give good results (44/46), were in fact rated as satisfactory from the point of view of technical and biological meaningfulness. Our gene expression profiles showed strong agreement with immunohistochemistry data, were able to reproduce breast cancer molecular subtypes, and allowed the validation of an estrogen receptor status classifier derived in frozen samples. The approach is therefore suitable to profile formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples collected in clinical trials, provided that quality controls are run both before (sample pre-assessment) and after hybridization on the array."
https://openalex.org/W2030325920,"Introduction It is well established that obesity-related hormones can have modulatory effects associated with the immune response. Ghrelin, a hormone mainly derived from endocrine cells of the gastric mucosa, regulates appetite, energy expenditure and body weight counteracting leptin, a hormone mainly derived from adipocytes. Additionally, receptors of both have been detected on immune cells and demonstrated an immune regulatory function during sepsis. Methods In the present study, the effect of peripheral ghrelin administration on early immune response and survival was investigated with lean mice and mice with diet-induced obesity using cecal ligation and puncture to induce sepsis. Results In the obese group, we found that ghrelin treatment improved survival, ameliorated hypothermia, and increased hyperleptinemia as compared to the lean controls. We also observed that ghrelin treatment divergently regulated serum IL-1ß and TNF-α concentrations in both lean and obese septic mice. Ghrelin treatment initially decreased but later resulted in increased bacteriaemia in lean mice while having no impact upon obese mice. Similarly, ghrelin treatment increased early neutrophil oxidative burst while causing a decrease 48 hours after sepsis inducement. Conclusion In conclusion, as the immune response to sepsis temporally changes, ghrelin treatment differentially mediates this response. Specifically, we observed that ghrelin conferred protective effects during the early phase of sepsis, but during the later phase deteriorated immune response and outcome. These adverse effects were more pronounced upon lean mice as compared to obese mice."

The interaural time difference (ITD), an important cue for sound localization, is computed in the auditory brainstem. In our previous modeling study, we introduced a two-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley type model to investigate how cellular and synaptic specializations may contribute to precise ITD computation of the barn owl's auditory coincidence detector neuron. Although our model successfully reproduced fundamental physiological properties observed in vivo, it was unsuitable for mathematical analyses and large scale simulations because of a number of nonlinear variables. In the present study, we reduce our former model into three types of conductance-based integrate-and-fire (IF) models. We test their electrophysiological properties using data from published in vivo and in vitro studies. Their robustness to parameter changes and computational efficiencies are also examined. Our numerical results suggest that the single-compartment active IF model is superior to other reduced models in terms of physiological reproducibility and computational performance. This model will allow future theoretical studies that use more rigorous mathematical analysis and network simulations."

PCI-CT of human breast tumour specimens with synchrotron radiation was performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). A total of 14 specimens of early-stage carcinomas and 8 specimens of adenomas were enrolled. Based on raw data reconstruction, the diagnostic signs present in the slices were analysed and correlated with histopathology. We proposed a criterion for clinical diagnosis according to the evaluated signs and the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) for reference. The criterion was then assessed by clinicians in a double-blind method. Finally, descriptive statistics were evaluated, depending on the assessment results. Results The 14 carcinoma specimens and 8 adenoma specimens were diagnosed as malignant and benign tumours, respectively. The total coincidence rate was 100%. Conclusion Our study results demonstrate that the X-ray diagnostic signs observed in the specimen slices and the criterion used for clinical diagnosis were accurate and reliable. The criterion based on signs analysis can be used to differentiate early-stage benign or malignant tumours. As a promising imaging method, PCI-CT can serve as a possible and feasible supplement to BI-RADS in the future."
