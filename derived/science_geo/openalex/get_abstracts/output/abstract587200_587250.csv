https://openalex.org/W2617667835,"The organization of the eukaryotic cell into discrete membrane-bound organelles allows for the separation of incompatible biochemical processes, but the activities of these organelles must be coordinated. For example, lipid metabolism is distributed between the endoplasmic reticulum for lipid synthesis, lipid droplets for storage and transport, mitochondria and peroxisomes for Î²-oxidation, and lysosomes for lipid hydrolysis and recycling. It is increasingly recognized that organelle contacts have a vital role in diverse cellular functions. However, the spatial and temporal organization of organelles within the cell remains poorly characterized, as fluorescence imaging approaches are limited in the number of different labels that can be distinguished in a single image. Here we present a systems-level analysis of the organelle interactome using a multispectral image acquisition method that overcomes the challenge of spectral overlap in the fluorescent protein palette. We used confocal and lattice light sheet instrumentation and an imaging informatics pipeline of five steps to achieve mapping of organelle numbers, volumes, speeds, positions and dynamic inter-organelle contacts in live cells from a monkey fibroblast cell line. We describe the frequency and locality of two-, three-, four- and five-way interactions among six different membrane-bound organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisome, mitochondria and lipid droplet) and show how these relationships change over time. We demonstrate that each organelle has a characteristic distribution and dispersion pattern in three-dimensional space and that there is a reproducible pattern of contacts among the six organelles, that is affected by microtubule and cell nutrient status. These live-cell confocal and lattice light sheet spectral imaging approaches are applicable to any cell system expressing multiple fluorescent probes, whether in normal conditions or when cells are exposed to disturbances such as drugs, pathogens or stress. This methodology thus offers a powerful descriptive tool and can be used to develop hypotheses about cellular organization and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2616265326,"The domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., is a global oil crop that has promise for climate change adaptation, because it can maintain stable yields across a wide variety of environmental conditions, including drought. Even greater resilience is achievable through the mining of resistance alleles from compatible wild sunflower relatives, including numerous extremophile species. Here we report a high-quality reference for the sunflower genome (3.6 gigabases), together with extensive transcriptomic data from vegetative and floral organs. The genome mostly consists of highly similar, related sequences and required single-molecule real-time sequencing technologies for successful assembly. Genome analyses enabled the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Asterids, further establishing the existence of a whole-genome triplication at the base of the Asterids II clade and a sunflower-specific whole-genome duplication around 29 million years ago. An integrative approach combining quantitative genetics, expression and diversity data permitted development of comprehensive gene networks for two major breeding traits, flowering time and oil metabolism, and revealed new candidate genes in these networks. We found that the genomic architecture of flowering time has been shaped by the most recent whole-genome duplication, which suggests that ancient paralogues can remain in the same regulatory networks for dozens of millions of years. This genome represents a cornerstone for future research programs aiming to exploit genetic diversity to improve biotic and abiotic stress resistance and oil production, while also considering agricultural constraints and human nutritional needs."
https://openalex.org/W2618411197,"Many exotic phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems emerge from the interplay between spin and motional degrees of freedom. For example, doping an antiferromagnet gives rise to interesting phases including pseudogap states and high-temperature superconductors. A promising route towards achieving a complete understanding of these materials begins with analytic and computational analysis of simplified models. Quantum simulation has recently emerged as a complementary approach towards understanding these models. Ultracold fermions in optical lattices offer the potential to answer open questions on the low-temperature regime of the doped Hubbard model, which is thought to capture essential aspects of the cuprate superconductor phase diagram but is numerically intractable in that parameter regime. A new perspective is afforded by quantum gas microscopy of fermions, which allows readout of magnetic correlations at the site-resolved level. Here we report the realization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a 2D square lattice of approximately 80 sites. Using site-resolved imaging, we detect (finite-size) antiferromagnetic long-range order (LRO) through the development of a peak in the spin structure factor and the divergence of the correlation length that reaches the size of the system. At our lowest temperature of T/t = 0.25(2) we find strong order across the entire sample. Our experimental platform enables doping away from half filling, where pseudogap states and stripe ordering are expected, but theoretical methods become numerically intractable. In this regime we find that the antiferromagnetic LRO persists to hole dopings of about 15%, providing a guideline for computational methods. Our results demonstrate that quantum gas microscopy of ultracold fermions in optical lattices can now address open questions on the low-temperature Hubbard model."

Three papers in this issue present a wealth of new Zika virus (ZIKV) genome sequences and further insights into the genetic epidemiology of ZIKV. Nathan Grubaugh et al. provide 39 new ZIKV genome sequences from infected patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Florida. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the virus has been introduced on multiple separate occasions, probably linked to travel from the Caribbean. They find a low probability of long-term persistence of ZIKV transmission chains within Florida, suggesting that the potential for future ZIKV outbreaks there will depend on transmission dynamics in the Americas. Nuno Faria et al. and Hayden Metsky et al. reconstruct the spread of ZIKV in Brazil and the Americas. Faria et al. provide 54 new ZIKV genomes, several sequenced in real time in a mobile genomics laboratory. They trace the spatial origins and spread of ZIKV in Brazil and the Americas and date the timing of the international spread of ZIKV from Brazil. They find that northeast Brazil had a crucial role in the establishment of the epidemic and the spread of the virus within Brazil and the Americas. Metsky et al. generate 110 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from ten regions. They also see rapid expansion of the epidemic within Brazil and multiple introductions to other geographic areas. In agreement with Faria et al., they find that ZIKV circulated unobserved for many months before transmission was detected. Metsky et al. additionally describe ZIKV evolution and discuss how the accumulation of mutations might affect the performance of diagnostic tests in the future. Transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas was first confirmed in May 2015 in northeast Brazil1. Brazil has had the highest number of reported ZIKV cases worldwide (more than 200,000 by 24 December 20162) and the most cases associated with microcephaly and other birth defects (2,366 confirmed by 31 December 20162). Since the initial detection of ZIKV in Brazil, more than 45 countries in the Americas have reported local ZIKV transmission, with 24 of these reporting severe ZIKV-associated disease3. However, the origin and epidemic history of ZIKV in Brazil and the Americas remain poorly understood, despite the value of this information for interpreting observed trends in reported microcephaly. Here we address this issue by generating 54 complete or partial ZIKV genomes, mostly from Brazil, and reporting data generated by a mobile genomics laboratory that travelled across northeast Brazil in 2016. One sequence represents the earliest confirmed ZIKV infection in Brazil. Analyses of viral genomes with ecological and epidemiological data yield an estimate that ZIKV was present in northeast Brazil by February 2014 and is likely to have disseminated from there, nationally and internationally, before the first detection of ZIKV in the Americas. Estimated dates for the international spread of ZIKV from Brazil indicate the duration of pre-detection cryptic transmission in recipient regions. The role of northeast Brazil in the establishment of ZIKV in the Americas is further supported by geographic analysis of ZIKV transmission potential and by estimates of the basic reproduction number of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2618233912,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone with essential roles in regulating insulin secretion, carbohydrate metabolism and appetite. GLP-1 effects are mediated through binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals primarily through the stimulatory G protein Gs. Class B GPCRs are important therapeutic targets; however, our understanding of their mechanism of action is limited by the lack of structural information on activated and full-length receptors. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the peptide-activated GLP-1R-Gs complex at near atomic resolution. The peptide is clasped between the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane core of the receptor, and further stabilized by extracellular loops. Conformational changes in the transmembrane domain result in a sharp kink in the middle of transmembrane helix 6, which pivots its intracellular half outward to accommodate the Î±5-helix of the Ras-like domain of Gs. These results provide a structural framework for understanding class B GPCR activation through hormone binding."

Although the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas and its link to birth defects have attracted a great deal of attention1,2, much remains unknown about ZIKV disease epidemiology and ZIKV evolution, in part owing to a lack of genomic data. Here we address this gap in knowledge by using multiple sequencing approaches to generate 110 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analysed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions; our phylogenetic evidence suggests rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil and multiple introductions of outbreak strains into Puerto Rico, Honduras, Colombia, other Caribbean islands, and the continental United States. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in multiple regions for many months before the first locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the importance of surveillance of viral infections. We identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis, as well as those that might be relevant to the effectiveness of diagnostic tests."
https://openalex.org/W2617274523,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is causing an unprecedented epidemic linked to severe congenital abnormalities. In July 2016, mosquito-borne ZIKV transmission was reported in the continental United States; since then, hundreds of locally acquired infections have been reported in Florida. To gain insights into the timing, source, and likely route(s) of ZIKV introduction, we tracked the virus from its first detection in Florida by sequencing ZIKV genomes from infected patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We show that at least 4 introductions, but potentially as many as 40, contributed to the outbreak in Florida and that local transmission is likely to have started in the spring of 2016-several months before its initial detection. By analysing surveillance and genetic data, we show that ZIKV moved among transmission zones in Miami. Our analyses show that most introductions were linked to the Caribbean, a finding corroborated by the high incidence rates and traffic volumes from the region into the Miami area. Our study provides an understanding of how ZIKV initiates transmission in new regions."
https://openalex.org/W2614915054,"Many animals keep track of their angular heading over time while navigating through their environment. However, a neural-circuit architecture for computing heading has not been experimentally defined in any species. Here we describe a set of clockwise- and anticlockwise-shifting neurons in the Drosophila central complex whose wiring and physiology provide a means to rotate an angular heading estimate based on the fly's angular velocity. We show that each class of shifting neurons exists in two subtypes, with spatiotemporal activity profiles that suggest different roles for each subtype at the start and end of tethered-walking turns. Shifting neurons are required for the heading system to properly track the fly's heading in the dark, and stimulation of these neurons induces predictable shifts in the heading signal. The central features of this biological circuit are analogous to those of computational models proposed for head-direction cells in rodents and may shed light on how neural systems, in general, perform integration."

https://openalex.org/W2620252718,"Buddhist-derived meditation practices are currently being employed as a popular form of health promotion. While meditation programs draw inspiration from Buddhist textual sources for the benefits of meditation, these sources also acknowledge a wide range of other effects beyond health-related outcomes. The Varieties of Contemplative Experience study investigates meditation-related experiences that are typically underreported, particularly experiences that are described as challenging, difficult, distressing, functionally impairing, and/or requiring additional support. A mixed-methods approach featured qualitative interviews with Western Buddhist meditation practitioners and experts in TheravÄda, Zen, and Tibetan traditions. Interview questions probed meditation experiences and influencing factors, including interpretations and management strategies. A follow-up survey provided quantitative assessments of causality, impairment and other demographic and practice-related variables. The content-driven thematic analysis of interviews yielded a taxonomy of 59 meditation-related experiences across 7 domains: cognitive, perceptual, affective, somatic, conative, sense of self, and social. Even in cases where the phenomenology was similar across participants, interpretations of and responses to the experiences differed considerably. The associated valence ranged from very positive to very negative, and the associated level of distress and functional impairment ranged from minimal and transient to severe and enduring. In order to determine what factors may influence the valence, impact, and response to any given experience, the study also identified 26 categories of influencing factors across 4 domains: practitioner-level factors, practice-level factors, relationships, and health behaviors. By identifying a broader range of experiences associated with meditation, along with the factors that contribute to the presence and management of experiences reported as challenging, difficult, distressing or functionally impairing, this study aims to increase our understanding of the effects of contemplative practices and to provide resources for mediators, clinicians, meditation researchers, and meditation teachers."
https://openalex.org/W2618352462,"Menopause is associated with bone loss and enhanced visceral adiposity. A polyclonal antibody that targets the Î²-subunit of the pituitary hormone follicle-stimulating hormone (Fsh) increases bone mass in mice. Here, we report that this antibody sharply reduces adipose tissue in wild-type mice, phenocopying genetic haploinsufficiency for the Fsh receptor gene Fshr. The antibody also causes profound beiging, increases cellular mitochondrial density, activates brown adipose tissue and enhances thermogenesis. These actions result from the specific binding of the antibody to the Î²-subunit of Fsh to block its action. Our studies uncover opportunities for simultaneously treating obesity and osteoporosis. An antibody against the pituitary hormone Fsh reduces adiposity and increases thermogenesis in ovariectomized mice or mice fed a high-fat diet. Menopause is associated with bone loss and enhanced build-up of abdominal fat. Previously, Mone Zaidi and colleagues showed that an antibody against the pituitary hormone Fsh increases bone mass in mice. In this paper, they show that this antibody also reduces fatty tissue in mice that have had their ovaries removed or mice on a high fat diet. The anti-obesity effect is accompanied by increases in UCP1 expression and thermogenesis in brown and beige fat, increased whole-body oxygen consumption rate and physical activity. The authors suggest that these findings could open up opportunities for combined treatment of obesity and osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2619620886,"Metabolic reprogramming by oncogenic signals promotes cancer initiation and progression. The oncogene KRAS and tumour suppressor STK11, which encodes the kinase LKB1, regulate metabolism and are frequently mutated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Concurrent occurrence of oncogenic KRAS and loss of LKB1 (KL) in cells specifies aggressive oncological behaviour. Here we show that human KL cells and tumours share metabolomic signatures of perturbed nitrogen handling. KL cells express the urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS1), which produces carbamoyl phosphate in the mitochondria from ammonia and bicarbonate, initiating nitrogen disposal. Transcription of CPS1 is suppressed by LKB1 through AMPK, and CPS1 expression correlates inversely with LKB1 in human NSCLC. Silencing CPS1 in KL cells induces cell death and reduces tumour growth. Notably, cell death results from pyrimidine depletion rather than ammonia toxicity, as CPS1 enables an unconventional pathway of nitrogen flow from ammonia into pyrimidines. CPS1 loss reduces the pyrimidine to purine ratio, compromises S-phase progression and induces DNA-polymerase stalling and DNA damage. Exogenous pyrimidines reverse DNA damage and rescue growth. The data indicate that the KL oncological genotype imposes a metabolic vulnerability related to a dependence on a cross-compartmental pathway of pyrimidine metabolism in an aggressive subset of NSCLC."

https://openalex.org/W2616877598,"Gene translation depends on accurate decoding of mRNA, the structural mechanism of which remains poorly understood. Ribosomes decode mRNA codons by selecting cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs delivered by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Here we present high-resolution structural ensembles of ribosomes with cognate or near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs delivered by EF-Tu. Both cognate and near-cognate tRNA anticodons explore the aminoacyl-tRNA-binding site (A site) of an open 30S subunit, while inactive EF-Tu is separated from the 50S subunit. A transient conformation of decoding-centre nucleotide G530 stabilizes the cognate codon-anticodon helix, initiating step-wise 'latching' of the decoding centre. The resulting closure of the 30S subunit docks EF-Tu at the sarcin-ricin loop of the 50S subunit, activating EF-Tu for GTP hydrolysis and enabling accommodation of the aminoacyl-tRNA. By contrast, near-cognate complexes fail to induce the G530 latch, thus favouring open 30S pre-accommodation intermediates with inactive EF-Tu. This work reveals long-sought structural differences between the pre-accommodation of cognate and near-cognate tRNAs that elucidate the mechanism of accurate decoding."
https://openalex.org/W2618808078,"Four galaxies discovered near quasars at redshifts exceeding 6 have star-formation rates that are high enough to explain the massive elliptical galaxies known to exist at redshifts of about 4. Giant elliptical galaxies have already been observed in place at a redshift of 4. This necessitates the existence of galaxies at higher redshifts forming stars at extremely high rates, but such galaxies have hitherto not been seen. Roberto Decarli et al. report the discovery of four galaxies sitting next to the host galaxies of quasars at redshifts exceeding 6 and forming stars at the requisite rates. Simulations of galaxy and structure formation did not predict the presence of such galaxies, and they were found by accident as part of a study of quasar hosts. If these galaxies are representative of a previously unseen population, the frequency is high enough to explain the massive elliptical galaxies. The existence of massive (1011 solar masses) elliptical galaxies by redshift z â 4 (refs 1, 2, 3; when the Universe was 1.5 billion years old) necessitates the presence of galaxies with star-formation rates exceeding 100 solar masses per year at z > 6 (corresponding to an age of the Universe of less than 1 billion years). Surveys have discovered hundreds of galaxies at these early cosmic epochs, but their star-formation rates are more than an order of magnitude lower4. The only known galaxies with very high star-formation rates at z > 6 are, with one exception5, the host galaxies of quasars6,7,8,9, but these galaxies also host accreting supermassive (more than 109 solar masses) black holes, which probably affect the properties of the galaxies. Here we report observations of an emission line of singly ionized carbon ([C ii] at a wavelength of 158 micrometres) in four galaxies at z > 6 that are companions of quasars, with velocity offsets of less than 600 kilometres per second and linear offsets of less than 100 kiloparsecs. The discovery of these four galaxies was serendipitous; they are close to their companion quasars and appear bright in the far-infrared. On the basis of the [C ii] measurements, we estimate star-formation rates in the companions of more than 100 solar masses per year. These sources are similar to the host galaxies of the quasars in [C ii] brightness, linewidth and implied dynamical mass, but do not show evidence for accreting supermassive black holes. Similar systems have previously been found at lower redshift10,11,12. We find such close companions in four out of the twenty-five z > 6 quasars surveyed, a fraction that needs to be accounted for in simulations13,14. If they are representative of the bright end of the [C ii] luminosity function, then they can account for the population of massive elliptical galaxies at z â 4 in terms of the density of cosmic space."
https://openalex.org/W2619083187,"The chemoattractant S1P is identified as an extrinsic factor that supports naive T cell survival, and acts via a signalling mechanism to maintain mitochondrial content and function. Susan Schwab and colleagues identify sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signalling through the S1P1 receptor (S1P1R) as a novel survival factor for naive T cells. A diverse T cell repertoire is required to mount an effective immune response against foreign peptides. S1P is secreted by lymphatic endothelial cells and stimulates S1P1R on T cells, acting via a mechanism that serves to maintain mitochondrial content. This pathway may provide a therapeutic target for inhibiting self-reactive T cell trafficking. Effective adaptive immune responses require a large repertoire of naive T cells that migrate throughout the body, rapidly identifying almost any foreign peptide1. Because the production of T cells declines with age, naive T cells must be long-lived2. However, it remains unclear how naive T cells survive for years while constantly travelling. The chemoattractant sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) guides T cell circulation among secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen, lymph nodes and Peyerâs patches, where T cells search for antigens. The concentration of S1P is higher in circulatory fluids than in lymphoid organs, and the S1P1 receptor (S1P1R) directs the exit of T cells from the spleen into blood, and from lymph nodes and Peyerâs patches into lymph3. Here we show that S1P is essential not only for the circulation of naive T cells, but also for their survival. Using transgenic mouse models, we demonstrate that lymphatic endothelial cells support the survival of T cells by secreting S1P via the transporter SPNS2, that this S1P signals through S1P1R on T cells, and that the requirement for S1P1R is independent of the established role of the receptor in guiding exit from lymph nodes. S1P signalling maintains the mitochondrial content of naive T cells, providing cells with the energy to continue their constant migration. The S1P signalling pathway is being targeted therapeutically to inhibit autoreactive T cell trafficking, and these findings suggest that it may be possible simultaneously to target autoreactive or malignant cell survival4."

https://openalex.org/W2617821883,"While the impacts of climate change on individual species and communities have been well documented there is little evidence on climate-mediated changes for entire ecosystems. Pristine alpine environments can provide unique insights into natural, physical and ecological response to climate change yet broad scale and long-term studies on these potential 'ecosystem sentinels' are scarce. We addressed this issue by examining cover changes of 1689 high-elevation wetlands (temporarily or perennial water-saturated grounds) in the Bolivian Cordillera Real, a region that has experienced significant warming and glacier melting over the last 30 years. We combined high spatial resolution satellite images from PLEIADES with the long-term images archive from LANDSAT to 1) examine environmental factors (e.g., glacier cover, wetland and watershed size) that affected wetland cover changes, and 2) identify wetlands' features that affect their vulnerability (using habitat drying as a proxy) in the face of climate change. Over the (1984-2011) period, our data showed an increasing trend in the mean wetland total area and number, mainly related to the appearance of wet grassland patches during the wetter years. Wetland cover also showed high inter-annual variability and their area for a given year was positively correlated to precipitation intensities in the three months prior to the image date. Also, round wetlands located in highly glacierized catchments were less prone to drying, while relatively small wetlands with irregularly shaped contours suffered the highest rates of drying over the last three decades. High Andean wetlands can therefore be considered as ecosystem sentinels for climate change, as they seem sensitive to glacier melting. Beyond the specific focus of this study, our work illustrates how satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem sentinels can help filling the lack of information on the ecological consequences of current and changing climate conditions, a common and crucial issue especially in less-developed countries."

Hence, knowledge of periodontal status during pregnancy and postpartum is important in order to reduce the risks of both diseases. This study aimed to analyze periodontal status at successive stages of pregnancy and 3â6 weeks postpartum in women with initial periodontal alterations. Materials and methods Ninety-six pregnant women were examined at 8â10 weeks (pregnancy diagnosis, baseline), 21â23 weeks and 34â36 weeks of gestation and at 40 days postpartum to record plaque scores, clinically assessed gingival inflammation and probing depth (mean depth and % sites with depth >3 mm). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Type 1 (Î±) error was established at 0.05 Results Plaque Index increased (p = 0.043) throughout pregnancy (baseline, 42%Â±0.18); 21â23 weeks, 42.6%Â±0.14; 34â36 weeks, 45.6%Â±0.13 and decreased postpartum (44.8%Â±0â13). Gingival Index increased (p<0.001) throughout pregnancy (baseline, 56.7%Â±0.20; 21â23 weeks, 66.36%Â±0.17; 34â36 weeks, 74.5%Â±0.18) and decreased postpartum (59.3%Â±0.21). Probing Depth increased (p<0.001) throughout pregnancy (baseline, 2.51Â±0.05; 21â23 weeks, 2.63Â±0.053; 34â36 weeks 2.81Â±0.055) and decreased postpartum (2.54Â±0.049). Percentage of sites with Probing Depth >3 mm increased (p<0.001) throughout pregnancy (baseline, 17.6%Â±0.16; 21â23 weeks, 23.9%Â±0.17; 34â36 weeks, 31.1%Â±0.17) and decreased postpartum (21.2%Â±0.17) but remained significantly (p<0.02) higher than at baseline.

https://openalex.org/W2619553679,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) are Ca2+-mobilizing messengers important for modulating cardiac excitationâcontraction coupling and pathophysiology. CD38, which belongs to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family, catalyzes synthesis of both NAADP and cADPR in vitro. However, it remains unclear whether this is the main enzyme for their production under physiological conditions. Here we show that membrane fractions from WT but not CD38â/â mouse hearts supported NAADP and cADPR synthesis. Membrane permeabilization of cardiac myocytes with saponin and/or Triton X-100 increased NAADP synthesis, indicating that intracellular CD38 contributes to NAADP production. The permeabilization also permitted immunostaining of CD38, with a striated pattern in WT myocytes, whereas CD38â/â myocytes and nonpermeabilized WT myocytes showed little or no staining, without striation. A component of Î²-adrenoreceptor signaling in the heart involves NAADP and lysosomes. Accordingly, in the presence of isoproterenol, Ca2+ transients and contraction amplitudes were smaller in CD38â/â myocytes than in the WT. In addition, suppressing lysosomal function with bafilomycin A1 reduced the isoproterenol-induced increase in Ca2+ transients in cardiac myocytes from WT but not CD38â/â mice. Whole hearts isolated from CD38â/â mice and exposed to isoproterenol showed reduced arrhythmias. SAN4825, an ADP-ribosyl cyclase inhibitor that reduces cADPR and NAADP synthesis in mouse membrane fractions, was shown to bind to CD38 in docking simulations and reduced the isoproterenol-induced arrhythmias in WT hearts. These observations support generation of NAADP and cADPR by intracellular CD38, which contributes to effects of Î²-adrenoreceptor stimulation to increase both Ca2+ transients and the tendency to disturb heart rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W2617392833,"Identifying children at risk of developing childhood sarcopenic obesity often requires specialized equipment and costly testing procedures, so cheaper and quicker methods would be advantageous, especially in field-based settings. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between the muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR) and relative handgrip strength, and to determine the ability of handgrip strength relative to body mass index (grip-to-BMI) to identify children who are at risk of developing sarcopenic obesity. Grip-to-BMI was measured in 730 Czech children (4 to 14 yrs). Bioelectrical impedance was used to estimate body fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, from which the MFR was calculated. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.791 (95% CI 0.692-0.890, p Ë 0.001) in girls 4-9; 0.789 (95% CI 0.688-0.890, p Ë 0.001) in girls 10-14 years old; 0.719 (95% CI 0.607-0.831, p = 0.001) in boys 4-9; and 0.896 (95% CI 0.823-0.969, p Ë 0.001) in boys 10-14 years old.

https://openalex.org/W2619097492,"We have previously established that adipose tissue adjacent to breast tumors becomes inflamed by tumor-derived cytokines. This stimulates autotaxin (ATX) secretion from adipocytes, whereas breast cancer cells produce insignificant ATX. Lysophosphatidate produced by ATX promotes inflammatory cytokine secretion in a vicious inflammatory cycle, which increases tumor growth and metastasis and decreases response to chemotherapy. We hypothesized that damage to adipose tissue during radiotherapy for breast cancer should promote lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling and further inflammatory signaling, which could potentially protect cancer cells from subsequent fractions of radiation therapy. To test this hypothesis, we exposed rat and human adipose tissue to radiation doses (0.25â5 Gy) that were expected during radiotherapy. This exposure increased mRNA levels for ATX, cyclooxygenase-2, IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-10, TNF-Î±, and LPA1 and LPA2 receptors by 1.8- to 5.1-fold after 4 to 48 h. There were also 1.5- to 2.5-fold increases in the secretion of ATX and 14 inflammatory mediators after irradiating at 1 Gy. Inhibition of the radiation-induced activation of NF-ÎºB, cyclooxygenase-2, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, or ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein blocked inflammatory responses to Î³-radiation. Consequently, collateral damage to adipose tissue during radiotherapy could establish a comprehensive wound-healing response that involves increased signaling by LPA, cyclooxygenase-2, and other inflammatory mediators that could decrease the efficacy of further radiotherapy or chemotherapy.âMeng, G., Tang, X., Yang, Z., Benesch, M.

More than 100 CYP21A2 variants give rise to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). We previously reported a structure of WT human P450 21A2 with bound progesterone and now present a structure bound to the other substrate (17Î±-OH-progesterone).

https://openalex.org/W2619853343,"Metalloenzymes catalyze complex and essential processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen fixation. For example, bacteria and archaea use [NiFe]-hydrogenases to catalyze the uptake and release of molecular hydrogen (H2). [NiFe]-hydrogenases are redox enzymes composed of a large subunit that harbors a NiFe(CN)2CO metallo-center and a small subunit with three ironâsulfur clusters. The large subunit is synthesized with a C-terminal extension, cleaved off by a specific endopeptidase during maturation. The exact role of the C-terminal extension has remained elusive; however, cleavage takes place exclusively after assembly of the [NiFe]-cofactor and before large and small subunits form the catalytically active heterodimer. To unravel the functional role of the C-terminal extension, we used an enzymatic in vitro maturation assay that allows synthesizing functional [NiFe]-hydrogenase-2 of Escherichia coli from purified components. The maturation process included formation and insertion of the NiFe(CN)2CO cofactor into the large subunit, endoproteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal extension, and dimerization with the small subunit. Biochemical and spectroscopic analysis indicated that the C-terminal extension of the large subunit is essential for recognition by the maturation machinery. Only upon completion of cofactor insertion was removal of the C-terminal extension observed. Our results indicate that endoproteolytic cleavage is a central checkpoint in the maturation process. Here, cleavage temporally orchestrates cofactor insertion and protein assembly and ensures that only cofactor-containing protein can continue along the assembly line toward functional [NiFe]-hydrogenase."

In addition to these core symptoms, atypical sensory responses are prevalent in the ASC phenotype. Here we investigated anomalous perception, i.e. hallucinatory and/or out of body experiences in adults with ASC. Thirty participants with an ASC diagnosis and thirty neurotypical controls completed the Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2). The CAPS is a 32-item questionnaire that asks participants to indicate whether or not they experience a range of anomalous and out of body experiences, and to rate how intrusive and distressing these experiences are. The SRS-2 asks participants to rate the extent to which they identify with a series of 65 statements that describe behaviours associated with the autism phenotype. We found that total CAPS score was significantly higher in the participants with ASC (mean = 14.8, S.D. = 7.9) than the participants without ASC (mean = 3.6, S.D. = 4.1). In addition, the frequency of anomalous perception, the level of distraction and the level of distress associated with the experience were significantly increased in participants with ASC. Importantly, both the frequency of anomalous perceptual experiences and the level of distress caused by anomalous perception in this sample of adults with ASC were very similar to that reported previously in a sample of non-autistic participants who were being treated in hospital for a current psychotic episode. These data indicate that anomalous perceptual experiences are common in adults with ASC and are associated with a high level of distress. The origins of anomalous perception in ASC and the implication of this phenomenon are considered."

Our goal was to determine the effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in treating SSc-ILD in a retrospective study. Methods A retrospective, computer-assisted search was performed to identify patients with SSc-ILD treated with MMF from 1997 through 2014. We used a novel software tool, Computer-Aided Lung Informatics for Pathology Evaluation and Rating (CALIPER), to quantify parenchymal lung abnormalities on high-resolution computed tomography. Lung function was evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months of MMF therapy. Results We identified 46 patients (28 females) with SSc-ILD (mean age at diagnosis 55 y) treated with MMF for at least 1 year (majority on 2 gm/day). Twenty-one patients (45.7%) stopped using MMF during the follow up period after the first 12 months, and they took MMF for a median of 2.12 years (range, 0.91â8.93 years). Only 4 discontinued MMF because of disease progression. Compared to baseline, the mean percentage change in forced vital capacity (95% CI) at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, was 1.01% (â2.38%-4.39%) (n = 26), 2.06% (â1.09%-5.22%) (n = 31), and â0.07% (â3.31%-3.17%) (n = 30), and the mean percentage change in ILD as measured by CALIPER (95% CI) was â5.40% (â18.62%-7.83%) (n = 18), â1.51% (â14.69%-11.68%) (n = 17), and â8.35% (â20.71%-4.02%) (n = 22).The mean right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) remained stable over the study period. Conclusions MMF is well tolerated and slows the rate of decline in lung function in SSc-ILD patients, even at doses lower at 3 g/day."
https://openalex.org/W2619073386,"The phylum Placozoa holds a key position for our understanding of the evolution of mitochondrial genomes in Metazoa. Placozoans possess large mitochondrial genomes which harbor several remarkable characteristics such as a fragmented cox1 gene and trans-splicing cox1 introns. A previous study also suggested the existence of cox1 mRNA editing in Trichoplax adhaerens, yet the only formally described species in the phylum Placozoa. We have analyzed RNA-seq data of the undescribed sister species, Placozoa sp. H2 (""Panama"" clone), with special focus on the mitochondrial mRNA. While we did not find support for a previously postulated cox1 mRNA editing mechanism, we surprisingly found two independent transcripts representing intermediate cox1 mRNA splicing stages. Both transcripts consist of partial cox1 exon as well as overlapping intron fragments. The data suggest that the cox1 gene harbors a single base pair (cytosine) micro exon. Furthermore, conserved group I intron structures flank this unique micro exon also in other placozoans. We discuss the evolutionary origin of this micro exon in the context of a self-splicing intron gain in the cox1 gene of the last common ancestor of extant placozoans."

https://openalex.org/W2619539185,"Introduction Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is of growing concern globally. The risk for transmission of antimicrobial resistant organisms across several continents to the Caribbean is a real one given its tourism industry. After a cluster of cases of CRKP were detected, several studies detailed in this report were initiated to better characterize the problem. Methods A hospital-wide point prevalence study and active surveillance were performed at Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Barbados in 2013 to assess the prevalence of CRKP infection/colonization. Following this, a 1-year longitudinal study measured the prevalence of CRKP isolates in the hospital and across all healthcare facilities in the country. Results In 2013, eleven viable isolates of CRKP from cluster of cases were sent for molecular epidemiology studies. When sequenced, they were found to be the ST-258 clone. Identification of a cluster of cases of CRKP ST-258/512 clones indicated person-to-person transmission. In September 2013, the hospital-wide point prevalence study revealed 18% of patients (53/299) at the hospital were either colonized or infected with CRKP. The infection to colonization ratio was 1:7. Patients who were infected/colonized vs. non-colonized were older (64.7 vs. 48.7 years, p<0.0001), were hospitalized longer (42.5 days vs. 27 days, p = 0.0042), were more likely to have an invasive device (66% vs. 32%, p<0.0001), especially urinary catheters (55% vs. 24%, p<0.0001), and were more likely to have used antimicrobials within the prior 14 days (91% vs. 46%, p<0.0001). Specific antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones and piperacillin-tazobactam, were significantly associated with infection/colonization. In 2014, the 12-month period prevalence of CRKP in Barbados was 49.6 per 100,000 population and of blood stream infections was 3.2 per 100,000 population. Conclusions This point prevalence study identified patients at-risk of acquisition of CRKP and allowed QEH to implement interventions aimed at decreasing the prevalence of CRKP. Organization of a National and regional Infection Prevention and Control Committee in 2014 aimed to strengthen antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs across the English-speaking Caribbean were established."
https://openalex.org/W2619560542,"Figs (Ficus sp.) are often considered as keystone resources which strongly influence tropical forest ecosystems. We used long-term tree-census data to track the population dynamics of two abundant free-standing fig species, Ficus insipida and F. yoponensis, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), a 15.6-km2 island in Lake GatÃºn, Panama. Vegetation cover on BCI consists of a mosaic of old growth (>400 years) and maturing (about 90â150 year old) secondary rainforest. Locations and conditions of fig trees have been mapped and monitored on BCI for more than 35 years (1973â2011), with a focus on the Lutz Catchment area (25 ha). The original distribution of the fig trees shortly after the construction of the Panama Canal was derived from an aerial photograph from 1927 and was compared with previous land use and forest status. The distribution of both fig species (~850 trees) is restricted to secondary forest. Of the original 119 trees observed in Lutz Catchment in 1973, >70% of F. insipida and >90% of F. yoponensis had died by 2011. Observations in other areas on BCI support the trend of declining free-standing figs. We interpret the decline of these figs on BCI as a natural process within a maturing tropical lowland forest. Senescence of the fig trees appears to have been accelerated by severe droughts such as the strong El NiÃ±o event in the year 1982/83. Because figs form such an important food resource for frugivores, this shift in resource availability is likely to have cascading effects on frugivore populations."
https://openalex.org/W2618614275,"Accounting for the interannual climatic variations is a well-known issue for simulation-based studies of environmental systems. It often requires intensive sampling (e.g., averaging the simulation outputs over many climatic series), which hinders many sequential processes, in particular optimization algorithms. We propose here an approach based on a subset selection in a large basis of climatic series, using an ad-hoc similarity function and clustering. A non-parametric reconstruction technique is introduced to estimate accurately the distribution of the output of interest using only the subset sampling. The proposed strategy is non-intrusive and generic (i.e. transposable to most models with climatic data inputs), and can be combined to most âoff-the-shelfâ optimization solvers. We apply our approach to sunflower ideotype design using the crop model SUNFLO. The underlying optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective one to account for risk-aversion. Our approach achieves good performances even for limited computational budgets, outperforming significantly standard strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2616279265,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) that is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, is recognized to be a major molecular chaperone. We have previously reported that prostaglandin F2Î± (PGF2Î±), a potent bone remodeling mediator, stimulates the synthesis of interleukin-6 (IL-6) through p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and p38 MAP kinase in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells, and that Rho-kinase acts at a point upstream of p38 MAP kinase. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of HSP90 in the PGF2Î±-stimulated IL-6 synthesis and the underlying mechanism in MC3T3-E1 cells. Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90, significantly amplified both the PGF2Î±-stimulated IL-6 release and the mRNA expression levels. In addition, other HSP90 inhibitors, 17-allylamino-17demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG) and 17-dimethylamino-ethylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-DMAG) and onalespib, enhanced the PGF2Î±-stimulated IL-6 release. Geldanamycin, 17-AAG and onalespib markedly strengthened the PGF2Î±-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Geldanamycin and 17-AAG did not affect the PGF2Î±-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT-1), a substrate of Rho-kinase, and the protein levels of RhoA and Rho-kinase. In addition, HSP90-siRNA enhanced the PGF2Î±-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, significantly suppressed the amplification by geldanamycin, 17-AAG or 17-DMAG of the PGF2Î±-stimulated IL-6 release. Our results strongly suggest that HSP90 negatively regulates the PGF2Î±-stimulated IL-6 synthesis in osteoblasts, and that the effect of HSP90 is exerted through regulating p38 MAP kinase activation."

Between 2010 and 2015, it displayed two epidemic waves annually among school populations in Shenzhen, China. However, their transmission dynamics remain unclear and there is no school-based vaccination programme in Shenzhen to-date. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to compare a school-based vaccination intervention scenario with a baseline (i.e. no intervention) scenario.Data on varicella reported cases were downloaded from the Infectious Disease Reporting Information Management System. We obtained the population size, age structure of children aged 15 or under, the class and school distribution from Shenzhen Education Bureau. We developed an Agent-Based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (ABM-SEIR) Model that considered within-class, class-to-class and out-of-school transmission modes. The intervention scenario was that school-wide vaccination intervention occurred when an outbreak threshold was reached within a school. We varied this threshold level from five to ten cases. We compared the reduction of disease outbreak size and estimated the key epidemiological parameters under the intervention strategy.Our ABM-SEIR model provided a good model fit to the two annual varicella epidemic waves from 2013 to 2015. The transmission dynamics displayed strong seasonality. Our results suggested that a school-based vaccination strategy could effectively prevent large outbreaks at different thresholds.There was a considerable increase in reported varicella cases from 2013 to 2015 in Shenzhen. Our modelling study provided important theoretical support for disease control decision making during school outbreaks and the development of a school-based vaccination programme."

https://openalex.org/W2619253934,"In order to supply optimum water to restore reed wetlands used for bird habitats, a field investigation and greenhouse experiment were conducted. Three water supplementation stages (early stage at 20 May, middle stage at 20 July and later stage at 20 September, respectively) and five depths (0, 10, 15, 20 and 35 cm over the surface, respectively) were established, with three replicates for each treatment combination. Reed growth characteristics (survival rate, height, density and biomass) and soil properties of field investigation and experiment were recorded to determine the impacts of water supplementation on reed wetland restoration. The field investigation showed that reeds in natural wetlands grow better than those in degraded wetlands and soil properties in degraded wetlands were significantly different from soils in natural wetlands. With freshwater supplementation, reed growth characteristics and soil properties greatly improved. As water depth increased, reed growth decreased gradually. Reeds grew best in shallow water depth (â¦10cm) than in the greater flooding depths. Saturated soils with no standing water at the early stage of reed growth increased reed survival and water depth can be increased as the reeds grow. During the process of water supplementation, soil salinity was reduced significantly. Soil salinity was reduced dramatically at early and middle stages of reed growth, but it increased slightly at the later stage. Soil pH increased greatly during the experiment. Soil total nitrogen (TN) and total organic carbon (TOC) showed contrasting changes, with soil TN decreasing and TOC increasing. To best manage reed wetlands restoration, we suggest saturating wetland in the spring to stimulate reed germination, increasing surface water depth up to 15cm at the stage of reed rapid growth, and then reducing water depth during the later growth stage."

Transcriptional initiation therefore requires numerous general transcriptional factors and cofactors that associate with pol II at the core promoter to form a pre-initiation complex. Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is a general cofactor that binds TFIID and stabilizes the TFIIDâDNA complex during transcription initiation. Previous studies showed that TFIIA can make contact with the DNA sequence upstream or downstream of the TATA box, and that the region bound by TFIIA could overlap with the elements recognized by another factor, TFIIB, at adenovirus major late core promoter. Whether core promoters contain a DNA motif recognized by TFIIA remains unknown. Here we have identified a core promoter element upstream of the TATA box that is recognized by TFIIA. A search of the human promoter database revealed that many natural promoters contain a TFIIA recognition element (IIARE). We show that the IIARE enhances TFIIA-promoter binding and enhances the activity of TATA-containing promoters, but represses or activates promoters that lack a TATA box.

Genome-wide studies have revealed that many genes lack so-called âcanonicalâ core promoter elements, suggesting that other core promoter elements remain to be discovered. Indeed, a recent study showed that the core promoter element, DTIE, directs transcription start site selection of genes with TATA-less promoters (12.Marbach-Bar N. Bahat A. Ashkenazi S.

DTIE, a novel core promoter element that directs start site selection in TATA-less genes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 1080-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been proposed that core promoter elements may not be essential for transcription of some genes in vivo (13.Barbash Z.S. Weissman J.D. Campbell Jr., J.A. Mu J. Singer D.S. Major histocompatibility complex class I core promoter elements are not essential for transcription in vivo.Mol. Cell.

It has been shown that many ânoncanonicalâ promoters instead contain epigenetic marks including histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and DNA marks such as enhancers, CpG islands, and ATG deserts (14.Voigt P.

The mechanisms by which canonical or noncanonical core promoters regulate transcriptional initiation are not fully understood. Transcription factor TFIIA comprises three subunits, Î±, Î², and Î³; TFIIAÎ±/Î² and TFIIAÎ³ are encoded by different genes (17.DeJong J. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G.

Although TFIIA was originally characterized as a general transcription factor, TFIIA is dispensable in transcription in vitro (25.Van Dyke M.W. Roeder R.G. Sawadogo M.

TFIIA can counteract the inhibitory roles of TAF1 and BTAF1 during TBP binding to the TATA box as well as the repressive effects of NC2 and HMGB1 on transcription (27.Xie J. Collart M. Lemaire M.

TFIIA stabilizes the TBPâTATA box complex through direct contact on the face of TBP opposite to the TFIIB-binding side (39.Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

Sigler P.B. Crystal structure of the yeast TFIIA/TBP/DNA complex.Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In our previous work, mutations of BRE consensus bases within the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter inhibit the formation of TFIIAâTBPâDNA complexes, suggesting that a sequence-specific TFIIA DNA-binding region might overlap with the sequence of the BRE (45.Deng W. MalecovÃ¡ B. OelgeschlÃ¤ger T. Roberts S.G. TFIIB recognition elements control the TFIIA-NC2 axis in transcriptional regulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that TFIIA makes direct contact with the sequence immediately upstream of the TATA box at the AdML promoter using combined molecular approaches. Using this information, we identified a core promoter element upstream of the TATA box that is recognized by TFIIA. We show that the TFIIA recognition element regulates transcription activity in a promoter context-dependent manner and determine the mechanism by which the TFIIA recognition element regulates transcription at the AdML promoter. Our previous work showed that mutations of BREu and BREd consensus bases within the AdML promoter (AdML-mBREud, Fig. 1A) inhibit formation of a TFIIAâTBPâDNA complex when compared with wild type AdML promoter, suggesting that a TFIIA DNA-binding region could overlap with the BREu or BREd of the AdML promoter (45.Deng W. MalecovÃ¡ B. OelgeschlÃ¤ger T. Roberts S.G. TFIIB recognition elements control the TFIIA-NC2 axis in transcriptional regulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that mutations of BREud consensus bases might affect TBP binding to the promoter DNA, bandshift assays were performed using TBP and radiolabeled promoter DNA fragments. As shown in Fig. 1B, the formation of TBPâDNA complexes showed minimal difference between the wild type AdML and AdML derivatives, indicating that mutations of the BREu or BREd consensus bases within the AdML promoter do not affect the formation of a TBPâDNA complex. To confirm this observation, proteinâDNA binding assays were performed using HEK293T nuclear extract and promoter DNA immobilized on magnetic beads. TFIIA showed decreased binding to the AdMLâmBREud promoter when compared with the wild type AdML promoter. However, TBP binding to DNA showed little difference between these two promoters (Fig. 1C), confirming that mutations of BREud consensus bases do not affect TBP binding to DNA, but significantly reduce TFIIA recruitment. To determine the specific contribution of the BREu and BREd elements to TFIIA recruitment, bandshift assays were performed using native hTFIIA, recombinant hTBP, and radiolabeled DNA fragments containing either a mutated BREu or a mutated BREd (Fig. 1A). The result shows that mutations in the BREu but not the BREd reduced the formation of a TFIIAâTBPâDNA complex compared with the wild type AdML promoter (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the TFIIA DNA-binding region overlaps with the BREu at the AdML promoter. To determine whether TFIIA interacts with specific bases within the BREu, DNA methylation interference assays were performed using native hTFIIA, recombinant hTBP, and radiolabeled AdML promoter DNA fragments. The data show that two G bases immediately upstream of the TATA box displayed weak signals at the positive strand of AdML (the black solid dots in lane IIA, Fig. 1E). This observation was verified by density quantification for the G tracks (â33 and â34 in G tracks, Fig. 1F); indicating that TFIIA can interact with at least two bases upstream of the TATA box. Taken together, these data confirm that TFIIA makes direct contact with the sequence immediately upstream of the TATA box at the AdML promoter. Previous studies using photocross-linking showed that TFIIA subunits, Î± and Î², interact with a number of bases immediately upstream of the TATA box (on both positive and negative strands) at the AdML promoter (42.Lagrange T. Kim T.K Orphanides G. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D. High-resolution mapping of nucleoprotein complexes by site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking: organization of the human TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB-DNA quaternary complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 10620-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our methylation interference analysis revealed the contacts between TFIIA and the two G bases of the positive strand upstream of the AdML TATA box (the black solid dots in Fig. 2A). Using this information, we generated a core promoter DNA library that contains randomized bases between positions â41 and â32 within AdML promoter derivatives (Fig. 2A). The randomized DNA was labeled with [Î±-32P]ATP and subjected to proteinâDNA binding selection through bandshift assays (SELEX). After seven rounds of SELEX, the efficiency of selection was examined by a bandshift assay. Fig. 2B shows that formation of a TFIIAâTBPâDNA complex was significantly enhanced, indicating that the affinity of TFIIA to DNA was increased by SELEX. The DNA fragments were then cloned into pGEM3 and 50 clones sequenced across the promoter region. A TFIIA-binding consensus sequence was determined by the frequency of occurrence for each base. As shown in Fig. 2C, the consensus sequence exhibited strong preference for G or T, with exclusion of A and C at the region between â41 and â39 and the region between â35 and â32. Based on this information, we derived a consensus sequence: 5â²-G-T/G-G-G/C/A-G/C-A/G-T-G/T-G/T-T-3â². Here we refer to the consensus sequence upstream of the TATA box as TFIIA recognition element (this element is abbreviated as IIARE, intentionally distinguished from the ARE (androgen response element)). The IIARE displayed four-base identity to the BREu (â38 to â32), and six-base identity to wild type AdML (â41 and â32). To gain insight into the prevalence of the IIARE in natural promoters, we searched the promoters from the human promoter database (epd.vital-it.ch/) (52.Dreos R. Ambrosini G. PÃ©rier R.C. Bucher P. The eukaryotic promoter database: expansion of EPDnew and new promoter analysis tools.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D92-D96Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 56.Dreos R. Ambrosini G.

The eukaryotic promoter database in its 30th year: focus on non-vertebrate organisms.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: D51-D55Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). There were 1957 TATA-containing promoters and 2058 TATA-less promoters used to analyze the presence of IIARE consensus bases in the region between â41 and â32 at the natural promoters. The result shows that 50.3% of the TATA-containing promoters contain over 5 consensus bases of the IIARE, 26.5% of promoters over 6 consensus bases, and 9.96% of promoters over 7 consensus bases. However, the IIARE showed a higher prevalence at the TATA-less promoters, particularly where the number of IIARE consensus bases is â¥7 or 8 (Table 1). The prevalence of the IIARE in TATA-less natural promoters is similar to the 5â8% of natural promoters that contain a TATA box (1.Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. The general transcription machinery and general cofactors.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 105-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the IIARE is potentially present in a large proportion of natural promoters. Whether the IIARE in these promoters is functional requires further study.Table 1The prevalence of IIARE in human natural promotersNumber of IIARE consensus basesâ¥5â¥6â¥7â¥8Percentage Â± S.D. in TATA-containing natural promoters50.3 Â± 0.09526.5 Â± 0.0629.96 Â± 0.0232.4 Â± 0.014Percentage Â± S.D. in TATA-less natural promoters58.4 Â± 0.13428.7 Â± 0.09515.5 Â± 0.0417.9 Â± 0.021 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the IIARE consensus that we derived affects the affinity of TFIIA to DNA, we generated AdML promoter derivatives that contain an optimal IIARE(AdML-IIARE) or a defective IIARE (AdMLâmIIARE) (Fig. 3A). Promoter DNA was immobilized with streptavidin magnetic beads and binding assays were performed using reconstituted hTFIIA and recombinant hTBP. Stably bound proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, TFIIA exhibited decreased binding to the promoter containing a defective IIARE (AdML-mIIARE) when compared with the promoter containing an optimal IIARE (AdML-IIARE). Thus, the IIARE within AdML promoter derivatives enhances TFIIA binding to DNA, which is consistent with the observation from the random selection (Fig. 2B). To determine the effect of the IIARE on the activities of these promoters, in vitro transcription assays were performed using HEK293T nuclear extract and reporter vectors driven by either the AdML-IIARE or AdML-mIIARE promoters. Because the vector does not contain any eukaryotic promoter except the tested promoter, transcripts can be detected using RT-qPCR as described previously (46.Wang J. Zhao S. Zhou Y. Wei Y. Deng W. Establishment and validation of a non-radioactive method for in vitro transcription assay using primer extension and quantitative real time PCR.PLOS ONE. 2015; 10: e0135317PubMed Google Scholar). The AdMLâmIIARE promoter showed significant reduction in transcriptional activity in either the absence or presence of GAL4âVP16 when compared with the AdMLâIIARE promoter or the wild type AdML promoter (Fig. 3C, left and right panels). To verify these observations, transient transfection of the promoter-driven reporters was performed with HEK293T cells in the absence or presence of GAL4âVP16 and the promoter activity was determined by luciferase assay. The IIARE defective promoter, AdMLâmIIARE, showed reduced activity regardless of the co-expression of GAL4âVP16 when compared with the AdMLâIIARE promoter or the AdMLâWT promoter (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that the IIARE within the AdML promoter is required for efficient TFIIA recruitment and positively regulates promoter activity. We next determined if our observations can be extended to natural promoters that contain a IIARE consensus sequence. A search of the human promoter databa"
https://openalex.org/W2618513873,"Caveolae are membrane invaginations present at high densities in muscle and fat. Recent work has demonstrated that myocardin family coactivators (MYOCD, MKL1), which are important for contractile differentiation and cell motility, increase caveolin (CAV1, CAV2, CAV3) and cavin (CAVIN1, CAVIN2, CAVIN3) transcription, but several aspects of this control mechanism remain to be investigated. Here, using promoter reporter assays we found that both MKL1/MRTF-A and MKL2/MRTF-B control caveolins and cavins via their proximal promoter sequences. Silencing of MKL1 and MKL2 in smooth muscle cells moreover reduced CAV1 and CAVIN1 mRNA levels by well over 50%, as did treatment with second generation inhibitors of MKL activity. GATA6, which modulates expression of smooth muscle-specific genes, reduced CAV1 and CAV2, whereas the cavins were unaffected or increased. Viral overexpression of MKL1 and myocardin induced caveolin and cavin expression in bladder smooth muscle cells from rats and humans and MYOCD correlated tightly with CAV1 and CAVIN1 in human bladder specimens. A recently described activator of MKL-driven transcription (ISX) failed to induce CAV1/CAVIN1 which may be due to an unusual transactivation mechanism. In all, these findings further support the view that myocardin family coactivators are important transcriptional drivers of caveolins and cavins in smooth muscle."

The nuclear exosome is a key factor for pre-rRNA processing through the activity of its catalytic subunits, Rrp6 and Rrp44. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rrp6 is exclusively nuclear and has been shown to interact with exosome cofactors. With the aim of analyzing proteins associated with the nuclear exosome, in this work, we purified the complex with Rrp6-TAP, identified the co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry, and found karyopherins to be one of the major groups of proteins enriched in the samples. By investigating the biological importance of these protein interactions, we identified Srp1, Kap95, and Sxm1 as the most important karyopherins for Rrp6 nuclear import and the nuclear localization signals recognized by them. Based on the results shown here, we propose a model of multiple pathways for the transport of Rrp6 to the nucleus. The exosome is a conserved multiprotein complex essential for RNA processing and degradation. The nuclear exosome is a key factor for pre-rRNA processing through the activity of its catalytic subunits, Rrp6 and Rrp44. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rrp6 is exclusively nuclear and has been shown to interact with exosome cofactors. With the aim of analyzing proteins associated with the nuclear exosome, in this work, we purified the complex with Rrp6-TAP, identified the co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry, and found karyopherins to be one of the major groups of proteins enriched in the samples. By investigating the biological importance of these protein interactions, we identified Srp1, Kap95, and Sxm1 as the most important karyopherins for Rrp6 nuclear import and the nuclear localization signals recognized by them. Based on the results shown here, we propose a model of multiple pathways for the transport of Rrp6 to the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2620357294,"Changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity constitute a key component of bipolar mania, but the extent and nature of these alterations are not fully understood. We use here the lateral hypothalamic-kindled (LHK) rat model to deliberately induce an acute manic-like episode and measure serum corticosterone concentrations to assess changes in HPA axis activity. A mathematical model is developed to succinctly describe the entwined biochemical transformations that underlay the HPA axis and emulate by numerical simulations the considerable increase in serum corticosterone concentration induced by LHK. Synergistic combination of the LHK rat model and dynamical systems theory allows us to quantitatively characterize changes in HPA axis activity under controlled induction of acute manic-like states and provides a framework to study in silico how the dynamic integration of neurochemical transformations underlying the HPA axis is disrupted in these states."

https://openalex.org/W2618049544,"The cofactor balances in metabolism is of paramount importance in the design of a metabolic engineering strategy and understanding the regulation of metabolism in general. ATP, NAD+ and NADP+ balances are central players linking the various fluxes in central metabolism as well as biomass formation. NADP+ is especially important in the metabolic engineering of yeasts for xylose fermentation, since NADPH is required by most yeasts in the initial step of xylose utilisation, including the fast-growing Kluyveromyces marxianus. In this simulation study of yeast metabolism, the complex interplay between these cofactors was investigated; in particular, how they may affect the possible roles of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycerol production and the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass. Using flux balance analysis, it was found that the potential role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was highly dependent on the cofactor specificity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and on the carbon source. Additionally, the excessive production of ATP under certain conditions might be involved in some of the phenomena observed, which may have been overlooked to date. Based on these findings, a strategy is proposed for the metabolic engineering of a future xylose-fermenting yeast for biofuel production."
