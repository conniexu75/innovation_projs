https://openalex.org/W2893560612,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous population of biological particles released by cells. They represent an attractive source of potential biomarkers for early detection of diseases such as cancer. However, it is critical that sufficient amounts of EVs can be isolated and purified in a robust and reproducible manner. Several isolation methods that seem to produce distinct populations of vesicles exist, making data comparability difficult. While some methods induce cellular stress that may affect both the quantity and function of the EVs produced, others involve expensive reagents or equipment unavailable for many laboratories. Thus, there is a need for a standardized, feasible and cost-effective method for isolation of EVs from cell culture supernatants. Here we present the most common obstacles in the production and isolation of small EVs, and we suggest a combination of relatively simple strategies to avoid these. Three distinct cell lines were used (human oral squamous cell carcinoma (PE/CA-PJ49/E10)), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (BxPC3), and a human melanoma brain metastasis (H3). The addition of 1% exosome-depleted FBS to Advanced culture media enabled for reduced presence of contaminating bovine EVs while still ensuring an acceptable cell proliferation and low cellular stress. Cells were gradually adapted to these new media. Furthermore, using the Integra CELLine AD1000 culture flask we increased the number of cells and thereby EVs in 3D-culture. A combination of ultrafiltration with different molecular weight cut-offs and size-exclusion chromatography was further used for the isolation of a heterogeneous population of small EVs with low protein contamination. The EVs were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoaffinity capture, flow cytometry, Western blot and transmission electron microscopy. We successfully isolated a significant amount of small EVs compatible with exosomes from three distinct cell lines in order to demonstrate reproducibility with cell lines of different origin. The EVs were characterized as CD9 positive with a size between 60–140 nm. We conclude that this new combination of methods is a robust and improved strategy for the isolation of EVs, and in particular small EVs compatible with exosomes, from cell culture media without the use of specialized equipment such as an ultracentrifuge."

Despite its advantages, metformin has variable therapeutic effects, contraindications, and side effects. Here, for the very first time, we investigate the short-term effect of metformin on the composition of healthy human gut microbiota. Methods We used an exploratory longitudinal study design in which the first sample from an individual was the control for further samples. Eighteen healthy individuals were treated with metformin (2 × 850 mg) for 7 days. Stool samples were collected at three time points: prior to administration, 24 hours and 7 days after metformin administration. Taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome was analyzed by massive parallel sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (V3 region). Results There was a significant reduction of inner diversity of gut microbiota observed already 24 hours after metformin administration. We observed an association between the severity of gastrointestinal side effects and the increase in relative abundance of common gut opportunistic pathogen Escherichia-Shigella spp. One week long treatment with metformin was associated with a significant decrease in the families Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae_1 and four genera within these families. Conclusions Our results are in line with previous findings on the capability of metformin to influence gut microbiota. However, for the first time we provide evidence that metformin has an immediate effect on the gut microbiome in humans. It is likely that this effect results from the increase in abundance of opportunistic pathogens and further triggers the occurrence of side effects associated with the observed dysbiosis. An additional randomized controlled trial would be required in order to reach definitive conclusions, as this is an exploratory study without a placebo control arm. Our findings may be further used to create approaches that improve the tolerability of metformin."
https://openalex.org/W2774468513,"The attrition of women in academic careers is a major concern, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics subjects. One factor that can contribute to the attrition is the lack of visible role models for women in academia. At early career stages, the behaviour of the local community may play a formative role in identifying ingroup role models, shaping women's impressions of whether or not they can be successful in academia. One common and formative setting to observe role models is the local departmental academic seminar, talk, or presentation. We thus quantified women's visibility through the question-asking behaviour of academics at seminars using observations and an online survey. From the survey responses of over 600 academics in 20 countries, we found that women reported asking fewer questions after seminars compared to men. This impression was supported by observational data from almost 250 seminars in 10 countries: women audience members asked absolutely and proportionally fewer questions than male audience members. When asked why they did not ask questions when they wanted to, women, more than men, endorsed internal factors (e.g., not working up the nerve). However, our observations suggest that structural factors might also play a role; when a man was the first to ask a question, or there were fewer questions, women asked proportionally fewer questions. Attempts to counteract the latter effect by manipulating the time for questions (in an effort to provoke more questions) in two departments were unsuccessful. We propose alternative recommendations for creating an environment that makes everyone feel more comfortable to ask questions, thus promoting equal visibility for women and members of other less visible groups."
https://openalex.org/W2894321487,"Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), a major scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plasma, acts as a redox signal modulator. However, the mechanism underlying GPx3-mediated suppression of cancer cell growth is unclear. The aim of this study was to identify these mechanisms with respect to lung cancer. To enhance the redox modulating properties of GPx3, lung cancer cells were subjected to serum starvation for 12 h, resulting in ROS generation in the absence of oxidant treatment. We then investigated whether suppression of tumorigenesis under conditions of oxidative stress was dependent on GPx3. The results showed that GPx3 effectively suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells under oxidative stress. In addition, GPx3 expression led to a significant reduction in ROS production by cancer cells and induced G2/M phase arrest. We also found that inactivation of cyclin B1 significantly suppressed by nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB) inactivation in lung cancer cells was dependent on GPx3 expression. To further elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying GPx3-medited suppression of tumor proliferation, we next examined the effect of GPx3-mediated redox signaling on the ROS-MKP3-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-NF-κB-cyclin B1 pathway and found that GPx3 strongly suppressed activation of the Erk-NF-κB-cyclin B1 signaling cascade by protecting MKP3 (an Erk-specific phosphatase) from the effects of ROS. Thus, this study demonstrates for the first time that the GPx3 suppresses proliferation of lung cancer cells by modulating redox-mediated signals."
https://openalex.org/W2893356404,"Countless neurodegenerative diseases are associated with perverse multiple targets of cyclic nucleotide signalling, hastening neuronal death. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective effects against sundry models of neurotoxicity, however, its role against Huntington’s disease (HD) has not yet been tackled. Hence, its modulatory effect on several signalling pathways using the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) model was conducted. Animals were injected with 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p) for two successive weeks with or without the administration of cilostazol (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Contrary to the 3-NP effects, cilostazol largely preserved striatal dopaminergic neurons, improved motor coordination, and enhanced the immunohistochemical reaction of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme. The anti-inflammatory effect of cilostazol was documented by the pronounced reduction of the toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4) protein expression and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, but with a marked elevation in IL-10 striatal contents. As a consequence, cilostazol reduced IL-6 downstream signal, where it promoted the level of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), while abated the phosphorylation of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK-2) and Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT-3). Phosphorylation of the protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3β/cAMP response element binding protein (Akt/GSK-3β/CREB) cue is another signalling pathway that was modulated by cilostazol to further signify its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic capacities. The latter was associated with a reduction in the caspase-3 expression assessed by immunohistochemical assay. In conclusion the present study provided a new insight into the possible mechanisms by which cilostazol possesses neuroprotective properties. These intersecting mechanisms involve the interference between TLR-4, IL-6-IL-10/JAK-2/STAT-3/SOCS-3, and Akt/GSK-3β/CREB signalling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2892462957,"We tested two methods for non-destructive assessment of wood density of Scots pine standing trees: one based on penetration depth of a steel pin (Pilodyn) and the other on micro-drilling resistance (Resistograph). As a benchmark we used wood density data from x-ray analysis (SilviScan). We assessed in total 622 trees of 175 full-sib families growing in a single progeny test. Pilodyn was applied with bark (PIL) and without bark (PILB). Raw Resistograph drilling profiles (RES) were adjusted (RESTB) in order to eliminate increasing trend caused by needle friction. Individual narrow-sense heritability of benchmark SilviScan density (DEN; 0.46) was most closely approached by that of adjusted RESTB (0.43). Heritabilities were lower for unadjusted RES (0.35) as well as for PIL and PILB (both 0.32). Additive genetic correlations of the benchmark DEN with RES, RESTB, PIL and PILB were 0.89, 0.96, 0.59 and 0.71, respectively. Our results suggest that Resistograph is a more reliable tool than Pilodyn for wood density assessment of Scots pine; however, we highly recommend adjusting Resistograph drilling profiles prior to further analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2894470898,"Four plasmids ranging in size from 4.7 to 44.7 kb found in the extensively antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolate D36 that belongs to lineage 2 of global clone 1 were examined. D36 includes two cryptic plasmids and two carrying antibiotic resistance genes. The smallest plasmid pD36-1 (4.7 kb) carries no resistance genes but includes mobA and mobC mobilisation genes related to those found in pRAY* (pD36-2, 6,078 bp) that also carries the aadB gentamicin, kanamycin and tobramycin resistance gene cassette. These two plasmids do not encode a Rep protein. Plasmid pRAY* was found to be mobilised at high frequency by the large conjugative plasmid pA297-3 but a pRAY* derivative lacking the mobA and mobC genes was not. The two larger plasmids, pD36-3 and pD36-4, encode Rep_3 family proteins (Pfam1051). The cryptic plasmid pD36-3 (6.2 kb) has RepAci1 and pD36-4 (44.7 kb) encodes two novel Rep_3 family proteins suggesting a co-integrate. Plasmid pD36-4 includes the sul2 sulfonamide resistance gene, the aphA1a kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene in Tn4352::ISAba1 and a mer module in a hybrid Tn501/Tn1696 transposon conferring resistance to mercuric ions. New examples of dif modules flanked by pdif sites (XerC-XerD binding sites) that are part of many A. baumannii plasmids were also identified in pD36-3 and pD36-4 which carry three and two dif modules, respectively. Homologs of three dif modules, the sup sulphate permease module in pD36-3, and of the abkAB toxin-antitoxin module and the orf module in pD36-4, were found in different contexts in diverse Acinetobacter plasmids, consistent with module mobility. A novel insertion sequence named ISAba32 found next to the pdif site in the abkAB dif module is related to members of the ISAjo2 group which also are associated with the pdif sites of dif modules. Plasmids found in D36 were also found in some other members of GC1 lineage 2."
https://openalex.org/W2892914993,"Background Point-of-care ultrasonography (PoCUS) is a rapidly evolving discipline that aims to train non-cardiologists, non-radiologists clinicians in performing bedside ultrasound to guide clinical decision. Training of PoCUS is challenging, time-consuming and requires large amount of resources. The objective of our study was to evaluate if this training process can be simplified by allowing medical students self-train themselves with a web-based cardiac ultrasound software. Methods A prospective, single blinded, cohort study, comparing performance of 29 medical students in performing a six-minutes cardiac ultrasound exam. Students were divided into two groups: self-learning group, using a combination of E-learning software and self-practice using pocket ultrasound device compared to formal, frontal cardiac ultrasound course. Results All 29 students completed their designated courses and performed the six-minutes exam: 20 students participated in the frontal cardiac ultrasound course and 9 completed the self-learning course. The median (Q1,Q3) test score for the self-learning group was higher than the frontal course group score, 18 (15,19) versus 15 (12,19.5), respectively. Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was found between the two study groups (p = 0.478). All students in the self-learning course group (9/9, 100%) and 16 (16/20, 80%) of students in the frontal ultrasound course group obtained correct alignment of the parasternal long axis view (p = 0.280). Conclusions Self-learning students combining E-learning software with self-practice cardiac ultrasound were as good as students who received a validated, bedside, frontal cardiac ultrasound course. Our findings suggest that independent cardiac ultrasound learning, combining utilization of E–learning software and self-practice, is feasible. Self-E- learning of cardiac ultrasound may serve as an important, cost-effective adjunct to heavily resource consuming traditional teaching."
https://openalex.org/W2894394927,"Efficient management of P fertilizers ensures good yield of crops and adequate food supply. In the acid soil of the tropics, soluble P is fixed by Al and Fe. Exploitation of the high CEC and pH of Clinoptilolite zeolite (CZ) could mitigate low soil pH and P fixation in acid soils. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of amending a weathered acid soil with CZ on: (i) soil P availability and other related soil chemical properties, and (ii) nutrient concentration, nutrient uptake, above-ground biomass, agronomic efficiency, and yield of Zea mays L. on a tropical acidic soil. Triple superphosphate (TSP), Egypt Rock phosphate (ERP), and Christmas Island Rock phosphate (CIRP) were used as P sources. The treatments evaluated were: (i) soil alone, (ii) 100% recommended fertilizer rate (NPK), and (iii) 75% fertilizer rate + Clinoptilolite zeolite. Selected soil chemical properties and P availability were determined before and after field trials. Zea mays L. above-ground biomass, nutrient concentration, nutrient uptake, agronomic efficiency, and fresh cob yield were also determined. Results revealed that the effects of treatments with and without CZ treatments on soil pH, P fractions, soil acidity, dry matter production, yield of maize, nutrient uptake, and agronomic efficiency were similar. Hence, suggesting CZ inclusion in the fertilization program of Zea mays L is beneficial in terms of reducing excessive or unbalanced use of chemical fertilizers due to reduction of fertilizers usage by 25%."
https://openalex.org/W2894028456,"Motivation The measurement of disease biomarkers in easily–obtained bodily fluids has opened the door to a new type of non–invasive medical diagnostics. New technologies are being developed and fine–tuned in order to make this possibility a reality. One such technology is Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS), which allows the measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in biological samples such as urine. These VOCs are known to contain a range of information on the relevant person’s metabolism and can in principle be used for disease diagnostic purposes. Key to the effective use of such data are well–developed data processing pipelines, which are necessary to extract the most useful data from the complex underlying biological structure. Results In this study, we present a new data analysis pipeline for FAIMS data, and demonstrate a number of improvements over previously used methods. We evaluate the effect of a series of candidate operational steps during data processing, such as the use of wavelet transforms, principal component analysis (PCA), and classifier ensembles. We also demonstrate the use of FAIMS data in our pipeline to diagnose diabetes on the basis of a simple urine sample using machine learning classifiers. We present results for data generated from a case-control study of 115 urine samples, collected from 72 type II diabetic patients, with 43 healthy volunteers as negative controls. The resulting pipeline combines the steps that resulted in the best classification model performance. These include the use of a two–dimensional discrete wavelet transform, and the Wilcoxon rank–sum test for feature selection. We are able to achieve a best ROC curve AUC of 0.825 (0.747–0.9, 95% CI) for classification of diabetes vs control. We also note that this result is robust to changes in the data pipeline and different analysis runs, with AUC > 0.80 achieved in a range of cases. This is a substantial improvement in performance over previously used data processing methods in this area. Our ability to make strong statements about FAIMS ability to diagnose diabetes is sadly limited, as we found confounding effects from the demographics when including these data in the pipeline. The demographics alone produced a best AUC of 0.87 (0.795–0.94, 95% CI). While the combination of the demographics and FAIMS data resulted in an improvement on the AUC (0.907; 0.848–0.97, 95% CI), it did not prove to be a significant difference. Nevertheless, the pipeline itself shows a significant improvement in performance over more basic methods which have been used with FAIMS data in the past."
https://openalex.org/W2892793759,"The systemic interactions among depressive symptoms, rumination, and stress are important to understanding depression but have not yet been quantified. In this article, we present a system dynamics simulation model of depression that captures the reciprocal relationships among stressors, rumination, and depression. Building on the response styles theory, this model formalizes three interdependent mechanisms: 1) Rumination contributes to 'keeping stressors alive'; 2) Rumination has a direct impact on depressive symptoms; and 3) Both 'stressors kept alive' and current depressive symptoms contribute to rumination. The strength of these mechanisms is estimated using data from 661 adolescents (353 girls and 308 boys) from two middle schools (grades 6-8). These estimates indicate that rumination contributes to depression by keeping stressors 'alive'-and the individual activated-even after the stressor has ended. This mechanism is stronger among girls than boys, increasing their vulnerability to a rumination reinforcing loop. Different profiles of depression emerge over time depending on initial levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, and stressors as well as the occurrence rate for stressors; levels of rumination and occurrence of stressors are stronger contributors to long-term depression. Our systems model is a steppingstone towards a more comprehensive understanding of depression in which reinforcing feedback mechanisms play a significant role. Future research is needed to expand this simulation model to incorporate other drivers of depression and provide a more holistic tool for studying depression."

A large part of the budget allocated to health care is attributed to cancer. In this study we aim to estimate the economic burden of oral cancer in Iran for the year 2014.In this study, we generated a prevalence-based estimate of the cost-of-illness of oral cancer in Iran. A societal perspective was used for this study, in which the direct costs and productivity losses of oral cancer cases in 2014 were estimated. The human capital approach was adopted for estimating productivity losses. Several data sources contributed to this study, including national cancer registry reports, hospital records, occupational data, and interviews with experts.Nearly 53% of patients were diagnosed in an advanced stage of oral cancer. The economic burden of oral cancer was $64,245,173 most of which (50%) was attributed to productivity losses. The direct medical cost accounted for 42% of the estimated total cost. Treatment expenses for advanced stages were five times higher than the early stages ($10,532 vs. $2,225).The economic burden of oral cancer is high in Iran. Planning an early detection and screening program for oral cancer may potentially decrease health care costs, morbidity, and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2894409731,"Bacterial infections from Staphylococcus pseudintermedius are the most common cause of skin infections (pyoderma) affecting dogs. Two component pore-forming leukocidins are a family of potent toxins secreted by staphylococci and consist of S (slow) and F (fast) components. They impair the innate immune system, the first line of defense against these pathogens. Seven different leukocidins have been characterized in Staphylococcus aureus, some of which are host and cell specific. Through genome sequencing and analysis of the S. pseudintermedius secretome using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry we identified two proteins, named “LukS-I” and “LukF-I”, encoded on a degenerate prophage contained in the genome of S. pseudintermedius isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of LukS-I components in comparison to the rest of the leukocidin family showed that LukS-I was most closely related to S. intermedius LukS-I, S. aureus LukE and LukP, whereas LukF-I was most similar to S. intermedius LukF-I S. aureus gamma hemolysin subunit B. The killing effect of recombinant S. pseudintermedius LukS-I and LukF-I on canine polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined using a flow cytometry cell permeability assay. The cytotoxic effect occurred only when the two recombinant proteins were combined. Engineered mutant versions of the two-component pore-forming leukocidins, produced through amino acids substitutions at selected points, were not cytotoxic. Anti-Luk-I produced in dogs against attenuated proteins reduced the cytotoxic effect of native canine leukotoxin which highlights the importance of Luk-I as a promising component in a vaccine against canine S. pseudintermedius infections."
https://openalex.org/W2893149169,"The walk and trot are inherently symmetrical gaits, making them potentially suitable for the detection of left-right asymmetries. The aims of this study were to describe asymmetrical vertical excursions of the withers at walk in non-lame high-level dressage horses and to seek associations between these asymmetric movements and other kinematic variables and vertical ground reaction forces (vGRFs). Seven dressage horses, judged clinically as being sound, walked unridden and unrestrained on a treadmill with an integrated force measuring system (480 Hz), from which spatiotemporal and vGRF variables were extracted. Markers were tracked by 12 infrared cameras (240 Hz). The vertical position of the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6), limb protraction and retraction distances throughout stance, and global limb lengths were determined. Contralateral trial-mean differences were calculated, including difference in T6 minimum vertical position between contralateral steps (T6minDiff). Mixed models were used to study associations between symmetry parameters. Trial-mean T6minDiff ranged between 0.3-23 mm. Of the seven horses, five consistently dropped the withers more in early left forelimb stance, one was fairly symmetrical, and one dropped the withers more in early right forelimb stance. Comparisons between contralateral limbs showed the following associations. The forelimb that was retracted when T6min was lowest showed greater retraction at toe-off (1 mm increase predicted 0.17 mm T6minDiff increase) and shorter stance duration (1 ms decrease predicted 0.3 mm T6minDiff increase). The hind limb that was in midstance when T6min was lowest showed a greater range of motion during the stance phase (1 mm increase in protraction or retraction predicted 0.2 mm T6minDiff increase). The haunches were displaced away from the side of the forelimb that was protracted when T6min was lowest (1 mm lateral shift predicted 0.07 mm T6minDiff increase). Forelimb and hind limb vGRF parameters were non-significant. Asymmetry of vertical withers movement in horses assessed as being sound at trot was related to a complex pattern of asymmetries in spatiotemporal variables throughout the stride cycle rather than to vertical load redistribution between the forelimbs. This suggests that the asymmetry may be due to inherent laterality rather than weight-bearing lameness."
https://openalex.org/W2893295862,"Oxathiapiprolin is a new fungicide with extremely high efficacy against oomycete plant pathogens. Solo components oxathiapiprolin (OXPT), chlorothalonil (CHT), azoxystrobin (AZ), mandipropamid (MPD), and mefenoxam (MFX) were compared with each other and with four oxathiapiprolin pre-packed fungicidal mixtures, OXPT+CHT 1+66.7, OXPT+AZ 1+10.3, OXPT+MPD 1+8.3, and OXPT+MFX 1+3 (weight active ingredient ratio), for control efficacy of late blight induced by MFX-insensitive Phytophthora infestans strains in tomato in growth chambers and the field. Mixtures performed better than all partner fungicides alone, except OXPT. Of the four mixtures, OXPT+MFX outperformed, with the highest preventive, curative, translaminar, and systemic efficacies. In the field, OXPT+MFX was superior to other fungicides in controlling late blight epidemics induced by MFX-insensitive isolates. Its deployment in the field will combat the dominating MFX-insensitive isolates, reduce the selection pressure imposed on P. infestans and delay the buildup of subpopulations resistant to oxathiapiprolin."
https://openalex.org/W2892584391,"Inflammatory β-cell failure contributes to type 1 and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines cause β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis, and lysine deacetylase inhibitors (KDACi) prevent β-cell failure in vitro and in vivo, in part by reducing NF-κB transcriptional activity. We investigated the hypothesis that the protective effect of KDACi involves transcriptional regulation of microRNAs (miRs), potential new targets in diabetes treatment. Insulin-producing INS1 cells were cultured with or without the broad-spectrum KDACi Givinostat, prior to exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ for 6 h or 24 h, and miR expression was profiled with miR array. Thirteen miRs (miR-7a-2-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-96-5p, miR-101a-3p, miR-140-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-340-5p, miR-384-5p, miR-455-5p, miR-466b-2-3p, miR-652-5p, and miR-3584-5p) were regulated by both cytokines and Givinostat, and nine were examined by qRT-PCR. miR-146a-5p was strongly regulated by cytokines and KDACi and was analyzed further. miR-146a-5p expression was induced by cytokines in rat and human islets. Cytokine-induced miR-146a-5p expression was specific for INS1 and β-TC3 cells, whereas α-TC1 cells exhibited a higher basal expression. Transfection of INS1 cells with miR-146a-5p reduced cytokine signaling, including the activity of NF-κB and iNOS promoters, as well as NO production and protein levels of iNOS and its own direct targets TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). miR-146a-5p was elevated in the pancreas of diabetes-prone BB-DP rats at diabetes onset, suggesting that miR-146a-5p could play a role in type 1 diabetes development. The miR array of cytokine-exposed INS1 cells rescued by KDACi revealed several other miRs potentially involved in cytokine-induced β-cell apoptosis, demonstrating the strength of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2894090356,"Algae are often promoted as feedstock organisms to produce a sustainable petroleum fossil fuel alternative. However, to induce lipid accumulation most often requires a severe stress that is difficult to induce in large batch cultures. The objective of this study is to analyze and mathematically model heat stress on growth, chlorophyll content, triacylglyceride, and starch synthesis in algae. We initially screened 30 algal species for the most pronounced induction of lipid droplets from heat stress using confocal microscopy and mass spectroscopy techniques. One species, Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C169, was selected and subjected to further biochemical analyses using a jacketed bioreactor amended with 1% CO2 at 25°C, 30°C, 32°C, 33°C, 34°C, 35°C, and 36°C. Lipid and starch accumulation was less extreme than N stress. Growth was reduced above 25°C, but heat stress induced lipid droplet synthesis was negatively correlated with growth only past a demonstrated threshold temperature above 32°C. The optimal temperature for lipid accumulation was 35°C, which led to 6% of dry weight triglyceride content and a 72% reduction from optimal growth after 5 days. Fatty acid influx rates into triglycerides and 15N labeling of amino acids and proteins indicate that heat stress is mechanistically distinct from N stress. Thus, this study lends support to a novel hypothesis that lipid droplet triglycerides result from a redistribution of carbon flux as fatty acids to neutral storage lipids over membrane or other lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2892451083,"Campylobacteriosis is a widespread infectious disease, leading to a major health and economic burden. Chickens are considered as the most common infection source for humans. Campylobacter mainly multiplies in the mucus layer of their caeca. No effective control measures are currently available, but passive immunisation of chickens with pathogen-specific maternal IgY antibodies, present in egg yolk of immunised chickens, reduces Campylobacter colonisation. To explore this strategy further, anti-Campylobacter nanobodies, directed against the flagella and major outer membrane proteins, were fused to the constant domains of chicken IgA and IgY, combining the benefits of nanobodies and the effector functions of the Fc-domains. The designer chimeric antibodies were effectively produced in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana. Stable expression of the chimeric antibodies in seeds resulted in production levels between 1% and 8% of the total soluble protein. These in planta produced antibodies do not only bind to their purified antigens but also to Campylobacter bacterial cells. In addition, the anti-flagellin chimeric antibodies are reducing the motility of Campylobacter bacteria. These antibody-containing Arabidopsis seeds can be tested for oral passive immunisation of chickens and, if effective, the chimeric antibodies can be produced in crop seeds."
https://openalex.org/W2892886365,"Investigating the variations in crop climatic suitability and planting regionalization can provide scientific evidence for ensuring food security under climate change. In this study, variations in climatic suitability and planting regionalization for the potato in northern China were investigated based on daily data from 1965 to 2014 collected at 321 agro-meteorological observation stations located throughout the region. Northern China was divided into three areas, including Northwest China, North China and Northeast China. The agricultural climatic suitability theory and the fuzzy mathematics method were applied. The potato growth seasons were divided into threestages:from sowing to emergence, from emergence to flowering and from flowering to maturity. The comprehensive climatic suitabilityindex (C), which varied from 0 to 1, was established to evaluate the effects of climate change on potato planting. The results showed that, from 1965 to 2014, the C value in the study area increased 0.002 every ten years over the past 50 years with an average of 0.706, benefitting potato growth in the vast area of northern China. Nonetheless, precipitation was found to be the main climatic factor restricting potato growth in northern China. For spatial distribution, the C value showed a gradually declining trend from east to west, decreasing westward and southward over the past 50 years. For the growth season, the C value varied during different potato growth stages over the past 50 years. The C value increased during the sowing-emergence stage and decreased during the emergence-flowering stage and the flowering-maturity stage. The decreased C during the later growth stages would directly affect the quality and yield of the potato, mainly because the flowering-maturity stage was associated with potato tuber enlargement and starch accumulation. Variations in potato planting regionalization in northern China over the past 50 years were evident. Climate change was more beneficial to potato cultivation in northeast China where the highly suitable areas had clearly expanded. However, potato cultivation was most negatively affected in northwest China where the middle suitable areas had receded. Our findings have important implications for improving climate change impact studies and agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2893609203,"Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient, is a prerequisite for various plant-growth mechanisms including root establishment/development, early/late vegetative stage development and reproductive stage development. Rice (Oryza sativa) is very sensitive to P starvation. Most cultivated genotypes have poor tolerance levels to P deficiency and consequently the grain yield is severely affected by P starvation. Since P deficiency of soils is a major concern of rice production areas, it is necessary to develop new cultivars with enhanced P tolerance. This is also an expectation of farmers and the Agriculture ministry of southern states of India where rice cultivation is intensive. Our objective was to introgress the phosphorus starvation tolerance (OsPSTOL1) gene through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) in to two intermediate genetic stocks of popular local-varieties namely, ASD 16 and ADT 43 which harbour bacterial blight and blast resistance (R) genes. To delve into the P starvation phenotypic effect, we have generated a set of four backcross inbred lines (BILs) with enhanced P starvation tolerance. The developed BILs showed altered root architecture pattern and greater root surface area with increased P uptake, confirming their adaptability to P deficient soil conditions. Further, a correlation between root traits and low/high P conditions indicates the function of introgressed OsPSTOL1 in BILs. The enhanced root characteristics, therefore, enabled the plants to access and effectively absorb available nutrients from soil. In summary, the unique features of the OsPSTOL1 BILs with bacterial blight and blast resistance can aid varietal development suitable for cultivation in P deficient soils."
https://openalex.org/W2894036156,"In Europe, the surface devoted to sunflower cultivation has expanded by ∼ 26% from 2006 to 2016. Theoretically, this implies an increasing demand for pollinators, while at the same time, scientific reports claim that pollinator communities worldwide are threatened by multiple stressors such as agrochemicals, the loss of suitable habitats and habitat fragmentation. However, the question that arises is whether insect pollination is still relevant for modern sunflower varieties that are often highly self-fertile. Following recent studies which demonstrate that surrounding land use composition may affect ecosystem service provisioning in cropped fields, this study aims at re-examining the pollination status of sunflower while disentangling the effects of local and landscape variables on sunflower seed set and oil content in Central Italy. Commercial cultivars, regardless of their degree of self-fertility, showed increased seed set and oil content when receiving adequate amounts of cross-pollination; oil composition, though, was not affected by cross-pollination events. Honey bees accounted for the vast majority of pollinators ensuring an overall adequate pollination. Sunflower seed set was higher in fields surrounded by landscapes containing a greater abundance of beehives, early flowering crops, urban areas and woody linear elements; conversely, seed set was lower where herbaceous semi-natural habitats dominated the surrounding landscape. This information is necessary for a science-based planning of agricultural policies and shows that, despite the adoption of self-fertile cultivars, sunflower still benefits from insect pollination and land use planning may affect crop productivity."

Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are a powerful geochemical tracer commonly applied in a wide range of scientific fields and laser-ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry is considered the method of choice to obtain spatially resolved 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios from a variety of sample materials. However, data reduction and analyses methods are variable between different research groups and research communities limiting reproducibility between studies. IsoFishR provides a platform to standardize these methods and can be used for both spot and time-resolved line transects. Furthermore, it provides advanced data analysis tools and filters for outlier removal, noise reduction, and visualization of time resolved data. The application can be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/MalteWillmes/IsoFishR) and the source code is available, encouraging future development and evolution of this software."
https://openalex.org/W2893573044,"Dichelobacter nododus is the causative agent of footrot, a major disease of sheep that creates welfare concerns and large economic loss. The virulence of D. nododus depends on the presence of extracellular proteases, AprV2 and AprB2, which differ by one amino acid. Strains possessing AprV2 can cause clinically virulent disease, while AprB2 may cause clinically benign disease. Current methods for detecting D. nodosus are difficult, laborious and time consuming. New techniques capable of rapidly detecting and typing D. nodosus are needed to aid control programs. Molecular methods, like real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) can detect aprV2 and aprB2, however, this assay is not field-deployable and cannot support local decision-making during an outbreak. Here we present a field-based molecular assay for detecting aprV2, using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The aprV2 LAMP (VDN LAMP) assay was optimised to reliably detect aprV2 from laboratory purified genomic (gDNA) of virulent D. nodosus down to 5x10(-3) ng μL-1, with time to positive (Tp) ≤ 16 minutes, while aprB2 was unreliably detected at 5 ng μL-1 from 16-20 minutes. The use of field collected samples that were rtPCR positive for aprB2 resulted in no amplification, while aprV2 positive field samples by VDN LAMP assay are defined as having Tps' of < 20 minutes and melting temperature between 88.0-88.9°C. When compared to rtPCR, the VDN LAMP was shown to have a diagnostic specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 83.33%. As proof of concept, the VDN LAMP was taken on farm, with all processing occurring in-field. The on farm VDN LAMP successfully detected 91.67% aprV2 positive samples, no aprB2 positive samples (n = 9) or D. nodosus negative (n = 23) samples, with a kappa agreement of 'almost perfect' to rtPCR. This highlights the potential of the assay to inform local treatment decisions for management."
https://openalex.org/W2892687233,"takeout (to) is one of the male-specific genes expressed in the fat body that regulate male courtship behavior, and has been shown to act as a secreted protein in conjunction with courtship circuits. There are 23 takeout family members in Drosophila melanogaster, and homologues of this family are distributed across insect species. Sequence conservation among family members is low. Here we test the functional conservation of takeout family members by examining whether they can rescue the takeout courtship defect. We find that despite their sequence divergence takeout members from Aedes aegypti and Epiphas postvittana, as well as family members from D. melanogaster can substitute for takeout in courtship, demonstrating their functional conservation. Making use of the known E. postvittana Takeout structure, we used homology modeling and amphipathic helix analysis and found high overall structural conservation, including high conservation of the structure and amphipathic lining of an internal cavity that has been shown to accommodate hydrophobic ligands. Together these data suggest a high degree of structural conservation that likely underlies functional conservation in courtship. In addition, we have identified a role for a conserved exposed protein motif important for the protein's role in courtship."
https://openalex.org/W2893787284,"This paper estimates the cost-effectiveness of a 20% price discount on healthy food and beverages with and without consumer nutrition education, as trialled in remote Northern Australia. Changes in actual store sales, from the pre-discount baseline period, were analysed for population impact on consumption of fruit and vegetables, water and artificially sweetened soft drinks, in addition with total dietary weight (grams), energy (Mega Joules), and sodium (milligrams). Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), arising from changes in dietary risk factor prevalence in the population, were estimated as the primary health outcome in a multi health-state Markov model. The costs of the strategies were sourced from paid invoices and time estimates of staff providing store-based discount promotion and consumer education. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio adopted a partial societal perspective, (including health and retail sector costs), as cost per DALY averted and was presented in 2011 Australian dollars. The price discount, helped address a gap in food price equity for residents of remote communities. However, the discount strategy, with or without consumer education led to a net loss of population health -36 95%CI (-47,-25) or -21(-28, -15) DALYs respectively, at increased cost to the retail and health sectors, of AUD860000 95%CI (710000, 1million) or AUD500000 (410000, 590000). The strategies trialled were thereby categorised as dominated by current practice while acknowledging considerable uncertainty surrounding the health outcome estimates. The 20% discount on limited targeted products appeared to need to be considered in conjunction with other marketing strategies to support healthy food choices, if remote Australian Indigenous population health is to be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2894475478,"Previous pre-clinical studies demonstrated a promising role of alpha-type peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα) agonists in decreasing nicotine self-administration and nicotine-seeking behavior in animals. Our goal was to investigate the potential of gemfibrozil, a PPARα agonist, on reducing tobacco smoking in humans.This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the effects of gemfibrozil (1200 mg/day) on smoking in 27 treatment-seeking smokers. The study had two 2-week phases separated by a washout period of at least 1 week. In each phase and after 1 week on medication, participants underwent a lab session where cue reactivity and forced choice paradigms were conducted. Physiological responses and self-reported craving were monitored during the presentation of smoking and neutral cues. In addition, two types of cigarettes were used in the forced choice paradigms: the Nicotinized cigarettes (Nic) and the Denicotinized cigarettes (Denic). The goal of the forced choice was to calculate the percentage of choice of Nic cigarettes while taking gemfibrozil or placebo. The number of quit days was calculated during the two quit attempts weeks (one while taking gemfibrozil and one while taking placebo) of the study.There were no significant differences between gemfibrozil and placebo groups in the percentage of choice of Nic cigarettes, the cue-reactivity (both physiological and subjective measures), or in the number of days of abstinence.Although preclinical studies with PPAR α agonists showed promising results, this preliminary study did not demonstrate positive effect of gemfibrozil on tobacco use and cessation indices."
https://openalex.org/W2892386122,"Therapy with inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) is being tested in human clinical trials, yet the alternative use of prodrugs, CO-Releasing Molecules (CORMs), is conceptually advantageous. These molecules are designed to release carbon monoxide in specific tissues, in response to some locally expressed stimulus, where CO can trigger a cytoprotective response. The design of such prodrugs, mostly metal carbonyl complexes, must consider their ADMET profiles, including their interaction with transport plasma proteins. However, the molecular details of this interaction remain elusive. To shed light into this matter, we focused on the CORM prototype [Mo(η5-Cp)(CH2COOH)(CO)3] (ALF414) and performed a detailed molecular characterization of its interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA), using spectroscopic and computational methods. The experimental results show that ALF414 partially quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA without changing its secondary structure. The interaction between BSA and ALF414 follows a dynamic quenching mechanism, indicating that no stable complex is formed between the protein Trp residues and ALF414. The molecular dynamics simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results and confirm the dynamic and unspecific character of the interaction between ALF414 and BSA. The simulations also provide important insights into the nature of the interactions of this CORM prototype with BSA, which are dominated by hydrophobic contacts, with a contribution from hydrogen bonding. This kind of information is useful for future CORM design."

Data collection included self-reported behavioural risk factors and clinical measurements comprising blood pressure, anthropometry and point-of-care random blood glucose and cholesterol assessments.Among the 7711 participants, 2488 men and 5223 women, the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension increased by BMI category across population groups. Compared with white men and women, black African men (odds ratio: 2.66, 95% confidence interval: 1.70-4.16) and women (2.10, 1.49-2.96), coloured men (2.28, 1.44-3.60) and women (2.15, 1.52-3.05) and Indian men (4.38, 2.65-7.26) and women (3.64, 2.50-5.32) were significantly more likely to have diabetes. The odds for hypertension were significantly higher only in coloured men compared with white men (1.37, 1.02-1.83), while it was significantly higher in black African, coloured and Indian women compared with white women. The odds for hypercholesterolaemia were significantly lower in black African men (0.64, 0.49-0.84) and women (0.52, 0.43-0.62) compared with white men and women, and significantly higher in Indian men (1.47, 1.05-2.08) compared with white men.

https://openalex.org/W2892727730,"Successful eradication of invasives is facilitated by early detection and prompt onset of control. However, realizing or verifying that a colonization has occurred is difficult for cryptic species especially at low population densities. Responding to the capture or unconfirmed sighting of a cryptic invasive species, and the associated effort to determine if it indicates an incipient (small, localized) population or merely a lone colonizer, is costly and cannot continue indefinitely. However, insufficient detection effort risks erroneously concluding the species is not present, allowing the population to increase in size and expand its range. Evidence for an incipient population requires detection of ≥1 individual; its absence, on the other hand, must be inferred probabilistically. We use an actual rapid response incident and species-specific detection estimates tied to a known density to calculate the amount of effort (with non-sequential detections) necessary to assert, with a pre-defined confidence, that invasive brown treesnakes are absent from the search area under a wide range of hypothetical population densities. We illustrate that the amount of effort necessary to declare that a species is absent is substantial and increases with decreased individual detection probability, decreased density, and increased level of desired confidence about its absence. Such survey investment would be justified where the cost savings due to early detection are large. Our Poisson-based model application will allow managers to make informed decisions about how long to continue detection efforts, should no additional detections occur, and suggests that effort to do so is significantly higher than previously thought. While our model application informs how long to search to infer absence of an incipient population of brown treesnakes, the approach is sufficiently general to apply to other invasive species if density-dependent detection estimates are known or reliable surrogate estimates are available."

During the fall season, a change in a leaf’s wettability and its impact on the leaf-fall are not well understood. In this study, we measure the surface morphology and wettability of Katsura leaves from the summer to winter, and reveal how leaf structural changes lead to wettability changes. The averaged contact angle of leaves decreases from 147° to 124° while the contact-angle hysteresis significantly increases by about 35°, which are attributed to dehydration and erosion of nano-wax. Due to such wettability changes, fall brown leaves support approximately 17 times greater water volume than summer leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2894103608,"Heavy metal-associated (HMA) domains bind metal ions at its Cys-x-x-Cys (CxxC) motif and constitute an intracellular network for trafficking of metal ions for utilization and detoxification. We thus expect that novel metalloproteins can be identified by screening proteins interacting with a HMA domain. In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of the human proteome and found an uncharacterized protein encoded as open reading frame 123 in chromosome 1 (C1orf123) that can interact specifically with the HMA domain of a copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCSdI). Our X-ray structural analysis of C1orf123 further revealed that it binds a Zn2+ ion in a tetrahedral coordination with four thiolate groups from two conserved CxxC motifs. For the interaction between C1orf123 and CCSdI, the CxxC motifs in both C1orf123 and CCSdI were required, implying metal-mediated interaction through the CxxC motifs. Notably, C1orf123 did not interact with several other HMA domains containing CxxC motifs, supporting high specificity in the interaction between C1orf123 and CCSdI. Based upon these results, we further discuss functional and structural significance of the interaction between C1orf123 and CCS."
https://openalex.org/W2892926802,"Nerve terminals of primary sensory neurons are influenced by their environment through target derived trophic factors, like nerve growth factor (NGF) or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). In mice, subpopulations of DRG neurons express receptors either for NGF or GDNF and therefore differentially respond to these neurotrophic factors. We probed neurite endings from porcine DRG neurons cultured in either NGF or GDNF and examined their shape, elongation and stimulus-evoked CGRP release. A compartmentalized culture system was employed allowing spatial separation of outgrown neurites from their somata and use of different growth factors in the compartments. We show that neurites of GDNF cultured somata extend into lateral compartments without added growth factor, unlike neurites of NGF cultured ones. Neurites of NGF cultured somata extend not only into NGF- but also into GDNF-containing compartments. GDNF at the site of terminals of NGF responsive somata led to a strong neurite arborization and formation of large growth cones, compared to neurites in medium with NGF. Functionally, we could detect evoked CGRP release from as few as 7 outgrown neurites per compartment and calculated release per mm neurite length. CGRP release was detected both in neurites from NGF and GDNF cultured somata, suggesting that also the latter ones are peptidergic in pig. When neurites of NGF cultured somata were grown in GDNF, capsaicin evoked a lower CGRP release than high potassium, compared to those grown in NGF. Our experiments demonstrate that the compartmented culture chamber can be a suitable model to assess neurite properties from trophic factor specific primary sensory neurons. With this model, insights into mechanisms of gain or loss of function of specific nociceptive neurites may be achieved."

Species of this pantropically distributed subgenus generally occur in seasonally or permanently wet grasslands or on shallow soils over sandstone or lateritic outcrops, less often they can be found in (open) woodlands. Previous studies established the monophyly of the subgenus, but the relationships between the species remained uncertain. In this study, DNA sequence data of 61 taxa of Scleria subgen. Hypoporum, where possible represented by multiple accessions from across their distributional range, were obtained for four molecular markers: the coding chloroplast marker ndhF, the chloroplast intron rps16 and the nuclear ribosomal regions ETS and ITS. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood approaches. A species tree was constructed to summarise the results. The results indicate the existence of three sections: the monotypic, pantropically occurring, Scleria sect. Lithospermae, a new section from central and south America containing two species, and Scleria sect. Hypoporum, also pantropically distributed, containing the remainder of the species of the subgenus. Relationships in the latter section are not fully resolved. However, three or four different clades can be distinguished supported by some morphological characters. Our results indicate at least six new species in Scleria sect. Hypoporum. The new section and species are described in a taxonomical treatment. Their morphology is compared with (morphologically) closely related species."

In this study, total soil respiration (RS), autotrophic respiration (RA), heterotrophic respiration (RH), litter respiration (RL), litterfall input and environmental factors were synchronously monitored for 2 years in a subtropical Michelia wilsonii forest of southwestern China. RH rates were often higher than RA rates during the two years except for the middle growing season (from July to September). The mean rate of Rs, RA, RH and RL was 1.94 μmol m-1 s-1, 0.85 μmol m-1 s-1, 1.09 μmol m-1 s-1 and 0.65 μmol m-1 s-1, respectively, during the 2-year experiment. Annual CO2 emission derived from RA, RH and RL was 3.26 Mg C ha-1 a-1, 4.67 Mg C ha-1 a-1 and 2.61 Mg C ha-1 a-1, respectively, which accounted for 41.4%, 58.6% and 32.9% of RS. Over the experimental period, the ratio of RA/RS increased with soil temperature but the opposite was true for RH/RS and RL/RS. The Q10 value was 2.01, 4.01, 1.34 and 1.30, respectively, for RS, RA, RH and RL. Path analysis indicated that environmental variables and litterfall production together explained 82.0%, 86.8%, 42.9% and 34.7% variations of monthly fluxes of RS, RA, RH and RL, respectively.

We performed a prospective cross-sectional study that included thirty-nine consecutive patients with CTEPH (48 ± 15 yrs, 61% female) confirmed by right heart catheterization that underwent an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test, 6-minute walk test and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) measurement. MIP < 70%pred was found in 46% of patients. On a multiple linear regression analysis, MIP was independently associated with 6MWD and . Patients with MIP < 70% presented greater than those with MIP ≥ 70%. Additionally, they also presented stronger sensations of dyspnea throughout exercise, even when adjusted for ventilation. At rest and at different levels of exercise, mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) was significantly higher in patients with MIP < 70%. In conclusion, IMW is associated with a rapid increase of dyspnea, higher inspiratory load and poor exercise capacity in patients with CTEPH."
https://openalex.org/W2893259841,"New therapeutic strategies are needed to treat drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) and to improve treatment for drug sensitive TB. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a critical component of current first-line TB therapy. However, the rise in PZA-resistant TB cases jeopardizes the future utility of PZA. To address this problem, we used the guinea pig model of TB and tested the efficacy of an inhaled dry powder combination, referred to as Pyrazinoic acid/ester Dry Powder (PDP), which is comprised of pyrazinoic acid (POA), the active moiety of PZA, and pyrazinoic acid ester (PAE), which is a PZA analog. Both POA and PAE have the advantage of being able to act on PZA-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. When used in combination with oral rifampicin (R), inhaled PDP had striking effects on tissue pathology. Effects were observed in lungs, the site of delivery, but also in the spleen and liver indicating both local and systemic effects of inhaled PDP. Tissue granulomas that harbor M. tuberculosis in a persistent state are a hallmark of TB and they pose a challenge for therapy. Compared to other treatments, which preferentially cleared non-necrotic granulomas, R+PDP reduced necrotic granulomas more effectively. The increased ability of R+PDP to act on more recalcitrant necrotic granulomas suggests a novel mechanism of action. The results presented in this report reveal the potential for developing therapies involving POA that are optimized to target necrotic as well as non-necrotic granulomas as a means of achieving more complete sterilization of M. tuberculosis bacilli and preventing disease relapse when therapy ends."
https://openalex.org/W2893909870,"The therapeutic application of peptide-based drugs is significantly limited by the rapid proteolytic degradation that occurs when in blood. Encapsulation of these peptide structures within a delivery system, such as liposomes, can greatly improve both stability and target delivery. As part of our work focused on novel ambiphilic mannosylated neoglycolipids as targeted drug delivery systems, we have developed a C14-alkyl-mannopyranoside that forms self-assembled monodisperse liposomes. Herein, these glycoliposomes are investigated as a potential method to improve the plasma stability of peptide-based drugs. Reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) methods were developed to assess the in vitro plasma stability of two structurally diverse peptides, including the kappa opioid receptor selective antagonist dynantin, and the NOD2 innate immune receptor ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP). The RP-HPLC methods developed were able to resolve the peptides from background plasma contaminants and provided suitable response levels and linearity over an appropriate concentration range. Both compounds were found to be significantly degraded in rat plasma. Increasing degrees of both entrapment and stabilization were noted when dynantin was combined with the C14-alkyl-mannopyranoside in increasing peptide:glycoside ratios. The combination of MDP with the glycolipid also led to peptide entrapment, which greatly improved the plasma stability of the peptide. Overall, the results clearly indicate that the stability of peptide-based structures, which are subject to degradation in plasma, can be greatly improved via entrapment within C14-alkyl-mannopyranoside-bearing glycoliposomes."

Retinal vascular parameters were quantitatively measured from retinal photographs using a computer-assisted program (Singapore I Vessel Assessment). The mean age of the population was 54.1 years (range 40 to 81 years). In multiple linear regression analysis, per SD decrease in retinal arteriolar caliber [β = 0.045 (0.003 to 0.086), p = 0.036], per SD increase in retinal venular caliber [β = -0.045 (-0.086 to -0.003), p = 0.036] and per SD increase in arteriolar branching angle [β = -0.039 (-0.072 to -0.006), p = 0.021] were associated with decreased serum lutein. Per SD increase in retinal venular tortuosity [β = -0.0075 (-0.0145 to -0.0004), p = 0.039] and per SD increase in arteriolar branching angle (β = -0.0073 [-0.0142 to -0.0059], p = 0.041) were associated with decreased serum zeaxanthin. None of the other carotenoids demonstrated meaningful relationship with quantitative measures of retinal vasculature.

https://openalex.org/W2892444591,"Behaviour related to patch resource exploitation is a major determinant of individual fitness. Assuming the size-dependency of patch departure behaviour, model-based approaches have shown size-mediated coexistence in systems of competing species. However, experimental evidence for the influence of body size on patch use behaviour is scarce. In this study, we explore whether allometric principles provide an underlying framework for interspecific patterns of resource use. To this end, we propose a meso-cosm approach using three species of gastropods differing in size as a model system and 32P radio-isotopic techniques as a measure of resource use. Foragers of different size were placed in an artificial patch, provided with a limited amount of labelled resource and let them free to move as resources decrease and scarcity is sensed. We investigated the extent to which individual body size affects the exploitation of resources by examining Giving Up Density (GUD), Giving Up Time (GUT), resource absorption rate and exploitation efficiency as components of individual exploitation behaviour. To compare positive, constant and negative individual size scaling of population energy requirements, experimental trials with an equal numbers and equal biomass of differently sized foragers were carried out, and an experimental trial with equal metabolic requirements was simulated. We observed clear size dependency in the patch departure behaviour of the experimental organisms. Even under conditions of equivalent overall population energy requirements, larger foragers decided to leave the resource patch earlier and at a higher density of resources than smaller ones. Smaller foragers were able to prolong their presence and make more use of the resources, resulting in an inverse body-size scaling of resource exploitation efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2894288985,"Following a certain type-specific number of mitotic divisions, terminally differentiated cells undergo proliferative senescence, thwarting efforts to expand different cell populations in vitro for the needs of scientific research or medical therapies. The primary cause of this phenomenon is the progressive shortening of the telomeres and the subsequent activation of cell cycle control pathways leading to a block of cell proliferation. Restoration of telomere length by transgenic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) usually results in bypassing of the replicative senescence and ultimately in cell immortalization. To date, there have not been any reports regarding immortalization of cells from common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), an important non-human primate model for various human diseases, with the use of exogenous human TERT (hTERT). In this study, marmoset fibroblasts were successfully immortalized with transposon-integrated transgenic hTERT and expanded in vitro for over 500 population doublings. Calculation of population doubling levels (PDL) showed that the derived hTERT-transgenic lines had significantly higher proliferation potential than the wild-type fibroblasts, which reached only a maximum of 46 doublings. However, the immortalized cells exhibited differences in the morphology compared with the control fibroblasts and transcriptome analysis also revealed changes in the gene expression patterns. Finally, the karyotypes of all hTERT-transgenic cell lines showed various aberrations such as presence of extra Chromosome 17, isochromosome 21q, or tetraploidy. By single-cell expansion of the least affected monoclonal immortalized line, one sub-clonal line with normal karyotype was established, suggesting the possibility to derive immortal marmoset cells with normal karyotypes. The results of this study are an important step towards the development and optimization of methods for the production of immortalized cells from common marmoset monkeys."

In silico analysis and luciferase reporter assay identified 'G' allele of the 3'UTR located FEN1 polymorphism c.4150G>T as the target for binding of hsa-miR-1236-3p. This study indicates that although FEN1 polymorphisms, c.-69G>A (rs174538) and c.4150G>T (rs4246215) are not genetically associated with FECD, its transcript regulation reported in other diseases such as lung cancer which are genetically associated by rs4246215 could be mediated through miRNA, hsa-miR-1236-3p."
https://openalex.org/W2893079150,"This paper demonstrates the impact of an endemic fossorial animal, plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae), on soil properties and N2O flux at the Zoige Wetland. Pika burrow and control sites without disturbance by pika were selected to measure the soil water content, bulk density, soil organic matter (SOM), NH4-N content and NO3-N content in August 2012. N2O fluxes were measured with static opaque chambers at these sites in June and August 2012. Pika burrowing altered soil aeration by transferring deeper soil to the surface and by constructing underground burrows, which significantly increased bulk density, and reduced soil water content, SOM and NH4-N content at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil depth. N2O flux had a significant correlation with bulk density, SOM and NH4-N content. Pika burrowing significantly influenced N2O flux by increasing N2O flux at the control site from near zero to 0.063±0.011 mg m-2 h-1. Our findings described how pika burrowing influences the soil traits and significantly increases the principal greenhouse gas N2O emission. As plateau pika was commonly considered as a pest, our findings give a novel clue to effectively manage populations of plateau pika on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from the perspective of greenhouse gas emission."
https://openalex.org/W2892820141,"Background The vestibular evoked myogenic potential triggered by galvanic vestibular stimulation (galvanic-VEMP) has been used to assess the function of the vestibulospinal motor tract and is a candidate biomarker to predict and monitor the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) associated myelopathy (HAM). This study determined the agreement and reliability of this exam. Methods Galvanic-VEMP was performed in 96 participants, of which 24 patients presented HAM, 27 HTLV-1-asymptomatic carriers, and 45 HTLV-1-negative asymptomatic controls. Galvanic vestibular stimulation was achieved by passing a binaural and bipolar current at a 2 milliamperes (mA) intensity for 400 milliseconds (ms) between the mastoid processes. Galvanic-VEMP electromyographic wave responses of short latency (SL) and medium latency (ML) were recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle. Intrarater (test-retest) and interrater (two independent examiners) agreement and reliability were assessed by standard error of measurement (SEM), coefficient of repeatability (CR), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Kappa coefficient. Results In the total sample (n = 96), SL and ML medians were 56 ms (IQR 52–66) and 120 ms (IQR 107–130), respectively. The intrarater repeatability measures for SL and ML were, respectively: SEM of 6 and 8 ms; CR of 16 and 22 ms; ICC of 0.80 (p<0.001) and 0.91 (p<0.001); and a Kappa coefficient of 0.53 (p<0.001) and 0.82 (p<0.001). The interrater reproducibility measures for SL and ML were, respectively: SEM of 3 and 10 ms; CR of 8 and 27 ms; ICC of 0.95 (p<0.001) and 0.86 (p<0.001); and a Kappa coefficient of 0.77 (p<0.001) and 0.88 (p<0.001). Conclusion Galvanic-VEMP is a reliable and reproducible method to define the integrity of the vestibulospinal tract. Longitudinal studies will clarify its validity in the clinical context, aimed at achieving an early diagnosis and the monitoring of HAM."
https://openalex.org/W2893112880,"The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) has been investigated for treating cancers and many other diseases as well as enhancing the reprogramming efficiency in cloned embryos for decades. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two novel HDAC inhibitors, i.e., HDACi-14 and -79, at the concentrations of 0, 1, 2, or 4 μM on the development of embryos cloned by the oocyte bisection cloning technique (OBCT). Blastocyst rates for the reconstructed embryos reached 60% in the 2 μM HDACi-14-treated groups, which was higher (P < 0.05) compared to the untreated group (36.9%). Similarly, HDACi-79 treatment at 2 and 4 μM also conferred higher (P < 0.05) blastocyst rates than that of the untreated group (79.4, 74.2, and 50.0%, respectively). Both HDACi-14 and -79 treatments had no beneficial effect on total cell numbers and apoptotic indices of cloned embryos (P > 0.05). Histone acetylation profile by both HDACi-14 (2 μM) and -79 (2 μM) treatments demonstrated a drastic increase (P < 0.05) mainly in two-cell stage embryos when compared to the control group. After seeding on the feeder cells, the aggregated cloned blastocysts produced by the HDACi-79 treatment showed a significant increase of primary outgrowths compared to the control group (60.0% vs. 42.9%; P < 0.05). Finally, the cloned embryo-derived ES cell lines from aggregated cloned embryos produced from the HDACi-79-treated, HDACi-14-treated and control groups were established (5, 3, and 2 lines, respectively). In conclusion, the novel histone deacetylation inhibitors improve blastocyst formation and potentially increase the derivation efficiency of ES cell lines from the cloned porcine embryos produced in vitro. Depending on the purposes, some fine-tuning may be required to maximize its beneficial effects of these newly synthesized chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2894176296,"Pituitary adenoma is a common intracranial neoplasm that is observed in approximately 10% of unselected individuals at autopsy. Prolactin-producing adenomas, i.e., prolactinomas, comprise approximately 50% of all pituitary adenomas and represent the most common class of pituitary tumor. Multiple observations suggest that estrogens may contribute to development of prolactinoma; however, direct evidence for a causal role of estrogens in prolactinoma etiology is lacking. Rat models of estrogen-induced prolactinoma have been utilized extensively to identify the factors, pathways and processes that are involved in pituitary tumor development. The objective of this study was to localize to high resolution Ept7 (Estrogen-induced pituitary tumor), a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that controls lactotroph responsiveness to estrogens and was mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7) in an intercross between BN and ACI rats. Data presented and discussed herein localize the Ept7 causal variant(s) to a 1.91 Mb interval of RNO7 that contains two protein coding genes, A1bg and Myc, and Pvt1, which yields multiple non-protein coding transcripts of unknown function. The Ept7 orthologous region in humans is located at 8q24.21 and has been linked in genome wide association studies to risk of 8 distinct epithelial cancers, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers; 3 distinct types of B cell lymphoma; multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases; and orofacial cleft defects. In addition, the Ept7 locus in humans has been associated with variation in normal hematologic and development phenotypes, including height. Functional characterization of Ept7 should ultimately enhance our understanding of the genetic etiology of prolactinoma and these other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2893712697,"Slime mold species in the genus Dictyostelium are considered to have a close relationship with non-parasitic nematodes; they are sympatric in soils and can exhibit interspecific competition for food. We investigated whether this relationship extends to a plant-parasitic nematode that is active in the rhizosphere and has broad host specificity, damaging crops worldwide. Using a novel assay to examine the interaction between the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, and the plant-parasitic nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., we found that cellular slime molds can repel plant parasitic nematodes. Specifically, the repulsion activity was in response to chemical compounds released by cellular slime mold fruiting bodies. Under laboratory conditions, these soluble chemical extracts from fruiting bodies of D. discoideum showed repulsion activity strong enough to protect plant roots. The fruiting body cell extracts repelled but were not toxic to the plant-parasitic nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2892707389,"The complexity and severity of traumatic wounds in military and civilian trauma demands improved wound assessment, before, during, and after treatment. Here, we explore the potential of 3 charge-coupled device (3CCD) imaging values to distinguish between traumatic wounds that heal following closure and those that fail. Previous studies demonstrate that normalized 3CCD imaging values exhibit a high correlation with oxygen saturation and allow for comparison of values between diverse clinical settings, including utilizing different equipment and lighting.We screened 119 patients at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and at Grady Memorial Hospital with at least one traumatic extremity wound of ≥ 75 cm2. We collected images of each wound during each débridement surgery for a total of 66 patients. An in-house written computer application selected a region of interest in the images, separated the pixel color values, calculated relative values, and normalized them. We followed patients until the enrolled wounds were surgically closed, quantifying the number of wounds that dehisced (defined as wound failure or infection requiring return to the operating room after closure) or healed.Wound failure occurred in 20% (19 of 96) of traumatic wounds. Normalized intensity values for patients with wounds that healed successfully were, on average, significantly different from values for patients with wounds that failed (p ≤ 0.05). Simple thresholding models and partial least squares discriminant analysis models performed poorly. However, a hierarchical cluster analysis model created with 17 variables including 3CCD data, wound surface area, and time from injury predicts wound failure with 76.9% sensitivity, 76.5% specificity, 76.6% accuracy, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 2.6-45.9).Imaging using 3CCD technology may provide a non-invasive and cost-effective method of aiding surgeons in deciding if wounds are ready for closure and could potentially decrease the number of required débridements and hospital days. The process may be automated to provide real-time feedback in the operating room and clinic. The low cost and small size of the cameras makes this technology attractive for austere and shipboard environments where space and weight are at a premium."
https://openalex.org/W2893853356,"Phosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau is an important modulator of its normal physiological functioning; however, it may also contribute to tau mis-folding and aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases, which are collectively termed tauopathies. As such, the investigations of tau phosphorylation and kinases that modify tau are important in trying to elucidate tau function and the mechanisms involved in the development of tauopathies. We have recently demonstrated that the putative tau kinase leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 is capable of phosphorylating tau at threonines 169 and 175 in vitro, and it has been previously shown that hyperphosphorylation at threonine 175 occurs in filamentous tau species from Alzheimer's brain tissue. These prior findings suggest that further studies of phosphorylation of tau at these epitopes may shed light on the pathogenesis of tauopathies. There is, however, a lack of tools available to analyze phosphorylation of tau at these sites. This study aimed to bridge that resource gap by generating monoclonal antibodies against tau phosphorylated at either threonine 169 or 175. While we did not succeed in generating a phospho-specific antibody, we did generate an antibody, MHT2, which is specific for human tau encompassing the threonine 169/175 epitope region. Immunostaining of transgenic rTg4510 mouse tissue as well as human tauopathy cases with MHT2 indicates that this antibody selectively detects cytoplasmic tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, and that it may have a further specificity pertaining to severity of disease progression, either because of phosphorylation or conformational bias."
