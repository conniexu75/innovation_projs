https://openalex.org/W1552555281,"The natural contamination of drinking water by arsenic needs to be urgently addressed. The pollution by naturally occurring arsenic of alluvial Ganges aquifers, which are used for the public water supply in Bangladesh and West Bengal, has been discussed by Nickson et al.1. We agree with their main conclusion that arsenic is released by reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides, as was proposed earlier2. Our observations indicate that arsenic- rich pyrite and other arsenic minerals, which were proposed in previous models (cited by Nickson et al.1) to give rise to arsenic pollution, are rare or even absent in the sediments of the Ganges delta. We believe that arsenic is more likely to be co-precipitated with or scavenged by iron (III) and manganese (IV) in the sedimentary environment."

https://openalex.org/W2030262603,"The t(11;18) (q21;q21) translocation is a characteristic chromosomal aberration in low-grade B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. We previously identified a YAC clone y789F3, which includes the breakpoint at 18q21 in a MALT lymphoma patient. BAC and PAC contigs were constructed on the YAC, and BAC 193f9 was found to encompass the breakpoint region. In the present study, we further narrowed down the breakpoint region at 18q21 in five MALT lymphoma patients by means of FISH and Southern blot analyses using the plasmid contig constructed from BAC 193f9. The breakpoints at 18q21 in three of the five MALT lymphoma patients were found to be clustered approximately within the 20 kb region. By using exon amplification and cDNA library screening, we identified a novel cDNA spanning the breakpoint region that exhibited aberrant mRNA signals in four of the five MALT lymphoma patients. The nucleotide sequence predicted an 813 amino acid protein that shows significant sequence similarity to the CD22β and laminin 5 α3b subunit. We refer to the gene encoding this transcript as MALT1 (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1). The alteration of MALT1 by translocation strongly suggests that this gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma."

https://openalex.org/W2335197400,"Previous studies have shown that the oncogenic HPV E6 proteins form a complex with the human homologue of the Drosophila tumour suppressor protein, discs large (Dlg). This is mediated by the carboxy terminus of the E6 proteins and involves recognition of at least one PDZ domain of Dlg. This region of E6 is not conserved amongst E6 proteins from the low risk papillomavirus types and, hence, binding of HPV E6 proteins to Dlg correlates with the oncogenic potential of these viruses. We have performed studies to investigate the consequences of the interaction between E6 and Dlg. Mutational analysis of both the HPV18 E6 and Dlg proteins has further defined the regions of E6 and Dlg necessary for complex formation. Strikingly, co-expression of wild type HPV18 E6 with Dlg in vitro or in vivo results in a dramatic decrease in the amount of Dlg protein, whereas mutants of E6 which fail to complex with Dlg have minimal effect on Dlg protein levels. The oncogenic HPV16 E6 also decreased the Dlg levels, but this was not observed with the low risk HPV11 E6 protein. Moreover, a region within the first 544 amino acids of Dlg containing the three PDZ domains confers susceptibility to E6 mediated degradation. Finally, treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor overrides the capacity of E6 to degrade Dlg. These results demonstrate that Dlg is targeted by high risk HPV E6 proteins for proteasome mediated degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2021360464,"Death Effector Domains (DEDs) have been known to mediate the recruitment of Caspase 8 and its homologs to the aggregated death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), consisting of the death domain (DD)-containing receptors and various signaling proteins. In addition, several viruses were recently shown to encode proteins with DEDs (also called FLICE inhibitory proteins or vFLIPs) which have the ability of blocking cell death induced by DD-containing receptors. We provide evidence that vFLIPs can also modulate the NF-κB pathway and physically interact with several signaling proteins, such as the TRAFs, RIP, NIK and the IKKs. Modulation of the NF-κB pathway may play a role in the natural history of infection by these viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1991263063,"We have examined the effects of human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 proteins on interferon (IFN) signaling. Here we show that expression of the `malignant' HPV-18 E6 in human HT1080 cells results in inhibition of Jak-STAT activation in response to IFN-α but not IFN-γ. This inhibitory effect is not shared by the `benign' HPV-11 E6. The DNA-binding and transactivation capacities of the transcription factor ISGF3 are diminished in cells expressing HPV-18 E6 after IFN-α treatment as a result of decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2, STAT2 and STAT1. However, HPV-18 E6 does not affect the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding of STAT1 by IFN-γ. In addition, HPV E6 proteins physically interact with Tyk2. This interaction takes place preferably with HPV-18 E6 and to a lesser extent with HPV-11 E6. The E6/Tyk2 interaction requires the JH6-JH7 domains of Tyk2, which are important for Tyk2 binding to the cytoplasmic portion of IFN-α receptor 1 (IFNAR1). These findings demonstrate an inhibitory role of HPV-18 E6 in the IFN-α-induced Jak-STAT pathway, which may be explained, at least in part, by the ability of E6 to interact with and impair Tyk2 activation."

https://openalex.org/W2091506455,"Focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) is present at sites of cell/extracellular matrix adhesion and has been implicated in the control of cell behaviour. In particular, as a key component of integrin-stimulated signal transduction pathways, pp125FAK is involved in cellular processes such as spreading, motility, growth and survival. In addition, a number of reports have indicated that pp125FAK may be up-regulated in human tumour cells of diverse origin, and consequently, a role has been proposed for pp125FAK in the development of invasive cancers. However, to date the mechanisms that lead to elevated pp125FAK expression in tumour cells have not been determined. Here we used in situ hybridization to confirm chromosome 8q as the genomic location of the human fak gene and report that elevation of pp125FAK protein in cell lines derived from invasive squamous cell carcinomas is accompanied by gains in copy number of the fak gene in all cases examined. In addition, we observed increased fak copy number in frozen sections of squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, increased dosage of the fak gene was also observed in many cell lines derived from human tumours of lung, breast and colon, including two cell lines Calu3 and HT29, in which fak was amplified. In addition, in an in vitro model for human colon cancer progression there was a copy number gain of the fak gene during conversion from adenoma to carcinoma, which was associated with increased pp125FAK protein expression. Thus, we show for the first time that many cell lines derived from invasive epithelial tumours have increased dosage of the fak gene, which may contribute to the elevated protein expression commonly observed. Although other genes near the fak locus are co-amplified or increased in copy number, including the proto-oncogene c-myc, the biological properties of pp125FAK in controlling the growth, survival and invasiveness of tumour cells, suggest that it may contribute to the selection pressure for maintaining increased dosage of the region of chromosome 8q that encodes these genes."

https://openalex.org/W2332110860,"The high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7 protein affects cell growth control and promotes transformation by interfering with functions of cellular proteins. A key target of E7 is the tumor suppressor protein p105RB. Although this interaction is required for E7-dependent transformation, other cellular molecules must also be involved, because some E7 mutants that have reduced transforming abilities still bind to p105RB. In order to identify additional proteins that interact with E7 and that may be responsible to mediate its transforming function, we have used the C-terminal half of E7 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified the fork head domain transcription factor M phase phosphoprotein 2 (MPP2) as an interaction partner of E7. Specific interaction of the two proteins both in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells was detected. The interaction of MPP2 with E7 is functionally relevant since MPP2 enhances the E7/Ha-Ras co-transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts. In addition HPV16 E7, but neither non-transforming mutants of HPV16 E7 nor low risk HPV6 E7, was able to stimulate MPP2-specific transcriptional activity. Thus, MPP2 is a potentially important target for E7-mediated transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1994962805,"p21-activated kinase (PAK) is a common effector protein of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, leading to the activation of downstream mitogen activated protein kinases. PAK also mediates polarized cytoskeletal changes induced by these GTPases. The recently identified PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor on Rac, and colocalizes with PAK in a focal complex, but little is known about the associated signaling cascades, including upstream activators of PIX. In this study, we show that one of the isoforms of PIX, αPIX, is activated by signaling cascades from the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and EphB2 receptor, and from integrin-induced signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). αPIX is activated by forming a complex with these receptors either via association with PAK and Nck, or direct association with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase. Synthetic phosphoinositide and membrane targeted PI3-kinase augmented the αPIX activity in vivo. In Xenopus, aggregates of mesodermal cells derived from embryos microinjected with αPIX significantly increased the peripheral spreading on fibronectin substrate in response to PDGF through PI3-kinase. These results indicate that αPIX is activated by PI3-kinase, and is involved in the receptor mediated signaling leading to the activation of the kinase activity of PAK, and the migration of mesodermal cells on extracellular matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2317412573,"Recently, we described a new biological function of p53 in inhibiting recombination processes when encountering mismatches in heteroduplexes (Dudenhöffer et al., 1998). Here, we characterized protein domains of p53 participating in this process by in vitro analysis of mutated p53 proteins, and by applying our SV40-based assay system on monkey cells, which express different p53 variants. We present evidence that both binding of artificial recombination intermediates and p53-dependent recombination control require an intact p53 core and the oligomerization domain, strongly suggesting that the recognition of DNA undergoing recombination represents an essential step of this genomic surveillance mechanism. Further analyses indicated a role of the C-terminus in negatively regulating recombination control, an effect which can be neutralized by concurrent mismatch recognition. p53 lacking the oligomerization domain totally lost its ability to suppress homologous recombination. The cancer-related mutant p53(273H) was also significantly defective in this function, although we observed only twofold reductions in the corresponding transactivation activities on p53-response elements in episomal constructs. HDM2, an inhibitor of p53's transcriptional and growth regulatory activities, interfered with the inhibition of DNA exchange processes by p53 only weakly. Thus, functions of p53 in recombination control can be structurally dissociated from p53-dependent transcriptional transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2334524089,"CEACAM1, also known as C-CAM, BGP and CD66a, is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family which is itself part of the immunoglobulin supergene family. CEACAM1 is involved in intercellular adhesion, signal transduction and tumor cell growth regulation. CEACAM1 is down-regulated in colon and prostate carcinomas, as well as in endometrial, bladder and hepatic tumors, and 30% of breast cancers. We have shown in a mouse colon tumor model that CEACAM1 with a long cytoplasmic domain inhibited the development of tumors whereas a splice variant lacking the cytoplasmic domain did not. In this study, we define the subregions of the long cytoplasmic domain participating in the tumor inhibition phenotype of CEACAM1. We show that a single point mutation of Tyr488, conforming to an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine Inhibition Motif (ITIM), was sufficient to reverse the in vivo tumor cell growth inhibition. Substitution or deletion of residues in the C-terminal region of the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain also led to reversal of tumor cell growth inhibition. This result is in agreement with our previous studies demonstrating the C-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain influences the levels of CEACAM1 Tyr phosphorylation and its association with the protein Tyr phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Furthermore, removal of the N-terminal domain of CEACAM1, essential for intercellular adhesion, did not impair the tumor inhibitory effect. These results suggest that Tyr phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain represents a crucial step in the control of epithelial cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2319273072,"Most modern chemo- and radiotherapy treatments of human cancers use the DNA damage pathway, which induces a p53 response leading to either G1 arrest or apoptosis. However, such treatments can induce mutations and translocations leading to secondary malignancies or recurrent disease, which often have a poor prognosis because of resistance to therapy. Here we report that 5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), an inhibitor of CDK7 TFIIH-associated kinase, CKI and CKII kinases, blocking RNA polymerase II in the early elongation stage, triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in human colon adenocarcinoma cells in a transcription independent manner. The fact that DRB kills tumour-derived cells without employment of DNA damage gives rise to the possibility of the development of a new alternative chemotherapeutic treatment of tumours expressing wild type p53, with a decreased risk of therapy-related, secondary malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2331943142,"The mammalian colon develops from a simple tube of undifferentiated cells into a complex, highly ordered organ, with a continuously self-renewing epithelial layer. We have previously described c-Myb expression in the epithelia of murine and human colon crypts and documented increased expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. To investigate the role of c-Myb in colonic epithelium development, we have used embryos with a disrupted c-myb gene. Prior to the in utero death of these embryos at E15, we excised colon tissue and transplanted it under the kidney capsule of recipient mice to allow further development and cyto-differentiation. Compared to the colons of wildtype and heterozygous littermates, the c-myb homozygous knockout colon is highly irregular with a disordered epithelium and abnormal crypts. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2, a known target of c-Myb, is reduced and apoptosis is increased, indicating a critical requirement for c-Myb in normal colon development."
https://openalex.org/W1999691484,"The cellular response to ionizing radiation (IR) includes the induction of apoptosis. The p300/CBP proteins possess histone acetyltransferase activity and function as transcriptional coactivators of p53. We have prepared cells deficient in p300 or CBP to define the roles of these proteins in the cellular response to DNA damage. The present results demonstrate that p300, but not CBP, contributes to IR sensitivity of cells. The results also demonstrate that IR-induced apoptosis is impaired in the p300-, but not CBP-, deficient cells. These findings indicate that p300 functions in the apoptotic response to DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2332357435,"Retinoids signal biological effects through retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) and their co-regulators. We previously reported that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) triggers terminal differentiation in the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTERA-2 clone D1 (NT2/D1), through an RARgamma dependent pathway. RARgamma repression in NT2/D1-R1 cells accounts for RA resistance in this line. This report finds RARgamma repression is due to selective repression of RARgamma but not RARbeta transcription in NT2/D1-R1 cells. The repression is neither due to mutations in RARgamma nor its promoter containing the RA response element. Prior work was confirmed and extended by demonstrating that an RARgamma selective agonist preferentially signals differentiation of NT2/D1 cells, while RARalpha/beta, RARbeta, RXR agonists and an RAR pan-antagonist do not even when NT2/D1 cells are treated with these retinoids at 10 microM dosages. None of these examined retinoids induced differentiation of the RA resistant NT2/D1-R1 cells. In contrast, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR), a reported transcriptional activator of RARgamma was shown to potently induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in both NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells. 4HPR-induced apoptosis was unaffected by co-treatment of both cell lines with equimolar RAR antagonist. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT - PCR) assays of total RNA from 4HPR-treated NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells did not reveal RARgamma induction. Since 4HPR signals in RA-resistant NT2/D1-R1 cells having an RARgamma transcriptional block, these results indicate that 4HPR triggers apoptosis but not differentiation through an RARgamma independent pathway. Taken together, these findings implicate a therapeutic role for 4HPR mediated apoptosis in germ cell tumors even when a maturation block is present."
https://openalex.org/W2319050879,"gamma-heregulin is a recently described novel isoform of the heregulin/neuregulin class of EGF-like ligands that bind to and activate receptors of the ErbB family. Deregulated signaling through the heregulin-ErbB pathway is thought to be implicated in the development of a subset of human breast cancers. gamma-heregulin has been found to be expressed in the culture supernatant of MDA-MB-175, a breast carcinoma cell line. gamma-heregulin is characterized by the presence of a large N-terminal peptide extension that is not found in other heregulin isoforms. Here we report that this unique N-terminal extension of gamma-heregulin is identical to the N-terminus of DOC4, a product of a recently identified CHOP-dependent stress-induced gene. Human DOC4 and the heregulin-encoding genes map to different chromosomes and the MDA-MB-175 cell line contains a chromosomal translocation that leads to the fusion of DOC4 and HGL, on chromosomes 11 and 8, respectively. Thus, gamma-heregulin is a product of a mutant fusion gene and not a bona fide normal isoform. We speculate that the mutation may be selected for by virtue of its ability to activate ErbB signaling through the production of an autocrine ligand."

https://openalex.org/W2326919835,"The MDR1 gene encoding the multidrug pump P-glycoprotein is transcriptionally activated in response to diverse extracellular stimuli, including the tumor promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). However, the signal transduction pathway responsible is unknown. Downstream of protein kinase C (PKC), the effects of TPA are often mediated by the Raf-1/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and Raf-1 has been implicated in MDR1 induction by serum and mitogens. Therefore, we examined the potential role of MAPK activation in TPA-mediated MDR1 induction in human leukemia K562 cells. MDR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased by TPA in the concentration range of 4 - 100 nM, with a maximal response 5 - 10 h after TPA addition. TPA-mediated MDR1 induction was inhibited by several PKC inhibitors including staurosporine, H7 and calphostin C. TPA stimulated the subcellular translocation of PKCalpha from the cytosol to the membrane and nucleus but did not affect other PKC isozymes. TPA also activated the Raf1/MEK/ERK cascade and activated another MAPK member, p38, but not JNK. In order to determine the potential role of MAPKs in MDR1 induction by TPA, specific inhibitors were utilized. The MEK inhibitor PD 098059, as well as the PKC inhibitors, completely blocked TPA-mediated ERK activation. However, under identical conditions, MDR1 induction by TPA was completely unaffected by PD 098059. Furthermore, SB 202190, which effectively inhibited TPA-mediated p38 activation, failed to inhibit TPA-induced MDR1 mRNA expression. These data demonstrate that MDR1 induction by TPA occurs via a PKC-dependent mechanism that operates independently of ERK, p38 or JNK pathways, and thus have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of MDR1 induction by extracellular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2322917436,"Experiments previously performed on 32D and C2C12 cell lines indicated that wild type p53 (wtp53) protein has a role in granulocyte and myotube differentiation. Since these are immortal cells, we asked whether the inhibition of differentiation induced by the expression of dominant-negative p53 (dnp53) proteins was dependent on the immortalization-determined microenvironment. Thus, we evaluated the effects produced by interfering with the endogenous p53 gene in murine primary hemopoietic and muscle cells. Expression of dnp53 protein reduced the differentiation of bone marrow cells into granulocytes and macrophages. Moreover, p53 activation was measurable during the differentiation process of primary myoblasts, while interference with this activation led to a consistent slow down of terminal differentiation. Since the impairment of the differentiation was not accompanied by alterations in the cell cycle withdrawal and in the rate of apoptosis which are coupled with these types of differentiation, the data here reported support a specific role for p53 in the differentiation process. However, the difference in the intensity of inhibition between immortal and primary cells, i.e., complete versus slow down, respectively, suggests that the immortalization process might render the cells more sensitive to the loss of wtp53 activity for the differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2312752335,"E-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion molecule expressed predominantly by epithelial cells. Reduction or loss of E-cadherin immunoreactivity has been associated with tumour progression in many epithelial cancers, including bladder carcinomas. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b) recognized specifically by FGF7 is expressed only by epithelial cells. Recently, decreased expression of FGFR2b protein and mRNA was found to be associated with tumour progression in bladder carcinomas. The purpose of this investigation was to look for a possible relationship between E-cadherin and FGFR2b expression in bladder carcinomas. As decreased E-cadherin immunoreactivity was found to correlate directly with decreased expression at the mRNA level, the possible relationship between E-cadherin and FGFR2b was investigated at the mRNA level using semi-quantitative RT - PCR in 92 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) and four lymph node metastases. All tumours with low E-cadherin expression had low expression of FGFR2b, whereas tumours with low FGFR2b mRNA could express any level of E-cadherin mRNA. The same observation was equally valid for bladder and colon cancer cell lines suggesting that, besides bladder tumours, this relationship could apply to other carcinomas types. These results suggest that a relationship exists between the transcription of the E-cadherin and FGFR2b genes preventing high expression of FGFR2b where expression of E-cadherin is low. We suggest that reduced expression of FGFR2b in conjunction with decreased expression of E-cadherin may contribute to the aggressive behaviour attributable to high grade TCCs."

https://openalex.org/W1972652514,"The trkA proto-oncogene encodes a high-affinity NGF receptor that is essential for the survival, differentiation and maintenance of many neural and non-neural cell types. Altered expression of the trkA gene or trkA receptor malfunction have been implicated in neurodegeneration, tumor progression and oncogenesis. We have cloned and characterized the 5' region of the mouse trkA gene and have identified its promoter. trkA promoter sequences are GC-rich, lack genuine TATA or CAAT boxes, and are contained within a CpG island which extends over the entire first coding exon. The mouse trkA transcription start site is located 70/71 bp upstream to the AUG translation initiation codon. Sequence analysis showed that the gene encoding the insulin receptor-related receptor, IRR, is located just 1.6 kbp upstream to the trkA gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction. We have used trkA-CAT transcriptional fusions to study trkA promoter function in transient transfection experiments. RNase protection assays and CAT protein ELISA analyses showed that a 150 bp long DNA segment, immediately upstream to the start site, is sufficient to direct accurate transcription in trkA-expressing cells. Dissection of this fragment allowed us to identify a 13 bp cis-regulatory element essential for both promoter activity and cell-type specific expression. Deletion of this 13 bp segment as well as modification of its sequence by site-directed mutagenesis led to a dramatic decline in promoter activity. Gel mobility shift assays carried out with double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the 13 bp element revealed several specific DNA-protein complexes when nuclear extracts from trkA-expressing cells were used. Supershift experiments showed that the Sp1 transcription factor was a component of one of these complexes. Our results identify a minimal trkA gene promoter, located very close to the transcription start site, and define a 13 bp enhancer within this promoter sequence."

We identified a novel 32-nucleotide exon (exon alpha) within intron 5 and an alternative splice acceptor site in exon 6, splitting exon 6 into two segments: 6A and 6B. Therefore, in addition to wild type (wt) proTGF-alpha mRNA, which skips exon alpha, two novel proTGF-alpha variants are produced: Variant I (VaI), skipping exons alpha and 6A, and Variant II (VaII) which includes exon alpha and skips exon 6A. The only significant difference between variant and wt proTGF-alpha proteins is that the two wt carboxyl-terminal valines are replaced in the variants by five or four other amino acids, respectively. Both variant TGF-alpha mRNAs were readily detected in human keratinocytes and tumor-derived cell lines. Their protein products were cleaved as efficiently as wt TGF-alpha in response to the calcium ionophore A23187. However, both variants (but not wt) reduced serum requirements for proliferation in CHO cells. In addition, VaII-expressing CHO cells (not VaI or wt) formed foci in monolayer cultures. These results suggest that variant TGF-alpha precursors induce autonomous growth."

https://openalex.org/W1546061042,"The GABAA receptor mediates the sedative and anxiety-reducing effects of ethanol. Although ethanol can potentiate GABAA receptor function, the effects are variable, and it has been suggested that the receptor's sensitivity to ethanol may depend on its phosphorylation state. In this issue (pages 997−1002), Hodge and colleagues show that one isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) mediates both the behavioral and biochemical response to ethanol by phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor. The authors found that mutant mice lacking PKC show markedly reduced ethanol self-administration compared to wild-type mice, and are much more sensitive to the acute behavioral effects of ethanol. Biochemically, these effects are associated with an increased GABAA receptor sensitivity. Because the mutant mice consume less ethanol, the authors suggest that inhibitors of PKC may be useful for treating alcoholism. Interestingly, the mutants also showed normal locomotor activity and did not appear to be sleepy or sedated. Inhibitors of PKC could therefore also be a non-sedating alternative to enhance GABAA function when treating disorders such as anxiety or epilepsy."
