https://openalex.org/W2063008299,"Phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chain of myosin is closely correlated with cross-bridge cycling in arterial smooth muscle. Evidence is presented that dephosphorylation can produce an attached, noncycling cross-bridge (latch-bridge) which is responsible for the high economy of force maintenance in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2091400786,"The cores of the microvilli present on intestinal epithelial cells are currently the only microfilament arrangement which can be isolated ultrastructurally intact and in sufficient quantities for biochemical analysis. We have isolated and characterized villin, a major protein of the microvillus core. Using villin's ability to bind very tightly to immobilized monomeric actin in a calcium-dependent manner, we have developed a method for its rapid purification by affinity chromatography on G actin, which itself was bound to immobilized pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I (DNAase I). The villin-G actin complex on DNAase I is resistant to high ionic strength, and villin, but not actin, is released when the calcium concentration is less than 106 M. Purified villin behaves as a globular monomeric protein of molecular weight 95,000, and is free of carbohydrate. Villin also interacts with F actin. In the absence of calcium, villin cross-links F actin having the properties of an F actin bundling or gelation factor. In the presence of calcium (>10−7 M), villin apparently restricts the polymerization of actin to short filaments which cannot be readily sedimented. The properties of villin are not compatible with its previously suggested role as the cross-filament between the microvillus microfilament core and the plasma membrane, but rather indicate a function as a calcium-dependent F actin-bundling protein. The role of villin is discussed in terms of the other protein components of the microvillus core and in relation to recently described calcium-dependent gelation factors."

https://openalex.org/W1497924644,"Thrombin-catalyzed activation of Protein C is accelerated by a human endothelial cell surface cofactor. The cofactor occurs also on mouse hemangioma cells (a transformed endothelial cell line), but not on cultured human smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts. The cofactor remains bound to the cell surface during Protein C activation. The cofactor is saturable with respect to both Protein C (Km = 0.72 +/- 0.07 microM) and thrombin (Km = 0.48 +/- 0.05 nM). Diisopropylphosphoryl-thrombin is a competitive inhibitor of the cofactor-dependent reaction with Ki = 0.56 +/- 0.1 nM. Prothrombin Fragment 1, the peptide derived from prothrombin that retains phospholipid binding capacity, does not inhibit activation of Protein C when present in a 7:1 molar excess over Protein C. Platelet Factor 4 (20 microgram/ml) also fails to inhibit Protein C activation. It is concluded that the endothelial cell provides a surface on which Protein C can be activated under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2092444003,"Living cultured fibroblasts were microinjected with rhodamine-labeled smooth muscle alpha-actinin and visualized by video-intensified fluorescence microscopy. The alpha-actinin incorporated into the stress fibers and exhibited a regularly striped arrangement. The fluorescently labeled stress fibers remained intact despite glycerol or digitonin extraction of the cells; furthermore, these cell models contracted upon addition of MgATP. During this process, sections of alpha-actinin-labeled stress fibers contracted up to 25%; shortening proceeded in the nonfluorescent part of the stress fiber sarcomeres. In glycerol-extracted cell models, adenylylimidodiphosphate, ADP and pyrophosphate inhibited but vanadate, N-ethylmaleimide-modified heavy meromyosin, cytochalasin B, colchicine, phalloidin and DNAase I did not. Cytochalasin B was inhibitory when added to the intact cells before glycerol extraction. These morphological and biochemical findings demonstrate that stress fiber sarcomeres of fibroblasts are contractile elements and support the concept that an actomyosin system may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1558484374,"The temporal changes in human platelet actin polymerization, cytoskeletal morphology, and protein content that occur during thrombin-induced platelet activation were investigated by analysis of Triton-extracted platelets. Measurement of the DNase inhibitory activity of control platelets immediately after adding an equal volume of 2% Triton X-100, 10 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, showed that approximately 50% of the actin in unstimulated platelets was filamentous and unable to inhibit DNase-catalyzed hydrolysis of DNA. Activation of platelets with thrombin for 15 s caused the amount of actin in the filamentous form to increase to approximately 65%. Examination of the morphology and protein composition of these filamentous structures showed that the cytoskeletal structures from control platelets consisted of a random array of filaments which contained 14% of the total platelet myosin and 6% of the total actin-binding protein. In contrast, the cytoskeletal structures of thrombin-activated platelets appeared as cytoskeletal structures of individual platelets. The composition of these cytoskeletons varied depending on the time of thrombin activation. Those from platelets activated with thrombin for 15 to 30 s contained 90% of the platelet myosin and 20% of the platelets with thrombin before Triton addition resulted in a decreased association of myosin to 60% with no change in either the actin or actin-binding protein content of the cytoskeletal structures. Since these changes are rapid and precede serotonin secretion, it is suggested that they are involved in the physiological response of the platelet."

https://openalex.org/W2046826725,"Acridine fluorescence reveals polyribosomes in fibroblasts and Triton-extracted skeletal frameworks; simultaneous phase-contrast images show cellular structure. Polyribosomes appear near nuclei of both intact fibroblasts and skeletal frameworks. Simultaneous autoradiography of cells so examined locates radioactive proteins. After synthesis, most proteins diffuse rapidly through the cytoplasm; intact cells autoradiographed after a 35S pulse show grains throughout. In sharp contrast, extraction with Triton leaves only radioactive skeletal proteins, which, although released from ribosomes, are near polyribosomes after a pulse. After a chase, skeletal-associated radioactivity is found throughout the framework structure. However, skeletal proteins migrate only if protein synthesis continues. Emetine administered following a pulse blocks protein migration; skeletal framework radio-activity remains near polyribosomes. This also indicates limited exchange between skeletal framework and soluble cytoplasmic proteins. The fact that proteins insert themselves into the skeletal framework at or near their synthesis site, with limited subsequent exchange, appears to contradict current views of protein self-assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2073975294,"We have studied the mechanism of Ca++-dependent restriction of actin filament length by villin, one of the major actin-associated proteins of intestinal microvilli microfilament bundles. Villin acts, even at a ratio of 1 to 1000 with respect to actin, very efficiently as a Ca++-dependent nucleation factor on actin assembly. This gives rise to unidirectional assembly, with the morphologically defined “barbed” end of the resulting filament being capped. Consequently, at steady state treadmilling of actin monomers through the filament is inhibited. Increase of the villin-to-actin ratio enhances the number of nucleated filaments necessarily shorter in length. This results finally in nonsedimentable F actin and a low molecular weight complex of one villin and three monomeric actins, which itself is a potent nucleator. Thus restriction of actin assembly by villin is not due to a direct inhibition of assembly but arises as the consequence of strongly enhanced nucleation followed by unidirectional elongation at the pointed end of the nucleated filaments. In addition, in the presence of Ca++-villin, but not the villin-actin complex, seems able to “break” or “sever” preformed F actin filaments. Thus a variety of cellular phenomena—nucleation, unidirectional assembly, filament end capping, nonpolymerizable actin and F actin bundles—can be observed in vitro in a two-protein component system modulated by the concentration of free Ca++."
https://openalex.org/W2004365967,"By shadowing specimens dried onto mice sheets we have obtained clear images of actin crosslinked by spectrin, an actin-binding protein found in erythrocytes. We conclude that spectrin dimers possess a single binding site for F actin. Tetramers formed by head-to-head association of two dimers possess two actin binding sites, one at each tail. Polymerizing G actin in the presence of spectrin tetramers or mixing preformed F actin with spectrin tetramer plus bad 4.1 results in an extensively crosslinked network of actin filaments. When G actin is polymerized in the presence of spectrin at spectrin:actin mole ratios close to that present on the erythrocyte membrane, large amorphous protein networks are formed. These networks are clusters of spectrin around 25 nm diameter structures which may be actin protofilaments. These networks are similar to the cytoskeletal network seen after erythrocyte membranes are extracted with detergent, and may represent the first in vitro assembly of a cytoskeletal complex resembling that of the native cell both biochemically and structurally."
https://openalex.org/W1608549456,"Pretreatment of the D-deficient chick with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by a stimulation of CDP-choline: sn-1,2-diacylglycerol choline-phosphotransferase reaction. The time course of change in the incorporation of [3H]choline and [14C]ethanolamine into the brush border lipid fraction after 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment correlates closely with the time course of change in calcium uptake into the brush border membrane vesicles. Prior treatment with cycloheximide does not block this increase in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. In addition, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 administration increases the incorporation of [3H]arachidonic acid into the phosphatidylcholine fraction of the brush border to a great extent but does not increase the incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into the phosphatidylcholine fraction. The incorporation of these 3H labeled fatty acids into diacylglycerol is not changed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These data indicate that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhances the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine independent of new protein synthesis, and also increases the incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids into phosphatidylcholine. From these results we suggest that changes in phospholipid metabolism in the enterocyte are the mechanisms by which 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 acts to enhance calcium entry across the brush border membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2005412295,"A 95,000 dalton actin-binding polypeptide, villin, has been purified to 98% homogeneity from brush border cytoskeletons of chicken intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro, this protein exerts control over the polymerization of actin. In the presence of villin, the lag phase preceding detectable actin polymerization is shortened and the steady state equilibrium viscosity is reduced in proportion to the amount of villin present. A molar ratio of villin:actin of 1:40 results in a 70% reduction of the Ostwald viscosity. Significant effects can be detected at a ratio of 1:600. These ratios are physiologically relevant because the ratio of villin:actin in brush borders is 1:13 and in isolated microvilli is 1:9-12. Reduction of viscosity is mirrored by an increase in the amount of protein which fails to sediment at 150,000 X g for 60 min. An assay of the nonsedimentable protein for actin monomers by the inhibition of DNAase I showed that the concentration of monomer was not significantly altered by the presence of villin. Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained, nonsedimentable actin demonstrated that the presence of villin during actin polymerization results in the production of short oligomers which cannot anneal with each other to form long filaments. Villin is also effective in reducing the viscosity of F-actin when it is added to a fuly polymerized actin sample. In view of these striking properties, villin is likely to be an important in vivo regulator of cytoskeletal structure and, by implication, of cell shape and motility."

https://openalex.org/W1585934860,"Prolactin synthesis was investigated in monolayer cultures of dispersed pituitary cells maintained in defined medium. Electrophoresis of cell extracts from cultures labeled with [35S]methionine demonstrated that treatment with the dopaminergic drug, ergocryptine, specifically inhibited prolactin synthesis. Analysis of the time course of ergocryptine effects demonstrated that prolactin synthesis decreased sharply after 1 to 2 days of treatment and appeared to reach a new level of 26 to 28% of control values after 4 to 6 days of treatment. The concentration of ergocryptine which produced half-maximal inhibition of prolactin synthesis was about 0.3 nM. The inhibition of prolactin synthesis produced by ergoctryptine treatment was reversed by removal of the ergocryptine. Dopamine, ergocryptine, and bromoergocryptine (also a dopamine agonist) all inhibited prolactin synthesis while epinephrine and norepinephrine had little effect. The concentration of prolactin mRNA in cultured cells was assayed by hybridization of total cell RNA to prolactin cDNA. Analysis of cultures treated either for varying times or with varying doses of ergocryptine demonstrated that there was a close correspondence between the inhibition of prolactin synthesis and the inhibition of prolactin mRNA levels. These studies demonstrate the ability of dopaminergic stimulation to specifically inhibit prolactin synthesis and to decrease prolactin mRNA levels in primary cultures of pituitary cells maintained in defined medium."
https://openalex.org/W2014185936,"HUT 14 is a cloned transformed cell line derived from normal diploid human KD fibroblasts. HUT 14 cells have an altered actin phenotype. In addition to the two nonmuscle actins beta and gamma, also present in the parent KD cells, they show the stable expression of a novel actin species (Ax-actin). Amino acid sequence analysis has been used to identify the three actins of HUT 14 cells. beta- and gamma-actins are identified as normal mammalian nonmuscle actins whereas Ax-actin is characterized as a beta-actin mutant revealing a single amino acid substitution at position 244. The results obtained are compatible with a simple mutational event involving a point mutation in one of the two beta-nonmuscle actin genes assumed to be present in proliferating human diploid fibroblasts. Certain emerging principles of nonmuscle actin gene expression in higher vertebrates are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2045082442,"Using a modification of the Berk and Sharp S1 nuclease mapping procedure and by analyzing actin cDNA clones, we have examined the expression of several members of the 17-member multigene family encoding actin in Dictyostelium. The mapping procedure, which takes advantage of the fact that the actin genes are homologous in the protein-coding region but are very divergent in the proposed 5′ untranslated region has enabled us to quantitate the relative expression of several genes during the Dictyostelium life cycle. We have shown that at least six of the 17 potential actin-coding sequences are expressed. One is not expressed at levels of more than 0.5-1% of total actin mRNA at the developmental times examined and appears to be a pseudogene. By quantitating the amount of actin mRNA in mRNA populations isolated from cells at various times in development, we have shown that four of the actin genes show different patterns of expression. Interestingly, three of the four genes appear to encode the same protein. We have also taken advantage of the S1 mapping procedure to identify the 5′ ends of the actin mRNAs from four genes and have compared the sequences outside the 5′ ends on these genes with the nucleotide sequences of seven other actin genes. We have identified homologous sequences in most of these genes that may be involved in initiation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2088963507,"A loss in the number of functional, sodium ion-dependent, high-affinity choline transport sites was observed in the cortex and hippocampus of mice given an intracerebroventricular injection of 65 nanomoles of AF64A (ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion) 3 days earlier. Such an effect was not observed in the striatum. This effect of AF64A represents a long-term neurochemical deficit at cholinergic nerve terminals in some brain regions which can lead to a persistent deficiency in central cholinergic transmission. The AF64A-treated animal may thus be a model for certain psychiatric or neurological disorders that appear to involve central cholinergic hypofunction."
https://openalex.org/W1569490850,"Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle has been modified with the fluorescent label N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (1,5-I-AEDANS). Under conditions where the actin is in the unpolymerized form (G-actin), the addition of Mg2+ or KCl results in enhancement of the fluorescence. Titration of the labeled G-actin with Mg2+ at varying concentrations of CaCl2 gives, by extrapolation, a value for the dissociation constant for Mg2+ of 35 microM in the absence of Ca2+ and a calculated value of 10 microM for Ca2+ in the absence of Mg2+. The two metal ions compete with each other. The fluorescence enhancement induced by Mg2+ is reversed by the addition of Ca2+ and both processes are time-dependent, indicating a reversible conformational change of G-actin as a consequence of addition of divalent metal. KCl also enhances the fluorescence of the labeled G-actin but does not appear to compete with the divalent metal ion. The enhancement of the fluorescence is very rapid and any conformational change induced by KCl is probably different from that induced by divalent metal ions. Finally, it is shown that loss of fluorescence of the labeled G-actin may be associated with inactivation of the actin."

https://openalex.org/W1556557726,"Administration of 3,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) to rats causes the accumulation of N-methylprotoporphyrin IX, a potent inhibitor of ferrochelatase. To clarify the origin of the porphyrin N-methyl group, we have synthesized and administered to rats N-ethyl-3,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydrocollidine (N-ethyl DDC) and 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-4-ethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine (DDEP), the DDC analogue with a 4-ethyl rather than 4-methyl group. Only N-methylprotoporphyrin IX is isolated from rats treated with the former agent, and only N-ethylprotoporphyrin IX from those treated with the latter. All four isomers of N-ethylprotoporphyrin IX are formed biologically. The structure of the isolated porphyrins has been confirmed by complete spectroscopic comparison with the four synthetic isomers of N-ethylprotoporphyrin IX. DDEP has been shown to cause NADPH- and time-dependent in vitro loss of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450. These results unequivocally establish that the 4-alkyl groups in DDC and dDEP are the source of the N-alkyl group in N-methyl- and N-ethylprotoporphyrin IX, respectively, and strongly suggest that the alkyl group is transferred to the prosthetic heme of cytochrome P-450 during catalytic processing of the substrate by the enzyme. The mechanism of the group transfer is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1605335020,"Purified soluble tubulin will interact with highly sonicated small unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. This results in the leakage of a fluorescent dye, carboxyfluorescein, from the internal aqueous space of the vesicles at the lipid phase transition. The amount of dye leaked from the vesicles is determined by the tubulin to vesicle ratio and partial dye leakage reflects the uniform leakage of carboxyfluorescein from all of the vesicles. Once tubulin interacts with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles at the phase transition, it is unavailable to interact with additional vesicles. This interaction represents the formation of stable tubulin-vesicle recombinants as shown by density gradient centrifugation. Such recombinants are only formed by interacting the protein with the vesicles at the lipid phase transition temperature. The interaction is insensitive to ionic strength (0.001 to 4 M NaCl) and the recombinants remain stable for days."

Globo-tetraglycosylceramide is transferred at a rate 40% of that for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. II3-alpha-N-Acetylneuraminosyl-gangliotetraglycosylceramide is also transferred by the transfer protein, either from sonicated phosphatidylcholine vesicles or from ganglioside micelles to erythrocyte ghosts. The nonspecific lipid transfer protein catalyzes the net transfer of glycosphingolipids from brush border membrane vesicles (from rabbit intestine) to sonicated phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2218823496,"Whereas skeletal muscle tropomyosin binds strongly to muscle F-actin in a buffer containing 30 mM KCl and 1-2 mM free Mg2+, equine platelet tropomyosin only binds stoichiometrically (1 tropomyosin molecule per 6 actin monomers) at higher Mg2+ concentrations (7-8 mM free Mg2+). At low free Mg2+ concentrations (1.5 mM) the binding of the platelet protein is only marginally increased by raising the KCl concentration to an optimal value (0.10-0.20 M). This weaker binding can be attributed to the relatively poor head-to-tail polymerization of platelet tropomyosin and its fewer actin-binding sites. In a buffer containing 30 mM KCl and 3 mM Mg2+, the binding of platelet tropomyosin to F-actin can be induced by the addition of either skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 1 or troponin-I. The binding induced by troponin-I is largely neutralized by the addition of troponin-C both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, but by calmodulin only in the presence of Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1575568619,"Gel-sol transformation of actin filaments, a process essential for cell motility, can be reconstituted in vitro and regulated in a predictable fashion by the combined action of villin and filamin. Measurements made in a low shear falling ball viscometer show that mixtures of actin, villin, and filamin exist either as a gel (yield point greater than or equal to 140 dynes/cm2) or as a low viscosity liquid depending on the relative ration of villin:actin. Filamin induces gelation of F-actin by forming stable cross-links between actin filaments. Villin inhibits filamin-induced F-actin gelation, but the effect can be overcome by increasing the amount of filamin. Sedimentation assays show that villin does not inhibit gelation of actin by preventing filamin from binding to F-actin. Results from viscosity measurements and filament length determinations show that villin increases actin filament number by reducing the average filament length without altering the total amount of polymer. Because the gel point of a fixed amount of polymer is sharply dependent on the ratio of cross-links to number of polymers, the solation effect of villin might be explained by its effect on filament number. Based on the network theory of gel formation, calculations of the amount of additional cross-linker required to overcome the effect of a known increase in the number of actin filaments agree reasonably well with experimental findings. These results document the existence of cellular proteins which could regulate gel-sol transformation in vivo by their effect on actin polymer length and, therefore, on actin filament number."

https://openalex.org/W1544177526,"When pancreatic phospholipase A2 is mixed with small unilamellar vesicles made from dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine at or above the phase transition temperature (tm), the time course of hydrolysis exhibits a distinct lag period. On the other hand, if the enzyme is preincubated with substrate for a short period of time below the transition temperature (during which time only limited hydrolysis occurs) and then assayed at high temperature, no lag period is observed. This phenomenon does not appear to be the result of product formation. Instead, the reported results lend substantial support to the hypothesis that a relatively slow substrate-enzyme organizational step is required as part of an activation process and this is most rapid when the substrate is in the gel state. However, the intrinsic activity (after the initial step of activation) is maximal when the substrate is in the liquid-crystalline state."

https://openalex.org/W2171415696,"The chemical reactivity of 8-chloroflavins and 8-mercaptoflavins has been exploited in order to examine the orientation of protein-bound flavins relative to solvent. The apoprotein form of a series of flavoproteins was prepared and the native flavin was replaced by either 8-Cl-flavin or 8-mercaptoflavin (FAD, FMN, or riboflavin form as was appropriate). The reconstituted proteins were exposed to reagents capable of reacting with the group at position 8. The 8-Cl-proteins were challenged with sodium sulfide and thiophenol, while the 8-mercaptoproteins were faced with iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid. The kinetics of the ensuing reactions served as a measure of the solvent availability of position 8 for the protein-bound flavin. These studies indicated that position 8 of flavin bound to melilotate hydroxylase, D-amino acid oxidase, old yellow enzyme, p-OH-benzoate hydroxylase, and flavodoxin is accessible to solvent, while position 8 on L-lactate oxidase, glucose oxidase, putrescine oxidase, and riboflavin-binding protein appears to be inaccessible. For luciferase, D-lactate dehydrogenase, and xanthine oxidase, the data suggest that position 8 is exposed but the results are inconclusive. The effect of ligand binding on the accessibility of position 8 was also studied. NADPH binding to 8-mercapto old yellow enzyme and benzoate binding to 8-Cl-D-amino acid oxidase results in complete blockage of previously available position 8. On the other hand, p-OH-benzoate hydroxylase and melilotate hydroxylase bind their respective substrates (p-OH-benzoate and melilotate) without significantly altering the reactivity of position 8."
https://openalex.org/W1490373207,"Abstract The diastereomers of adenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (ATP alpha S) and adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ATP beta S) were tested as substrates for creatine kinase in the presence of different activating divalent metal cations. In the presence of Mg2+, the Rp diastereomers of both ATP alpha S and ATP beta S are the preferred substrates, whereas in the presence of Cd2+, the Sp diastereomers are preferred. In the reverse reaction the Rp isomer of ADP alpha S is the better substrate in the presence of Mg2+ while the Sp isomer is preferred in the presence of Cd2+. In the presence of Mg2+, only the Rp isomer of ATP beta S is synthesized from prochiral ADP beta S while the Sp isomer is synthesized predominantly in the presence of Cd2+. In the presence of Ca2+, Mn2+, and Co2+, loss of substrate specificity is observed. These results are explained on the basis of the observation that Mg2+ prefers to coordinate to oxygen and Cd2+ to sulfur in these phosphorothioate analogs (Jaffe, E. K., and Cohn, M. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4823-4825). Thus, the metal ion appears to be bound to both the alpha- and beta-phosphates at some stage of the reaction. The interpretation is that the substrate binds as the lambda, beta, gamma-bidentate MgATP chelate. It can then undergo either nucleophilic substitution at the gamma-phosphorus followed by migration of the metal to yield the alpha, beta MgADP complex or metal migration followed by subsequent phosphoryl transfer. The product of the reaction is delta, alpha, beta-bidentate MgADP. The different reaction routes are discussed."

The present procedure employs media incubation of newborn calf testis, passage through DEAE Bio-Gel A and CM Bio-Gel A and sequential lectin affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin (WGL)-Sepharose 6MB and concanavalin A (Con A)-Sepharose 4B. Strongly bioactive MIS was released from both lectin columns in the bound glycoprotein fraction only after elution with lectin-specific sugar. Carbohydrate analysis of the highly purified glycoprotein fraction eluted from Con A indicated the presence of both N-acetyl glucosamine and mannose, as would be expected from its sequential lectin affinity, as well as of galactose, galactosamine and N-acetyl neuraminic acid. Electrophoresis of this fraction on polyacrylamide-SDS gels showed an identical band pattern after staining with either Coomassie blue or periodic acid-Schiff reagent, further indicating that MIS is a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1600605069,"A large proportion of actin in extracts of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes is unpolymerized in the presence of 0.1 M KCl, a condition expected to promote maximal assembly of purified actin. Raising of the KCl concentration increases the extent of actin polymerization in leukocyte extracts, and, at KCl concentrations greater than or equal to 0.3 M, the polymer concentration is maximal and approaches that of purified muscle actin in 0.1 M KCl solution. After removal of the actin polymers from leukocyte extracts made 0.6 M in KCl, the supernatant fluid contains an activity which inhibits the extent of assembly of purified skeletal muscle actin in 0.1 M KCl solution. We have purified this activity by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified inhibitor contains polypeptides of 65,000 and 62,000 daltons in a molar ratio of 1:2 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate. The Stokes radius of 32 A, and S20,w of 4.8 of the native inhibitor suggest that the purified protein is a mixture of monomers of slightly different molecular weight. Substoichiometric concentrations of the inhibitor rapidly prevent the assembly of purified actin in 0.1 m KCl solution in a concentration-dependent manner, and the reduction in final viscosity remains constant over time. Raising the KCl concentration reverses the inhibition, as observed for actin polymerization in unfractionated extracts. The findings are consistent with the conclusion that this inhibitor protein is responsible for the large proportion of unpolymerized actin in extracts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1581233583,"This report presents a kinetic model for endwise depolymerization of linear, self-assembling protein systems. We develop a reliable method for predicting the shape of depolymerization curves (remaining polymer weight versus time) on the basis of the initial polymer length distribution. Computer simulations are used to illustrate changes in the polymer length distribution and average polymer weight during disassembly. In addition, our method provides an accurate determination of the microscopic rate constant for subunit release. Application of this analysis to dilution-induced and cold induced disassembly of microtubules is illustrated in the preceding paper (Karr, T.L., Kristofferson, D., and Purich, D.L. (1980) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W99765359,"We have shown that soluble tubulin will bind to small unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (Klausner, R. D., Kumar, N., Weinstein, J. N., Blumenthal, R., and Flavin, M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5879-5885). This association uniquely occurs at the lipid phase transition. The tubulin, when bound to the vesicles, displays an altered tryptophan fluorescence characterized by a 5-nm blue shift in the emission maximum and a 22% decrease in fluorescence intensity, when compared to soluble tubulin. Tryptophans in vesicle-bound tubulin are less accessible to the aqueous collisional quenchers, acrylamide and iodide, than in soluble tubulin. Circular dichroism studies reveal an increase in alpha-helical content of tubulin as a result of vesicle interaction. Proteolytic digestion by trypsin of vesicle bound tubulin is slower than of soluble tubulin. The beta subunit of tubulin is preferentially protected from trypsin by vesicle interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1526571049,"Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3'-sulfonate) inactivated both soluble and membrane bound-ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase of spinach chloroplasts. Either NADP+ or NADPh afforded complete protection against modification. Ki and the apparent Kd for protection afforded by NADP+ depended on the ionic strength of the medium. Nucleophylic displacement of reagent bound to the soluble enzyme by [14C]glycine ethyl ester showed that 5 to 6 carboxyl groups/flavin were modified when the diaphorase activity was completely inhibited. In differential labeling experiments using NADP+ as protective agent, it was shown that enzyme inactivation was due to blocking of only 1 carboxyl group/mol. Derivatized reductase did not bind pyridine nucleotides. Protection by NADP+ of the membrane-bound reductase was higher, and the apparent Kd for NADP+ lower, in the light than in the dark. Inactivation increased abruptly with the external pH, indicating a progressive exposure of the carboxyl group as the pH was raised. The results presented suggest (a) the existence of a light-driven conformational change and a pH-dependent transition in membrane-bound ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase; (b) the presence of an essential carboxyl residue in the nucleotide binding site of the reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1481205128,"The binding protein for 15-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) was isolated from chick serum. The molecular weight was 60,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, without the existence of sub-units. Its sedimentation coefficient was 4.3 S. The isoelectric points of the major and minor components were 6.1 and 5.9, respectively. Addition of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 causes an anodal shift in the isoelectric point of the two forms of the binding protein. Heating at 60 degrees C slowly destroys the binding protein but the addition of vitamin D metabolites increases its thermostability. The binding protein has probably a single binding site for all vitamin D metabolites and its association constant for 25-OH-D3 at 4 degrees C and pH 7.4 is 10(9) M-1. The same affinity is found for 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 but 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 have a 3- and 10-fold lower affinity, respectively. The amino acid composition is very similar to that of the human and rat binding protein. The concentration of chick 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-binding protein was higher in egg-laying hens (10 microM) than in immature hens (4 microM) or immature or adult roosters (4 microM). Chick plasma contains virtually only a 4 S form of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-binding protein but partially hemolyzed chick serum also contains a 6 S form. Addition of pure actin to chick plasma or serum converts all 4 S form to the 6 S form. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-binding protein is thus heterogenous since it exists in two 4 S forms (with different pI) and a 6 S form (complexed with actin). No evidence was found for the existence of a separate vitamin D3-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1517786520,"The induction of hepatic heme oxygenase in response to cobaltous chloride (CoCl2) administration was examined in normal, sham-operated, and adrenalectomized rats. The basal level of heme oxygenase was elevated about 2-fold in adrenalectomized rats as compared to normal controls or sham-operated animals. The extent of heme oxygenase induction by CoCl2 was also increased about 2-fold above normal in adrenalectomized animals and was accompanied by an enhanced breakdown of cytochrome P-450. The initial decline (approximately 2 h) and the late rebound increase (approximately 16 h) of delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity caused by the metal administration were, however, similar for all three groups of animals. Hydrocortisone is known to restore the impaired inducibility of delta-aminolevulinate synthase by allylisopropylacetamide in adrenalectomized rats. In this study, treatment with hydrocortisone prevented the exaggerated metal induction of heme oxygenase but did not affect the associated initial decline or the late rebound of delta-aminolevulinate synthase. These data indicate that hydrocortisone and adrenalectomy can significantly influence the extent of the induction of heme oxygenase produced by CoCl2, but that both the initial decline and the rebound induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthase associated with this metal treatment are apparently independent of these endocrine controls."
https://openalex.org/W2060888190,"In the axolotl embryo the somitic mesoderm passes through a reversible and then an irreversible phase of commitment with respect to its later differentiation into muscle. We show that the commencement of alpha-actin synthesis and the first appearance of thin myofilaments occur at the the same developmental stage as the transition between these phases. In intact embryos beta-and gamma-actin are made at all stages of development and in all tissues. alpha-actin, however, first appears at the late head process stage and is confined to the somites and tailbud, the regions of the embryo which later form the myotomal muscles. The thin filaments first appear near the myocoel of the somites in association with a novel organelle of mottled appearance and are quite distinct in structure from the epidermal microfilament networks found in embryos of the same stage. Cell fusion occurs somewhat later, although before the appearance of muscle striations in the light microscope. Well formed sarcomeres are not found until some time after the onset of motility. Presumptive somitic mesoderm isolated at a stage before the transition and cultured in a buffered salt solution for six days autonomously begins to synthesize alpha-actin and develop sarcomeres with the normal structure."
https://openalex.org/W2010356595,"The p63/6.9 protein has previously been shown to be specified by a gene within the mouse T/t complex. All wild-type chromosomes 17 specify a basic form of p63/6.9 (p63/6.9b). It is distinguishable by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from the acidic form of p63/6.9 (p63/6.9a), which is specified by all complete t haplotypes analyzed to date. To determine whether p63/6.9 is a direct gene product of the T/t complex, testicular cytoplasmic RNA from mice bearing the genotypes +/+, +/t and t/t was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte-derived cell-free system, and translated products were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The data indicate that the difference between th allelic forms of p63/6.9 is encoded within mRNA transcribed from the T/t complex. Thus p63/6.9 is the first primary gene product identified in the T/t complex. Results obtained from both cell-free translation and pulse-chase labeling experiments indicate that the mature cell surface-associated form of p63/6.9 has not undergone detectable post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1515791469,"Polymerization of actin was completely inhibited by metal chelating agents, such as EDTA or diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid, even in the presence of 0.1 M KCl and excess ATP. Addition of 1 mM MgCl2, but not CaCl2, caused full polymerization in the presence of 10 mM diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid, suggesting that micromolar concentrations of Mg ions are required for the polymerization of actin. However, it turned out that sonic vibration induced a very rapid polymerization of actin in the absence of Mg ions. The sonication-induced polymerization of actin was greatly inhibited by cytochalasins D and B, and partially by beta-actinin. This can be explained by assuming that the fast growing ends of the formed nuclei are blocked by the cytochalasins, and the slowly growing ends with beta-actinin. The elongation of added F-actin fragments was also similarly inhibited by the cytochalasins and beta-actinin in the absence of Mg ions. It appears that sonic vibration enhances nuclei formation of actin monomers by mechanical agitation in the absence of Mg ions, which stabilize formed nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1538734140,"Purpurin, the lectin from Dictyostelium purpureum, has been resolved into seven tetrameric isolectins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.9. The isolectins are assembled from four distinct subunits resolved by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and by tryptic peptide mapping. Two of the subunits combine randomly with each other to form mixed tetramers (I4, I3II1, I2II2, I1II3, II4) in binomial proportions. The other two subunits (III and IV) form only homotetramers. The isolectins can be functionally discriminated and separated on the basis of their relative affinities for columns derivatized with complementary saccharides. On the basis of relative sensitivity to hapten inhibitors of hemagglutination, isolectins III4 and IV4 are distinct from each other and from isolectins composed of subunits I and II. However, isolectins of I and II are not distinguishable on the basis of hemagglutination inhibition. None of the subunits are glycosylated, and all form tetramers with molecular weights of approximately 88,000. The existence of multiple functionally distinct forms suggests that lectin function in cellular slime molds may be more complex than presently envisioned."
https://openalex.org/W1489739329,"Binding of Cd2+ to concanavalin A and the subsequent induction of saccharide-binding activity has been studied at pH 6.5. We found that Cd2+ bound to both metal sites, S1 and S2, and that Cd2+ alone would induce sugar binding in concanavalin A. Using the fluorescent sugar 4-methylumbelliferyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside we determined that full saccharide-binding activity was obtained only when the total bound Cd2+ stoichiometry reached 2 ions/concanavalin A subunit. We also report evidence suggesting that the binding of Cd2+ to S2 is the crucial step in activation and that Cd2+ binding to S1 induces a form of concanavalin A similar to that induced by Zn2+, Ni2+, or Co2+ and different from that induced by Mn2+."
