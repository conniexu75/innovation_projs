https://openalex.org/W4313488719,"The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron sublineages, including the BA.2-derived BA.2.75.2 and the BA.5-derived BQ.1.1 and XBB.1, have accumulated additional spike mutations that may affect vaccine effectiveness. Here we report neutralizing activities of three human serum panels collected from individuals 23–94 days after dose 4 of a parental mRNA vaccine; 14–32 days after a BA.5 bivalent booster from individuals with 2–4 previous doses of parental mRNA vaccine; or 14–32 days after a BA.5 bivalent booster from individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2–4 doses of parental mRNA vaccine. The results showed that a BA.5 bivalent booster elicited a high neutralizing titer against BA.4/5 measured at 14–32 days after boost; however, the BA.5 bivalent booster did not produce robust neutralization against the newly emerged BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1 or XBB.1. Previous infection substantially enhanced the magnitude and breadth of BA.5 bivalent booster-elicited neutralization. Our data support a vaccine update strategy that future boosters should match newly emerged circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to evade neutralization by COVID-19 vaccines, including bivalent boosters that target the BA.4/BA.5 variants of concern, suggesting that strategies to get ahead of the virus’ evolution might be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4311582376,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are divided into two populations1,2; long GRBs that derive from the core collapse of massive stars (for example, ref. 3) and short GRBs that form in the merger of two compact objects4,5. Although it is common to divide the two populations at a gamma-ray duration of 2 s, classification based on duration does not always map to the progenitor. Notably, GRBs with short (≲2 s) spikes of prompt gamma-ray emission followed by prolonged, spectrally softer extended emission (EE-SGRBs) have been suggested to arise from compact object mergers6-8. Compact object mergers are of great astrophysical importance as the only confirmed site of rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, observed in the form of so-called kilonovae9-14. Here we report the discovery of a possible kilonova associated with the nearby (350 Mpc), minute-duration GRB 211211A. The kilonova implies that the progenitor is a compact object merger, suggesting that GRBs with long, complex light curves can be spawned from merger events. The kilonova of GRB 211211A has a similar luminosity, duration and colour to that which accompanied the gravitational wave (GW)-detected binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 (ref. 4). Further searches for GW signals coincident with long GRBs are a promising route for future multi-messenger astronomy."
https://openalex.org/W4311044920,"Plastics show the strongest production growth of all bulk materials and are already responsible for 4.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions1,2. If no new policies are implemented, we project a doubling of global plastic demand by 2050 and more than a tripling by 2100, with an almost equivalent increase in CO2 emissions. Here we analyse three alternative CO2 emission-mitigation pathways for the global plastics sector until 2100, covering the entire life cycle from production to waste management. Our results show that, through bio-based carbon sequestration in plastic products, a combination of biomass use and landfilling can achieve negative emissions in the long term; however, this involves continued reliance on primary feedstock. A circular economy approach without an additional bioeconomy push reduces resource consumption by 30% and achieves 10% greater emission reductions before 2050 while reducing the potential of negative emissions in the long term. A circular bioeconomy approach combining recycling with higher biomass use could ultimately turn the sector into a net carbon sink, while at the same time phasing out landfilling and reducing resource consumption. Our work improves the representation of material flows and the circular economy in global energy and emission models, and provides insight into long-term dynamics in the plastics sector."
https://openalex.org/W4311006217,"It is generally believed that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with massive star core collapse1, whereas short-duration GRBs are associated with mergers of compact star binaries2. However, growing observations3-6 have suggested that oddball GRBs do exist, and several criteria (prompt emission properties, supernova/kilonova associations and host galaxy properties) rather than burst duration only are needed to classify GRBs physically7. A previously reported long-duration burst, GRB 060614 (ref. 3), could be viewed as a short GRB with extended emission if it were observed at a larger distance8 and was associated with a kilonova-like feature9. As a result, it belongs to the type I (compact star merger) GRB category and is probably of binary neutron star (NS) merger origin. Here we report a peculiar long-duration burst, GRB 211211A, whose prompt emission properties in many aspects differ from all known type I GRBs, yet its multiband observations suggest a non-massive-star origin. In particular, substantial excess emission in both optical and near-infrared wavelengths has been discovered (see also ref. 10), which resembles kilonova emission, as observed in some type I GRBs. These observations point towards a new progenitor type of GRBs. A scenario invoking a white dwarf (WD)-NS merger with a post-merger magnetar engine provides a self-consistent interpretation for all the observations, including prompt gamma rays, early X-ray afterglow, as well as the engine-fed11,12 kilonova emission."
https://openalex.org/W4311421419,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are flashes of high-energy radiation arising from energetic cosmic explosions. Bursts of long (greater than two seconds) duration are produced by the core-collapse of massive stars1, and those of short (less than two seconds) duration by the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars2. A third class of events with hybrid high-energy properties was identified3, but never conclusively linked to a stellar progenitor. The lack of bright supernovae rules out typical core-collapse explosions4-6, but their distance scales prevent sensitive searches for direct signatures of a progenitor system. Only tentative evidence for a kilonova has been presented7,8. Here we report observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 211211A, which classify it as a hybrid event and constrain its distance scale to only 346 megaparsecs. Our measurements indicate that its lower-energy (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) counterpart is powered by a luminous (approximately 1042 erg per second) kilonova possibly formed in the ejecta of a compact object merger."
https://openalex.org/W4311546538,"Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene epochs 3.6 to 0.8 million years ago1 had climates resembling those forecasted under future warming2. Palaeoclimatic records show strong polar amplification with mean annual temperatures of 11-19 °C above contemporary values3,4. The biological communities inhabiting the Arctic during this time remain poorly known because fossils are rare5. Here we report an ancient environmental DNA6 (eDNA) record describing the rich plant and animal assemblages of the Kap København Formation in North Greenland, dated to around two million years ago. The record shows an open boreal forest ecosystem with mixed vegetation of poplar, birch and thuja trees, as well as a variety of Arctic and boreal shrubs and herbs, many of which had not previously been detected at the site from macrofossil and pollen records. The DNA record confirms the presence of hare and mitochondrial DNA from animals including mastodons, reindeer, rodents and geese, all ancestral to their present-day and late Pleistocene relatives. The presence of marine species including horseshoe crab and green algae support a warmer climate than today. The reconstructed ecosystem has no modern analogue. The survival of such ancient eDNA probably relates to its binding to mineral surfaces. Our findings open new areas of genetic research, demonstrating that it is possible to track the ecology and evolution of biological communities from two million years ago using ancient eDNA."
https://openalex.org/W4311129803,"Feedback inhibition of humoral immunity by antibodies was first documented in 19091. Subsequent studies showed that, depending on the context, antibodies can enhance or inhibit immune responses2,3. However, little is known about how pre-existing antibodies influence the development of memory B cells. Here we examined the memory B cell response in individuals who received two high-affinity anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and subsequently two doses of an mRNA vaccine4-8. We found that the recipients of the monoclonal antibodies produced antigen-binding and neutralizing titres that were only fractionally lower compared than in control individuals. However, the memory B cells of the individuals who received the monoclonal antibodies differed from those of control individuals in that they predominantly expressed low-affinity IgM antibodies that carried small numbers of somatic mutations and showed altered receptor binding domain (RBD) target specificity, consistent with epitope masking. Moreover, only 1 out of 77 anti-RBD memory antibodies tested neutralized the virus. The mechanism underlying these findings was examined in experiments in mice that showed that germinal centres formed in the presence of the same antibodies were dominated by low-affinity B cells. Our results indicate that pre-existing high-affinity antibodies bias germinal centre and memory B cell selection through two distinct mechanisms: (1) by lowering the activation threshold for B cells, thereby permitting abundant lower-affinity clones to participate in the immune response; and (2) through direct masking of their cognate epitopes. This may in part explain the shifting target profile of memory antibodies elicited by booster vaccinations9."
https://openalex.org/W4311654164,"Oxygen-containing functional groups are nearly ubiquitous in complex small molecules. The installation of multiple C-O bonds by the concurrent oxygenation of contiguous C-H bonds in a selective fashion would be highly desirable but has largely been the purview of biosynthesis. Multiple, concurrent C-H bond oxygenation reactions by synthetic means presents a challenge1-6, particularly because of the risk of overoxidation. Here we report the selective oxygenation of two or three contiguous C-H bonds by dehydrogenation and oxygenation, enabling the conversion of simple alkylarenes or trifluoroacetamides to their corresponding di- or triacetoxylates. The method achieves such transformations by the repeated operation of a potent oxidative catalyst, but under conditions that are sufficiently selective to avoid destructive overoxidation. These reactions are achieved using electrophotocatalysis7, a process that harnesses the energy of both light and electricity to promote chemical reactions. Notably, the judicious choice of acid allows for the selective synthesis of either di- or trioxygenated products."
https://openalex.org/W4311581286,"An energetic γ-ray burst (GRB), GRB 211211A, was observed on 11 December 20211,2. Despite its long duration, typically associated with bursts produced by the collapse of massive stars, the observation of an optical-infrared kilonova points to a compact binary merger origin3. Here we report observations of a significant (more than five sigma) transient-like emission in the high-energy γ-rays of GRB 211211A (more than 0.1 gigaelectronvolts) starting 103 seconds after the burst. After an initial phase with a roughly constant flux (about 5 × 10-10 erg per second per square centimetre) lasting about 2 × 104 seconds, the flux started decreasing and soon went undetected. Our detailed modelling of public and dedicated multi-wavelength observations demonstrates that gigaelectronvolt emission from GRB 211211A is in excess with respect to the flux predicted by the state-of-the-art afterglow model at such late time. We explore the possibility that the gigaelectronvolt excess is inverse Compton emission owing to the interaction of a late-time, low-power jet with an external source of photons, and find that kilonova emission can provide the seed photons. Our results open perspectives for observing binary neutron star mergers."

https://openalex.org/W4311045589,"Systems of correlated particles appear in many fields of modern science and represent some of the most intractable computational problems in nature. The computational challenge in these systems arises when interactions become comparable to other energy scales, which makes the state of each particle depend on all other particles1. The lack of general solutions for the three-body problem and acceptable theory for strongly correlated electrons shows that our understanding of correlated systems fades when the particle number or the interaction strength increases. One of the hallmarks of interacting systems is the formation of multiparticle bound states2-9. Here we develop a high-fidelity parameterizable fSim gate and implement the periodic quantum circuit of the spin-½ XXZ model in a ring of 24 superconducting qubits. We study the propagation of these excitations and observe their bound nature for up to five photons. We devise a phase-sensitive method for constructing the few-body spectrum of the bound states and extract their pseudo-charge by introducing a synthetic flux. By introducing interactions between the ring and additional qubits, we observe an unexpected resilience of the bound states to integrability breaking. This finding goes against the idea that bound states in non-integrable systems are unstable when their energies overlap with the continuum spectrum. Our work provides experimental evidence for bound states of interacting photons and discovers their stability beyond the integrability limit."

The study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated Covid-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV (Vero Cells) Sinopharm vaccine currently deployed in Morocco against SARS- CoV-2 severe disease/ hospitalization"" within 9 months after vaccination.We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among a population aged 18 years or older who were tested by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection from February to October 2021 in Morocco. From the national laboratory COVID-19 database; we identified cases who were rt-PCR positive amongst severe and critical COVID-19 cases and controls who had a negative rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. From the national vaccination register (NVR); individuals vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) and those unvaccinated were identified and included in the study. The linkage between databases was conducted for the study of Vaccination status based on the timing of the vaccine receipt relative to the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test date. For each person, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, we identified a propensity score-matched control participant who was tested negative. We estimated vaccine effectiveness against SARS- CoV-2 severe disease/ hospitalization using conditional logistic regression.Among 12884 persons who tested positive and 12885 propensity score-matched control participants, the median age was 62 years, 47.2% of whom were female. As a function of time after vaccination of second dose vaccination, vaccine effectiveness during the first month was 88% (95% CI, 84-91), 87% (95% CI: 83-90) during the second and third month, 75% (95% CI: 67-80) during the fourth month, 61% (95% CI: 54-67) during the fifth month, and 64% (95% CI: 59-69) beyond the sixth month. VE remained high and stable during the first three months in the two-age subgroup. In the fourth month, the VE in the older population aged 60 years and above (64%) was reduced by 20 points compared to VE in the younger population (84%).A Sinopharm vaccine is highly protective against serious SARS-CoV-2 infection under real-world conditions. Protection remained high and stable during the first three months following the second dose and decreases slightly beyond the fourth month especially beyond 60 years."
https://openalex.org/W4310762924,"Macrophages present a spectrum of phenotypes that mediate both the pathogenesis and resolution of atherosclerotic lesions. Inflammatory macrophage phenotypes are pro-atherogenic, but the stimulatory factors that promote these phenotypes remain incompletely defined. Here we demonstrate that microbial small RNAs (msRNA) are enriched on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and drive pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization and cytokine secretion via activation of the RNA sensor toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8). Removal of msRNA cargo during LDL re-constitution yields particles that readily promote sterol loading but fail to stimulate inflammatory activation. Competitive antagonism of TLR8 with non-targeting locked nucleic acids was found to prevent native LDL-induced macrophage polarization in vitro, and re-organize lesion macrophage phenotypes in vivo, as determined by single-cell RNA sequencing. Critically, this was associated with reduced disease burden in distinct mouse models of atherosclerosis. These results identify LDL-msRNA as instigators of atherosclerosis-associated inflammation and support alternative functions of LDL beyond cholesterol transport."
https://openalex.org/W4311844897,"Introduction After the acute Sars-CoV-2-infection, some athletes suffer from persistent, performance-impairing symptoms, although the course of the disease is often mild to moderate. The relation between cardiopulmonary performance and persistent symptoms after the acute period is still unclear. In addition, information about the development of this relationship is lacking. Objective To assess the prevalence of persistent symptoms over time and their association with the performance capability of athletes. Methods We conducted two cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) in a three months interval with 60 athletes (age: 35.2±12.1 years, 56.7% male) after infection with Sars-CoV-2 (t 0 : study inclusion; t 1 : three months post t 0 ). At each examination, athletes were asked about their persistent symptoms. To evaluate the change of Peak VO 2 /BM (Body Mass) between the time before infection and the first examination, the VO 2 /BM (predVO 2 ) before infection was predicted based on anthropometric data and exercise history of the athletes. For data analysis, athletes were grouped according to their symptom status (symptom-free, SF; persistent symptoms, PS) and its progression from the first to the second examination 1) SF-SF, 2) PS-SF and 3) PS-PS. Results Comparing the SF and PS groups at t 0 , significant differences for Max Power/BM, Max Power/lbm (lean body mass), Peak VO 2 , Peak VO 2 /BM, Peak VO 2 /lbm, Peak VO 2 /HR, Peak VE, Peak Vt and VE/VCO 2 -Slope were observed. Regarding the progression over three months, an increase in Max Power/BM was shown in SF-SF and PS-SF (tendency). Max Power/lbm increased in SF-SF and PS-PS (tendency). A decrease of VE/VCO 2 -Slope in PS-PS was found. Conclusion COVID-19 led to a decline in performance that was greater in PS than in SF. Additionally, PS had decreased ventilatory parameters compared to SF. Furthermore, an improvement over time was observed in some CPET parameters and a partial recovery was observed judging by the decrease in various symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W4310857490,"Precise monitoring of internal temperature is vital for thermal homeostasis in mammals. For decades, warm-sensitive neurons (WSNs) within the preoptic area (POA) were thought to sense internal warmth, using this information as feedback to regulate body temperature (Tcore). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which WSNs measure temperature remain largely undefined. Via a pilot genetic screen, we found that silencing the TRPC4 channel in mice substantially attenuated hypothermia induced by light-mediated heating of the POA. Loss-of-function studies of TRPC4 confirmed its role in warm sensing in GABAergic WSNs, causing additional defects in basal temperature setting, warm defense, and fever responses. Furthermore, TRPC4 antagonists and agonists bidirectionally regulated Tcore. Thus, our data indicate that TRPC4 is essential for sensing internal warmth and that TRPC4-expressing GABAergic WSNs function as a novel cellular sensor for preventing Tcore from exceeding set-point temperatures. TRPC4 may represent a potential therapeutic target for managing Tcore."

However, few studies have examined the most effective formats for alcohol HWLs. This study tested the effects of three different types of alcohol HWLs. In an online experiment, N = 1,755 Australian adult drinkers were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: (a) No HWL control; (b) DrinkWise control (industry-developed labels currently on some containers); (c) Text-Only HWLs; (d) Text + Pictogram HWLs; or (e) Text + Photograph HWLs. In the three intervention conditions, participants were exposed to eight HWLs, each depicting a different long-term harm. Exposure occurred during an initial session, and repeatedly over the subsequent eight days. Differences between conditions were assessed immediately following initial exposure and at nine-day follow-up. Compared to participants in the No HWL control, participants exposed to Text + Pictogram HWLs were more likely to have intentions to avoid drinking alcohol completely in the next month (post-exposure) and intentions to drink less alcohol in the next week (follow-up), and participants in all three intervention conditions reported stronger negative emotional arousal (follow-up) and weaker positive emotional arousal (follow-up). Compared to participants in the DrinkWise control, those exposed to Text + Pictogram HWLs had stronger intentions to drink less alcohol in the next week and intentions to avoid drinking alcohol completely in the next month (follow-up), participants in the Text + Photograph condition reported significantly weaker positive emotional arousal, and all three intervention conditions resulted in stronger negative emotional arousal. There would likely be benefits to public health if any of the three types of intervention HWLs were implemented. However, there is some evidence that Text + Pictogram HWLs should be recommended over Text-Only or Text + Photograph HWLs, given they were the only HWLs to increase intentions to drink less."

For the period of five years before and after retraction, we counted the citations to papers in a sample of over 3,000 retracted, and a matched sample of another 3,000 non-retracted papers. Retraction led to a decrease in average annual citation frequency from about 5 before, to 2 citations after retraction. In contrast, for non-retracted control papers the citation counts were 4, and 5, respectively. Put differently, we found only a limited effect of retraction: retraction decreased citation frequency only by about 60%, as compared to non-retracted papers. Thus, retracted papers often live on. For effective self-correction the scientific enterprise needs to be more effective in removing retracted papers from the scientific record. We discuss recent proposals to do so."
https://openalex.org/W4310856775,"Humans and non-human primates can flexibly switch between different arbitrary mappings from sensation to action to solve a cognitive task. It has remained unknown how the brain implements such flexible sensory-motor mapping rules. Here, we uncovered a dynamic reconfiguration of task-specific correlated variability between sensory and motor brain regions. Human participants switched between two rules for reporting visual orientation judgments during fMRI recordings. Rule switches were either signaled explicitly or inferred by the participants from ambiguous cues. We used behavioral modeling to reconstruct the time course of their belief about the active rule. In both contexts, the patterns of correlations between ongoing fluctuations in stimulus- and action-selective activity across visual- and action-related brain regions tracked participants’ belief about the active rule. The rule-specific correlation patterns broke down around the time of behavioral errors. We conclude that internal beliefs about task state are instantiated in brain-wide, selective patterns of correlated variability."

Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.28 frail older adults in the United Kingdom, purposively sampled for neighbourhood, frailty and symptoms of anxiety/depression.Thematic analysis to inductively derive themes from the data.Our findings suggest that frail older adults find maintaining independence, engaging in meaningful activities, and socialising and peer support important for self-managing depression and anxiety. These could all be adapted to the level of frailty experienced. Drawing on life experiences, addressing the perceived cause and faith were helpful in some situations and for some personalities. Distraction and avoidance were helpful for more severe symptoms or where the causes of symptoms could not be resolved. Self-management strategies were less well-established for anxiety symptoms, especially when linked to newer health fears and worries about the future.Developing services and sources of information that support and facilitate key therapeutic components of self-management, which align with older adults' preferred coping styles and take into account levels of frailty, may be a way of supporting frail older people waiting for mental health treatments or those who prefer not to access these. Greater awareness of anxiety and how it can be self-managed in frail older people is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4311581075,"Camel milk is recognized as a functional food with significant economic value. Mastitis is one of the most common and costly diseases in the dairy industry. Mastitis, which is caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and algae, has an impact on the quality and quantity of milk produced as well as animal health and welfare. There is a paucity of data on the etiological factors that cause camel mastitis. This study reports the bacterial and fungal community involved in clinical camel mastitis using Illumina amplicon sequencing. A total of 25 milk samples were analyzed, including 9 samples with mastitis and 16 healthy samples. The bacterial community in healthy samples was significantly more diverse and abundant than in mastitis samples. The fungal population in mastitis samples, on the other hand, was more diverse and abundant. As compared to healthy samples, the genera Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , Schlegelella , unclassified Enterobacteriaceae , Lactococcus , Jeotgalicoccus . and Klebsiella were found to be abundant in mastitic milk. However, the genera Corynebacterium , Enteractinococcus , unclassified Sphingomonadaceae , Atopostipes , Paenibacillus , Pseudomonas , Lactobacillus , Sphingomonas , Pediococcus and Moraxella were reduced. In the fungal community, mastitis caused a significant increase in the relative abundance of the majority of taxa, including Candida , Phanerochaete , Aspergillus , Cladosporium and unclassified Pyronemataceae , while Penicillium and Alternaria showed a decline in relative abundance. In the bacterial and fungal communities, the discriminant analysis showed 19 and 5 differently abundant genera in healthy milk and mastitic milk, respectively. In conclusion, this study showed a microbiome dysbiosis linked to clinical camel mastitis, with opportunistic pathogens outgrowing commensal bacteria that were reduced. These findings are essential in designing an appropriate control program in the camel dairy herd, as well as in preventing and treating camel mastitis."
https://openalex.org/W4311586047,"A general lockdown to minimize to slow transmission of COVID-19 in Bangladesh came into effect on March 26 th and lasted until May 30 th . The lockdown had far-reaching economic implications for the population, with many facing economic hardship due to loss of income. Despite the attempt of the government to ease economic hardship by means of social safety net packages, people suffered from poor access to health services, and financial and food insecurity. This is likely to have disastrous consequences for the nutritional status of young children. This cross-sectional study measured the impact of the first general lockdown on food consumption of young children, access to water, handwashing and health seeking behavior, and the ability to maintain livelihood among households with children under the age of 5, in rural Bangladesh. The result of the analysis suggest that loss of income was reported by almost all respondents across all socio-economic groups. However, the poorest households were less likely to provide for sufficient food for their families and had to reduce consumption of food. Diet diversity and food intake–particularly animal protein sources—for young children were severely affected. On the other, increased awareness of handwashing and access to soap were also reported. The pandemic is likely to be detrimental to the nutritional status of children in Bangladesh and can exacerbate existing health inequities. Strong social safety net programs are needed to protect vulnerable populations to consequences of restrictive measures, supported in design and implementation by non-governmental organizations."

https://openalex.org/W4311578046,"Currently early diagnosis of malignant lesions at the periphery of lung parenchyma requires guidance of the biopsy needle catheter from the bronchoscope into the smaller peripheral airways via harmful X-ray radiation. Previously, we developed an image-guided system, iMTECH which uses electromagnetic tracking and although it increases the precision of biopsy collection and minimizes the use of harmful X-ray radiation during the interventional procedures, it only traces the tip of the biopsy catheter leaving the remaining catheter untraceable in real time and therefore increasing image registration error. To address this issue, we developed a shape sensing guidance system containing a fiber-Bragg grating (FBG) catheter and an artificial intelligence (AI) software, AIrShape to track and guide the entire biopsy instrument inside the lung airways, without radiation or electromagnetic navigation. We used a FBG fiber with one central and three peripheral cores positioned at 120° from each other, an array of 25 draw tower gratings with 1cm/3nm spacing, 2 mm grating length, Ormocer-T coating, and a total outer diameter of 0.2 mm. The FBG fiber was placed in the working channel of a custom made three-lumen catheter with a tip bending mechanism (FBG catheter). The AIrShape software determines the position of the FBG catheter by superimposing its position to the lung airway center lines using an AI algorithm. The feasibility of the FBG system was tested in an anatomically accurate lung airway model and validated visually and with the iMTECH platform. The results prove a viable shape-sensing hardware and software navigation solution for flexible medical instruments to reach the peripheral airways. During future studies, the feasibility of FBG catheter will be tested in pre-clinical animal models."
https://openalex.org/W4311579392,"PspA and pneumolysin are two important vaccine candidates, able to elicit protection in different models of pneumococcal infection. The high immunogenic potential of PspA, combined with a possible adjuvant effect of pneumolysin derivatives (due to their ability to interact with TLR-4) could greatly improve the immunogenicity and coverage of a protein-based pneumococcal vaccine. A chimeric protein including the N-terminal region of PspA in fusion with the pneumolysin derivative, PlD1, has been shown to induce high antibody levels against each protein, and protect mice against invasive challenge. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular response induced by such vaccine, and to evaluate protection in a murine model of lobar pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia was induced in BALB/c mice by nasal instillation of a high dose of a serotype 14 strain with low virulence. Airway inflammation was confirmed by total and differential cell counts in BAL and by histological analysis of the lungs, and bacterial loads were measured 7 days after challenge. Cytokine levels were determined in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of mice immunized with rPspA-PlD1 fusion after challenge, by flow cytometry and ELISA. After challenge, the mice developed lung inflammation with no invasion of other sites, as demonstrated by histological analysis. We detected significant production of TNF-α and IL-6 in the BALF, which correlated with protection against pneumonia in the group immunized with rPspA-PlD1. In conclusion, we found that the rPspA-PlD1fusion is protective against pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, and protection is correlated with an early and controlled local inflammatory response. These results are in agreement with previous data demonstrating the efficacy of the fusion protein against pneumococcal sepsis and reinforce the potential of the rPspA-PlD1 protein chimera as a promising vaccine strategy to prevent pneumococcal disease."

The two compounds were reported to possess anti-cancer properties. This study aimed to investigate whether stabilization of human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA by GW-2974- and SCH-442416 is a plausible fundamental mechanism underlying their anti-cancer effects. Human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA with sequence AG 3 (TTAGGG) 3 was used. The study used ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), fluorescence, fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism (CD), melting temperatures (T m ) and molecular docking techniques to evaluate interactions. The results showed that GW-2974 and SCH-442416 interacted with G-quadruplex DNA through intercalation binding into two types of dependent binding sites. Binding affinities of 1.3 × 10 8 –1.72 × 10 6 M −1 and 1.55 × 10 7 –3.74 × 10 5 M −1 were obtained for GW-2974 and SCH-442416, respectively. An average number of binding sites between 1 and 2 was obtained. Additionally, the melting temperature curves indicated that complexation of both compounds to G-quadruplex DNA provided more stability (ΔT m = 9.9°C and 9.6°C, respectively) compared to non-complexed G-quadruplex DNA. Increasing the molar ratios over 1:1 (drug:G-quadruplex) showed less stabilization effect on DNA. Furthermore, GW-2974 and SCH-442516 have proven ≥ 4.0 folds better selective towards G-quadruplex over double-stranded ct-DNA. In silico molecular docking and dynamics revealed favorable exothermic binding for the two compounds into two sites of parallel and hybrid G-quadruplex DNA structures. The results supported the hypothesis that GW-2974 and SCH-442416 firmly stabilize human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA in additions to modulating tyrosine kinase and adenosine receptors. Consequently, stabilizing G-quadruplex DNA could be a mechanism underlying their anti-cancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W4311583523,"As transition areas between aquatic ecosystems and the adjacent terrestrial ones, riparian regions are highly exposed to coastal climate hazards. This article describes how climate change and extreme weather impact vulnerable riparian communities and settlements. The analysis is done by reviewing past research and empirical case studies from riparian rural communities of the impact zone of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, the world's most extensive mangrove forest. The article discusses the climate-related impacts on households through a Severity Index of Vulnerability and assesses the adaptation responses they may pursue. The principal climate-related vulnerabilities and impacts due to increases in temperature, storm surges, sea flooding, and sea-level rise are seawater intrusion and riverbank erosion. Many households have adopted several autonomous reactive adaptation strategies rather than planned ones, to cope with these impacts. However, government organisations and NGOs provide less than optimal technical and financial support to households for planned and anticipatory adaptive responses. The main barriers to adaptation were the high cost of improved crop varieties, inadequate agricultural extension services, and a lack of knowledge on effective climate adaptation. The restoration of the mangrove ecosystem may increase its resilience and, among other things, make local communities less exposed. The article also presents some adaptation measures proper to reduce the climate-related vulnerability of riparian settlements."
https://openalex.org/W4311585678,"Recent research has made great strides clarifying the chronology, temporal span, and geographic and technological patterning of the Acheulian in eastern Africa. However, highland occurrences of the Acheulian remain under-represented and their relationship to cultural dynamics in the Rift are still poorly understood. Recently, a stratified sequence of four archaeological layers, recording Acheulian occupations dated between ~1.6 Ma and ~1.3 Ma, has been discovered in locality MW2 of the Melka Wakena site-complex (south-central Ethiopian highlands). This database enabled a systematic exploration of the question of tempo and mode of technological changes at a local sequence, allowing, for the first time, comparison with other highland sites as well as in the Rift. The detailed techno-economic study presented in this study shows that the early Acheulian at the locality was characterized by the co-existence of lithic reduction sequences for small debitage and for flake-based Large Cutting Tool production. In the early, ~1.6 Ma assemblage, a strategy of variable raw material exploitation and technological emphasis on small debitage were coupled with production of few crude bifacial elements. These shifted at ~1.4 Ma towards a preferential and intensive exploitation of a highly knappable glassy ignimbrite and emphasis on Large Cutting Tool production, including higher investment in their techno-morphological aspects. The MW2 sequence tracks lithic technological trends observed in the Rift, with only a short time lag. Diachronic changes in the raw material economy and land use patterns may have occurred at MW2 earlier than previously reported for the Acheulian on the highlands. The behavioral dynamics gleaned from the early Acheulian assemblages at MW2 are important for our understanding of the diachronic changes in the abilities of Acheulian hominins to exploit the diverse geographic and ecological habitats of eastern Africa and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4311827947,"We present and analyze a database of 1.13 million public Instagram posts during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, which erupted in response to George Floyd’s public murder by police on May 25. Our aim is to understand the growing role of visual media, focusing on a) the emergent opinion leaders and b) the subsequent press concerns regarding frames of legitimacy. We perform a comprehensive view of the spatial (where) and temporal (when) dynamics, the visual and textual content (what), and the user communities (who) that drove the social movement on Instagram. Results reveal the emergence of non-institutional opinion leaders such as meme groups, independent journalists, and fashion magazines, which contrasts with the institutionally reinforcing nature of Twitter. Visual analysis of 1.69 million photos show symbols of injustice are the most viral coverage, and moreover, actual protest coverage is framed positively, in contrast with combatant frames traditionally found from legacy media. Together, these factors helped facilitate the online movement through three phases, culminating with online international solidarity in #BlackOutTuesday. Through this case study, we demonstrate the precarious nature of protest journalism, and how content creators, journalists, and everyday users co-evolved with social media to shape one of America’s largest-ever human rights movements."
https://openalex.org/W4311829618,"The main aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitory control (IC) abilities influence the peeking and lying behaviours of 2.5-year-olds, as measured by a modified temptation resistance paradigm (mTRP). Using a longitudinal design, 252 children’s IC abilities were tested at ages 1.5, 2 and 2.5, as well as their ability to lie at age 2.5. Results showed that 35% of 2.5-year-olds peeked, 27% of peekers lied and 40% of non-peekers falsely confessed they had peeked. Non-peekers had higher IC than peekers at ages 2 and 2.5. Lower IC at age 2 increased the probability of peeking at age 2.5 by 6 times. The highest level of IC was presented in children who followed the adult’s restrictions in the mTRP and were then able to tell the truth about their behaviour. These results suggested that the first, or so-called primary, lies of 2.5-year-olds are probably spontaneous, rather than deliberate. Implications for further research were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4310728366,"Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and temporal cortex (TE) all contribute to visual decision-making. Accumulating evidence suggests that vlPFC may play a central role in multiple cognitive operations, perhaps resembling domain-general regions of the human frontal lobe. We trained monkeys in a task calling for learning, retrieval, and spatial selection of rewarded target objects. Recordings of neural activity covered large areas of vlPFC, dlPFC, and TE. Results suggested a central role for vlPFC in each cognitive operation with strong coding of each task feature, while only location was strongly coded in dlPFC and current object identity in TE. During target selection, target location was communicated first from vlPFC to dlPFC, followed by extensive mutual support. In vlPFC, stimulus identities were independently coded in different task operations. The results suggest a central role for the inferior frontal convexity in controlling successive operations of a complex, multi-step task."
https://openalex.org/W4310950797,"Abstract The R-RAS2 GTP hydrolase (GTPase) (also known as TC21) has been traditionally considered quite similar to classical RAS proteins at the regulatory and signaling levels. Recently, a long-tail hotspot mutation targeting the R-RAS2/TC21 Gln 72 residue (Q72L) was identified as a potent oncogenic driver. Additional point mutations were also found in other tumors at low frequencies. Despite this, little information is available regarding the transforming role of these mutant versions and their relevance for the tumorigenic properties of already-transformed cancer cells. Here, we report that many of the RRAS2 mutations found in human cancers are highly transforming when expressed in immortalized cell lines. Moreover, the expression of endogenous R-RAS2 Q72L is important for maintaining optimal levels of PI3K and ERK activities as well as for the adhesion, invasiveness, proliferation, and mitochondrial respiration of ovarian and breast cancer cell lines. Endogenous R-RAS2 Q72L also regulates gene expression programs linked to both cell adhesion and inflammatory/immune-related responses. Endogenous R-RAS2 Q72L is also quite relevant for the in vivo tumorigenic activity of these cells. This dependency is observed even though these cancer cell lines bear concurrent gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding RAS signaling elements. Finally, we show that endogenous R-RAS2, unlike the case of classical RAS proteins, specifically localizes in focal adhesions. Collectively, these results indicate that gain-of-function mutations of R-RAS2/TC21 play roles in tumor initiation and maintenance that are not fully redundant with those regulated by classical RAS oncoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W4311572725,"Bacterial endosymbionts are abundantly found in both hard and soft ticks. Occidentia massiliensis, a rickettsial endosymbiont, was first identified in the soft tick Ornithodoros sonrai collected from Senegal and later was identified in a hard tick Africaniella transversale. In this study, we noted the presence of Occidentia species, designated as Occidentia-like species, in a soft tick O. turicata americanus. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the two genetic markers, 16S rRNA and groEL confirmed the presence of Occidentia-like species in O. turicata americanus ticks. The Occidentia-like species was noted to be present in all developmental stages of O. turicata americanus and in different tick tissues including ovaries, synganglion, guts and salivary gland. The levels of Occidentia-like species 16S rRNA transcripts were noted to be significantly higher in ovaries than in a gut tissue. In addition, Occidentia-like species groEL expression was noted to be significantly higher in tick synganglion than in ovaries and gut tissues. Furthermore, levels of Occidentia-like species 16S rRNA transcripts increased significantly upon O. turicata americanus blood feeding. Taken together, our study not only shows that Occidentia-like species is present in O. turicata americanus but also suggests that this bacterium may play a role in tick-bacteria interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4311573313,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a global health care challenge and a major cause of liver disease. To find new therapeutic avenues with a potential to functionally cure chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we performed a focused screen of epigenetic modifiers to identify potential inhibitors of replication or gene expression. From this work we identified isonicotinic acid inhibitors of the histone lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) with potent anti-HBV activity. To enhance the cellular permeability and liver accumulation of the most potent KDM5 inhibitor identified (GS-080) an ester prodrug was developed (GS-5801) that resulted in improved bioavailability and liver exposure as well as an increased H3K4me3:H3 ratio on chromatin. GS-5801 treatment of HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes reduced the levels of HBV RNA, DNA and antigen. Evaluation of GS-5801 antiviral activity in a humanized mouse model of HBV infection, however, did not result in antiviral efficacy, despite achieving pharmacodynamic levels of H3K4me3:H3 predicted to be efficacious from the in vitro model. Here we discuss potential reasons for the disconnect between in vitro and in vivo efficacy, which highlight the translational difficulties of epigenetic targets for viral diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4311574563,"This study investigates the relationship between auditory localization accuracy in the horizontal plane and the spontaneous translation and rotation of the head in response to an acoustic stimulus from an invisible sound source. Although a number of studies have suggested that localization ability improves with head movements, most of them measured the perceived source elevation and front-back disambiguation. We investigated the contribution of head movements to auditory localization in the anterior horizontal field in normal hearing subjects. A virtual reality scenario was used to conceal visual cues during the test through a head mounted display. In this condition, we found that an active search of the sound origin using head movements is not strictly necessary, yet sufficient for achieving greater sound source localization accuracy. This result may have important implications in the clinical assessment and training of adults and children affected by hearing and motor impairments."
https://openalex.org/W4311575491,"Fatigue is defined as loss of capacity to develop muscle force and/or velocity that is reversible at rest. We assessed non-invasively the fatigue and recovery of inspiratory rib cage muscles during two respiratory endurance tests in healthy individuals.The sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) was assessed before and after two respiratory endurance tests: normocapnic hyperpnea (NH) and inspiratory pressure threshold loading (IPTL). Contractile (maximum rate of pressure development and time to peak pressure) and relaxation parameters (maximum relaxation rate [MRR], time constant of pressure decay [τ], and half relaxation time) obtained from sniff curves and shortening velocity and mechanical power estimated using optoelectronic plethysmography were analyzed during SNIP maneuvers. Respiratory muscle activity (electromyography) and tissue oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy-NIRS) were obtained during endurance tests and SNIP maneuvers. Fatigue development of inspiratory rib cage muscles was assessed according to the slope of decay of median frequency.Peak pressure during SNIP decreased after both protocols (p <0.05). MRR, shortening velocity, and mechanical power decreased (p <0.05), whereas τ increased after IPTL (p <0.05). The median frequency of inspiratory rib cage muscles (i.e., sum of sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and parasternal) decreased linearly during IPTL and exponentially during NH, mainly due to the sternocleidomastoid.Fatigue development behaved differently between protocols and relaxation properties (MRR and τ), shortening velocity, and mechanical power changed only in the IPTL."

Though adult and pediatric vaccines became available to the public, vaccine uptake among youth and particularly younger children has been gradual. This explanatory study aimed to better understand parents’ attitudes and beliefs of the pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and the barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake in a rural community through a brief, online demographic survey, and in-depth qualitative interviews. Forty-one in depth interviews were conducted with parents (31-English and 10-Spanish-speaking) residing in rural and frontier counties in Colorado between September 2021 and February 2022. Six emergent themes related to COVID-19 pediatric vaccine uptake were identified among the population. These themes spanned the three levels of influence in the Social Ecological Model (individual, interpersonal, and community levels). The six themes were identified as such; 1) Vaccine accessibility was associated with pediatric COVID vaccine uptake in rural communities, 2) Previous pediatric vaccine behaviors were not associated with COVID-19 pediatric vaccine uptake, 3) Perceived health status of a child or family member influenced pediatric COVID-19 vaccine uptake, 4) COVID-19 health seeking behaviors, like COVID pediatric vaccine uptake, are influenced by an individual’s prosocial or individualistic perspectives, 5) Child autonomy and “age of consent” frames vaccine decision making behaviors in parents, and lastly 6) Social networks impacted COVID-19 pediatric vaccine decision making. These findings inform next steps for COVID-19 pediatric vaccine uptake including targeted and tailored messaging for communities (cues to actions), engaging youth stakeholders, and identifying trusted sources to build rapport and trust between health professionals and community members. The growing vaccine hesitancy among parents has serious implications for disease eradication and future viral outbreaks. Understanding the perceived barriers and facilitators to pediatric vaccine uptake is important to maintain the health of our youth and communities."

According to the Health Belief Model, health beliefs and perceptions influence the success in adopting disease prevention strategies. While factors influencing hypertension self-care behaviour have been examined previously in patient populations, they have not been assessed in the general community.This was a cross-sectional study conducted between 12 June 2020 to 26 July 2021. An online survey was administered via email and social media to Malaysians in the Selangor and Kuala Lumpur communities. Respondents were over 18 years old, without a formal diagnosis of hypertension. The survey evaluated hypertension knowledge, Health Belief Model constructs, self-care behaviour frequency, and motivators and barriers to self-care behaviour. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the main predictors of self-care behaviour, and descriptive statistics were used to characterise motivators and barriers of each self-care behaviour.Only health motivations (β = 0.217, p < 0.001) and perceived barriers (β = 0.571, p < 0.001) significantly influenced self-care behaviour. Maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity and blood pressure checks need to be improved in the community, particularly in reducing salt and calorie intake. Lack of time, limited choices and laziness are the biggest challenges that need to be tackled in adopting a healthy diet and an active lifestyle in the community. Many are ignorant towards their health status, therefore, do not prioritize blood pressure screenings, suggesting a need to enhance community blood pressure checks for early diagnosis of hypertension.Motivations and barriers were the main determinants of self-care behaviour in the Selangor and Kuala Lumpur community. Targeting these aspects of self-care behaviour should be considered when developing interventions and education programmes tailored to local cultural, environmental and personal factors, to more effectively reduce the hypertension prevalence and burden."

(n = 20) were induced. Animals were randomized to hypothermia (33°C) or normothermia (38°C). We evaluated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissue levels of cytokines and investigated changes in microRNA- and gene-expression as well as tissue apoptosis.We observed a significant induction of Interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-6, IL-8, and Cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA in lung tissue. Likewise, an increased IL-6 protein concentration could be detected in BAL-fluid, with a slight decrease of IL-6 protein in animals treated with hypothermia. Lower IL-10 protein levels in normothermia and higher IL-10 protein concentrations in hypothermia accompanied this trend. Tissue apoptosis increased after trauma. However, intervention with hypothermia did not result in a meaningful reduction of pro-inflammatory biomarkers or tissue apoptosis.We observed signs of a time-dependent pulmonary inflammation and apoptosis at the site of severe trauma, and to a lower extent in the trauma-distant lung. Intervention with mild hypothermia had no considerable effect during 48 hours following trauma."
https://openalex.org/W4311580855,"Studies have produced vastly disparate findings when exploring relationships between social networking site (SNS) usage and psychosocial well-being. These inconsistencies might reflect a lack of consideration for how people use SNS; specifically, while meaningful interactions are suggested to foster positive feelings, the passive consumption of others' feeds is proposed to have negative effects on users' well-being. To facilitate the empirical evaluation of these claims, the present study developed a computerised task to measure styles of usage on a mock SNS platform. Administering this Social Network Site Behaviour Task (SNSBT) online to 526 individuals, we identified three dissociable usage styles that extend the active-passive dichotomy employed frequently in the literature: passive use (consuming content posted by others), reactive use (reacting to others' content), and interactive use (interacting with others through content sharing). Furthermore, our data reveal that these usage styles differ on several measures of psychosocial variables employed frequently in the disparate literature: more interactive users reported greater feelings of social connectedness and social capital than passive or reactive users. Importantly, however, our results also reveal the multi-dimensional nature of usage styles, with online network size and time spent on SNS platforms serving as potentially confounding influences on some psychosocial measures. These findings not only advance our understanding of SNS behaviour by providing empirical support for theoretic propositions, but also demonstrate the utility of the SNSBT for experimental investigations into the psychosocial outcomes of different SNS usage styles."
https://openalex.org/W4311581781,"β-thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disease with the reduction or absence in the production of β-globin chain in the hemoglobin, which is caused by mutations in the Hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene. In Vietnam, the number of β-thalassemia carriers range from 1.5 to 25.0%, depending on ethnic and geographical areas, which is much higher than WHO's data worldwide (1.5%). Hence, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) plays a crucial role in reducing the rate of β-thalassemia affected patients/carriers. In this research, we report the feasibility and reliability of conducting PGD in combination with the use of short tandem repeat (STR) markers in facilitating the birth of healthy children. Six STRs, which were reported to closely linked with the HBB gene, were used on 15 couples of β-thalassemia carriers. With 231 embryos, 168 blastocysts were formed (formation rate of 72.73%), and 88 were biopsied and examined with STRs haplotyping and pedigree analysis. Thus, the results were verified by Sanger sequencing, as a definitive diagnosis. Consequently, 11 over 15 couples have achieved pregnancy of healthy or at least asymptomatic offspring. Only three couples failed to detect any signs of pregnancy such as increased Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) level, foetal sac, or heart; and one couple has not reached embryo transfer as they were proposed to continue with HLA-matching to screen for a potential umbilical cord blood donor sibling. Thus, these results have indicated that the combination of PGD with STRs analysis confirmed by Sanger sequencing has demonstrated to be a well-grounded and practical clinical strategy to improve the detection of β-thalassemia in the pregnancies of couples at-risk before embryo transfer, thus reducing β-thalassemia rate in the population."

The prevalence of Bartonella and Rickettsia in Iran is unknown. This study aimed to detect Rickettsia spp. and Bartonella species in ticks in northeast Iran and conduct phylogenetic analysis on these bacteria. Ticks from the sample bank in the Research Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases were included in this study. The ticks were collected in 2017 and 2018 from domestic animals (sheep, goats, cows, camels, horses, dogs, and donkeys) and rodents in Golestan, Mazandaran, and Guilan provinces. Molecular methods were used to examine the DNA extracted from these samples to detect Rickettsia spp. and Bartonella species. The study examined a total of 3999 ticks. Ixodes ricinus (46.4%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (26.3%), and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (17.1%) were the most prevalent species. Among 638 DNA pools, real-time-PCR detected Rickettsia spp. in 161 (25.2%), mostly belonging to Rh. sanguineus (48.9%) and Rh. turanicus (41.9%). Golestan Province had the highest number of positive pools (29.7%). No positive samples for Bartonella were detected in a 638 pooled samples. Eight distinct Rickettsia species were detected in 65 sequenced samples, the majority of which were R. massiliae (n = 32, 49.2%) and R. sibirica (n = 20, 30.8%). Other species included R. rhipicephali (n = 3), R. aeschlimannii (n = 5), R. helvetica (n = 5), R. asiatica (n = 4), R. monacensis (n = 6), and R. raoultii (n = 1). The research findings may provide helpful information about tick-borne Rickettsiae in Iran and help to clarify the role of these arthropods in maintaining these agents. Rickettsia species were found to be circulating in three Northern provinces; thus, it is recommended that this disease be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile diseases caused by tick bites and febrile diseases with skin rashes such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)."

https://openalex.org/W4311588901,"The effect of resting heart rate (RHR) on the heart rate (HR) dynamics and parasympathetic modulation at rest, exercise, and recovery remain to be clarified. This study compares HR and parasympathetic responses at rest, during submaximal exercise testing and recovery in young, physically active men with different RHR average values. HR and parasympathetic responses were compared between two groups: bradycardia group–RHR &lt; 60 bpm (BG, n = 20) and normocardia group–RHR ≥ 60 ≤ 100 bpm (NG, n = 20). A Polar RS800® was used to record the RR-interval series and HR at rest in the supine position, following the postural change (from supine to orthostatic position) and in the orthostatic position for 5 minutes, as well as during and after a submaximal exercise testing. Statistical analysis employed the MANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and Simple Linear regression test with a two-tailed p-value set at ≤ 0.05. BG at rest showed lower HR in the orthostatic position, higher parasympathetic activity in the supine and orthostatic positions, and higher parasympathetic reactivity than NG (p ≤ 0.01) after the postural change. BG before exercise showed lower HR and higher values of the chronotropic reserve and parasympathetic withdrawal than NG (p ≤ 0.01) throughout the exercise. Following the exercise, BG showed higher values of HR recovery (HRR) and parasympathetic reactivation in the 3 rd and 5 th minutes of recovery than NG (p ≤ 0.01). Lastly, the RHR can explain the variance of the HR at rest, during exercise testing, and recovery from 11 to 48%. We concluded that BG (RHR &lt; 60 bpm) showed higher chronotropic and parasympathetic modulation at rest, higher chronotropic reserve, parasympathetic withdrawal during the submaximal exercise test, and faster HRR and parasympathetic reactivation after effort in young physically active men."
https://openalex.org/W4311589402,"Osmoregulatory behaviours should have evolutionarily modified for terrestrialisation of vertebrates. In mammals, sensations of buccal food and drying have immediate effects on postprandial thirst to prevent future systemic dehydration, and is thereby considered to be 'anticipatory thirst'. However, it remains unclear whether such an anticipatory response has been acquired in the non-tetrapod lineage. Using the mudskipper goby (Periophthalmus modestus) as a semi-terrestrial ray-finned fish, we herein investigated postprandial drinking and other unique features like full-body 'rolling' over on the back although these behaviours had not been considered to have osmoregulatory functions. In our observations on tidal flats, mudskippers migrated into water areas within a minute after terrestrial eating, and exhibited rolling behaviour with accompanying pectoral-fin movements. In aquarium experiments, frequency of migration into a water area for drinking increased within a few minutes after eating onset, without systemic dehydration. During their low humidity exposure, frequency of the rolling behaviour and pectoral-fin movements increased by more than five times to moisten the skin before systemic dehydration. These findings suggest anticipatory responses which arise from oral/gastrointestinal and cutaneous sensation in the goby. These sensation and motivation seem to have evolved in distantly related species in order to solve osmoregulatory challenges during terrestrialisation."

Despite overwhelming evidence that labor activities are distributed unevenly across space, detailed statistics on the geographical distribution of labor and work are not readily available. To fill this gap, we demonstrated an approach to create fine-scale gridded occupation maps by means of downscaling district-level labor statistics, informed by remote sensing and other spatial information. We applied a super-learner algorithm that combined the results of different machine learning models to predict the shares of six major occupation categories and the labor force participation rate at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (~1x1 km) in Vietnam. The results were subsequently combined with gridded information on the working-age population to produce maps of the number of workers per occupation. The super learners outperformed (n = 6) or had similar (n = 1) accuracy in comparison to best-performing single machine learning algorithms. A comparison with an independent high-resolution wealth index showed that the shares of the four low-skilled occupation categories (91% of the labor force), were able to explain between 28% and 43% of the spatial variation in wealth in Vietnam, pointing at a strong spatial relationship between work, income and wealth. The proposed approach can also be applied to produce maps of other (labor) statistics, which are only available at aggregated levels."
