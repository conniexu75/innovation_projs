https://openalex.org/W1963533648,"Almost 15 years have passed since carbynes entered the literature as new forms of elemental carbon. They recently attracted attention as possible interstellar dust constituents and as carriers of presolar noble gases in meteorites. Their existence and that of the related mineral chaoite are questioned, and a reevaluation of previous data is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1994279919,"The predatory sun star, Heliaster kubiniji, once the commonest rocky intertidal asteroid of the Gulf of California, has been rare throughout this region since summer 1978 when a devastating disease outbreak occurred. This unprecedented phenomenon and several other exceptional ecological events in marine communities of the northeastern Pacific appear to be linked to large-scale climatic changes that occurred during 1977 and 1978. Implications of the decline in Heliaster kubiniji are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031224888,"Mammal faunas collected from the Uqu√≠a Formation at Chucalezna and Esquina Blanca in Jujuy Province, northwest Argentina, are calibrated by potassium-argon age determinations and paleomagnetic polarity data. The sediments range in age from 2.5 million years old to perhaps as young as 1.5 million years, from late Pliocene through early Pleistocene, and correspond in time to late Blancan and early Irvingtonian land mammal age faunas in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2063781797,"A new carotenoporphyrin has been prepared in which a synthetic carotenoid is joined to a tetraarylporphyrin through a flexible trimethylene linkage. This molecule exists primarily in an extended conformation with the carotenoid chromophore far from the porphyrin pi-electron system. In benzene solution, where large-amplitude molecular motions are rapid, the molecule can momentarily assume less stable conformations which favor triplet energy transfer, and quenching of the porphyrin triplet by the carotenoid is fast. In a polystyrene matrix or frozen glass such motions are slow, and energy transfer cannot compete with other pathways for depopulating the triplet state. These observations help establish the requirements for biological photoprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2085634686,"Lattice dimensions of bismuth vanadate have been determined under 37 different high-pressure or high-temperature conditions or a combination of these conditions. New high-pressure, high-temperature, single-crystal x-ray techniques were used to bracket the reversible monoclinic (ferroelastic) to tetragonal (paraelastic) transition."
https://openalex.org/W2031670813,"A fungus parasite observed on two ancient lemma fragments of wheat was identified as Puccinia graminis. The fragments were found in a storage jar from the Late Bronze Age excavated at Tel Batash, Israel, Uredia, hyphae, and germinating uredospores, though charred, were well preserved."
https://openalex.org/W1973580691,Recent archeological fieldwork on the north coast of Peru permits a preliminary reconstruction of a prill-extraction copper and copper alloy smelting process heretofore undocumented in the New World. The process was applied on a large scale during the late pre-Hispanic period. This study provides strong support for the claim that central Andean metallurgy constituted one of the major independent metallurgical traditions of the world.
https://openalex.org/W2045239446,"The space shuttle era will focus renewed attention on the hazards of the space environment to human habitation. The chief unpredictable hazard for astronauts is energetic proton radiation from solar flares. In some orbits, there is no reasonable level of shielding material that will protect shuttle occupants from potentially lethal doses of radiation. The effects of a solar flare that occurred druing the first flight of the Columbia are discussed and current flare research reviewed. The emphasis is on progress made during the recent international Solar Maximum Year toward understanding the origins of proton showers."
https://openalex.org/W2120525659,"By considering the present occurrence of hydrocarbons, past geologic conditions, and timing of deposition, deformation, and metamorphism, realistic limits to hydrocarbon occurrences in the Appalachians may be defined. Additional consideration of thermal gradients and present depths to possible sedimentary rocks in the footwall beneath the Blue Ridge-Piedmont overthrust indicates that hydrocarbon stability is unlikely beneath much of it today."
