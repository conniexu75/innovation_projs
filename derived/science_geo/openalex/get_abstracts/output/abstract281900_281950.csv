https://openalex.org/W2093730168,"Interstellar hydrogen ionized primarily by the solar wind has been detected by the SWICS instrument on the Ulysses spacecraft at a distance of 4.8 astronomical units from the sun. This ""pick-up"" hydrogen is identified by its distinct velocity distribution function, which drops abruptly at twice the local solar wind speed. From the measured fluxes of pick-up protons and singly charged helium, the number densities of neutral hydrogen and helium in the distant regions of the solar system are estimated to be 0.077 ± 0.015 and 0.013 ± 0.003 per cubic centimeter, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1964539248,Directionally oriented peptide layers 1000 angstroms thick were constructed by polymerization on gold and indium-tin-oxide glass. A key feature is the use of an appropriately functionalized surface on which the initiation sites for polymerization are spaced at distances consistent with the helical diameter of the peptide. Completely helical polyalanine and polyphenylalanine layers have been constructed. The helicity of the polyalanine layer was completely retained after heating at 180 degrees C for 7 days.
https://openalex.org/W2018205538,"Motor vehicle emissions have been and are being controlled in an effort to abate urban air pollution. This article addresses the question: Will the vehicle exhaust emission control and fuel requirements in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and the California Air Resources Board regulations on vehicles and fuels have a significant impact? The effective control of in-use vehicle emissions is the key to a solution to the motor vehicle part of the urban air pollution problem for the next decade or so. It is not necessary, except perhaps in Southern California, to implement extremely low new car emission standards before the end of the 20th century. Some of the proposed gasoline volatility and composition changes in reformulated gasoline will produce significant reductions in vehicle emissions (for example, reduced vapor pressure, sulfur, and light olefin and improved high end volatility), whereas others (such as substantial oxygenate addition and aromatics reduction) will not."
https://openalex.org/W2043234911,The reaction dolomite + 2 coesite --><-- diopside + 2 diamond + 2O(2) defines the coexistence of diamond and carbonate in mantle eclogites. The oxygen fugacity of this reaction is approximately 1 log unit higher at a given temperature and pressure than the oxygen fugacities of the analogous reactions that govern the stability of diamond in peridotite. This difference allows diamond-bearing eclogite to coexist with peridotite containing carbonate or carbonate + diamond. This potential coexistence of diamond-bearing eclogite and carbonate-bearing peridotite can explain the presence of carbon-free peridotite interlayered with garnet pyroxenites that contain graphitized diamond in the Moroccan Beni Bousera massif at the Earth's surface and the preferential preservation of diamond-bearing eclogitic relative to peridotitic xenoliths in the Roberts Victor kimberlite.

These additions to the model show that the major controls on CO(2) concentrations during the Paleozoic era were solar and biological, and not tectonic, in origin. The model predictions agree with independent estimates of a large mid-Paleozoic (400 to 320 million years ago) drop in CO(2) concentrations, which led to large-scale glaciation. This agreement indicates that variations in the atmospheric greenhouse effect were important in global climate change during the distant geologic past."
https://openalex.org/W2050590105,"The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM), which separate the West Antarctic rift system from the stable shield of East Antarctica, are the largest mountains developed adjacent to a rift. The cause of uplift of mountains bordering rifts is poorly understood. One notion based on observations of troughs next to many uplifted blocks is that isostatic rebound produces a coeval uplift and subsidence. The results of an over-snow seismic experiment in Antarctica do not show evidence for a trough next to the TAM but indicate the extension of rifted mantle lithosphere under the TAM. Furthermore, stretching preceded the initiation of uplift, which suggests thermal buoyancy as the cause for uplift."

https://openalex.org/W2069220259,"ABSTRACT We have previously reported that chimpanzees chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) could be reinfected, even with the original infecting strain. In this study we tested the hypothesis that this might reflect the presence of minor quasispecies to which there was little or no immunity. To evaluate this hypothesis, we sequenced multiple clones taken at intervals after primary infection and rechallenge from four chronically infected chimpanzees. The inoculum used in these studies (HCV-H, genotype 1a) revealed 17 separate variants among 46 clones sequenced. Following challenge, each of the four challenged animals showed marked alterations of their quasispecies distribution. The new variants, which appeared 1 to 6 weeks after challenge, were either identical to or closely resembled variants present in the challenge inoculum. These results, paralleled by an increase in viremia in some of the challenged animals, suggest that quasispecies in the challenge inoculum were responsible for signs of reinfection and that there was little immunity. However, the newly emerged quasispecies completely took over infection in only one animal. In the remaining three chimpanzees the prechallenge quasispecies were able to persist. The natural evolution of infection within chimpanzees resulted in variants able to compete with the inoculum variants. Whether through reexposure or the natural progression of infection, newly emerged quasispecies are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection."
