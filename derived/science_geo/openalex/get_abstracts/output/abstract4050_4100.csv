https://openalex.org/W2061177902,"Abstract Three cloned cell lines have been established from murine tumors induced with Abelson leukemia virus which express properties of macrophages. Two of the three original tumors in addition yielded lymphocyte cell lines, one typical of the Abelson virus disease and the other a thymic lymphoma. Two of the macrophage lines are tumorigenic when placed in syngeneic mice. All of the macrophage lines pinocytose neutral red, phagocytose zymosan and latex beads, mediate antibody-dependent killing and phagocytosis of sheep erythrocyte targets, and secrete high levels of lysozyme. None of these properties was exhibited by the lymphocyte lines. Of the two macrophage cell lines tested, neither was capable of replacing the adherent cell population required for the induction of in vitro immune responses. An agent that activates normal macrophages, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, specifically inhibits the growth of the transformed macrophages in culture. Secretion of infectious Abelson leukemia virus by two of the macrophage lines, RAW 309Cr and WR 19M, provides conclusive evidence that the Abelson virus is capable of productively infecting the macrophage cell type. The other macrophage line, RAW 264, fails to secrete detectable virus particles and is negative in the XC plaque formation assay, as well as the fibroblast transformation assay for Abelson virus, but becomes positive for Abelson virus production after rescue by Moloney leukemia virus."

https://openalex.org/W2028683797,"A specific receptor on the surface of cultured human fibroblasts binds plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) with high affinity, and thereby initiates a cellular process by which the LDL is internalized and degraded within lysosomes and its cholesterol component is made available for cellular membrane synthesis. Current studies demonstrate that the activity of this LDL receptor is under feedback regulation. Prior incubation of fibroblast monolayers with cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, or LDL progressively reduced the ability of the cells to bind 125I-labeled LDL at the high affinity site. A series of kinetic studies indicated that this reduction in binding was due to a decrease in the number of LDL receptors. From measurements of the rate of decline in 125I-LDL binding activity after administration of cycloheximide, the LDL receptor was calculated to have a half-life of about 25 hr. LDL appeared to reduce 125I-LDL-binding activity by suppressing the synthesis of receptor molecules. Thus cultured human fibroblasts regulate their intracellular cholesterol content by regulating the activity of the LDL receptor, which in turn controls the rate of cellular entry of cholesterol derived from plasma LDL contained within the culture medium."

https://openalex.org/W1994991276,"Capillary endothelial cells isolated from rat brain exhibit Na+-dependent uptake of the neutral amino acid analog α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid. Since studies in vivo demonstrate that this transport system is not present on the blood side of brain capillaries we conclude that Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transport is located on the brain side. Therefore, the luminal plasma membrane and the antiluminal plasma membrane appear to be functionally distinct. This polarity should permit brain capillary endothelial cells to actively regulate the internal milieu of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2021278591,"After 3 weeks of twice-daily administration of desipramine to rats, the frequency-response curve for field stimulation of adrenergic neurons in isolated left atrial strips was shifted markedly to the left and the efflux of [3H]norepinephrine was enhanced greatly. After 1 day of treatment, only slight shifts in the frequency-response curve and small increases in [3H]norepinephrine efflux occurred although inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake was already maximal, and phenoxybenzamine caused a further shift to the left in the frequency-response curve similar to that which occurred after 3 weeks of desipramine treatment alone. A gradual decrease in the sensitivity of the presynaptic alpha receptor would explain the delay in the onset of the linical effect of the tricyclic antidepressants."
https://openalex.org/W1971854296,We have investigated the mechanisms by which dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) stimulates the production of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) by cell cultures derived from mammary carcinomas of GR mice. Treatment of these cells with dexamethasone stimulates a rapid accumulation of intracellular virus-specific RNA which is dependent upon RNA synthesis but not upon DNA or protein synthesis. The effect of dexamethasone is probably mediated by a specific and saturable glucocorticoid receptor. We conclude that the accumulation of MMTV RNA is a primary response to dexamethasone and that the rate of synthesis of MMTV RNA is probably accelerated by treatment with dexamethasone.
https://openalex.org/W2063270572,"Owl monkeys were inoculated intracerebrally, subcutaneously, and intravenously with JC, BK, or SV40 virus. Two of four adult owl monkeys inoculated with JC virus, a human polyomavirus, developed brain tumors at 16 and 25 months after inoculation, respectively. A grade 3 to grade 4 astrocytoma (resembling a human glioblastoma multiforme) was found in the left cerebral hemisphere and brainstem of one monkey. The second monkey developed a malignant tumor in the left cerebral hemisphere containing both glial and neuronal cell types. Impression smears prepared from unfixed tissue of this tumor showed cells that contained polyomavirus T antigen. Virion antigens were not detected. Tumor cells cultured in vitro also contained T antigen but were negative for virion antigen. Infectious virus was not isolated from extracts of this tumor."
https://openalex.org/W1640573482,"One of the two nonidentical subunits of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, protein B2, contains an organic free radical required for enzyme activity. Earlier isotope subtitution experiments (Sjoberg, B.-M., Reichard, P. Graslund, A., and Ehrenberg, A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 536-541) demonstrated that the radical was localized to a tyrosine residue of the enzyme and suggested that the spin density of the radical was centered at the methylene carbon of tyrosine. However, additional isotope substitution experiments now show that the spin density of the radical must be delocalized over the aromatic ring of the tyrosine residue."

https://openalex.org/W1595659121,"In order to investigate the roles of the physical states of phospholipid and protein in the enzymatic behavior of the Ca2+ -ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum, we have modified the lipid phase of the enzyme, observed the effects on the enzymatic activity at low temperatures, and correlated these effects with spectroscopic measurements of the rotational motions of both the lipid and protein components. Replacement of the native lipids with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine inhibits ATPase activity and decreases both lipid fluidity, as monitored by EPR spectroscopy on a stearic acid spin label, and protein rotational mobility, as monitored by saturation transfer EPR spectroscopy on the covalently spin-labeled enzyme. Solubilization of the lipid-replaced enzyme with Triton X-100 reverses all three of these effects. Ten millimolar CaCl2 added either to the enzyme associated with the endogenous lipids or to the Triton X-100 soulbilized enzyme inhibits both ATPase activity and protein rotational mobility but has no detectable effect on the lipid mobility. These results are consistent with the proposal that both lipid fluidity and protein rotational mobility are essential for enzymatic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2005001360,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the leader RNA synthesized in vitro by the Indiana serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus is presented. The sequence was determined by the technique described by Donis-Keller, Maxam and Gilbert (1977) in combination with the standard two-dimensional fingerprint techniques described by Barrell (1971). The leader RNA contains 48 nucleotides variably terminating at the 3' terminus with cytosine (68%) and adenosine at position 47 (32%). Since the leader RNA is complementary to the 3' terminal portion of the viral genome RNA, the first 48 nucleotides from the 3' end of the genome RNA can be decuded. The leader RNA contains repetitive and palindromic sequences with a polypurine sequence at its 3' terminus. The possible role of some of the sequences is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585903151,"A protein, present in bovine seminal plasma, initiates forward motility in immature, immotile caput spermatozoa that have been incubated with a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. An improved motility assay was developed to study this process and the protein involved. This forward motility protein exhibits multiple forms when fractionated on the basis of charge or molecular weight. Molecular sieving in urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol results in a single peak of activity which will re-form the larger aggregates in the absence of these agents. The molecular weight of this monomeric motility protein, as estimated from molecular sieving under these dissociating conditions, is 37,500. The forward motility protein can be partially purified by heat treatment, gell chromatography in urea, and affinity chromatography on concanavalin A/agarose. Enzymatic treatments further suggest a glycoprotein nature, i.e. treatment with beta-galactosidase, neuraminidase, alpha-mannosidase, or galactose oxidase reduces its activity by 50%; treatment with trypsin completely abolishes forward motility protein activity. On the basis of concurrent studies on the activity, properties, and distribution of forward motility protein in bovine body fluids, it is suggested that this protein is involved in the development of the capacity for motility as sperm traverse the epididymis."
https://openalex.org/W1579123093,"A K+ -stimulated ATPase in membranes of Escherichia coli has been identified as an activity of the Kdp system, and ATP-driven K+ transport system. Three characteristics support association of the ATPase with the Kdp system: (i) ATPase and Kdp transport are both repressed by growth in media containing high concentrations of K+; (ii) the ATPase and Kdp system accept only K+ as substrate, neither requires Na+ nor accepts Rb+ as a substrate; (iii) the affinity of the ATPase and that of th Kdp system for K+ is similar and is altered by mutations in the structural genes of the Kdp system. Discovery of an ATPase associated with a bacterial transport system suggests functional similarities with the ATP-driven transport systems of animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1558786268,"The state of self-association of the apoprotein components of human high density lipoprotein have been studied by use of the cross-linking reagent dimethyl-suberimidate. Analusis of the cross-linked products was carried out by soduim dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and by agarose column chromatography in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Apo-A-I was found to exist as a monomer at low concentration, but associates to tetrameric and pentameric forms at concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml or higher. The self-association was found to be ionic strength-dependent, with association promoted by the presence of salt. Apo-A-II was also found to associate, but the major oligomeric form observed was dimeric (Mr = 34,000), and the association was less dependent on ionic strength than for apo-A-I. Cross-linking in the presence of various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride showed that apo-A-II self-association persisted at higher concentrations of the denaturant than for apo-A-I. Studies of the effect of temperature demonstrated that the self-association of both proteins was diminished at temperatures above 30 degrees C. Recombination of apo-A-II with phospholipid resulted in the formation of particles which yielded primarily trimers upon cross-linking. This suggests that phospholipid binding causes major reorganization of the self-associated forms of apo-A-II."
https://openalex.org/W1999271526,"beta-Endorphin is not detectable in plasma from normal human subjects when measured under baseline conditions or after the subjects have received vasopressin, an agent that elevates beta-lipotropin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Significant amounts of beta-endorphin are present in plasma of patients with endocrine disorders associated with increased ACTH and beta-lipotropin production. Highly purified, natural beta-lipotropin is not peripherally converted to beta-endorphin in vivo in normal subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1577410692,"In order to study the action of the divalent cation which is essential for phosphorylation of sodium- and potassium-transport adenosine triphosphatase, magnesium ion, the normal ligand, was replaced with calcium ion, which had properties diffeerent from those of Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+. Phosphorylation of the enzyme from ATP at pH 7.4 in the presence of Na+ and Ca2+ yielded a Ca.phosphoenzyme (60% of the maximal level) with a normal rate of dephosphorylation following a chase with unlabeled Ca.ATP (PK = 0.092S-1 at 0 degrees C). In contrast, after a chase by a chelator, namely ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid, or ethylene glycol bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid, dephosphorylation slowed within 5 s and half of the initial phosphoenzyme remained with a stability about 5-fold greater than normal. Three states of the phosphoenzyme were distinguished according to their relative sensitivity to ADP or to K+ added during a chase. Normally prepared Mg.phosphoenzyme was sensitive to K+ but not to ADP; Ca.phosphoenzyme was sensitive either to ADP or to K+; and the stabilized phosphoenzyme prepared from Ca.phosphoenzyme by addition of a chelator was sensitive neither to ADP nor to K+ nor to both together. Addition of Ca2+ to the stabilized phosphoenzyme restored the reactivity to that of Ca.phosphoenzyme. Addition of Mg2+ to the stabilized phosphoenzyme changed the reactivity to that of Mg.phosphoenzyme. Therefore, this unreactive, stabilized state of the phosphoenzyme appeared to be a divalent cation-free phosphoenzyme. With respect to sensitivity to ouabain, Ca.phosphoenzyme was as sensitive as Mg.phosphoenzyme but calcium-free phosphoenzyme was much less sensitive. It was concluded that the divalent cation required for phosphorylation normally remains tightly bound to the phosphoenzyme and is required for normal reactivity. Calcium ion was almost unique in dissociating relatively easily from the phosphoenzyme. Strontium ion appeared to act similarly to Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W2003483927,"The 2S RNA synthesized in vitro by the RNA polymerase of a defective interfering (DI) particle of vesicular stomatitis virus was labeled at its 3' terminus with 32P-cytidine 3', 5' bisphosphate and RNA ligase. Analysis of the labeled RNA showed that it was a family of RNAs of different length but all sharing the same 5' terminal sequence. The largest labeled RNA was purified by gel electrophoresis, and the sequence of 41 of its 46 nucleotides was determined by rapid RNA sequencing methods. The assignment of the remaining 5 nucleotides was made on the basis of an analysis of one of the smaller RNAs and published data. A new approach in RNA sequencing based on the identification of 3' terminal nucleotides of rna fragments originally present in the DI product or generated during the ligation reaction confirmed most of the sequence. The complete sequence of this 46 nucleotide long plus-sense RNA is: ppACGAAGACCACAAAACCAGAUAAAAAA UAAAAACCACAAGAGGGUC-OH. This RNA anneals to the RNA of the DI particle from which it was synthesized, indicating that its synthesis is template-specified. At least the first 17 and possibly all of the nucleotides are also complementary to sequences at the 3' end of two other VSV DI particles which were derived independently and whose genomes differ significantly in length. These data suggest a common 3' terminal sequence among all VSV DI particles which contain part of the Lgene region of the parental genome."

https://openalex.org/W1507734858,"The effects of ATP and divalent cations on a divalent cation-independent phosphorylase phosphatase of Mr = 35,000 (phosphatase S) purified from canine cardiac muscle have been studied. The enzyme can be rapidly inactivated by ATP or other nucleoside di- and triphosphates and PPi, but not by AMP, adenosine, adenine, Pi, EDTA, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N' -tetraacetic acid, 1,10-phenanthroline, or 8-hydroxyquinoline. After removing the inactivating agent, such as ATP or PPi, by gel filtraiton followed by exhaustive dialysis, the inactivated enzyme (apophosphatase S) can be reactivated by preincubating with Mn2+ or Co2+, but not with Mg2+, Ca2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, or Cd2+. The Mn2+ -reactivated enzyme, which is less active than the Co2+ -reactivated enzyme, can be again inactivated by preincubating with ATP. The present findings indicate that phosphatase S contains a tightly bound divalent cation, probably Mn2+, in the active site. ATP and PPi, due to their structural similarity to the phosphoprotein substrate and their ability to chelate metal ions, can readily enter the active site to remove the divalent cation(s) essential for the catalytic function. The present findings also indicate that phosphatase S, a common catalytic subunit of several larger molecular forms of nospecific phosphoprotein phosphatase in cardiac muscle, can exist in two interconvertible forms, a metallized form (active) and a demetallized form (inactive). ATP and metal ions may regulate this class of isozymes by mediating the interconversions."
https://openalex.org/W1988759018,"The expression of alpha-galactosidase in liver, heart, and brain during postembryonic development has been examined in several inbred mouse strains. In most strains, the developmental patterns of alpha-galactosidase are coordinate with those of two other acid hydrolases, beta-glucuronidase and beta-galactosidase. Certain inbred mouse strains, including members of the C57-C58 family, have a tissue-specific alteration in the temporal expression of alpha-galactosidase activity. This alteration shows additive inheritance and appears to be controlled by a single genetic locus. The altered developmental expression of the enzyme is not accompanied by any discernible change in its physical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2073739277,"EPIDEMIOLOGICAL evidence indicates that particulate matter, such as asbestos, can increase the health risk from exposure to chemical carcinogens. For example, asbestos insulation workers show an eightfold increased disposition towards lung cancer; non-smokers had only a slightly increased risk of lung cancer, whereas the smokers had a 92-fold increased risk1,2. These data indicate that 90% of the asbestos related cancers are the result of the co-carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoking and the inhalation of asbestos fibres. We have now examined one possible mechanism of co-carcinogenesis—the ability of particulate matter to increase the rate of cellular uptake of benzo[a]pyrene (BP). We used fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the ability of two particulates, silica and asbestos, to adsorb BP, and to deliver the carcinogen to model membranes. The surface area of the asbestos sample was 60-fold less than that of our silica sample. Surprisingly the asbestos sample showed a greater ability to adsorb BP in a monomeric state than silica. Most importantly BP which is adsorbed to asbestos is more rapidly transported into membranes than BP which is adsorbed to silica. Thus increased cellular exposure to carcinogens, resulting from the presence of particulates which can adsorb and deliver these carcinogens to cells, may be involved in the process of co-carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046502861,"Cells producing avian sarcoma virus (ASV) contain at least three virus-specific mRNAs, two of which are encoded within the 3' half of the viral genome. Each of these viral RNAs can hybridize with single-stranded DNA(cDNA5') that is complementary to a sequence of 101 nucleotides found at the 5' terminus of the ASV genome, but not within the 3' half of the genome. We proposed previously (Weiss, Varmus and Bishop, 1977) that this nucleotide sequence may be transposed to the 5' termini of viral mRNAs during the genesis of these RNAs. We now substantiate this proposal by reporting the isolation and chemical characterization of the nucleotide sequences complementary to cDNA5' in the genome and mRNAs of the Prague B strain of ASV. We isolated the three identified classes of ASVmRNA (38, 28 and 21S) by molecular hybridization; each class of RNA contained a ""capped"" oligonucleotide identical to that found at the 5' terminus of the ASV genome. When hybridized with cDNA5', each class of RNA gave rise to RNAase-resistant duplex hybrids that probably encompassed the full extent of cDNA5'. The molar yields of duplex conformed approximately to the number of virus-specific RNA molecules in the initial samples; hence most if not all of the molecules of virus-specific RNA could give rise to the duplexes. The duplexes prepared from the various RNAs all contained the capped oligonucleotide found at the 5' terminus of the viral genome and had identical ""fingerprints"" when analyzed by two-dimensional fractionation following hydrolysis with RNAase T1. In contrast, RNA representing the 3' half of the ASV genome did not form hybrids with cDNA5'. We conclude that a sequence of more than 100 nucleotides is transposed from the 5' end of the ASV genome to the 5' termini of smaller viral RNAs during the genesis of these RNAs. Transposition of nucleotide sequences during the production of mRNA has now been described for three families of animal viruses and may be a common feature of mRNA biogenesis in eucaryotic cells. The mechanism of transposition, however, and the function of the transposed sequences are not known."

https://openalex.org/W2015102512,"BY the application of a wide variety of restriction enzymes and of recently developed DNA sequencing techniques, large segments of the SV40 genome have now been sequenced1,2. As a result, the expression of the viral genetic information can be studied in molecular detail. The major SV40-specific messenger RNA is a polyA-containing, cytoplasmic RNA which sediments at 16S and is only expressed after the onset of DNA replication3. In vitro translation studies have shown that it codes for VP1, the main structural protein of the virion (ref. 4 and A. Smith, personal communication). 16S mRNA hybridises mainly to the SV40 DNA Hind II + III restriction fragments K, F, J and G, which correspond to the region 0.95 to 0.17 on the standard map5,6. The localisation of these restriction fragments and of 16S mRNA is illustrated in Fig. 1."
https://openalex.org/W1568514591,"Abstract It had been observed previously that a pair of transient EPR resonances (g = 1.78 and 1.69) appears within less than 5 ms on reoxidation of reduced cytochrome c oxidase by O2. Since the location of other lines that are part of the same signal was not known, the quantity of the paramagnetic species involved, and thus the significance of the observed resonances, remained questionable. We have now found a broad resonance at g = 5 which is obviously associated with those at g = 1.78 and 1.69. The width of the signal (approximately 250 mT) at the observed intensity suggests that it represents a significant fraction of one of the components of the enzyme. The signal disappears within less than 5 ms on addition of cyanide or sulfide but only within several hundred milliseconds after addition of ferrocytochrome c. This behavior suggests that it originates from the a3 component of the enzyme. It is suggested that the species represented in the signal is either identical with or part of what has been named collectively the oxygenated form and recently described activated forms of the enzyme. On reoxidation of reduced oxidase with oxygen enriched 90% in 17O, no change of signal shape was seen."

Gentle lysis of cells with urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.24 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) is followed by the removal of high molecular weight bulk DNA by centrifugation. Protein and RNA are removed from the supernatant by hydroxyapatite chromatography in urea/phosphate buffer. Urea is then removed with 0.15 M phosphate buffer and the extrachromosomal DNA, virtually free from protein and RNA, is finally eluted in 0.5 M phosphate buffer. The procedure allows the recovery of about 99% simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA from infected monkey kidney cells in the extrachromosomal fraction. In normal mouse, monkey, andhuman cells, approximately 1% of total cell DNA appears to be extrachromosomal."

We and others have recently reported the finding of a novel mechanism of viral RNA maturation in SV40-infected cells1–7 in which the leader sequences (those found at the 5′ ends of the main bodies of SV40 late mRNAs) and the adjacent coding sequences are transcribed from non-contiguous segments of the viral DNA. Similar observations have been reported for adenovirus mRNAs8,9. This process is known as splicing and may proceed by several possible routes. These include: intermolecular ligation of RNA; deletion in the DNA template of the intervening sequences; looping out of intervening DNA sequences so that the RNA polymerase could skip over short distances; and deletion of the appropriate intervening RNA sequences at the post-transcriptional level. We present here an analysis of R-loop structures10 formed between nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNAs and linear SV40 DNA, which provides support for the last of these possibilities40.
