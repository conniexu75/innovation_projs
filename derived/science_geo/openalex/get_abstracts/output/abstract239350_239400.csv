https://openalex.org/W1981467972,"The steroid hormone estrogen regulates many functionally unrelated processes in numerous tissues. Although it is traditionally thought to control transcriptional activation through the classical nuclear estrogen receptors, it also initiates many rapid nongenomic signaling events. We found that of all G protein–coupled receptors characterized to date, GPR30 is uniquely localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it specifically binds estrogen and fluorescent estrogen derivatives. Activating GPR30 by estrogen resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus. Thus, GPR30 represents an intracellular transmembrane estrogen receptor that may contribute to normal estrogen physiology as well as pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W1986827801,"We show that the specific subcellular distribution of H- and Nras guanosine triphosphate–binding proteins is generated by a constitutive de/reacylation cycle that operates on palmitoylated proteins, driving their rapid exchange between the plasma membrane (PM) and the Golgi apparatus. Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the Golgi, from where it is redirected to the PM via the secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization. The de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by transport of PM-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate. Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific activation responses to growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2131310090,"Understanding the role of competing states in the cuprates is essential for developing a theory for high-temperature superconductivity. We report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments which probe the 4a0 x 4a0 charge-ordered state discovered by scanning tunneling microscopy in the lightly doped cuprate superconductor Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. Our measurements reveal a marked dichotomy between the real- and momentum-space probes, for which charge ordering is emphasized in the tunneling measurements and photoemission is most sensitive to excitations near the node of the d-wave superconducting gap. These results emphasize the importance of momentum anisotropy in determining the complex electronic properties of the cuprates and places strong constraints on theoretical models of the charge-ordered state."

Neuronal populations were monitored with voltage-sensitive dyes after each stimulus. By quantifying the discrimination time of each neuron, we found single neurons that discriminate before the two behaviors are evident. We used principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to find populations of neurons that discriminated earlier than any single neuron. The analysis highlighted the neuron cell 208. Hyperpolarizing cell 208 during a stimulus biases the leech to swim; depolarizing it biases the leech to crawl or to delay swimming."

The origin of the MeO-PBDEs has been uncertain; circumstantial evidence supports a natural and/or an industrial source. By analyzing the natural abundance radiocarbon content of two MeO-PBDEs isolated from a True's beaked whale ( Mesoplodon mirus ), we show that these compounds were naturally produced."
https://openalex.org/W1992856202,"The microenvironments of the thymus are generated by thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and are essential for inducing immune self-tolerance or developing T cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the differentiation of TECs and thymic compartmentalization are not fully understood. Here we show that deficiency in the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 results in disorganized distribution of medullary TECs (mTECs) and the absence of mature mTECs. Engraftment of thymic stroma of TRAF6(-/-) embryos into athymic nude mice induced autoimmunity. Thus, TRAF6 directs the development of thymic stroma and represents a critical point of regulation for self-tolerance and autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1995574044,"In recent work (Fierobe, H.-P., Bayer, E. A., Tardif, C., Czjzek, M., Mechaly, A., Belaïch, A., Lamed, R., Shoham, Y., and Belaich, J.-P. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 49621–49630), we reported the self-assembly of a comprehensive set of defined “bifunctional” chimeric cellulosomes. Each complex contained the following: (i) a chimeric scaffoldin possessing a cellulose-binding module and two cohesins of divergent specificity and (ii) two cellulases, each bearing a dockerin complementary to one of the divergent cohesins. This approach allowed the controlled integration of desired enzymes into a multiprotein complex of predetermined stoichiometry and topology. The observed enhanced synergy on recalcitrant substrates by the bifunctional designer cellulosomes was ascribed to two major factors: substrate targeting and proximity of the two catalytic components. In the present work, the capacity of the previously described chimeric cellulosomes was amplified by developing a third divergent cohesin-dockerin device. The resultant trifunctional designer cellulosomes were assayed on homogeneous and complex substrates (microcrystalline cellulose and straw, respectively) and found to be considerably more active than the corresponding free enzyme or bifunctional systems. The results indicate that the synergy between two prominent cellulosomal enzymes (from the family-48 and -9 glycoside hydrolases) plays a crucial role during the degradation of cellulose by cellulosomes and that one dominant family-48 processive endoglucanase per complex is sufficient to achieve optimal levels of synergistic activity. Furthermore cooperation within a cellulosome chimera between cellulases and a hemicellulase from different microorganisms was achieved, leading to a trifunctional complex with enhanced activity on a complex substrate. In recent work (Fierobe, H.-P., Bayer, E. A., Tardif, C., Czjzek, M., Mechaly, A., Belaïch, A., Lamed, R., Shoham, Y., and Belaich, J.-P. (2002) J. Biol.

Cellulosomes are extracellular macromolecular complexes produced by cellulolytic anaerobic bacteria that efficiently degrade cellulose (the most abundant biopolymer on earth) and related polysaccharides of the plant cell wall (1Bayer E.A. Bélaïch J-P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Typical cellulosomes, such as those produced by Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum contain a scaffolding protein devoid of enzymatic activity that displays a powerful substratetargeting family-3a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, resonance unit; 5Ac, Cel5A appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin; 8Cc, Cel8C appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin; 9Ec, Cel9E appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin; 48Fc, Cel48F appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin; 9Gc, Cel9G appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin; 9Mc, Cel9M appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin; 48Ft, Cel48F appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin; 9Gf, Cel9G appended with a R. flavefaciens dockerin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and numerous cohesin modules (eight and nine for the two respective species) (2Gerngross U.T. Romaniec M.P. Kobayashi T. Huskisson N.S. Demain A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Pages S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Tardif C. Gaudin C. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter cohesins bind to the enzymeborne dockerin modules in a species-dependent manner (4Pages S. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The cohesin-dockerin interaction is Ca2+-dependent and of high affinity (K ≥ 109 m-1) (5Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Fierobe H.P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Within the given species, the dockerin component appears to bind to all of the cohesins with similar affinity, thus suggesting a random incorporation of the enzymes in the cellulosome (3Pages S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Tardif C. Gaudin C. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relative abundance of the catalytic subunits in the cellulosomes is assumed to reflect the level of expression of the corresponding genes as demonstrated recently in the case of C. cellulolyticum using a genetic approach (9Perret S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Belaich J.P. Tardif C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The modular nature of the cellulosomal subunits led to the proposal that the individual modules could be linked together genetically to form chimeric components whose combination would result in the construction of artificial “designer cellulosomes,” which could then be applied to improve the degradation of cellulosic wastes (10Bayer E.A. Morag E. Lamed R. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 379-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In previous studies (6Fierobe H.P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the property of species specificity was indeed exploited to selectively incorporate desired enzymes into precise positions within chimeric minicellulosomes. In this approach, chimeric scaffoldins were constructed that contained a cohesin from each species and an optional CBM. In addition, hybrid cellulases were constructed in which the native dockerins of three different C. cellulolyticum enzymes were replaced by a dockerin of divergent specificity derived from the other species. In total, a library of 75 different bifunctional designer cellulosomes was constructed by combining one of the five chimeric scaffoldins with one of the three dockerin-engineered hybrid cellulases (C. cellulolyticum Cel5A, Cel9E, and Cel48F with an appended C. thermocellum dockerin) in combination with one of the five available wild-type C. cellulolyticum cellulases (Cel5A, Cel8C, Cel9E, Cel48F, and Cel9G) (11Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In most cases, controlled incorporation of the enzyme pairs into chimeric scaffoldins enhanced the level of synergistic activity, especially toward recalcitrant celluloses such as microcrystalline cellulose. The stimulation of the activity was mainly a function of two factors: (i) enzyme proximity within the complex and (ii) the substrate targeting effect of the CBM. Among the 75 different designer cellulosomes tested, the most efficient contained two prominent cellulosomal enzymes, i.e. Cel48F and Cel9G (11Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Nevertheless even the most potent bifunctional designer cellulosome exhibited much less activity on cellulose compared with native cellulosomes purified from C. cellulolyticum (11Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of natural cellulosomes, a new generation of trifunctional designer cellulosomes was developed in which three different enzymes could be integrated at specified positions within the complex. For this purpose, a third cohesin-dockerin device, derived from the cellulosomal system of the rumen bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens, was established (12Rincon M.T. Ding S.Y. McCrae S.I. Martin J.C. Aurilia V. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Flint H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The affinity of the interaction was determined, and species specificity was verified. A new chimeric scaffoldin was then constructed that contained a CBM and three cohesins, one from each of the three species. A series of trifunctional designer cellulosomes was then self-assembled by combining the new chimeric scaffoldin with three different enzymes (selected from native or dockerin-engineered cellulases from C. cellulolyticum and a hemicellulase from C. thermocellum). The resultant designer cellulosomes were examined for their capacity to degrade microcrystalline cellulose and hatched straw substrates.

The vector pETscaf2 was first modified to remove the stop codon located at the end of the scaffoldin coding sequence. The DNA encoding the CBDt-Ct was amplified from pETscaf2 using the primers 5′-TGGCACGATCGATCCGACCAAGGGAGC-3′ (PvuI in boldface) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTAtATCTCCAACATTTAC-3′ (BamHI in boldface, inserted base pair in lowercase) and cloned into PvuI-BamHI-linearized pETscaf2 thus generating pETscaf2-2. The DNA encoding cohesin 1 of ScaB from R. flavefaciens was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-TATAGGATCCGCCGGTGGTTTATC-3′ (BamHI site in boldface) and 5′-AAAGGATCCCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCTTAACAATGATAGCGCCATC-3′ (BamHI site in boldface) introducing six His codons (italics) and a stop codon (underlined) at the 3′ extremity of the coding sequence. The amplified DNA was cloned into BamHI-linearized pETscaf2-2. Correct orientation of the cloned fragment was checked by restriction analysis of the resulting plasmid, pETscaf6. The plasmid pETCohrf encoding His-tagged cohesin 1 of ScaB was obtained by overlap extension PCR from pETscaf6, introducing a silent mutation in the DNA encoding cohesin 1 from ScaB to remove an internal NdeI site using the mutagenic complementary primers 5′-GCTGAAGGTACCTATGATGTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGACATCATAGGTACCTTCAGC-3′ (mutation in bold face) and the external primers 5′-GATATACATATGGCTGGTGGTTTATCCGCTGTGCAG-3′ (NdeI site in boldface) and 5′-CAATCCCTCGAGCTTAACAATGATAGCGCCATCAGTAAGAGT-3′ (XhoI site in bold). The resulting amplified fragment was cloned into NdeI-XhoI-linearized pET22b+ vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) that contains six His codons and a stop codon in frame. pETGf, which encodes Cel9G appended with the dockerin module of ScaA from R. flavefaciens, was obtained by overlap extension PCR. The DNA encoding the C-terminal region of Cel9G core enzyme was amplified from pETGc using the forward primer 5′-TGGACTTGTCTGAAATTGTAGC-3′ that matches a sequence located 79 bp upstream of the unique NcoI site of celG and the reverse primer 5′-AGGAACGAGCTTTGTGCCGGGTTCTGATCCACCTGCGGGTTC-3′. The DNA coding for the dockerin from ScaA was amplified from a pET28a-dockerin ScaA using the forward primer 5′-GAACCCGCAGGTGGATCAGAACCCGGCACAAAGCTCGTTCCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCCGCTCGAGTTGAGGAAGTGTGATGAGTTCAAC-3′ introducing a XhoI site (bold) at the 3′ extremity. The two resultant overlapping fragments (overlapping regions in italics) were mixed, and a combined fragment was synthesized using the external primers. The fragment was subsequently cloned into NcoI-XhoI-linearized pETGc. pETXynZt encoding the xylanase XynZt (19Blum D.L. Kataeva I.A. Li X.L. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) from C. thermocellum was obtained by PCR from C. thermocellum genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-GGGGCCATGGCGGCATCCTTGCCAACCATG-3′ introducing a NcoI site (bold) and the reverse primer 5′-GGCGGATCCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGATAGCCCATAAGAGCTTCCTT-3′ introducing six His codons (italics) and a BamHI site (bold). The amplified fragment was cloned into NcoI-BamHI-linearized pET9d. Positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. DH5α Escherichia coli strain was used as production host for pJFAc and pJFCc. For pET derivatives, BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used as production host. Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The production and purification of 5Ac, 8Cc, 9Ec, 48Fc, 48Ft, 9Gc, Scaf2, and 9Mc were performed as described previously (11Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A.

E. coli strains overproducing Coh-rf, Scaf6, 9Gf, and XynZt were grown in toxin flasks at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with glycerol (12 g/liter) and the appropriate antibiotic until A600 = 1.5. The culture was then cooled to 25 °C (XynZt), 20 °C (Coh-rf and Scaf6), or 15 °C (9Gf), and isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 200 μm (Coh-rf and Scaf6), 50 μm (XynZt), or 40 μm (9Gf). After 16 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 30 min), resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2, and broken in a French press. Coh-rf, Scaf6, XynZt, and 9Gf, which all contain a C-terminal His tag (see Fig. 1), were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). The purification of Coh-rf and 9Gf was achieved on Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm CaCl2. The proteins of interest were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm CaCl2. In the case of Scaf6, the purification was achieved on Avicel PH101 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) as described previously (6Fierobe H.P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For the xylanase XynZt, the final purification was performed by gel filtration using an Δkta system (Amersham Biosciences) and a Hiload 26/60 Superdex preparatory grade column (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of purified proteins was estimated by absorbance (280 nm) in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, using the program ProtParam tool (www.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html) and by quantitative amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 system using ninhydrin detection. The purified proteins were dialyzed by ultrafiltration against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2 and stored at -20 °C. Purification of the Cellulosomes of C. cellulolyticum—The cellulosomes produced by C. cellulolyticum were purified as described previously (20Gal L. Pages S. Gaudin C. Belaich A. Reverbel-Leroy C. Tardif C. Belaich J.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from a 5-day culture (1 liter) on a medium containing 7.5 g/liter crystalline cellulose as the carbon source. The final protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Nondenaturing PAGE—Samples (10 μm final concentration) were mixed at room temperature in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 4 μl were subjected to PAGE (4–15% gradient) using a Phastsystem device (Amersham Biosciences). Stability of Chimeric Cellulosomes—Proteins were mixed at 10 μm (final concentration) in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (w/v) NaN3 and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were extracted at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h and subjected to nondenaturing PAGE as described above and to SDS-PAGE (12%) after addition of loading buffer (25%, v/v) and 5 min of boiling using a vertical electrophoresis system (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Experiments were performed using a BIAcore system (BIAcore, Neuchātel, Switzerland) as described previously (5Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D.

The dockerin-containing enzymes were diluted (2.5–1000 nm) in the same buffer and allowed to interact with the immobilized cohesin or scaffoldins by injections of 600-s duration. The resultant sensograms were evaluated with the biomolecular interaction analysis software (BIAcore) to calculate the kinetic constants of the interaction between Coh-rf and 9Gf. The data were interpreted on the basis of the simple model L + A ↔ LA where L denotes the mobile ligand and A denotes the immobilized receptor. For all tested ligands, control experiments were performed by direct injection on the streptavidin-dextran layer. Enzyme Activity—Hatched straw (0.2–0.8 mm) provided by Valagro (Poitiers, France) was incubated in distilled water under mild stirring for 3 h at room temperature, vacuum filtered on 2.7-μm glass filter, resuspended in water, and incubated for 16 h under mild stirring at 4 °C. The suspension was filtered and washed three times with water, and the concentration of the residual material was estimated by dry weight. The total acid-extractable reducing sugar content was determined according to Ref. 22Yu P. McKinnon J.J. Maenz D.D. Olkowski A.A. Racz V.J. Christensen D.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2003; 51: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar with some modifications: 300 mg (dry matter) were incubated for 1 h with 12 m H2SO4 at 35 °C. The sample was diluted 12 times with distilled water and autoclaved at 120 °C for 1 h. The pH was adjusted to 7 with NaOH, and the suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 8000 × g. The reducing sugar content of the supernatant was determined using the Park and Johnson method (23Park J.T. Johnson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 181: 149-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the glucose content was examined using the glucose oxidase method (24Huggett A.S. Nixon D.A. Lancet. 1957; 273: 368-370Abstract PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The released monosaccharides were also analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on an NH2P50 column (Shodex, Tokyo, Japan) using 75% (v/v) CH3CN. The detection and quantification of the various monosaccharides were performed with a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) refractive index detector. Kinetics were performed by incubating at 37 °C aliquots (40 μl) of the protein samples (10 μm in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2) with 4 ml of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH101, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) or washed straw at 3.5 g/liter in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (w/v) NaN3. The final protein concentration was thus 0.1 μm. Aliquots (0.9 ml) were extracted at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h, centrifuged, and examined for soluble reducing sugars using glucose as the standard. The xylanase activity of XynZt was determined on insoluble xylan (Sigma). Insoluble xylan was prepared according to Ref. 25Mohand-Oussaid O. Payot S. Guedon E. Gelhaye E. Youyou A. Petitdemange H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4035-4040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and resuspended at 10 g/liter in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2. Four milliliters of substrate were incubated at 37 or 60 °C with an appropriate dilution of XynZt. Aliquots (0.9 ml) were extracted at specific intervals, centrifuged, and examined for reducing sugars using xylose as the standard. Activity on methyl ferulate was performed as described previously (26Ralet M.C. Faulds C.B. Williamson G. Thibault J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 263: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with some modifications: 1070 μl of an appropriate dilution of XynZt in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 6, was incubated at 37 and 60 °C with 30 μl of 2.2 mm methyl ferulate (Aapin, Oxon, UK) in the same buffer. The enzymatic release of ferulate was monitored by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 335 nm. Selection and Characterization of a Third Divergent Cohesin-Dockerin Device—Previous studies have shown that complexation of cellulase pairs, appended with suitable dockerins, into hybrid miniscaffoldins containing two divergent cohesins (derived from C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum) served to induce significant increases in cellulolytic activity, especially toward recalcitrant cellulose such as microcrystalline cellulose (6Fierobe H.P.

These reports also indicated that the most efficient bifunctional complexes remain approximately 10 times less active on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) compared with purified C. cellulolyticum cellulosomes, which may contain up to eight different enzymes (11Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with hybrid scaffoldins bearing two divergent cohesins, only two enzymes with a 1:1 stoichiometry could be studied in the complexed state, although it is known that in natural cellulosomes some catalytic subunits are more abundant than others (20Gal L. Pages S. Gaudin C. Belaich A. Reverbel-Leroy C. Tardif C. Belaich J.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, a third specific cohesin-dockerin device was sought to increase the capacity of the hybrid cellulosomes. The first cohesin module of ScaB and the complementary C-terminal dockerin module of ScaA from R. flavefaciens were selected because affinity blotting experiments have shown that these modules interact strongly with each other (12Rincon M.T. Ding S.Y. McCrae S.I. Martin J.C. Aurilia V. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Flint H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, these modules are rather divergent from those found in Clostridium spp. and were classified, on the basis of sequence similarities, in a different phylogenetic group, termed type III (27Rincon M.T. Martin J.C. Aurilia V. McCrae S.I. Rucklidge G.J. Reid M.D. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Flint H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2576-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cross-reactivity with type-I cohesins or dockerins from either C. cellulolyticum or C. thermocellum is therefore unlikely to occur. To accurately determine the affinity constant of the cohesin-dockerin interaction in R. flavefaciens and verify the lack of cross-reactivity with its C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum counterparts, the His-tagged cohesin 1 from ScaB (termed Coh-rf) was overproduced in E. coli and purified. In parallel, Cel9G from C. cellulolyticum was engineered to bear the corresponding R. flavefaciens dockerin from ScaA thus generating 9Gf (Fig. 1). The dockerin-borne cellulase hybrid was subsequently purified from the E. coli overproducing strain. Nondenaturing PAGE experiments (data not shown) of equimolar mixtures of Coh-rf with 9Gf, 5Ac, or 48Ft (see scheme in Fig. 1) showed that Coh-rf can only interact with 9Gf, thus demonstrating the species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction of the R. flavefaciens system versus C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum. Similarly 9Gf was unable to bind to the hybrid scaffoldin Scaf2 (Fig. 1), which contains one cohesin each from C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum but lacks Coh-rf. The interaction between 9Gf (ligand) and Coh-rf (immobilized receptor) was analyzed by SPR, and kinetic constants of 4.1 × 105 s-1 m-1 and 1.1 × 10-4 s-1 were obtained for kon and koff, respectively. The value of the resulting KA, 3.7 × 109 m-1, was lower than that found for the C. thermocellum system (KA > 1011 m-1) using the same technique (6Fierobe H.P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Belaich A. Lamed R.

Inagaki M. Kimura T. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9867-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but similar to the affinity constant of the C. cellulolyticum cohesin-dockerin interaction (KA = 4.8 × 109 m-1) (5Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the latter case, however, both rate constants of association and dissociation are faster. 5Ac and 48Ft at concentrations up to 1 μm failed to interact with the immobilized Coh-rf, whereas no binding of 9Gf at 1 μm to immobilized Scaf2 was detected by SPR. Taken together, these data confirmed the high affinity of the R. flavefaciens cohesin-dockerin interaction and the lack of cross-reactivity with the corresponding modules originating from C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum. The selected cohesin and dockerin from the rumen bacterium thus constituted suitable building blocks for the construction of hybrid cellulosomes.

We showed that the protein expression of ZIP7 was repressed under zinc-rich condition, whereas there were no effects of zinc on ZIP7 gene expression and intracellular localization.

It is an essential cofactor for many enzymes and a structural element for many zinc finger or ring finger proteins. Therefore, when zinc is deficient, a variety of biochemical processes of the human body become dysfunctional resulting in retarded growth, poor cognitive function, abnormal neurosensory function, skin rash, delayed wound healing, hair loss, poor appetite, frequent infections, severe diarrhea, and male hypogonadism (1Prasad A.S.

Dermatol. 2000; 18: 745-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Zinc homeostasis is maintained by a diverse array of zinc transporters through zinc uptake, intracellular sequestration, restoration, and export (4Eide D.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 5Palmiter R.D. Huang L. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Uptake of zinc from the lumen of the small intestine or from the blood circulation of the body is achieved by the members of the ZRT1- and IRT1-like protein (ZIP) 1The abbreviations used are: ZIP, ZRT1- and IRT1-like protein; ZnT, zinc transporter; Zrt, zinc-regulated transporter; Zrc, zinc resistance-conferring; Msc2, meiotic sister-chromatid recombination; ORF, open reading frame; EST, expressed sequence tag; BFA, brefeldin A; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; WI-38, human lung fibroblast cells; MCF-7, human mammary gland epithelial cells; RWPE1, normal human prostate epithelial cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ZRE, zinc-responsive element; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. family (6Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. BioMetals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The ZIP proteins are predicted to have eight transmembrane domains with an intracellular histidine-rich loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4. The loop region of the ZIP protein may play important role in zinc binding as mutations of these histidine residues in the loop region destroyed zinc transport activity of these ZIP proteins (6Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. BioMetals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). So far, fourteen mammalian members of the ZIP family have been identified through mouse and human genome analyses (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Conversely, zinc efflux is accomplished by the members of the ZnT proteins (zinc transporter) (5Palmiter R.D. Huang L. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The ZnT proteins are predicted to have six transmembrane domains with a histidine-rich loop between transmembrane domains 4 and 5. This histidine-rich loop of the ZnT proteins may perform similar functions to the one in ZIP proteins. Within the ZnT family, the ZnT1 protein is involved in zinc efflux from the cell, whereas other ZnT proteins (ZnT2–7) are engaged in subcellular zinc sequestration when zinc is abundant (5Palmiter R.D. Huang L. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The outcome of the ZnT protein function is to reduce the cytoplasmic zinc concentrations to avoid zinc toxicity when zinc is in excess. On the other hand, the ZIP members are essential for an increase of the cytoplasmic zinc concentrations by enhancement of zinc uptake or release of stored zinc from subcellular compartments to the cytoplasm of the cell when zinc is deficient (6Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. BioMetals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Indeed, yeast ZRT1 and ZRT2 as well as mammalian ZIP1–5 proteins have been demonstrated to function in zinc uptake (7Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although a yeast zinc transporter, ZRT3, was reported to mediate the release of the intracellular compartmentalized zinc into the cytoplasm of the yeast cell (16MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), the mammalian counterpart is still not known. To identify a possible mammalian zinc transporter(s) that functions in transporting zinc from subcellular compartments to the cytoplasm of the cell, we performed a prediction analysis for subcellular localization of fourteen mammalian members of the ZIP family based on their amino acid sequences using the online PSORT II (www.psort.org) program. Among the fourteen mammalian members of the ZIP family, ZIP6 and ZIP7 were predicted to have more than a 50% probability to be localized on the membranes of intracellular organelles. In addition, the likelihood that ZIP6 and ZIP7 resided on the plasma membrane of the cell was less than 20%. The mouse ZIP7 (Ke4) gene was discovered while characterizing genes in the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 17 (17Lai F. Stubbs L. Lehrach H. Huang Y. Yeom Y. Artzt K. Genomics. 1994; 23: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Human ZIP7 (HKE4), the human homologue, was mapped to the HLA class II region on chromosome 6 (18Ando A. Kikuti Y.Y. Shigenari A. Kawata H. Okamoto N. Shiina T. Chen L. Ikemura T. Abe K. Kimura M. Inoko H. Genomics. 1996; 35: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mouse ZIP7 protein has been shown to suppress the iar1 mutant phenotype when it was expressed in the Arabidopsis iar1 mutant plant (19Lasswell J. Rogg L.E. Nelson D.C. Rongey C. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2395-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The IAR1 gene in Arabidopsis encodes a protein with similarity to members of the ZIP family. Null mutations in the iar1 gene of Arabidopsis led to suppression of the inhibitory effects of several IAA (indole 3-acetic acid)-amino acid conjugates. It was speculated that the IAR1 protein is a metal transporter to carry metal ions (zinc and/or copper) out of intracellular compartments to the cytoplasm of the plant cell (19Lasswell J. Rogg L.E. Nelson D.C. Rongey C. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2395-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The human ZIP7-V5 recombinant protein was detected intracellularly in transient-transfected CHO (Chinese hamster ovarian) cells. Moreover, expression of the ZIP7-V5 fusion protein in CHO cells led to an increase of the intracellular free zinc ions, measured with Newport Green, a zinc-specific fluorescent dye (20Taylor K. Morgan H.E. Johnson A Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The ZIP6 gene (LIV-1) was isolated in an effort to identify the estrogen-regulated genes in a human breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-1 (21Manning D.L. Daly R.J. Lord P.G. Kelly K.F. Green C.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 59: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mRNA expression of ZIP6 was upregulated about 4-fold in the presence of 10-8 m estradiol in culture medium (21Manning D.L. Daly R.J. Lord P.G. Kelly K.F. Green C.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 59: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent microscopy study of recombinant human ZIP6 indicated that ZIP6 was localized to the plasma membrane of CHO cells (22Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which is in disagreement with the prediction of its cellular localization. The presence of a ubiquitin binding site in the ZIP6 protein may explain its predicted localization (22Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here we describe the functional characterization of the endogenous ZIP7 protein in mammalian cells. Our study demonstrates that ZIP7 mRNA was abundantly expressed in both human and mouse tissues. The endogenous ZIP7 protein was localized in the Golgi apparatus, and the ZIP7 protein transported intracellular zinc from the Golgi apparatus to the cytoplasm of the cell. Overexpression of mouse ZIP7 alleviated compartmental zinc accumulation and resulted in an increased labile zinc pool in yeast zrt3 mutant cells (16MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, the protein expression of ZIP7 was repressed by zinc, and the gene expression of ZIP7 and the intracellular localization of ZIP7 were not affected by zinc availability. Northern Blot Analysis—The human multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from Clontech, BD Biosciences. The mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was prepared using 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from liver, kidney, spleen, heart, brain, small intestine, and lung of a C57BL/6J mouse using a FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation system (Invitrogen). The blots were probed with 32P-labeled full-length ORF (open reading frame) cDNA fragments purified from either the human or the mouse ZIP7 gene (EST clones BG823375 and BG342480). The hybridization was performed in the ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech, BD Biosciences) at 65 °C for 2 h. The blots were rinsed twice with 2× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS solution and then washed twice with 1× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS solution at 50 °C for 15 min. Finally, the blots were washed twice with 0.1× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS solution at 50 °C for 10 min. The blots were exposed to films with intensifying screens at -80 °C for overnight. Western Blot Analysis—The mouse liver and brain tissues isolated from a C57BL/6J mouse were washed with 1× PBS, pH 7.4 and homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. One mini proteinase inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and 56 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added into 10 ml of the lysis buffer just before use. The homogenized tissue was then heated at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagents. 200 μg of protein extracts from liver and brain were separated on a 4–20% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). RWPE1 cells were cultured in a keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml human recombinant EGF and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with 0 or 75 μm ZnSO4 for another 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared as previously described (23Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 100 μg of protein extracts were separated on a 4–20% Tris-HCl gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The bacterial lysates containing the GST-ZIP7 fusion protein or the GST protein alone were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). 1 μg of the bacterial lysates was loaded to each well of a 4–20% Tris-HCl gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The ZIP7 protein was detected as described previously (23Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) using an affinity-purified anti-ZIP7 antibody (1:400 dilution) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,500–1:20,000) (Pierce). ZIP7 was visualized using a SuperSignal west femto kit (Pierce) and an Alpha Innotech Gel Documentation system (Alpha Innotech). The GST-ZIP7 fusion protein was visualized by an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the blot was subsequently exposed to film (Kodak). Antibodies—Rabbit anti-mouse ZIP7 antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide from amino acids of mouse ZIP7 (RRGGNTGPRDGPVKPQS) and affinity-purified (Pierce). The result from a BLAST search of the SWISSPORT data base indicated that this peptide is unique. The monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Stressgen. The Alexa 488- or 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. The peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Pierce. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—WI-38 (human lung fibroblast cells) and MCF-7 (human mammary gland epithelial cells) were cultured in a high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (basal medium) (Invitrogen). RWPE1 (normal human prostate epithelial cells) was cultured in a keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract (basal medium). K-562 (human erythroleukemia cells) was cultured in an Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% FBS, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate. CHO/FRT/ZnT7 cells were cultured in 1:1 DMEM/F12 (Ham) medium with 15 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 2 mg/ml pyridoxine hydrochloride, and 10% FBS (Invitrogen) (24Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The mouse ZIP7-expressing cell line and the control cell line were generated by transfecting pcDNA3.1/ZIP7 or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) into the ZnT7-expressing CHO cells using a Lipofectamine plus kit (Invitrogen). The stable cell lines were selected and maintained in 1:1 DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.1 mg/ml of hygromycin B and 0.6 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). Plasmids—The EST clone, BG342480, containing a full-length mouse ZIP7 ORF was purchased from ResGen (Invitrogen). The ZIP7 ORF sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of a yeast expression vector, pYES2 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pY-ZIP7 was confirmed by sequencing and used for transformation of yeast mutant stains. The mammalian ZIP7-expressing plasmid, pHM6/ZIP7, was constructed by insertion of the ZIP7 ORF cDNA sequence into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pHM6 vector (Roche Applied Science). The plasmid was confirmed by sequencing and used for generation of a stable ZnT7/ZIP7-co-expressing CHO cell line. The yeast ZRE-lacZ reporter plasmid used in this study was kindly provided by Dr. David Eide at the University of Wisconsin (16MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The bacterial GST-ZIP7 fusion protein-expressing plasmid, pGEX/ZIP7, was constructed by insertion of the ZIP7 ORF cDNA sequence into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorscent Microscopy—Immunofluorescent analysis was performed as previously described (23Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). WI-38, RWPE1, MCF-7, K-562, CHO/FRT/ZnT7, and CHO/FRT/ZnT7/ZIP7 cells were cultured in slide chambers for 48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.4% saponin (Sigma). Where indicated, MCF-7 cells were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA, 5 μg/ml) for the indicated time prior to the fixation. In the study of the effect of zinc on the cellular localization of the ZIP7 protein, WI-38, and RWPE1 cells were treated with 0 or 75 μm ZnSO4 in serum-free DMEM (WI-38) or keratinocyte serum-free medium without supplements (RWPE1) for 2 h prior to fixation. In the study of the effect of intracellular zinc deficiency on the cellular distribution of ZIP7, WI-38 and RWPE1 cells were treated with 0 or 10 μm TPEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine, Sigma) or 10 μm TPEN plus 75 μm ZnSO4 for 1 h before fixation (32Kim B.E.

The cells were then stained with the polyclonal anti-ZIP7 (1:100 dilution) or monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (1:100 dilution for the ZIP7-Myc fusion protein) followed by Alexa 488- and 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:250 dilution), respectively. Photomicrographs were obtained by a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope with a digital camera. Zinquin Staining—Zinquin staining was performed using the pcDNA5/ZnT7 and pcDNA5/ZnT7/pHM6/ZIP7 stably transfected CHO cells. Cells were grown in slide chambers for 48 h and then treated with 75 μm ZnSO4 for 3 h in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% chelex-treated FBS (Bio-Rad), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. After ZnSO4 treatment, cells were rinsed three times with 1× PBS (pH 7.4) and then incubated in fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml Zinquin ethyl ester (Dojindo) for 2 h. Cells were washed with 1× PBS (pH 7.4), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.4% saponin (Sigma). The ZnT7 and ZIP7 proteins were detected by anti-Myc and anti-ZIP7 antibodies, respectively. Alexa 488- or 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:250 dilution) was used to visualize the proteins. The blue fluorescence of ZnQ staining was visualized and photographed using a digital Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope with a C-9051 filter (Nikon). Yeast Stains and Culture Conditions—The yeast mutants of zinc homeostasis were from Dr. David Eide at the University of Wisconsin (Δzrt1), Dr. D. Conklin at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (Dzrt3), and ResGen, Invitrogen (Δzrc1 and Δmsc2). Yeast cells were grown in a synthetic defined medium (SD) supplemented with auxotrophic requirements containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose/1% raffinose. Measurement of β-Galactosidase Activity and Cell-associated Zinc Contents—Yeast cells were harvested 6 h after growth in the inducible SD medium containing 2% galactose/1% raffinose. The β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The total protein contents were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The cell numbers were determined by measuring the absorbance of yeast cell suspensions at A600 and converting to cell number based on a standard curve. The cell-associated zinc was measured by a Vista AX Simultaneous ICP-AES (Varian) using a nitric acid digestion method (26Chen H. Su T. Attieh Z.K. Fox T.C. McKie A.T. Anderson G.J. Vulpe C.D. Blood. 2003; 102: 1893-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Total RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—RWPE1 cells were grown in 100-mm plates for 24 h and then treated with either 0 or 75 μm ZnSO4 for 24 h before harvesting. The total RNA was purified by a micro total RNA purification kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript Choice system (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—cDNA was diluted 2-fold, and 2 μl of cDNA was added to a quantitative PCR mixture containing corresponding primer pair and a FAM-labeled TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems). The quantitative PCR reactions were performed on a PRISM® ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) in triplicate, and the expression of β-actin (BACT) was used for normalization. The relative changes of gene expression in response to the ZnSO4 treatment was calculated using relative quantification as follows: ΔΔCt = ΔCtq - ΔCtcb; where Ct = the cycle number at which amplification rises above the background threshold, ΔCt is the change in Ct between two test samples, for example, zinc-untreated and -treated samples; q is the target gene, and cb is the calibrator gene (the calibrator used in this study was BACT). Gene expression is then calculated as 2-ΔΔCt (Applied Biosystems). Expression of ZIP7 in Mouse and Human Tissues—The cDNA and amino acid sequences of human ZIP7 (HKE4) and the comparison of the ZIP7 protein sequence to the other ZIP family members were reported previously by K. M. Taylor et al. (20Taylor K. Morgan H.E. Johnson A Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of ZIP7 in mammalian cellular zinc homeostasis, we first examined the mRNA expression level of ZIP7 in mouse and human tissues by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the mouse ZIP7 cDNA probe hybridized to a band at ∼2.4 kb in the mRNA samples isolated from liver, kidney, spleen, heart, brain, small intestine, and lung. However, two similar intensive bands of ZIP7 at ∼2.2 kb and 2.5 kb were detected in all human tissues examined (Fig. 1). The two different ZIP7 transcripts may be generated by an alternative splicing event that occurred in the 5′-UTR region of ZIP7 as two groups of EST clones of ZIP7 differing in 302 bp in their 5′-UTR region have been found in the GenBank™ EST data base. The expression of ZIP7 was abundant in mouse liver and human heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta (Fig. 1). In addition, the mouse and human ZIP7 mRNAs were also detected in many cDNA libraries including embryo, mammary gland, ovary, uterus, cervix, testis, prostate, tongue, larynx, stomach, pancreas, bladder, eye, pituitary, bone, bone marrow, skin, and peripheral nervous system (UniGene Clusters Mm.18556 and Hs.278721). Taken together, the ZIP7 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in mouse and human tissues. In an effort to detect the endogenous ZIP7 protein, a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acids 296–312 of the mouse ZIP7 protein was raised in rabbit. The selected peptide sequence of the mouse ZIP7 protein was assured to be unique among the ZIP proteins. The resulting rabbit antiserum was affinity-purified with the same peptide used for raising the antibody. 200 μg of protein extracts from mouse liver and brain were analyzed using anti-ZIP7 antibody by Western blot assay. As shown in Fig. 2a, a protein band migrating at ∼56 kDa was detected in the mouse tissues of liver and brain. These protein bands were not seen when preimmune serum were applied (data not shown). The apparent molecular mass of ∼56 kDa is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of mouse ZIP7 (∼51 kDa). The specificity of the newly synthesized anti-ZIP7 antibody was validated by a Western blot analysis using protein extracts from the bacteria expressing either the GST-ZIP7 fusion protein or the GST protein alone. A protein band (∼88 kDa) in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of the GST-ZIP7 fusion protein (∼81 kDa) was detected by the anti-ZIP7 antibody in the bacterial lysate containing the GST-ZIP7 fusion protein whereas no protein band was detected in the bacterial lysate containing the GST protein alone (Fig. 2b). Taken together, the results indicate that the newly synthesized anti-ZIP7 antibody specifically reacts with the ZIP7 protein. Localization of ZIP7 to the Golgi Apparatus in Mammalian Cells—Intracellular zinc homeostasis is maintained by the physiological processes that include zinc uptake, subcellular organelle zinc sequestration and restoration, and zinc export. The members of the ZIP family have been demonstrated to be involved in zinc uptake and in the release of stored zinc into the cytoplasm of cells when zinc is deficient. In yeast, ZRT1 and ZRT2 function as zinc uptake proteins whereas ZRT3 functions as a zinc transporter to release stored zinc into the cytoplasm of the yeast cell. In mammalian cells, the ZIP1–5 proteins have been reported to function as zinc uptake proteins. However, the potential mammalian counterpart(s) of the yeast ZRT3 has not been identified. Previous studies from others demonstrated that the ZIP7-V5 fusion protein resided intracellularly in the transiently transfected CHO cells (20Taylor K. Morgan H.E. Johnson A Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In order to determine the precise subcellular localization of the endogenous ZIP7 in mammalian cells, human cells including human lung fibroblasts (WI-38), human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1), human erythroleukemia cells (K-562), and human mammary gland epithelial cells (MCF-7) were examined using immunofluorescent microscopy analysis. As shown in Fig. 3a, the majority of the anti-ZIP7 antibody-stained fluorescence clustered at the perinuclear regions of WI-38, RWPE1, K-562, and MCF-7 cells. This subcellular localization of ZIP7 resembles that of GM130 (cis-Golgi matrix protein), a Golgi marker (27Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). These results suggested that ZIP7 was localized to the Golgi apparatus. To confirm the localization of ZIP7 in the Golgi apparatus, we treated the cultured MCF-7 with BFA, a fungal macrocyclic lactone known to disrupt the Golgi apparatus, prior to immunofluorescent staining. As shown in Fig. 3b, the perinuclear staining of ZIP7 in the MCF-7 cells (panel A) diffused into the cytoplasm and formed a network staining pattern after 30 min of treatment (panel B). Removal of BFA after 30 min of treatment followed by the incubation of cells in the fresh medium for an hour restored the normal localization of ZIP7 (panel C), strongly suggesting that ZIP7 is associated with Golgi apparatus. Negation of Zinc Accumulation in the Golgi Apparatus by ZIP7—The similarity of ZIP7 to the known zinc and uptake proteins and its cellular localization made ZIP7 a compelling candidate as a zinc transporter functioning in zinc delivery from the Golgi apparatus to the cytoplasm of cells. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a ZnT7-Myc-expressing CHO cell line that we previously generated for studying the function of ZnT7 (24Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Goo"
https://openalex.org/W2081114359,"By exploring global gene expression of <i>Escherichia coli</i> growing on six different carbon sources, we discovered a striking genome transcription pattern: as carbon substrate quality declines, cells systematically increase the number of genes expressed. Gene induction occurs in a hierarchical manner and includes many factors for uptake and metabolism of better but currently unavailable carbon sources. Concomitantly, cells also increase their motility. Thus, as the growth potential of the environment decreases, cells appear to devote progressively more energy on the mere possibility of improving conditions. This adaptation is not what would be predicated by classic regulatory models alone. We also observe an inverse correlation between gene activation and rRNA synthesis suggesting that reapportioning RNA polymerase (RNAP) contributes to the expanded genome activation. Significant differences in RNAP distribution <i>in vivo</i>, monitored using an RNAP-green fluorescent protein fusion, from energy-rich and energy-poor carbon source cultures support this hypothesis. Together, these findings represent the integration of both substrate-specific and global regulatory systems, and may be a bacterial approximation to metazoan risk-prone foraging behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2169748057,"The Wnt signaling pathway is critical in normal development, and mutation of specific components is frequently observed in carcinomas of diverse origins. However, the potential involvement of this pathway in lung tumorigenesis has not been established. In this study, analysis of multiple Wnt mRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary lung tumors revealed markedly decreased Wnt-7a expression compared with normal short-term bronchial epithelial cell lines and normal uninvolved lung tissue. Wnt-7a transfection in NSCLC cell lines reversed cellular transformation, decreased anchorage-independent growth, and induced epithelial differentiation as demonstrated by soft agar and three-dimensional cell culture assays in a subset of the NSCLC cell lines. The action of Wnt-7a correlated with expression of the specific Wnt receptor Frizzled-9 (Fzd-9), and transfection of Fzd-9 into a Wnt-7a-insensitive NSCLC cell line established Wnt-7a sensitivity. Moreover, Wnt-7a was present in Fzd-9 immunoprecipitates, indicating a direct interaction of Wnt-7a and Fzd-9. In NSCLC cells, Wnt-7a and Fzd-9 induced both cadherin and Sprouty-4 expression and stimulated the JNK pathway, but not β-catenin/T cell factor activity. In addition, transfection of gain-of-function JNK strongly inhibited anchorage-independent growth. Thus, this study demonstrates that Wnt-7a and Fzd-9 signaling through activation of the JNK pathway induces cadherin proteins and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sprouty-4 and represents a novel tumor suppressor pathway in lung cancer that is required for maintenance of epithelial differentiation and inhibition of transformed cell growth in a subset of human NSCLCs.

Deregulation of developmental signaling pathways is a common theme in human cancers. In this regard, the Wnt family encodes 19 distinct proteins that serve as extracellular signaling molecules controlling diverse morphogenetic and developmental programs (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling proceeds in an autocrine and paracrine fashion and is mediated by a family of 10 distinct seven-membrane receptors known as Frizzled (Fzd) 1The abbreviations used are: Fzd, Frizzled; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF, T cell factor; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; STBE, short-term bronchial epithelial; HA, hemagglutinin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MKK7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-7. 1The abbreviations used are: Fzd, Frizzled; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF, T cell factor; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; STBE, short-term bronchial epithelial; HA, hemagglutinin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MKK7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-7.

A well defined cell signaling pathway has been established whereby Wnt binding to Fzd ultimately results in the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β present in a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β, targeting it for ubiquitylation and 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation. Suppression of glycogen synthase kinase-3β following Wnt/Fzd binding allows β-catenin to accumulate and function in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator with the T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors (3Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar).The oncogenic potential of the wnt genes was first appreciated upon the identification of the murine wnt-1 gene as the site of mouse mammary tumor virus integration, leading to deregulated Wnt-1 expression and mammary tumorigenesis (4Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1982; 31: 99-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). In human colon cancers, Wnt pathway components, including APC and β-catenin, are frequently mutated, leading to tumorigenesis. At least 85% of human familial colorectal cancers have loss-of-function mutations in APC or gain-of-function mutations in β-catenin (5Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). By contrast, mutations in APC or β-catenin are rare in human breast carcinomas (6Howe L.R. Brown A.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, if stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin are used as indicators, then the Wnt pathway is likely to be activated in a majority of breast cancers as well (6Howe L.R. Brown A.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The Wnt pathway has also been implicated in many other tumor types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, uterine carcinoma, and melanoma (7de la Coste A. Romagnolo B. Billuart P. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Soubrane O. Fabre M. Chelly J. Beldjord C. Kahn A. Perret C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 8Fukuchi T. Sakamoto M.

Thus, increased activity of the Wnt signaling pathway appears to be a major oncogenic input in diverse human cancers.Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells exhibit frequent loss of function in several defined tumor suppressor genes, including p53 (∼50%), Rb (retinoblastoma protein; 15-30%), and p16INK4 (30-70%) (10Sekido Y. Fong K.M. Minna J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F21-F59PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, variable deletion of putative and ill defined tumor suppressor genes residing on chromosome 3p occurs frequently in NSCLC cells (10Sekido Y. Fong K.M. Minna J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F21-F59PubMed Google Scholar). Although evidence indicates that the Wnt pathway is central to development of the lung (11Ten Have-Opbroek A.A. Exp.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), the role of the Wnt pathway in lung carcinogenesis is ill defined. Similar to breast cancer, mutations in APC and β-catenin are rare in lung cancers (15Wada M. Miller C.W. Yokota J. Lee E. Mizoguchi H. Koeffler H.P. J. Mol.

In this study, we demonstrate that re-expression of Wnt-7a and signaling through Fzd-9 are associated with increased differentiation and additionally represent a novel tumor suppressor pathway in NSCLC cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Retrovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—NSCLC cells of the adenocarcinoma (A549, H2122), large cell (H1334, H460, H661), and squamous (H226, H157) phenotypes as well as a mesothelioma (H28) cell line were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Normal human short-term bronchial epithelial (STBE) cultures were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) and cultured according to the manufacturer's protocol.wnt-3 and wnt-7a cDNAs inserted into pcDNA3 encoding a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were kindly provided by Dr. Jan Kitajewski (Columbia University). The wnt cDNAs were excised from pcDNA3 with HindIII and NotI and ligated between the HindIII and NotI sites of the retroviral expression vector pLNCX2 (Clontech). A murine fzd-9 cDNA was excised from pCS2+ with HindIII and NotI and ligated between the HindIII and NotI sites of the retroviral expression vector pLPCX (Clontech). The resulting vectors, LNCX2-HA-Wnt and LPCX-mFzd-9, were packaged into replication-defective retrovirus using 293T cells and the retrovirus component expression plasmids SV-Ψ--A-MLV and SV-Ψ--env--MLV as described (17Landau N.R.

The secreted retroviruses were collected and incubated with NSCLC cell lines H157, A549, and H2122, and the transduced cells were selected in growth medium containing G418 (250 μg/ml) for LNCX2 vectors or puromycin (1 μg/ml) for LPCX vectors. NSCLC cells expressing both HA-Wnt and Fzd-9 were first transduced with LNCX2-HA-Wnt, and subclones expressing the HA-tagged Wnt proteins were subsequently transduced with LPCX-Fzd-9. The cells were maintained in medium containing G418 and puromycin.For the measurement of transfected cell growth on plastic dishes, 50,000 cells of the different transfectants were seeded per well of a 24-well culture plate in complete growth medium. On subsequent days as indicated, the cells were trypsinized from the wells with 100 μl of trypsin, diluted with 400 μl of growth medium, and counted using a hemocytometer. For measurement of anchorage-independent cell growth, 2500 cells were plated in triplicate in 35-mm wells of a 6-well plate in a volume of 1.5 ml of growth medium containing 0.3% Nobel agar onto a base of 1.5 ml of growth medium containing 0.5% agar. The plates were incubated in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 21 days, and the colonies were counted using a microscope. The data are presented as cloning efficiency calculated by dividing the mean number of colonies per well by the number of cells (2500) plated.Semiquantitative and Quantitative PCRs—RNA was extracted from cultured cells with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen Inc.). Total RNA that had been extracted from primary lung tumors as well as uninvolved lung was provided by the Specialized Program of Research Excellence Lung Cancer Tissue Procurement Core of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Aliquots of the RNA (10 μg) were converted to cDNA with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's specifications. Primer sets for semiquantitative and quantitative PCRs are shown in Table I. Semiquantitative PCR was carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR System 9600 with an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 20 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. Each reaction contained 1 μl of cDNA template, 5 pmol each of forward and reverse primers, 0.75 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 200 μm each dNTP, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.

Initial real-time PCR amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels to verify that the primer pairs amplified a single product of the predicted size. β-Actin mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR in the samples as a control gene. The real-time PCR data were analyzed with the Smart Cycler® software (Version 1.2d) to calculate the threshold cycle values for the different samples and are presented as mRNA levels in arbitrary units.Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Aliquots of lung cancer cells (2 million cells in 100 μl) were electroporated at 220 V and 250 microfarads with a GeneZAPPER (IBI, New Haven, CT) in Gene Pulser 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Cells were transfected with 2 μg of TOPflash and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal for determination of transfection efficiency and with other expression plasmids as indicated in the figure legends. For analysis of c-Jun activity in cells, cells were similarly transfected with 100 ng of plasmid c-Jun-Gal4, 2 μg of 5xUAS-TK-Luc, and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal. Following electroporation, cells were plated in 10-cm dishes in complete medium. After 3 days of incubation, the cells were collected, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 250 μl of luciferase reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The cell lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and aliquots (80 μl) of the supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and luciferase assay substrate (Promega). Aliquots (15 μl) of the extracts were also assayed for β-galactosidase to correct for transfection efficiency. The data are presented as relative light units/milliunit of β-galactosidase.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoblotting of HA-Wnt, cell extracts were prepared in MAPK lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin) as described previously (20Winn R.A. Bremnes R.M. Bemis L. Franklin W.A. Miller Y.E. Cool C. Heasley L.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7497-7506Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis of Fzd-9, the cells were suspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and forced three times through a 26-gauge syringe needle to lyse the cells, and the homogenate was submitted to centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect the membrane fragments, which were then resuspended in 100 μl of MAPK lysis buffer. Aliquots of the different extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 140 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with the same blocking solution containing the indicated antibodies at 1 μg/ml for 12-16 h. The HA epitope was detected with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science), and Fzd-9 was detected with a previously described rabbit polyclonal antibody (60van Raay T.J. Wang Y.K. Stark M.R. Rasmussen J.T. Francke U. Vetter M.L. Rao M.S. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The filters were extensively washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and bound antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies and LumiPhos reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions.For co-immunoprecipitation of Fzd-9 and Wnt-7a, H157 transfectants were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and cell-free extracts were prepared following microcentrifugation. The protein complexes in 200 μg of extract were immunoprecipitated (16 h, 4 °C) using rabbit anti-Fzd-9 antibody or normal rabbit serum and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for HA-tagged Wnt-7a using anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5.Three-dimensional Cell Culture, Immunofluorescence Analysis, and Image Acquisition—Cells were grown in three-dimensional basement membrane cultures according to Debnath et al. (21Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was combined in a 1:1 ratio with complete serum medium (RPMI 1640 medium + 10% fetal bovine serum). 90 μl was added to each well of an 8-well glass slide chamber and allowed to solidify for 2 h in a 37 °C incubator. Cells were trypsinized, counted, and diluted to 25,000 cells/ml. A 10% Matrigel solution was prepared in complete serum medium. The cell suspension was combined in a 1:1 ratio with the 10% Matrigel solution, and 200 μl of this mixture was added to each well for a final concentration of 5000 cells/well in 5% Matrigel. Cells were consequently fed complete serum medium containing 5% Matrigel every 3 days for a defined term of culture. After 8 days of incubation, the cultures were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilization was performed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by rinsing several times with phosphate-buffered saline/glycine. The primary and secondary blocks were performed according to Debnath et al. (21Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against rabbit laminin V (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and mouse phospho-ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) were both used at 1:100 dilution and were incubated overnight (15-18 h) at room temperature. Alexa-conjugated rabbit and mouse secondary antibodies were both added at 1:500 dilution and incubated for 50 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed several times and mounted with ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min. Confocal analyses were performed using LSM410 confocal microscopy systems (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Composite images were generated using MetaMorph software (Version 4.6r6).JNK Assay—Cells were lysed in MAPK lysis buffer. Following microcentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, aliquots of the extracts containing 200 μg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with GST-c-Jun-(1-79) immobilized on glutathione-agarose (10 μl of packed beads/sample containing ∼5-10 μg of protein). The GST-c-Jun-(1-79)-agarose complexes were washed three times by repetitive centrifugation in MAPK lysis buffer and then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (25,000 cpm/pmol). The reactions were terminated with 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE. The GST-c-Jun-(1-79) polypeptides were identified on Coomassie Blue-stained gels, excised, and counted in a scintillation counter.RESULTSWnt-7a mRNA Expression Is Reduced in NSCLC Cells and Primary Tumors and Re-expression Inhibits Proliferation in a Subset of Cell Lines—The Wnt proteins leading to β-catenin accumulation through stimulation of the Fzd receptors are widely invoked as an oncogenic signaling pathway in diverse tumors (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence indicates that specific Wnt proteins may function as tumor suppressors in certain instances where loss of Wnt expression is observed in cancer cells (22Li S. Chiang T.C. Davis G.R. Williams R.M. Wilson V.P. McLachlan J.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Liang H. Chen Q. Coles A.H. Anderson S.J. Pihan G.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, a recent study demonstrated a frequent loss of Wnt-7a mRNA expression in lung cancer cell lines and primary lung tumors (25Calvo R. West J. Franklin W. Erickson P. Bemis L. Li E. Helfrich B. Bunn P. Roche J. Brambilla E. Rosell R. Gemmill R.M. Drabkin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12776-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), indicating that Wnt-7a may represent a novel tumor suppressor in lung cancer. Our quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR experiments revealed that Wnt-7a mRNA levels were undetectable in six of the eight NSCLC cell lines compared with the four normal human STBE cells. Two of the eight cell lines (H1334 and H2122) had detectable, but markedly lower expression (Fig. 1A, left panel). Importantly, Wnt-7a mRNA expression was significantly lower in the 13 primary NSCLC tumors relative to the 13 matched uninvolved lung tissues as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A, right panel). By contrast, Wnt-3, Wnt-4, Wnt-5a, and Wnt-10b mRNAs were present at approximately equal levels in STBE cells relative to the panel of NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1B) and Wnt-1, Wnt-2, Wnt-5b, Wnt-6, and Wnt-8b mRNAs were not reproducibly detected in either the STBE or NSCLC cells (data not shown). Thus, our results demonstrate decreased expression of Wnt-7a mRNA in lung cancer cell lines and primary tumor samples relative to STBE cells and uninvolved lung tissue, consistent with a previous study (25Calvo R. West J. Franklin W. Erickson P. Bemis L. Li E. Helfrich B. Bunn P. Roche J. Brambilla E. Rosell R. Gemmill R.M. Drabkin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12776-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and indicate that loss of Wnt-7a expression is a frequent molecular event that accompanies oncogenesis in the lung.If loss of Wnt-7a expression in NSCLC cells contributes to lung cancer progression, then re-expression of Wnt-7a is predicted to negatively influence the growth of NSCLC cells lacking Wnt-7a. To this end, a retroviral vector encoding HA-tagged Wnt-7a was constructed and packaged into retrovirus (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a control, retroviruses encoding the empty LNCX vector or HA-Wnt-3, a Wnt protein ubiquitously expressed in NSCLC cell lines and STBE cells (Fig. 1), were generated. NSCLC cell lines H157, A549, and H661 were transduced with the packaged retroviruses, and stable transfectants were selected for resistance to G418. Fig. 2 shows an anti-HA immunoblot of cell extracts prepared from A549 and H157 transfectants transduced with the indicated retroviruses. Whereas transfected HA-Wnt-3 was readily detected in both A549 and H157 cells, transfected HA-Wnt-7a was observed only in transduced H157 cells, with only trace levels of HA-Wnt-7a detected in multiple independent A549 transfectants. Moreover, retroviral infection of H661 cells with the HA-Wnt-7a retrovirus failed to generate any G418-resistant H661 cells in multiple retroviral infections. This result suggests that Wnt-7a expression exerts a strong negative influence on growth of A549 and H661 cells, but not H157 cells.Fig. 2Immunoblot analysis of transfected HA-Wnt and Fzd-9 in NSCLC cell lines. A, extracts were prepared from the indicated HA-Wnt-transfected H157 and A549 clones with MAPK lysis buffer. Aliquots containing 100 μg of protein were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. A nonspecific (ns) endogenous cellular protein recognized by the antibody is indicated. B, membrane fractions were isolated from the indicated transfectants as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and aliquots containing 75 μg of protein were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit anti-Fzd-9 polyclonal antibody. C, extracts were prepared from the indicated H157 transfectants with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots containing 100 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-Fzd-9 antibody to verify expression of Fzd-9 protein (left panel). In addition, aliquots of the extracts containing 200 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated (IP) with protein G-Sepharose and mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 to collect HA-Wnt-7a (middle panel) or rabbit anti-Fzd-9 antibody or normal rabbit serum (NRS) (left panel) as indicated. Following SDS-PAGE, the filters were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The mouse anti-HA immunoprecipitate was blotted with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to avoid detection of the mouse IgG heavy chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The influence of Wnt-7a expression on cell proliferation measured on standard tissue culture plastic in complete medium was tested. The findings revealed that expression of Wnt-7a significantly reduced the growth rate of A549 cells compared with cells transduced with the empty vector (Fig. 3A) despite the fact that the HA-tagged Wnt-7a protein was only weakly expressed (Fig. 2A). By contrast, the growth rate of H157 cells expressing substantially higher levels of HA-Wnt-7a protein was not different from that of the LNCX controls (Fig. 3B). In preliminary studies, expression of Wnt-7a also failed to influence the growth rate of H2122 cells (data not shown). Importantly, expression of Wnt-3 did not significantly affect the growth of any of the cell lines tested (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that the growth inhibition observed in A549 cells with Wnt-7a was not simply a general effect of Wnt overexpression.Fig. 3Transfected Wnt-7a and Fzd-9 inhibit proliferation of NSCLC cells. The indicated NSCLC transfectants were seeded in growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum into 24-well plates, and cell number was measured daily as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fzd-9 Is Differentially Expressed in NSCLC Cell Lines and Mediates the Growth Inhibitory Ef"
https://openalex.org/W2009567773,"Rho family GTPases and STAT3 act as mediators of cytokine and growth factor signaling in a variety of cellular functions involved in inflammation, tumorigenesis, and development. In the course of searching for their functional connections, we found by using STAT3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 could cause nonspecific activation of STAT3 promoter-driven luciferase reporter in the absence of STAT3, raising concerns to a body of literature where STAT3 was associated with Rho GTPases based on the reporter system. We also found that although active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 could all mediate Ser-727 and Tyr-705 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, the Rho GTPases were able to induce STAT3 activation independently of the interleukin-6 autocrine pathway, and active RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 could not form a stable complex with STAT3 as previously suggested, indicating an unappreciated mechanism of STAT3 activation by the Rho GTPases. The RhoA-induced STAT3 activation partly depended on Rho-associated kinase (ROK) and involved multiple effector signals as revealed by the examination of effector domain mutants of RhoA. Genetic deletion of STAT3 led to a loss of response to RhoA in myosin light chain phosphorylation and actin stress fiber induction but sensitized the cells to RhoA or ROK-stimulated cell migration. STAT3 was required for the RhoA-induced NF-κB and cyclin D1 transcription and was involved in NF-κB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, loss of STAT3 expression inhibited RhoA-promoted cell proliferation and blocked RhoA or ROK induced anchorage-independent growth. These phenotypic changes in STAT3–/– cells could be rescued by reconstituting STAT3 gene. Our studies carried out in STAT3 null cells demonstrate unambiguously that STAT3 represents an essential effector pathway of Rho GTPases in regulating multiple cellular functions including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cell migration, gene activation, and proliferation.

Rho family GTPases act as intracellular molecular switches cycling between the active, GTP-bound state and the inactive, GDP-bound state in response to a large number of mitogenic or cytokine signals (1Hall A.

Upon activation, the Rho family members RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 each can turn on a distinct panel of effectors (4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

In particular, on route to stimulate cell growth, the Rho GTPases have been shown to promote G1- to S-phase cell cycle transition (6Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) in part through modulation of key cell cycle machineries, such as cyclin D1 and NF-κB, at the transcription level (7Perona R.

Moreover, in the regulation of cell morphology and motility, Rho GTPases have emerged as important signal transducers to control actin cytoskeleton structure, focal adhesion complex, cell polarity as well as cell-cell communication (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar, 5Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C.

Studies of the past decade have also shown that these Rho GTPases and their signaling components are intimately associated with human disease development; they have been suggested to serve as candidate targets for future pharmacological interventions (10Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 11Boettner B. Van Aelst L.

Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). Among seven mammalian STAT genes identified, STAT3 is ubiquitously expressed and appears to have important and unique functions since STAT3 gene targeting leads to early embryonic lethality (13Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Cell stimulation by cytokine and growth factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), platelet-derived growth factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor can activate STAT3 by tyrosine and serine residue phosphorylation to induce STAT3 dimerization, and the activated STAT3 translocates from cytosol to cell nucleus to mediate transcription of a number of STAT3-responsive genes. It is well established that STAT3 is involved in the control of essential cellular processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation, and growing evidence draws a correlation between abnormal STAT3 regulation and oncogenic transformation (14Bromberg J.F.

Constitutively active STAT3 occurs with a high incidence in a number of human tumor types (15Sartor C.I. Dziubinski M.L. Yu C.L. Jove R. Ethier S.P.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3282-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In one study it was reported that active Rac1 can directly interact with STAT3 in a yeast two-hybrid system and in co-expression/co-immunoprecipitation assays, leading to STAT3 activation (17Simon A.R. Vikis H.G. Stewart S. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Guan K.L. Science. 2000; 290: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In another work it was shown that Rac1 could indirectly activate STAT3 activity through autocrine induction of IL-6, which in turn caused STAT3 activation (18Faruqi T.R. Gomez D. Bustelo X.R. Bar-Sagi D. Reich N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9014-9019Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A third study suggested that constitutively active RhoA, but not Rac1, could stimulate STAT3 transcription activity in a transient expression system (19Aznar S. Valeron P.F. del Rincon S.V. Perez L.F. Perona R. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3282-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although these results raise interesting possibilities of potential signaling cross-talk and interdependence between the Rho GTPases-controlled signaling cascades and the STAT3-mediated transcriptional events, the controversial nature of the reported observations has stalled the Rho GTPase research field in incorporating STAT3 to the Rho GTPase-signaling paradigm.To clarify the functional relationship between Rho GTPases and STAT3, we have attempted to assess the involvement of STAT3 in Rho GTPase-regulated cell functions and pathways by using the STAT3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells in the present studies. We found unexpectedly that the widely used STAT3-luciferase reporter gene constructs could produce a strong reporter signal in the presence or absence of STAT3, raising concerns to a body of literature where STAT3 was associated with Rho GTPases based on the reporter system. In addition, we found that although active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 could all mediate Ser-727 and Tyr-705 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, the Rho GTPases were able to induce STAT3 activation independently of the IL-6 autocrine pathway, and active Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42 could not form a stable complex with STAT3 as previously suggested. We show that the RhoA-induced STAT3 activation involves multiple effector signals including ROK. Moreover, we demonstrate that STAT3 is required for the RhoA-induced NF-κB and cyclin D1 transcription, cell proliferation, and transformation as well as actin stress fiber formation and migration. These studies carried out in STAT3 null cells unambiguously establish that STAT3 represents an essential effector pathway of Rho GT-Pases in regulating multiple cellular functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs—The constitutively active mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (L63RhoA, V14RhoA, L61Rac1, V12Rac1, L61Cdc42, and V12Cdc42) and the effector domain mutants of RhoA in the constitutively active backbone (L63RhoA-F39V, L63RhoA-E40T, L63RhoA-E40L, and L63RhoA-Y42C) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis based on oligonucleotide-mediated PCR as described (20Li R.

The STAT3 floxed/floxed (wild type) MEFs were derived from 14-day-old STAT3 floxed/floxed mouse embryos and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and immortalized according to Todaro and Green (25Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). To generate the STAT3 knock-out MEFs, the STAT3 floxed/floxed MEFs were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the Cre recombinase (26Anton M. Graham F.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4600-4606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual clones were isolated from the infected pool by limited dilution and were genotyped by PCR (27Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To generate the STAT3-reconstituted STAT3–/– cells, the STAT3–/– MEFs were stably transfected with pZeo-STAT3 and selected with zeocin (400 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Individual clones were characterized for comparable STAT3 expression to wild type MEFs and were cultured in DMEM with 10% calf serum, 4.5 mg/ml d-glucose, 4.5 mg/ml l-glutamine, and 10 μg of gentamicin/ml.Recombinant retroviruses were produced using the Phoenix cell packaging system by transient expression of relevant cDNAs in the MIEG3 retroviral vector containing bicistronically expressed EGFP (22Guo F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1426-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The MEF cells were infected with the respective retroviruses and harvested 48–72 h post-infection. The EGFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Luciferase Reporter Assay—Two luciferase reporter constructs for STAT3 used in the studies were as described before (APRE-Luc (28Takeda T.

The NF-κB reporter construct was obtained from Stratagene, whereas the cyclin D1 reporter construct was described previously (8Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25245-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22Guo F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1426-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To probe STAT3, NF-κB, or cyclin D1 gene induction, the luciferase reporter constructs fused with the promoter sequences of the respective genes were transiently co-expressed with the respective small GTPases and cDNA encoding β-galactosidase. Transient transfection of these reporter plasmids was carried out by using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Twenty-four hours before harvesting, the cells were switched to a medium containing 0.5% serum. Analysis of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of the transfected cells was performed by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were routinely corrected by obtaining the ratio of the luciferase and the β-galactosidase activities observed in the same sample as previously described (31Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on cover glasses were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline once followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The cells were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. For actin staining, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. For STAT3 or NF-κB staining, the cells were labeled with anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) followed by incubation with a TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody or with anti-p65 NF-κB monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by a TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI for 10 min. The stained cells were mounted onto slides in Aqua-mount and viewed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscopy or a Leica fluorescence microscopy equipped with deconvolution software (Improvision, Inc.).Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared by extraction of the cells with a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min. The nuclear proteins were purified by the method described before (8Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25245-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in a hypotonic buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl) and lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 10 μg of aprotinin/ml for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was washed with hypotonic buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, resuspended in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 25% glycerol, vortexed, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were taken as the nuclear protein lysates. Protein contents in the whole-cell lysates and nuclear lysates were normalized by the Bradford method. The lysates were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ectopic expression of the constitutively active forms of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 were probed by using an anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science). Phosphotyrosine 705 and phosphoserine 727 of STAT3 and total STAT3 from the cell extracts were probed by using the anti-phospho-Tyr-705, anti-phospho-Ser-727 and anti-STAT3 antibodies, respectively (Cell Signaling).Wound Healing and Transwell Migration Assays—For wound healing assays cells were plated at 2 × 106/dish density in 60-mm diameter dishes. A plastic pipette tip was drawn across the center of the plate to produce an ∼1-mm-wide wound area after the cells have reached confluency. After 12 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% calf serum (CS), cell movement into the wound area was examined under a phase contrast microscope. The distances between the leading edge of the migrating cells and the edge of the wound were measured (21Guo F. Gao Y. Wang L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Cell migration was also assayed by using a Transwell plate inserted with a 6.5-mm polycarbonate membrane (8.0-μm pore size; Costar Inc.) (21Guo F. Gao Y. Wang L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of culture medium and were added to the upper chamber. 10% fetal calf serum in DMEM was used as chemoattractant in the lower chamber. The cells were incubated for 16 h in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells that traversed the 8.0-μm membrane pores and spread to the lower surface of the membrane were stained with 5% Giemsa solution and were counted in six different fields. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, and error bars represent the mean S.E.Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell growth was measured by tracing [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were cultured in a medium containing 2% CS for the assays. The cell cultures were assayed at 0, 1, 2, and 3 days by the addition of 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/ml to the medium followed by an incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. The radioisotope chased cells were harvested by trypsinization, and [3H]thymidine incorporated into the cells was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Cell Transformation Assay—To determine the transforming potential of the STAT3 deficient or wild type (WT) cells transduced with active RhoA mutant, ROK, or EGFP, 10,000 cells were suspended in 10% CS supplemented DMEM containing 0.3% agarose and were plated on top of a solidified medium containing 0.6% agarose. The cells were fed weekly by the addition of 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% CS. Three weeks after plating the colony numbers were scored, and the foci morphologies were recorded under a phase microscope (22Guo F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1426-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).RESULTSActive RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 All Can Mediate STAT3 Activation in MEFs—Previously by using a STAT3-responsive luciferase reporter system, it has been shown that constitutively active Rac1 mutant was capable of activating STAT3 transcriptional activity in Cos-1 and Rat-1 cells (17Simon A.R. Vikis H.G. Stewart S. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Guan K.L. Science. 2000; 290: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Faruqi T.R. Gomez D. Bustelo X.R. Bar-Sagi D. Reich N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9014-9019Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in transient transfection experiments carried out in HEK 293T cells, constitutively active RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, was shown to activate a STAT3-responsive reporter (19Aznar S. Valeron P.F. del Rincon S.V. Perez L.F. Perona R. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3282-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To clarify whether and which Rho GTPases could mediate STAT3 activation, we have utilized STAT3 knock-out MEF cells (KO) that have been genetically deleted of the STAT3 gene product (Fig. 1A) in the present studies to determine the functional relationship between the active Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, and STAT3. Unexpectedly, upon co-transfection of a STAT3-responsive luciferase reporter construct (APRE-Luc; Refs. 28Takeda T. Kurachi H.T. Yamamoto Y. Nishio Y. Nakatsuji K-I. Morishige A. Miyake Murata Y. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 159: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Sivko G.S. Sanford D.C. Dearth L.D. Tang D. Dewille J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Kamakura S. Oishi K. Yoshimatsu T. Nakafuku M. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) with the constitutively active mutant of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 (V14RhoA, V12Rac1, or V12Cdc42, respectively), we observed a ∼2.5-fold induction of the STAT3 reporter activity by V14RhoA or V12Rac1 and a ∼3-fold induction by V12Cdc42 over the respective controls in the STAT3 knock-out cells, similar to that observed in the wild type (WT) cells (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of the wild type Rho GTPases did not further enhance the reporter activity (Fig. 1B). To verify whether the apparent lack of specificity of the reporter system was due to the particular reporter construct tested, we examined another STAT3 reporter system containing four copies of the STAT3 enhancer element that has been widely in use (pSTAT3-TA-Luc, BD Biosciences) and obtained similar results (data not shown). These data indicate that the STAT3-responsive reporter systems that have been believed to be specific to STAT3 activity could have nonspecific effects caused by other STAT3-related transcription factors, raising concerns to a body of literature where STAT3 was associated with Rho GTPase activities based on the use of such reporters.STAT3 in quiescent cells resides in the cytoplasm in a latent state. Upon activation it translocates to the nucleus after phosphorylation-dependent dimerization (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 13Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). To circumvent the potential problems caused by using the nonspecific STAT3 transcription reporter systems, as alternative approaches we have adopted immunofluorescence and anti-phospho-STAT3 Western blotting to track STAT3 activation state by its intracellular localization and by its phosphotyrosine 705 (Try(P)-705) and phosphoserine 727 (Ser(P)-727) statuses, events that are known to be associated with STAT3 activation. We used recombinant retrovirus transduction to introduce various constitutively active Rho GTPases (L63RhoA, L61Rac1, or L61Cdc42) together with an EGFP marker or EGFP alone to wild type cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the serum-starved cells expressing the active RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 mutant, STAT3 was found to be co-localized with the nucleus as revealed by anti-STAT3 and DAPI staining, similar to that observed in the CS-stimulated cells, whereas in EGFP-expressing cells STAT3 appeared almost exclusively localized in the cytosol under serum-free conditions. A quantification of the nuclear translocation of STAT3 indicated that the RhoA-, Rac1-, or Cdc42-stimulated effect was comparable with that induced by serum (>85%, Fig. 2A, lower panel). Anti-Tyr(P)-705 or anti-Ser(P)-727 of STAT3 Western blotting revealed that in cells expressing constitutively active RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42, Tyr-705, and Ser-727 residues were phosphorylated similarly as by serum stimulation (Fig. 2B; data not shown). The expression of the HA-tagged RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 mutant was revealed by anti-HA Western blotting (data not shown). Immunofluorescent staining of the active RhoA-, Rac1-, or Cdc42-expressing cells by anti-Tyr(P)-705 or anti-Ser(P)-727 of STAT3 also showed that the Rho GTPases potently stimulated Tyr-705 and Ser-727 phosphorylation that accompanied STAT3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 2C). Both events of phosphorylation at Tyr-705 and Ser-727 were closely associated with the STAT3 nuclear localization pattern induced by the active Rho GTPase expressions (Fig. 2D; data not shown). Together these results demonstrate unambiguously that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 can all mediate STAT3 activation by means of Tyr-705 and Ser-727 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.Fig. 2RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 all can activate STAT3 in cells.A, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 can all stimulate STAT3 nuclear translocation. WT MEFs infected with retrovirus expressing EGFP together with L63RhoA, L61Rac1, or L61Cdc42, or EGFP alone were fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated for EGFP expression and were serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were then fixed and stained with anti-STAT3 antibody and TRITC-labeled secondary antibody as well as with DAPI. The percentage of cells displaying a STAT3 staining co-localized with"

We observed SAA binding to a surprisingly large number of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The binding was found to be high affinity and rapid. Importantly, this binding was not inhibited by high density lipoprotein with which SAA is normally complexed in serum. Binding was also observed when bacteria were offered serum containing SAA. Ligand blots following SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gels revealed two major ligands of 29 and 35 kDa that bound SAA when probing with radiolabeled SAA or SAA and monoclonal anti-SAA. Following fractionation the ligand was found in the outer membrane fraction of E. coli and was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to be outer membrane protein A (OmpA). OmpA-deficient E. coli did not bind SAA, and following purification of OmpA the protein retained binding activity. The ligands on other bacteria were likely to be homologues of OmpA because wild type, but not OprF-deficient, P. aeruginosa bound SAA.

During systemic inflammation the most notable change in protein synthesis involves hepatic synthesis of a set of proteins with roles in homeostasis or protection from the cause of the inflammation, most notably infection. Among these proteins the two that show the highest -fold increase are C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (SAA). 1The abbreviations used are: SAA, serum amyloid A; OmpA, outer membrane protein A; HDL, high density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Human SAA is a family of proteins that includes two acute phase forms (SAA1 and SAA2) as well as a constitutive form (SAA4) (1Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The acute phase forms have an approximate molecular mass of 12 kDa with no disulfide bonds and for which no structure has yet been elucidated and no clear function ascribed. SAA is found in mammals and other vertebrates such as marsupials and fish (1Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) but more anciently in the sea cucumber, an echinoderm, where it is expressed in the coelomic epithelium and shows induction in response to lipopolysaccharide (2Santiago-Cardona P.G. Berrios C.A. Ramirez F. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In mammals during inflammation SAA1 and 2 are synthesized largely by hepatocytes and can comprise more than 2% of total protein synthesis (3Morrow J.F. Stearman R.S. Peltzman C.G. Potter D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with the result that concentrations in plasma may increase from 1–5 μg/ml to approach 1 mg/ml (1Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). SAA of all isoforms associates with high density lipoprotein (HDL), in particular subfraction 3 (4Benditt E. Eriksen N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4025-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This interaction has lead to suggestions that the role of SAA may relate to one or more of the properties of HDL and lipid metabolism. It would in fact be surprising if responses were not seen when SAA becomes the major apolipoprotein, as is the case during severe inflammation. Indeed, a number of changes have been demonstrated (1Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), but studies have yet to demonstrate a convincing role. Alternative studies have examined direct effects of SAA on a number of immune cells. For instance, SAA has been reported to cause chemotaxis and activation of several cell types (5Su S.B. Gong W.

Blood. 2003; 101: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but HDL can inhibit these responses (5Su S.B. Gong W. Gao J.L. Shen W. Murphy P.M. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Exp.

SAA has also been reported to induce a number of other cellular responses, including collagenase production (8Brinckerhoff C.E. Mitchell T.I. Karmiolwicz M.J. Kluve-Beckerman B. Benson M.D. Science. 1989; 243: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and induction of secretory phospholipase A2 (9Pruzanski W. de Beer F.C. de Beer M.C. Stefanski E. Vadas P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously described binding properties include interaction with a number of cell types such as platelets and T cells (10Ureili-Shoval S. Shubinsky G. Linke R.P. Fridkin M. Tabi I. Matzner Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7172-7181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this report we have demonstrated that SAA binds to a range of Gram-negative bacteria and that this reactivity is not inhibited by HDL or serum. Ligand was bound when present in whole bacteria as well as in lysate preparations. Following fractionation of Escherichia coli the ligand was found in an outer membrane fraction and was shown by mass spectrometry to be outer membrane protein A. This is a protein found in almost all Gram-negative bacteria, which opens up the possibility that SAA may be a pattern recognition protein. Materials—SAA in this study was the isoform SAA1, prepared as described (14Raynes J.G. McAdam K.P.W.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with the modification that the first stage of purification on octyl-Sepharose 4B was performed in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. SAA was ∼98% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and comparable with recombinant human SAA (Peprotech). Recombinant human SAA is a chimeric protein comprising human SAA1 with 3 amino acid replacements/additions. SAA was dissolved in 4 m urea and dialyzed extensively against distilled water before addition to medium for experiments. SAA was radiolabeled with carrier-free 125I using the N-bromosuccinimde method (15Sinn H.J. Schrenk H.H. Friedrich E.A. Via D.P. Dresel H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 170: 186-192Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to specific activities between 70–120 kBq/μg. It was stored in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and used within 48 h. SAA was freshly dialyzed from 4 m urea into distilled water o/n before incorporation into experimental media in all studies. HDL and SAA-depleted plasma were obtained by affinity chromatography from human plasma using columns generated from activated CH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to affinity-purified goat polyclonal anti-SAA (provided by Prof. K. P. W. J. McAdam) or rabbit polyclonal anti-apoAI (Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) using protocols provided by the manufacturer. Bacteria—Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (18S, a lab strain, and 7/1, a clinical strain) were kindly provided by Dr. S. H. Gillespie (Department of Microbiology, Royal Free Hospital, London) and Dr. T. Pitt (Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, London), respectively. OmpA-deficient strain of E. coli was provided by Dr. R. Koebnik (Institute of Genetics, Martin-Luther-University, Halle, Germany) and OprF-deficient strain of P. aeruginosa was provided by Dr. H. E. Gilleland (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center). Other organisms were obtained from P. Donachie (Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Burkholderia cepacia, Vibrio cholerae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were cultured in brain heart infusion broth at 37 °C for 18 h until stationary phase. Bacteria were harvested or washed at 2000 × g for 10 min. S. pneumoniae was cultured on blood agar plates in an atmosphere containing 10% v/v CO2 at 37 °C. SAA Binding Assays—Live bacteria (108) were incubated with SAA at 0.01–5 μg/ml in PBS or plasma at various dilutions in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h followed by washing three times with PBS, followed by addition of 2 μg/ml mouse anti-human SAA (clone 513; Anogen, Mississauga, Canada) or isotype control for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times, and F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse (IgG) fluorescein isothiocyanate (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:50 was added for 1 h at 4 °C. Bacteria were washed three times and fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed by FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 events were analyzed using Cell Quest software. In the time course experiment, bacteria were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed extensively before the binding assay. Quantitation of radiolabeled SAA binding was performed by adding 170 μl of a 60:40 mixture of dibutyl phthalate:dinonyl phthalate (Fischer Scientific) to 0.4-ml polypropylene tubes together with 100 μlofan upper aqueous layer of PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. To this upper layer was added 2 × 108 bacteria and 125I-SAA at the concentration indicated. Following incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, or as stated, the bacteria were centrifuged through the oil layer (5 min, 12,000 × g) to a pellet for γ-counting. Aliquots of supernatant were counted to determine free SAA concentrations. SAA Ligand Blotting—SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide, 1:19 bisacrylamide) of bacterial lysates at 108 bacteria/lane boiled for the stated period in denaturing sample buffer containing 7% (w/v) SDS and 50 mm dithiothreitol was performed. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 5% (w/v) milk powder in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST). Radiolabeled SAA was added at 5 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature in PBST. The blots were then extensively washed for a minimum of 4 h with 5 changes in PBST. Bound radioactivity was detected on a STORM phosphoimager. Alternative procedures of detection used unlabeled SAA at 5 μg/ml in PBST followed by detection using 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-SAA clone 513 (Anogen) followed by 2 μg/ml F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) each stage for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing with PBST three times for 5 min each. Detection was by chemiluminescence using ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences) and Biomax film (Kodak). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The first-dimension gel was run using 7.5% acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and 8 m urea with 4% (v/v) ampholine, pH 5–7, and 1% (v/v) ampholine, pH 3–10. A vertical slab gel apparatus was used with cathode buffer 50 mm NaOH and anode buffer 25 mm orthophosphoric acid. Samples were prepared in 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, and 2% (v/v) ampholine, pH 5–8. Gels were run at 150 V for the first 30 min and then at 200 V for 2.5 h. Strips from each lane were treated with 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol before placing horizontally on a pre-set 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 2% (w/v) agarose in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, was used to seal the strip in place. The second-dimension gel was run for 100 V for 1 h and stained with Coomassie blue or probed for SAA ligand. Fractionation of E. coli and Ligand Identification—100 ml of E. coli grown to stationary phase was centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min, resuspended in 5 ml of PBS, freeze/thawed three times, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min. The pellet was sonicated and centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min. The pellet was then extracted with 8 m urea and 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. Ligand was absent from the soluble fraction but was solubilized when the pellet was re-extracted with 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 4% (w/v) CHAPS in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was used for separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and ligand blotting or protein staining. The major protein components in this fraction were ligands for SAA; thus, a single-dimensional gel was used before staining with sypro orange, tryptic digestion, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis. Peptides were analyzed using Mascot (Dr. Lamont, University of Dundee). OmpA Purification—OmpA was purified by sonication of E. coli BL21 in NaCl 0.15 m, 1 μg/ml E64, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA and centrifugation for 15 min at 36,000 × g. This provided a pellet that was re-extracted in the same buffer and then extracted with 8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 25 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40 in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Following centrifugation for 15 min at 30,000 × g the pellet was extracted with 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1 μg/ml E64, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by centrifugation at 36,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a mono-Q HR5/5 column with loading buffer 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Elution buffer was the same with 0.3 m NaCl introduced and thiourea excluded. Using centrifugation of bacteria through a phthalate oil layer, we demonstrated that 125I-labeled purified human SAA1 bound strongly to a variety of Gram-negative bacteria in suspension, including E. coli, S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. In contrast, little binding was seen to the Gram-positive organisms S. pneumoniae (serotype 3) or Staphylococcus aureus or to certain Gram-negative organisms such as B. cepacia (Fig. 1a). Other Gram-negative bacteria also bound, such as Serratia marcescens and V. cholerae. The unencapsulated form of S. pneumoniae R36A also failed to bind. When radiolabeled SAA was added to the bacteria and bound radiolabel separated from free by washing the bacteria, the recovered radiolabel had a molecular mass of 12 kDa. A recombinant version of human SAA (similar to SAA1) containing 3 amino acid substitutions also bound to the same range of bacteria using the same methodology (data not shown). Binding was rapid and reached equilibrium within 15 min (Fig. 1b). When nonspecific binding (obtained by addition of 20-fold excess unlabeled SAA) was subtracted from the specific binding, saturation of binding was approached at the highest concentrations of SAA added (Fig. 1c). Scatchard analysis indicated a dissociation constant of ∼1 × 10–7 m for P. aeruginosa. FACS analysis for SAA binding using monoclonal anti-human SAA (Fig. 2a) confirmed these results and showed unlabeled SAA also bound to bacteria. Using this approach and various concentrations of SAA to examine binding to P. aeruginosa, maximal binding was observed at ∼1 μg/ml (Fig. 2b). Calculations of Kd from these data using double reciprocal plots revealed a value of ∼5 × 10–8 m, similar to that observed using radiolabeled SAA. Affinity of SAA binding varied according to the bacteria, with E. coli and V. cholerae having apparently higher affinity than some other bacteria such as P. aeruginosa. Thus the concentration of SAA required for half maximal binding was within physiologically normal levels of SAA and did not require acute phase levels.Fig. 2SAA binds to Gram-negative bacteria. a, binding of SAA to various bacteria was determined by FACS. Bacteria were incubated with (open histogram) or without 1 μg/ml SAA (filled histogram). Binding was demonstrated using anti-SAA and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG. 20,000 events were captured by FACS. b, binding of SAA at various concentrations to P. aeruginosa 18S was determined as above and expressed as mean fluorescence intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because SAA circulates in HDL, HDL was purified by affinity chromatography using antibody to apolipoprotein-A1 and was introduced into radiolabeled SAA binding assays using the phthalate oil technique such that SAA would represent ∼15% of total protein, typical of a strong acute phase response. The presence of HDL did not significantly decrease the binding of SAA to P. aeruginosa (Fig. 3). If HDL were purified by ultracentrifugation then this also failed to cause significant inhibition of the binding of SAA to the same organisms despite the presence of low levels of SAA in the normal plasma from which the HDL was generated (data not shown). Following this, we demonstrated that SAA in plasma binds to bacteria using FACS. The amount of SAA binding from acute phase sera, which originally contained 100 μg/ml SAA and was diluted in PBS 10-fold so that it contained 10 μg/ml SAA (Fig. 4b), was greater than seen with normal sera diluted in the same way so that it contained 0.5 μg/ml SAA (Fig. 4a). This was consistent with dose responses obtained with purified SAA. When the SAA was depleted from these sera by passage through an anti-SAA column, the SAA-depleted plasma showed reduced binding to P. aeruginosa compared with both normal and acute phase plasma from which it was derived (Fig. 4, a and b). Failure to completely remove SAA following passage through the affinity column (SAA was reduced to 65 or 15 ng/ml in depleted acute phase or normal serum, respectively, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) led to the residual SAA being sufficient to generate low levels of binding. Again this was consistent with the dose response for purified SAA (Fig. 2b). Similar results were obtained using another strain of the same organism.Fig. 4SAA in plasma binds to bacteria. a, SAA in normal plasma binds to P. aeruginosa. Depletion of SAA from plasma reduces SAA binding to bacteria. P. aeruginosa 18S was incubated without plasma (open dotted histogram), normal plasma containing SAA at 0.5 μg/ml (open histogram), or SAA-depleted normal plasma (15 ng/ml SAA; shaded histogram). b, SAA in acute phase plasma binds to P. aeruginosa. Depletion of SAA from acute phase plasma reduces SAA binding to bacteria. P. aeruginosa 18S was incubated without plasma (open dotted histogram), with acute phase plasma containing SAA at 10 μg/ml (open histogram), or with SAA-depleted acute phase plasma (63 ng/ml SAA; shaded histogram).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then sought to identify the bacterial ligand responsible for SAA binding. Ligand blotting of whole bacterial lysates following SDS-PAGE with 125I-SAA revealed bands at ∼29 and 35 kDa for P. aeruginosa but not S. pneumoniae (Fig. 5a). Bands of similar molecular mass were observed for various other Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli. The same specificity was observed if unlabeled SAA and monoclonal anti-SAA were used to determine binding to ligands (data not shown). E. coli was fractionated by sonication, followed by freeze/thawing, centrifugation, and extraction with urea/thiourea buffer. The various fractions of bacteria were examined by ligand blotting, and ligand was identified mainly in the outer membrane fraction. The ligand was obtained in a relatively pure form when 8 m urea extracts were centrifuged and the pellet was re-extracted with 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% CHAPS. Blotting following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of this purified fraction of outer membrane revealed that ligands of 29 and 35 kDa had a pI of ∼4.5–5.5 (Fig. 5b), whereas no spots were observed in the absence of SAA. Because this fraction contained major bands at 29 and 35 kDa by protein staining, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis of these ligands from one-dimensional gels revealed the ligand identity as the surface protein OmpA since this was the only identified ligand at 35 kDa and was also present in the 29-kDa ligand. This identification explained the presence of two bands because this protein has a very stable ordered barrel structure that runs at 29 kDa if not boiled or boiled with SDS-sample buffer for short periods, but when denatured it runs at 35 kDa if boiled for a minimum of 5 min as previously reported (7He R. Sang H. Ye R.D. Blood. 2003; 101: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To confirm this, SAA binding was only observed to the 35-kDa form when samples were extensively denatured or to 29 kDa if the lysate were not boiled. As further demonstration that OmpA was indeed the ligand, OmpA-deficient E. coli failed to bind SAA in comparison with wild type bacteria when examined by ligand blotting (Fig. 6a), which only shows the high molecular form due to prolonged boiling treatment. Further, when examined by FACS the OmpA-deficient bacteria failed to bind, indicating that this protein appears to be the major binding site on these bacteria (Fig. 6b). Finally, we used the observation that the fraction obtained using urea and thiourea contained mainly OmpA to obtain pure OmpA after anion exchange chromatography of this fraction. The purified protein bound SAA by ligand blotting (Fig. 7).Fig. 6OmpA-deficient E. coli does not bind SAA. a, wild type, but not OmpA-deficient, E. coli shows 29-kDa ligand for 125I-SAA (5 μg/ml) by blotting of SDS-PAGE of unboiled lysates. b, FACS analysis reveals SAA binding to wild type, but not OmpA-deficient, E. coli. SAA (1 μg/ml) (filled histogram) compared with the absence of SAA (gray line). Binding was demonstrated using monoclonal anti-SAA followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG and 20,000 recorded events.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7OmpA purified from E. coli binds SAA. OmpA was purified to homogeneity by fractionation and anion exchange chromatography. 10% SDS-PAGE of OmpA shows a single band by Coomassie blue staining that bound SAA as shown by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-SAA and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We were interested to know whether this protein ligand was also responsible for binding to other bacteria. OmpA is expressed in S. typhimurium, V. cholerae, and K. pneumoniae, which is likely to account for the binding of SAA seen with these bacteria. Many other Gram-negative bacteria have homologues of this protein (16Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar, 17Beher M.G. Schnaitman C.A. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 906-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In P. aeruginosa the homologue is OprF, and we thus investigated the OprF-deficient mutant and wild type for SAA binding using FACS analysis (Fig. 8). The failure of the OprF-deficient bacteria to bind suggested that this was indeed the major ligand on P. aeruginosa. The OmpA/OprF family are conserved proteins among the Enterobacteriaceae; related members are found in almost all Gram-negative bacteria (16Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar, 17Beher M.G. Schnaitman C.A. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 906-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). They are involved in the maintenance of structural membrane integrity and likely porin activity. The OmpA/OprF molecule consists of a periplasmic C-terminal region that is involved in peptidoglycan binding and anchoring of the outer membrane and an N-terminal domain arranged as a 170-amino acid 8-transmembrane β-barrel (19Schweizer M. Hindennach I. Garten W. Henning U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region is highly conserved as is the transmembrane region of the N-terminal domain (20Pautsch A. Schulz G.E. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, the external loops are proposed to be highly mobile and extend beyond the outer membrane (21Koebnik R. Locher K.P. van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) and are highly variable within the Enterobacteriaceae (19Schweizer M. Hindennach I. Garten W. Henning U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, several studies have indicated that an alternative minority conformer of the protein exists as a 16-stranded transmembrane form with a pore size of ∼1 nm with regions of the conserved C-terminal domain presented externally (22Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Singh S.P. Williams Y.U. Miller S. Nikaido H. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3937-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Arora A. Abildgaard F. Bushweiler J.H. Tamm L.K. Nature Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Because OmpA has been reported to exist at up to 100,000 copies/bacterium it may well be that the SAA binds to the C-terminal region, which is only surface expressed in ∼2–3% of the total OmpA (22Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure to bind to B. cepacia may be related to the lack of an OmpA/OprF member or to a divergent sequence because a close homologue was not observed by sequence analysis of the bacterial genome. Studies should now be directed to determining which part of the ligand is responsible for binding. Although studies to examine SAA binding to bacteria have been restricted in the report to SAA1, the fact that recombinant SAA also bound suggests that it would be interesting to examine SAA2 for its ability to bind to bacteria. Human SAA2 only differs from SAA1 in a few amino acids (∼7, depending on isoform). The constitutive form SAA4 could have similar properties, although these proteins are less easy to work with because of greater hydrophobicity and reduced solubility. OmpA is involved in a number of bacterial functions in addition to linking peptidoglycan to the outer membrane. These include having porin activity, albeit inefficiently. Properties vary between bacteria (16Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). It is not clear what role OmpA plays in invasion and survival within cells; it may depend on the context, because OmpA-deficient bacteria have been reported to survive better in macrophages (25Sukurmaran S.K. Shimada H. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and it has been shown that neutrophil elastase can attack OmpA (26Belaaouaj A. Kim K.S. Shapiro S.D. Science. 2000; 289: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, OmpA has been shown to be required for interaction and for crossing the brain microvascular endothelial cell barrier (27Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4556-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Prasadaro N.V. Srivastava P.K. Rudrabhatla R.S. Kim K.S. Huang S. Sukumaran S.K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 71: 1680-1688Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and OmpA may reduce complement-mediated attack (29Prasadarao N.V. Blom A.M. Villoutreix B.O. Linsangan L.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 71: 6352-6360Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to determine whether this interaction has a role in innate immunity. It will be informative to investigate whether the binding of SAA to various bacteria will lead to increased or decreased responses because OmpA has been reported to activate macrophages, dendritic cells (30Jeannin P. Renno T. Goetsch L. Miconnet I. Aubry J.P. Delneste Y. Herbault N. Baussant T. Magistrelli G. Soulas C. Romero P. Cerottini J.C. Bonnefoy J.Y.

Immun. 2000; 71: 1680-1688Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, SAA could equally generate responses through receptors that have been reported for SAA. Currently four potential candidates for the SAA receptor have been suggested, including Tanis (32Walder K. Kantham L. McMillan J.S. Trevaskis J. Kerr L. de Silva A. Sunderland T. Godde N. Gao Y.

Gao J.L. Shen W. Murphy P.M. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (a chemotactic 7-transmembrane receptor). Most recently SR-B1 was found to be capable of interacting with SAA both as a free molecule and as a component of HDL (34Cai L. De Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Kurlander R. Chen Z. Kimelman M.L. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8031-8040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These do not represent the only potential ways in which SAA might link bacteria with host cells as binding is also reported to laminin and vitronectin (11Preciado-Patt L. Hershkoviz R. Fridkin M. Lider O. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1189-1195PubMed Google Scholar) and interactions with the integrin receptor αIIbβ3 on platelets have been reported (10Ureili-Shoval S. Shubinsky G. Linke R.P. Fridkin M. Tabi I. Matzner Y. Blood. 2002; 99: 1224-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is clear though that some of these interactions would be predicted to have innate immune consequences for innate immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. Previous studies showed that SAA synthesis in the normal non-inflamed state was largely epithelial (36Urieli-Shovel S. Cohen P. Eisenberg S. Matzner Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and that SAA was induced in mouse intestinal epithelium in response to normal mucosal enteric bacteria (37Ogawa H. Fukushima K. Sasaki I. Matsuno S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G492-G499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus SAA is produced in a site that needs protection against Gram-negative bacteria. The interaction of SAA with bacteria could have a direct effect on bacteria or bacterial adherence. But because SAA has been reported under some conditions to activate immune cells, the question of whether SAA opsonization of bacteria changes the responses of host immune cells becomes an important one. In particular, an obvious line of investigation will be to examine whether SAA opsonization has any ability to help in clearing bacteria by phagocytes, which is primarily important for an efficient response to combat bacterial infection. Thus we have shown that SAA binds strongly to a range of Gram-negative bacteria and that the ligand OmpA may well be a pathogen-associated molecular pattern because it is conserved across the Gram-negative bacteria. The important features of this reaction are that it occurs in the presence of HDL and has sufficiently high affinity to occur at normal concentrations of SAA."

Another group has found a similar gene family and designated it as NOD, christened after the founding member of the family (4Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev.

Linhoff M.W. Zhang J. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4088-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). MHCIITA, the founding member of the CATERPILLER gene family, has long been recognized as a transcriptional co-activator found in professional antigen-presenting cells required for the transcription of MHC class II surface glycoproteins and more recently plexin-A1 (7Harton J.A.

Without the surface expression MHC class II proteins, individuals succumb to a severe immunodeficiency termed the type II Bare Lymphocytes Disease. CATERPILLER 1.1, also named CIAS1, PYPAF1, and NALP3 has been linked genetically to the inflammatory disorders Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold urticaria (FCU), and neonatalonset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) (12Aksentijevich I.

Mutations in CIAS1 associated with these disorders cause an increase in the basal secreted levels of IL-1β, a major inflammatory cytokine (12Aksentijevich I. Nowak M. Mallah M. Chae J.J. Watford W.T.

Additionally, the protein product of CIAS1, cryopyrin, associates with an inflammasome complex consisting of ASC, Cardinal, and caspase-1, important for the conversion of pro-IL-1β to its secreted form (18Masumoto J.

Other functional investigations have shown that cryopyrin can affect the NF-κB pathway as either an inhibitor or an activator depending on the experimental circumstances (22Manji G.A. Wang L.

The meaning of these latter results is unclear without further mechanistic studies, but is nevertheless consistent with a role for cryopyrin in inflammation. Another CATERPILLER protein, Monarch-1 (PYPAF7), has also been identified in a similar role. Overexpression of PYPAF7 along with ASC in COS-7L cells results in significant IL-1β secretion and activation of NF-κB (25Wang L. Manji G.A. Grenier J.M. Al-Garawi A. Merriam S. Lora J.M. Geddes B.J.

Our group has also implicated Monarch-1 in the regulation of classical and non-classical MHC class I genes (26Williams K.L. Taxman D.J. Linhoff M.W. Reed W. Ting J.P. J.

Thus, multiple hypotheses have been put forth to explain how these proteins are intimately involved in the immune system and inflammatory diseases, including the intriguing possibility that NOD1 and NOD2 may serve as intracellular sensors (reviewed in Refs. 35Kobayashi K.S. Eynon E.E. Flavell R.A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Beutler B.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 652-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Because members of the same gene family often have similar but functionally distinct roles, we surmised that the predicted CLR16.2 (3Harton J.A. Linhoff M.W. Zhang J. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4088-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) also has an important role in the adaptive or innate immune system. Our current report on the cloning and characterization of CLR16.2 provides evidence for this supposition. After cloning the full-length transcript of CLR16.2, we find evidence that CLR16.2 may be predominantly expressed in cells of the immune system, particularly in T lymphocytes. CLR16.2 expression decreases luciferase assay values for NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1, major signal transduction pathways activated in innate and/or adaptive immunity, and decreases transcript levels of genes controlled by these transcription factors. This effect is observed in anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-stimulated T cells. Data mined from a microarray study indicates that CLR16.2 is strongly down-regulated in primary T cells following stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex and CD28. Thus, CLR16.2 is the first protein within this family to potentially affect TCR signaling. With these results in mind, we postulate that CLR16.2 has a specific role in the attenuating the activation of T cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—HeLa, HEK293, HEK293T, A549, K-562, MCF7, and B16-F10 cells were maintained in DMEM-H medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and grown in a humidified, 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Raji, Jurkat E6-1, THP-1, U-937, HL-60, SB, HSB-2, and KU812 cell lines were cultured in RMPI media containing 10% fetal calf serum under the same incubation conditions. To create Jurkat stable cell lines, cells were electroporated, as described below, with 30 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2 and selected with 2000 μg/ml G418. The resulting polyclonal cultures were used in experiments. Stable 293 cells expressing EGFP or EGFPCLR16.2 were created by transfection of cells with FuGENE 6 and treatment of cells with 500 μg/ml G418. PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats (American Red Cross) using lymphocyte separation medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals). For antibody stimulations, Jurkat E6.1 cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with protein G-purified anti-CD3 antibody (mouse monoclonal OKT3)(ATCC) at 2 μg/ml and anti-CD28 (mouse monoclonal CD28.2)(eBiosciences) at 5 μg/ml for 30 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at 10 μg/ml for 30 min, and plated in medium.Cloning of Human CLR16.2 and Identification of mCLR16.2—Raji total mRNA was isolated with TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen). To perform RACE procedures, the FirstChoice™ RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following oligonucleotide sequences: 5′-ACCGAGCAGATGAGTCGGTCG, 5′-GCACACAGCTTCTCGTGGGTG, and 5′-GTCAACACAGCCCTCACTGCTCTCTATCTCC. To amplify the CLR16.2 open reading frame (ORF), cDNA was generated with Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science), and PCR was performed with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The following sense and antisense primers were used to generate the cDNA and PCR product: 5′-TCACATTTCAACAGTGCACGTGGGAGCATTTGTCTTG, 5′-ACGGTACGGGCTCCCCAGCCGAGCAGGTGAAAGC. The full-length sequence of CLR16.2 was deposited into GenBank™ under the accession number AY601811. The pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2 construct was created by PCR amplification of the CLR16.2 ORF with a FLAG tag containing forward primer and cloned into pcDNA3.1(-) by standard methodology. The EGFPCLR16.2 fusion was created by cloning CLR16.2 into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). To predict mouse CLR16.2, human CLR16.2 was used to query NCBI, Ensembl mouse genome and UCSC data bases. Predicted mouse CLR16.2 was deposited in GenBank™ under the accession BK005605 and aligned to hCLR16.2 using ClustalX.Real-Time PCR and Reverse Transcription—Complementary DNA was generated from total RNA using random primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). CLR16.2 real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the following oligonucleotides: F, 5′-CTGGGAAGGGCAGTCAAG, R; 5′-TGCCTCTGTATCCTTGAGTC, probe 5′-CCCGCAGGCCCTGGATAGGACACC. IL-2 and CD25 real-time PCR were performed with QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) using the following primers: IL-2F, 5′-CCAAGAAGGCCACAGAACTGAAACATC; IL-2R, 5′-GGTTGCTGTCTCATCAGCATATTCACAC; CD25F, 5′-CCAGAGATCCCACACGCCACATTCAAAG; and CD25R, 5′-GCATTGACATTGGTTGTCCCAGGACGAG. Real-time PCR experiments were performed three times using an AB Prism 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems), and representative experiments were graphed. RNA levels of the gene of interest and 18 S rRNA were quantitated by comparing the experimental signal with a DNA plasmid-based standard curve. Values were normalized to 18 S rRNA levels. The following oligonucleotides were used for 18 S real time PCR: F, 5′-GCTGCTGGCACCAGACTT; R, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGG; probe, 5′-CAAATTACCCACTCCCGACCCG. For pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2-specific reverse transcriptase PCR, PCR was performed with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) on randomly primed cDNA samples using the following primers: F, 5′-TCAACACAGCCCTCACTGCTCTCTATCT; and R, 5′-AGCCACCCCAATGGCATTTCCTCTTAAG.Immunofluorescent Staining—HeLa cells were plated on two well chamber slides and transfected with 1.0 μg/well pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2 or pcDNA3 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Mouse M5 anti-FLAG (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) were used to stain for FLAGCLR16.2. Mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) was used to counterstain cell nuclei. Leptomycin B (LMB) was used as previously described (39Cressman D.E. O'Connor W.J. Greer S.F. Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3626-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Microarray Data—General expression data for hCLR16.2 and mCLR16.2 was obtained from Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) (symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas) using NOD3 as the keyword identifier (40Su A.I. Wiltshire T. Batalov S. Lapp H. Ching K.A. Block D. Zhang J. Soden R. Hayakawa M. Kreiman G. Cooke M.P. Walker J.R. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mCLR16.2 gene identified by GNF corresponds to the cDNA RIKEN gene D230007K08. The mouse data set analyzed by the gcRMA (open source; www.bioconductor.org) software package is presented. In the human study, 2-4 samples for each tissue were examined. All tissues were taken from different individuals. In the mouse study, two arrays were performed for each tissue. The samples applied to each array were pooled RNA from seven mice of the same genetic strain. The Stanford Microarray Data Base (SMD) is found at the website, genome-www.stanford.edu/microarray (42Gollub J. Ball C.A. Binkley G. Demeter J. Finkelstein D.B. Hebert J.M. Hernandez-Boussard T.

The unique clonal identifiers for the CLR16.2 sequence, IMAGE:713166 and IMAGE:712914, correspond to cDNA sequences contained within GenBank™. These sequences belong to the 3′-UTR of CLR16.2. The identifiers were used to query the microarray data produced by Diehn et al. (43Diehn M. Alizadeh A.A. Rando O.J. Liu C.L. Stankunas K. Botstein D. Crabtree G.R. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 2002; 99: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) were retrieved and graphed in a similar manner.Luciferase Assays—HEK293T cells were plated in 96-well plates and transfected with either 50 ng of AP-1 or NF-κB luciferase reporter construct and 100, 200, 300, or 400 ng of pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Additional amounts of pcDNA3 were transfected to keep the total amount of DNA transfected per well constant. The AP-1 reporter constructs were activated by treatment with PMA (5 ng/ml). The NF-κB reporter constructs were activated by treatment of the cells for 18 h with TNFα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (20 ng/ml) or by cotransfection of 75 ng of pCMV4T-p65. A p53-luciferase reporter and a p53 expression construct were used as a negative control (24O'Connor Jr., W. Harton J.A. Zhu X. Linhoff M.W. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6329-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 18-24-h post-transfection, and luciferase units were measured by standard methodology. Similar results were observed using EGFPCLR16.2.Jurkat luciferase assays were performed as follows: Cells in exponential growth were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in fresh, ice cold, phenol red-free RPMI media containing 2% fetal calf serum at 2 × 107 cells/ml. A total of 0.4 ml of cells were mixed with 3 μg of AP-1, NF-κB, or NFAT reporter constructs and 0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 μg of pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2. Total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant using additional amounts of pcDNA3. Cells were electroporated with the Genepulser II instrument (Bio-Rad) at 960 microfarad and 250 V in a 0.4 cm gap cuvette. Cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (Sigma) (10 ng/ml and 1 μm) or stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 6 h to activate the AP-1, NF-κB, or NFAT reporter constructs. The control data with p53- and DRα-luciferase constructs were generated in a similar manner, using p53 and CIITA cotransfection to activate the reporter constructs and using 30 μg of pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2 where applicable. Average results of at least three experiments are graphed.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—For immunoprecipitation of FLAGCLR16.2, Jurkat pcDNA3, or Jurkat pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2 stably transfected cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and mammalian protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma) for 10 min. Lysates were cleared and mixed with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with fresh lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-IκBα (sc-371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), M5 anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-β-actin (Abcam), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon) antibodies were used to stain membranes, and secondary stains were performed with either goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase or goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Supersignal Chemiluminescence Reagent (Pierce) was used for detection.IκBα Degradation Assay—For the IκBα degradation assay, HEK293T cells plated in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FLAGCLR16.2 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 18 h, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for the indicated amounts of time, and cells were lysed for 2 min in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer with 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The protein concentrations of cleared lysates were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by immunoblot as described above. The IκBα degradation assay performed with EGFPCLR16.2 was accomplished in a similar manner, with the exception that stably transfected 293 cells were used. Jurkat T cells were electroporated with 30 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FgCLR16.2, and stimulated after 12-18 h with PMA and ionomycin for the indicated amounts of time.RESULTSCloning and Description of the CLR16.2 Gene—We previously predicted the partial sequence of human CLR16.2 (3Harton J.A. Linhoff M.W. Zhang J. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4088-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Based on this prediction, primers were designed and used to amplify 98% of the CLR16.2 coding region (Fig. 1, A and B, ii). Additionally, 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE procedures were performed, and the resulting bands (Fig. 1, A and B, i and iii) sequenced to reveal the full-length mRNA sequence of the CLR16.2 gene (NCBI accession AY601811). The cloned ORF of CLR16.2 gene is similar to a predicted sequence within GenBank™, NOD3 (NCBI accession NM_178844), with the differences resulting in an extra 47 residues in the N terminus and a Q41H point mutation in the NOD3 protein. Another cDNA reported and cloned by the NEDO human cDNA sequencing project (www.nedo.go.jp/bio-e/index.html) (NCBI accession AK090431) is also similar to CLR16.2. The mRNA sequence of the NEDO clone contains two insertions, one in the 5′-UTR and the other within the ORF of CLR16.2, resulting in a frameshift at the nucleotide corresponding to residue 727 of CLR16.2 and the addition of 34 out-of-frame residues to the CLR16.2 protein (schematically represented in Fig. 1A, iv).Consistent with CATERPILLER proteins, CLR16.2 contains an NBD encoded by one large exon and 14 exons coding for LRRs (schematically represented in Fig. 1C). Where many of the CATERPILLER proteins contain an N-terminal pyrin domain, the N terminus of CLR16.2 does not adhere to any current domain definition. CLR16.2 was aligned with several other prominent CATERPILLER family members, CIITA, CIAS1, Monarch-1, NOD1/CARD4, and NOD2/CARD15, to demonstrate their homology (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the mouse CLR16.2 (mCLR16.2) gene was identified and deposited in GenBank™. A protein alignment between human CLR16.2 (hCLR16.2) and mCLR16.2 is shown (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2The homology of CLR16.2 protein to the CATERPILLER family members and mCLR16.2. A, protein alignment of the CLR16.2 and other well-known CATERPILLER family members, Monarch-1, CIAS1, NOD1/CARD4, NOD2/CARD15, and CIITA, demonstrates significant homology between these proteins.

In Escherichia coli, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Streptomyces coelicolor, RNase E interacts with the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, DEAD-box helicase(s), and additional factors in an RNA-degrading complex. To characterize the degradosome of the psychrotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W, RNase E was enriched by cation exchange chromatography and fractionation in a glycerol density gradient. Most surprisingly, the hydrolytic exoribonuclease RNase R was found to co-purify with RNase E. Co-immunoprecipitation and Ni2+-affinity pull-down experiments confirmed the specific interaction between RNase R and RNase E. Additionally, the DEAD-box helicase RhlE was identified as part of this protein complex. Fractions comprising the three proteins showed RNase E and RNase R activity and efficiently degraded a synthetic stem-loop containing RNA in the presence of ATP. The unexpected association of RNase R with RNase E and RhlE in an RNA-degrading complex indicates that the cold-adapted P. syringae has a degradosome of novel structure. The identification of RNase R instead of polynucleotide phosphorylase in this complex underlines the importance of the interaction between endo- and exoribonucleases for the bacterial RNA metabolism.

The physical association of RNase E with an exoribonuclease and an RNA helicase apparently is a common theme in the composition of bacterial RNA-degrading complexes. RNA maturation and degradation involve the action of different ribonucleases, some of which are organized in protein complexes. It is reasonable to assume that such complexes work like molecular machines and would therefore catalyze different enzymatic steps in an ordered manner. Escherichia coli possesses an RNA-degrading complex called degradosome. It is organized by the endoribonuclease RNase E, which is tightly associated with the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), 1The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PAP, poly(A) polymerase. the DEAD-box helicase RhlB, and enolase (1Carpousis A.J.

Polynucleotide kinase, poly(A) polymerase, and the chaperones DnaK and GroEL are also implicated to be components of this complex (4Sohlberg B. Lundberg U. Hartl F.U. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The existence of the E. coli degradosome in vivo and its roles in mRNA and rRNA degradation are well documented (8Liou G.G. Jane W.N. Cohen S.N. Lin N.S. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Khemici V. Carpousis A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Bernstein J.A. Lin P.H. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). RNase E organizes the degradosome via its C-terminal protein binding scaffold, whereas its catalytic domain is located in the N-terminal part (11Kaberdin V.R. Miczak A. Jakobsen J.S. Lin-Chao S. McDowall K.J. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11637-11642Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Not all bacteria have a gene for RNase E (rne), and some bacteria possess only short RNase E homologues without potential protein binding domains (12Lee K. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). They most probably do not harbor degradosomes. The remaining species with long RNase E versions are thought to have degradosomes, the structure of which may differ from that of E. coli. The second bacterial RNase E-based protein complex studied was that of Rhodobacter capsulatus (13Jäger S. Fuhrmann O. Heck C. Hebermehl M. Schiltz E. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4581-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RNase E of R. capsulatus strongly interacts with a DEAD-box helicase, the transcription termination factor Rho, and two other previously unidentified proteins. A second DEAD-box helicase also co-purifies with R. capsulatus RNase E. PNPase is not tightly associated with the complex but is found in substoichiometric amounts in RNase E-containing fractions after three purification steps (13Jäger S. Fuhrmann O. Heck C. Hebermehl M. Schiltz E. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4581-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that a structurally shuffled RNase E homologue in Streptomyces coelicolor harbors its active center in the middle of the molecule and interacts with PNPase via its N-terminal part (12Lee K. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The available data imply that the bacterial degradosome consists of RNase E, DEAD-box helicase(s), the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease PNPase, and additional subunits, which vary in the different species. Each monomer of the homotrimeric PNPase harbors two RNase PH-like domains (RNase PH, EC 2.7.7.56). The six RNase PH-like domains of PNPase are organized in a ring, similarly to the six RNase PH-like domain-containing subunits of the eukaryotic RNA-processing and -degrading complex, the exosome (14Symmons M.F. Williams M.G. Luisi B.F. Jones G.H. Carpousis A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Aloy P. Ciccarelli F.D. Leutwein C. Gavin A.C. Superti-Furga G. Bork P. Bottcher B. Russell R.B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The structural similarity between PNPase and the exosome ring led to the suggestion that the RNA-degrading complexes of bacteria and eukaryotes may have functional similarities and/or a common evolutionary origin. It was shown that the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus possesses an exosome-like protein complex (16Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Walter P. Hochleitner E. Lottspeich F. Klug G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the existence of the exosome in many Archaea was predicted (17Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Physiologically, RNases are important virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria (18Cheng Z.F. Zuo Y. Li Z. Rudd K.E.

For example, the exoribonucleases PNPase and RNase R accumulate under cold shock in mesophilic E. coli (22Cairrao F. Cruz A. Mori H. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Polissi A. De Laurentis W. Zangrossi S. Briani F. Longhi V. Pesole G. Deho G. Res. Microbiol. 2003; 154: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the RNA processing and degradation in psychrotrophic bacteria, some of which are pathogens. Therefore, we decided to study the degradosome of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W, a model organism, which grows well at 4 °C (24Janiyani K.L. Ray M.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, we found that RNase E of this strain interacts with the hydrolytic exoribonuclease RNase R in a protein complex. Another component of the complex is the DEAD-box helicase RhlE. Our data reveal the existence of a bacterial RNA-degrading complex of unexpected structure. Bacterial Strains—The psychrotrophic P. syringae Lz4W was grown at 22 or 4 °C in Antarctic Bacterial Medium composed of 5 g liter–1 peptone and 2.5 g liter–1 yeast extract as described earlier (24Janiyani K.L. Ray M.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When necessary, the culture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C prior to harvesting. Cells were harvested at OD600 of 1.0. E. coli strains DH5α and BL21(DE3) were cultured at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (LB), E. coli JM 109 in standard I medium (Merck). When necessary, the growth medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml–1), kanamycin (50 μg ml–1), or tetracycline (20 μg ml–1). Protein Fractionation—RNase E-containing fractions of P. syringae Lz4W and E. coli JM 109 were isolated as described for the R. capsulatus degradosomes (13Jäger S. Fuhrmann O. Heck C. Hebermehl M. Schiltz E. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4581-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction of cell lysates was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a sulfopropyl (SP)-Sepharose cation exchanger column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated in buffer A containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Genapol X-080, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaCl (13Jäger S. Fuhrmann O. Heck C. Hebermehl M. Schiltz E. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4581-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After washing with the same buffer containing first 50 and then 300 mm NaCl, RNase E was eluted with 1 m NaCl. The SP-Sepharose fractions containing RNase E were layered on top of a 10–30% (w/v) glycerol gradient containing buffer A with 300 mm NaCl. A control experiment with the RNase A-treated SP fraction was also performed. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman SW60 rotor at 4 °C for 21 h 30 min at 30,000 rpm. For calibration, bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), and ferritin (440 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences) were used. Aliquots of 260 μl (total 16 fractions) were harvested from the top of the gradient. The distribution of proteins was visualized by running aliquots of each fraction on denaturing 8–10% polyacrylamide gels with subsequent silver staining. Protein Sequencing and Identification—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Ponceau S reagent. The stained bands were excised, washed 10 times with MilliQ water in microcentrifuge tube, and stored at –30 °C. The strips were used for N-terminal amino acid sequencing by the Edman degradation method on an Automated Protein Sequencer Procise cLC from Applied Biosystems. The N-terminal sequence was used for Protein Blast analysis at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using the default parameters of search for short, nearly exact matches. The proteins were identified from among the best matches under the constraints that the identity/similarity must lie within the N-terminal end and must have a molecular mass similar to the estimated mass derived from the mobility of protein in SDS-PAGE. For example, identification of the ∼70-kDa protein in degradosomal fraction of P. syringae Lz4W as RhlE (PSPTO5070) homologue of P. syringae pv. tomato (25Buell C.R. Joardar V. Lindenberg M. Selengut J. Paulsen I.T. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10181-10186Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) was based not only on the identity of N-terminal amino acid sequence but also on its size (629 amino acids long), because another homologue, PSPTO4664, had an almost identical N-terminal amino acid sequence but was only 442 amino acids long. Purification of Recombinant Proteins from E. coli and Antibody Production—The P. syringae RNase R gene (rnr) was amplified by the forward primer (5′-ATGGCCGATT-GGCAAACCCTCGAT-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-TCATGACTTGGCCTTAGG-3′) from genomic DNA. The 2.651-kb PCR product was first cloned into the EcoRV site of the pMOSBlue plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). Then the rnr gene was cloned between the SalI and EcoRI sites of the expression vector pET28a (Novagen) to generate pETrnr-his producing N-terminal His-tagged RNase R protein. For RhlE, a part of the rhlE gene was amplified from P. syringae genomic DNA by PCR, using forward and reverse (5′-ATGTCCTTTKCTTCCCTCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGATGCGGTGSACRTAGTCTTC-3′) primers, respectively. The amplified fragment (∼1 kb) encodes a truncated protein corresponding to the amino acid positions 1–340 of RhlE (PSPTO5070) in P. syringae pv. tomato (NCBI accession number NC004578.1). It was cloned into the pET28a expression vector. The successful cloning in-frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Both His-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified under denaturing conditions by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography (Qiagen). The identity of the purified recombinant RNase R was additionally confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The purified truncated His-tagged protein RhlE* has a calculated molecular mass of ∼40 kDa. The polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit against the purified recombinant RNase R and in mouse against the RhlE* by using standard protocols. The anti-RhlE* antibodies cross-reacted only to the degradosomal fraction-associated 70-kDa protein, confirming the identity of the expressed open reading frame as RhlE (PSPTO5070 homologue). Expression of His-tagged RNase E and RNase R in P. syringae—For expression of His-tagged RNase E and RNase R in P. syringae, the rne and rnr genes were cloned into the broad host range plasmid vector pGL10 (26Bidle K.A. Bartlett D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2330-2337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pGLrne-his and pGLrnr-his (details of cloning and expression will be published elsewhere). Briefly, the rne gene was amplified by PCR using primers (FPn1, 5′-ATGAAAAGAATGCTGATTAACGCAAC-3′, and RP2, 5′-TCAGACGAGGGGTTTAGGGCTGGTGTTC-3′) and was cloned in the EcoRV site of pMOSBlue (Amersham Biosciences). The gene was then ligated in-frame between the EcoRI and SalI sites of the expression vector pET28a (Novagen) to produce pETrne-his, similar to pETrnr-his described above. Subsequently, His-tagged rne and rnr reading frames were cleaved out as XbaI fragments from the respective pET28a expression vectors and were ligated into the XbaI site of the broad host range plasmid vector pGL10 (26Bidle K.A. Bartlett D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2330-2337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive expression from the lacZ promoter of the plasmid resulted in production of soluble His-tagged proteins, which were purified under native conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography following the supplier's instructions. Analysis of Interacting Proteins by Ni-NTA Resin—For analyzing interacting proteins, purified His-tagged RNase E (15–20 μg) was mixed with SP-Sepharose-eluted fraction (100–125 μg of protein) of cell lysate from P. syringae in a buffer that contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C by gentle shaking, and then 200 μl of Ni-NTA slurry (50%) was added to it and incubated for another 1 h. The whole slurry was then processed for routine Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography, except that the column was washed with at least 10 volumes of phosphate buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. Resin-bound proteins were finally eluted with 250 mm imidazole. As a control, RNase treatment was performed prior to elution. Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was carried out following transfer of the separated proteins onto Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. The membrane filters were probed with antisera raised against R. capsulatus RNase E (13Jäger S. Fuhrmann O. Heck C. Hebermehl M. Schiltz E. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4581-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or P. syringae RNase R and RhlE (this work). The detection was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse goat IgG and standard protocols. A commercially available anti-His polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to confirm expression of His-tagged proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—For co-immunoprecipitation experiments by anti-RNase R antibodies, 250 μl of the SP-Sepharose fraction (∼125 μg of protein) of P. syringae was incubated with 10 μl of the antisera by gentle shaking for 2 h at 4 °C. Then 10 μl of protein A-conjugated CL-agarose slurry (Bangalore Genei, India) was added and incubated further for 1 h. Protein A-agarose beads were then pelleted down by centrifugation (1500 × g, 2 min) and washed three times with buffer A (see protein fractionation method) containing 1 m NaCl. Finally, the agarose beads were resuspended in 100 μl of sample loading buffer of SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE separation, the proteins were visualized by silver staining or processed for Western analysis. As a control, RNase treatment of SP fraction was performed prior to incubation with antibodies. In Vitro Transcription of RNAs and Enzyme Assays—In vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and purification of the [α-32P]UTP-labeled pZBP transcript (27Fritsch J. Rothfuchs R. Rauhut R. Klug G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) on denaturing gels was performed as described (28Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 29Conrad C. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When RNA I.26 was used, the plasmid pT7-R25 (a kind gift from Dr. J. G. Belasco) was used as template (30Jiang X. Diwa A. Belasco J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2468-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Synthetic poly(A) substrate (Amersham Biosciences) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Radioactively labeled RNA I.26 and poly(A) were purified from unincorporated nucleotides by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. The RNA degradation assays were performed in a buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 100 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, in presence of 10 units of RNasin (Promega). Optionally, this buffer was amended with 10 mm K2HPO4 (for the PNPase assay) or with 5 mm ATP (for the helicase assay). The assays were performed in a final volume of 10 μl with RNase E fractions containing 5 ng of P. syringae RNase R or 5 ng of E. coli PNPase (as determined by silver staining), His-tagged P. syringae RNase R, or His-tagged P. syringae RNase E. The reactions were terminated with 10 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K and were incubated for 10 min at 50 °C. One sample was stopped immediately (time point 0). Generated RNA fragments were then detected by PhosphorImaging (Bio-Rad and Fuji). Polyadenylation of RNA for Degradation Assay—To examine the effect of polyadenylation of RNA on degradation by exonucleases, the 32P-labeled RNA I.26 was polyadenylated by E. coli poly(A) polymerase, PAP-I (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in presence of [α-32P]ATP according to the supplier's instruction, and purified by NucAway spin column (Ambion). Both polyadenylated and control RNA I substrates were then assayed for degradation in the presence of purified RNase R and degradosomal fractions from glycerol gradients as described above. Thin Layer Chromatography—In vitro degradation reaction mixtures were applied in two 5-μl portions to a layer of Cellulose MN 300 PEI (Macherey & Nagel). After drying, the separation of uridine tri-, di-, and monophosphate was carried out using 0.9 m guanidine chloride, pH 6.3. The plate was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. P. syringae RNase R Is in a Complex with RNase E and RhlE—To enrich P. syringae RNase E with associated proteins, we used the procedure already successfully applied for isolation of the RNase E-based protein complexes of E. coli and R. capsulatus. After ammonium sulfate precipitation of the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction and cation exchange chromatography, fractionation through a glycerol density gradient in the presence of protease inhibitors was performed. The protein content of the fractions was analyzed in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). In parallel, the sedimentation behavior of marker proteins was monitored (Fig. 1B). In Fig. 1A, a protein band of ∼200 kDa was detected in the 5–9 fraction from the top of the glycerol density gradient. This band showed a cross-reaction with antibodies specific for RNase E of R. capsulatus (lane W in Fig. 1A). The 118-kDa RNase E of R. capsulatus and E. coli migrates in SDS-PAGE like a 180-kDa protein (1Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Jäger S. Fuhrmann O. Heck C. Hebermehl M. Schiltz E. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4581-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The rne gene of P. syringae DC3000 (NCBI accession number 28870994) encodes a protein of ∼120 kDa. We concluded that the 200-kDa band in Fig. 1A represents aberrantly migrating RNase E of P. syringae Lz4W. This assumption was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. To test the RNase E-containing fractions for an endoribonucleolytic activity, assays with labeled RNA substrates were performed in buffer devoid of inorganic phosphate. Most surprisingly, we observed strong hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity (see Fig. 4). This prompted us to identify other proteins in the RNase E-containing fractions by N-terminal sequencing. We found that RNase R, DnaK, RhlE, EngA, SrmB, RsuA, and MvaT homologues are present in the RNase E-containing fractions (Fig. 1A and Table I). The identification of homologues of two DEAD-box helicases (RhlE and SrmB) and an exoribonuclease (RNase R) in the RNase E fractions suggested that these fractions may contain the degradosome of P. syringae. This part of the glycerol density gradient (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–9) corresponds to proteins with a native molecular mass of 160–240 kDa (Fig. 1B). Thus, not all of the proteins present in the fractions 5–9 of the glycerol density gradient are in a complex.

We decided to test whether RNase E and RNase R of P. syringae interact with each other, because they peaked in the same glycerol density gradient fractions (Fig. 1A). To this end, co-immunoprecipitation was performed with RNase R-directed antibodies and the RNase E-containing SP fraction of P. syringae (the cation exchanger fraction pool usually used for further glycerol gradient fractionation; see lane SP in Fig. 1A). In addition to RNase R, a 200-kDa polypeptide was specifically co-precipitated, which"
https://openalex.org/W1991442209,"In human myometrial cells, the promiscuous coupling of the oxytocin receptors (OTRs) to Gq and Gi leads to contraction. However, the activation of OTRs coupled to different G protein pathways can also trigger opposite cellular responses, e.g. OTR coupling to Gi inhibits, whereas its coupling to Gq stimulates, cell proliferation. Drug analogues capable of promoting a selective receptor-G protein coupling may be of great pharmacological and clinical importance because they may target only one specific signal transduction pathway. Here, we report that atosiban, an oxytocin derivative that acts as a competitive antagonist on OTR/Gq coupling, displays agonistic properties on OTR/Gi coupling, as shown by specific 35S-labeled guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) trisphosphate ([35S]GTPγS) binding. Moreover, atosiban, by acting on a Gi-mediated pathway, inhibits cell growth of HEK293 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably transfected with OTRs and of DU145 prostate cancer cells expressing endogenous OTRs. Notably, atosiban leads to persistent ERK1/2 activation and p21WAF1/CIP1 induction, the same signaling events leading to oxytocin-mediated cell growth inhibition via a Gi pathway. Finally, atosiban exposure did not cause OTR internalization and led to only a modest decrease (20%) in the number of high affinity cell membrane OTRs, two observations consistent with the finding that atosiban did not lead to any desensitization of the oxytocin-induced activation of the Gq-phospholipase C pathway. Taken together, these observations indicate that atosiban acts as a “biased agonist” of the human OTRs and thus belongs to the class of compounds capable of selectively discriminating only one among the multiple possible active conformations of a single G protein-coupled receptor, thereby leading to the selective activation of a unique intracellular signal cascade.

Oxytocin, a nonapeptide secreted by the neurohypophysis, exerts its biological effects by binding to and activating the oxytocin receptor (OTR), 1The abbreviations used are: OT, oxytocin; OTR, oxytocin receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; InsP, inositol phosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)trisphospate; PLC, phospholipase C; MAPK, mitogen activated kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PTx, pertussis toxin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: OT, oxytocin; OTR, oxytocin receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; InsP, inositol phosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)trisphospate; PLC, phospholipase C; MAPK, mitogen activated kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PTx, pertussis toxin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a membrane receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family (1Kimura T. Tanizawa O. Mori K. Brownstein M.J. Okayama H. Nature. 1992; 356: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). As recently reviewed by Gimpl (2Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar), OTRs were originally described in the uterus, mammary gland, and central nervous system. In the uterus, the level of OTR expression increases during pregnancy and peaks immediately before the onset of labor, when receptor activation promotes uterine contractility. The OTRs in the mammary gland are located on myoepithelial cells, where they stimulate contractility and promote milk ejection. In the central nervous system, where they modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity during pregnancy (3Tomizawa K. Iga N. Lu Y.F. Moriwaki A. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Miyamoto O. Itano T. Matsui H. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), OTRs are involved in regulating a number of reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors.OTRs have more recently been detected in a vast number of tumor cells of various origin (breast and endometrial carcinomas, neuroblastomas, glioblastomas, Kaposi sarcomas, small-cell lung carcinomas), and their stimulation variably affects cell growth (4Bussolati G. Cassoni P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been suggested that OTRs are involved in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes (5Paquin J. Danalache B.A. Jankowski M. McCann S.M. Gutkowska J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9550-9555Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and myoblasts (6Breton C. Haenggeli C. Barberis C. Heitz F. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. Tribollet E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1415-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Despite the biological relevance of OTR signaling, the identity of signaling pathways activated to accomplish these different functions has only been partially clarified. In particular, although human OTRs have been shown to associate to Gq, Gi, and, to a minor extent, to Gs (7Strakova Z. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E870-E876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only the signaling events induced by Gq activation have been extensively investigated and exploited to develop drugs already entered in the clinical use. In myometrial and breast myoepithelial cells, OTR coupling to Gq is responsible for phospholipase C (PLC) activation followed by inositol phosphate (InsP) and diacylglycerol production, increased intracellular calcium, and increased contractility (8Sanborn B.M. Exp. Physiol. 2001; 86: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Accordingly, selective oxytocin analogues capable of blocking this pathway are employed in the treatment of preterm labor (9Thornton S. Vatish M. Slater D. Exp. Physiol. 2001; 86: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The physiological role played by OTRs coupled to Gi in myometrial cells is far less clear, although it was shown some years ago to also lead to an increase of cell contractility (10Phaneuf S. Europe-Finner G.N. Varney M. MacKenzie I.Z. Watson S.P. Lopez Bernal A. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 136: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recently, a specific role for OTR coupled to Gi has emerged in MDCK and HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human OTR, where OT inhibits cell growth in a pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive manner, thus suggesting a key role of OTR-Gi coupling in mediating an anti-proliferative effect (11Rimoldi V. Reversi A. Taverna E. Rosa P. Francolini M. Cassoni P. Parenti M. Chini B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).A review of our previous work indicated that atosiban, an OTR antagonist that is currently used in the treatment of preterm labor because of its ability to block the Gq/PLC/calcium signaling pathway in myometrial cells (12Akerlund M.

Cancer. 1996; 66: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As we have recently shown that the growth of MDCK and HEK293 cells is inhibited via Gi-coupled OTRs (11Rimoldi V. Reversi A. Taverna E. Rosa P. Francolini M. Cassoni P. Parenti M. Chini B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that atosiban inhibited cell growth via a biased agonist mechanism by selectively promoting OTR coupling to Gi. Biased agonists have been defined as analogues displaying, at a single promiscuous GPCR, agonist properties at one coupling pathway and antagonist properties at another one (17Jarpe M.B. Knall C.

Sci. 2003; 24: 346-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To check the biased agonist properties of atosiban at the human OTR, we examined atosiban signaling in MDCK and HEK293 cell clones stably transfected with human OTRs, as well as in DU145 human prostate cancer cells endogenously expressing OTRs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptides and Reagents—OT and Thr4Gly7OT were obtained from Sigma; atosiban ((mpa1,d-Tyr(et)2,Thr4, Orn8)OT) (12Akerlund M. Stromberg P. Hauksson A. Andersen L.F. Lyndrup J. Trojnar J. Melin P. Br. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. 1987; 94: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. M. Manning, Toledo, OH. The sources of the primary antibodies were as follows: polyclonal anti-p21 (catalogue number sc-397) and anti-caveolin-1 (catalogue number sc-894) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (catalogue number M048–3 clone 1E4) from MBL International Corp.; polyclonal anti-β-tubulin (catalogue number T5293 clone 2–28-33) from Sigma; polyclonal anti-phospho p42/44 MAPK (catalogue number 9101) from Cell Signaling Technology. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Pierce, and [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Cell Culture—The human prostate carcinoma DU145 cell line was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and Fungizone (Invitrogen), in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, at 37 °C. Production, pharmacological characterization, and culture conditions of MDCK and HEK293 clones stably expressing the human OTR cDNA fused to EGFP have been described elsewhere (11Rimoldi V.

Francolini M. Parenti M. Chini B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1658-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Cell Growth Assay—Cells were seeded in 48-multiwell plates (10,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere for 24–48 h. Peptides were then added to the culture medium at the specified concentrations for up to 72 h. DU145 and MDCK cells were then fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% (v/v) methanol, and solubilized in 10% (v/v) acetic acid prior to cell growth evaluation through measurement of absorbance at 590 nm in a microplate reader (Wallac Victor2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell growth of HEK293 was determined by a methanethiosulfonate-based assay (Promega CellTiter 96® AQueous one solution assay) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All treatments were performed in quadruplicate. Equal numbers of cells were assayed, and a linear correlation between absorbance and cell counts was established up to 1 × 105 cells. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t test.[35S]GTPγS Binding Studies—[35S]GTPγS binding studies were carried out on transiently transfected cells. HEK293 cells, plated in 10-cm dishes at a 50% confluence, were transfected with 30 μg of a pEGFP-N3 Clontech plasmid encoding human OTR·EGFP using calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were collected in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS-), centrifuged, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After cell rupture with a glass homogenizer and removal of nuclei by low speed centrifugation (800 × g), cell extracts were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm Mg2Cl and 100 mm NaCl, to a final concentration of 1–2 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. When required, cells were exposed to PTx (Sigma) for 16 h at a final concentration of 150 ng/ml before harvesting. [35S]GTPγS binding studies were performed according to Wieland and Jakobs (22Wieland T. Jakobs K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of membranes were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in a final assay volume of 100 μl. The assay mixture consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 μm GDP. [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) was used at 50 nCi/assay tube, giving a final assay concentration of 0.5 nm. Agonist- and antagonist-dependent binding of [35S]GTPγS was determined in the presence of 100 nm oxytocin or atosiban, whereas nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled GTPγS. The binding reaction was stopped by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm Mg2Cl) and filtration through Whatman GF/C filters followed by three quick washes with washing buffer. After air-drying filters and adding 5 ml of Ultima Gold™ XR scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Inositol Phosphate Determination—Inositol phosphate (InsP) accumulation was measured as described previously (20Kirk C.J. Guillon G. Balestre M. Jard S. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Chini B. Mouillac B. Ala Y. Balestre M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Elands J. Hibert M. Manning M. Jard S. Barberis C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2176-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 6-well dishes were labeled for 24 h with myo-[2-3H]inositol at a final concentration of 2 μCi/ml in a serum- and inositol-free medium (Invitrogen). The cells were washed twice in Krebs buffer (146 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES base, 1% (w/v) glucose, pH 7.4) and preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the same buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl. After incubation for 15 min in the absence (baseline) or presence of peptide at a final concentration 10-7m, the reaction was stopped with 5% (v/v) perchloric acid, and the [3H]InsPs were extracted and separated using a strong anionic exchange column (Dowex AG1X8, formate form, 200–400 mesh; Bio-Rad). The fraction containing the [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and tris-phosphates was collected, and its radioactivity content was determined by liquid scintillation counting. This fraction is referred to as total InsP and expressed as DPM/well.cAMP Accumulation Assay—Cells grown in 10-cm Petri dishes for 48 h were washed twice with PBS- and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in PBS- supplemented with 4 mm EDTA. After scraping with a rubber policeman, cells were centrifuged at low speed, and resulting pellets were resuspended at a density of 106 cells/90 μl in PBS- supplemented with 5.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Cell suspensions (total volume of 90 μl) were equilibrated at 37 °C for 15 min and further incubated with peptides at a final concentration of 10-7m, or buffer (basal accumulation), for additional 10 min. cAMP accumulation was stopped by placing the tubes in liquid nitrogen and boiling for 5 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf minifuge, and the supernatants were immediately used to measure cAMP using a competitive binding assay (cyclic AMP [3H] assay kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—After 1 h of starvation in serum-free medium, cells were stimulated with OT or atosiban at the final concentration of 10-7m for the indicated periods of time. Cells were then washed once in ice-cold PBS- and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, preheated at 100 °C. After 4–5 cycles of freezing in dry ice and boiling for 2 min, aliquots of the lysates were assayed for protein content using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Cellular proteins (30 μg) were resolved by Laemmli SDS-PAGE system using 11% acrylamide (45Laemli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline/milk and for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (Pierce). When phospho p42/44 MAPK antibody was used, blocking was performed in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin/0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C,and incubation was performed overnight in Tris-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Proteins were detected using the SuperSignal® chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For quantification, unsaturated bands were acquired by means of an Arcus II Scanner (Agfa-Gevaert) and analyzed with the NIH Image program Version 1.61 (National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA).Internalization Assays—Cells were washed twice in serum-free medium and left for 30 min to equilibrate at 37 °C. Peptides were then added at a final concentration of 10-7m. At fixed time intervals (0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min), cells were processed for fluorescence microscopy or binding assays.For fluorescence microscopy, cells grown on glass coverslips placed in 6-well dishes were washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were rinsed with LS buffer and mounted on glass slides with 90% (v/v) glycerol in PBS. Slides were observed under an MRC1024 Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal microscope.To determine cell surface binding, cells subcultured into 24-well dishes were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer (146 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES base, 1% (w/v) glucose, 0.018% (w/v) l-tyrosine, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and placed on ice.[3H]OT at a final concentration of 4 nm was added to the wells with or without 10-7 m unlabeled OT in a final volume of 200 μl. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, a time required to reach the equilibrium, cells were washed three times with binding buffer to remove the unbound radioactivity and then solubilized with 0.5 N NaOH. The samples were transferred to scintillation vials and counted in a β counter after the addition of 3.5 ml of scintillation fluid. Specific surface binding at each time was calculated as percentage of specific binding at time 0.RESULTSAtosiban-induced Inhibition of MDCK and HEK29 Cells Expressing Human OTRs—To analyze the ability of atosiban to inhibit the growth of cells expressing the human OTR, we checked its effects on MDCK and HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human OTR fused to EGFP (11Rimoldi V. Reversi A. Taverna E. Rosa P. Francolini M. Cassoni P. Parenti M. Chini B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Guzzi F. Zanchetta D. Cassoni P. Guzzi V. Francolini M. Parenti M. Chini B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1658-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and D), cell growth was significantly inhibited after 48 h of treatment with OT and atosiban. This effect was concentration-dependent with calculated IC50 values of 20.8 ± 0.2 nm in HEK293 cells and 15.4 ± 0.44 nm in MDCK cells (Fig. 1, B and E), very similar to those calculated for OT (5.76 ± 0.3 nm and 22.0 ± 4.3 nm in HEK293 and MDCK cells, respectively; 13, 18). 2A.

Saturation and competition binding experiments performed in HEK293 cells resulted in the following affinities: Kd = 4.9 ± 2.2 nm and Ki = 71.5 ± 21.2 nm for OT and atosiban, respectively (data not shown). Finally, as shown in Fig. 1 (C and F), OT and atosiban did not induce any change in cell growth in parental MDCK and HEK293 cells stably transfected with the pEGFP vector alone, thus indicating that their effects on cell growth could only be detected in cells expressing OTRs.Signaling Pathways Involved in the Atosiban-mediated Inhibition of Cell Growth—As it is known that OTRs couple to Gq and Gi (7Strakova Z. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E870-E876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that receptor coupling to Gi is responsible for the OT-induced inhibition of HEK293 cell growth (11Rimoldi V. Reversi A. Taverna E. Rosa P. Francolini M. Cassoni P. Parenti M. Chini B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we investigated the signaling events leading to the atosiban-induced inhibition of cell growth, and particularly, whether Gi is involved. To determine whether atosiban could directly promote OTR coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins, we measured its ability to promote the binding of [35S]GTPγS, according to the paradigm that receptor activation promotes the GDP/GTP exchange on G protein α subunits. This assay utilizes [35S]GTPγS resistance to hydrolysis, its high affinity for the Gα subunits, and its relatively high specific activity to determine receptor-induced Gα activation (22Wieland T. Jakobs K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Harrison C. Traynor J.R. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 489-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 87-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, in HEK293 expressing the human OTR, OT and atosiban were both able to induce a percentage increase in [35S]GTPγS binding over basal of 23.84 ± 2.70 and 26.42 ± 4.10, respectively. In contrast, in parental, untransfected HEK293 cells, the two analogues did not induce any significant increase in [35S]GTPγS binding. These data indicate that atosiban is capable of promoting OTR coupling to G protein, thus displaying agonist properties toward the human OTR. In addition, in OTR-expressing cells pretreated with PTx, the capability of OT and atosiban to increase [35S]GTPγS binding was completely abolished, indicating a coupling to Gi-like proteins. The lack of any residual [35S]GTPγS binding even in membranes treated with OT indicates that, in our experimental conditions, OTR coupling to Gq did not significantly contribute to total [35S]GTPγS binding. We then checked the ability of atosiban to modulate proliferation of PTx-treated cells (Fig. 2B); under these conditions, the atosiban-induced inhibition of cell growth was completely abolished, thus indicating that a PTx-sensitive G protein of the Gi family mediates the inhibitory effect.Fig. 2Signaling pathways involved in atosiban-induced growth inhibition of HEK293 cells expressing the recombinant human OTR.A, [35S]GTPγS binding assay. [35S]GTPγS binding performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” is expressed as the percentage of increase of specific binding measured in agonist-treated membranes with respect to membranes treated with vehicle (basal). Membranes were prepared from untransfected parental and OTR-expressing HEK293 cells untreated or pretreated for 16 h with PTx at a final concentration of 150 ng/ml. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001 versus parental Hek293 cells (Student's t test). B, effect of PTx on atosiban-induced inhibition of cell growth. Atosiban-induced effects on cell growth were determined in cells pretreated or not with PTx. In cells treated with PTx, the atosiban-induced variations in cell number was determined with respect to control cells maintained in the presence of PTx for the complete duration of the experiment. C, MAPK activation by OT and atosiban. The cells were treated with 10-7m OT or atosiban for the indicated periods of time. Then cells were lysed, and 30 μg of proteins/lane were subjected to separation by SDS-PAGE (11% acrylamide), Western immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-phosphoERK1/ERK2 antibody, and chemiluminescence detection. A caveolin-1 (cav-1) antibody was used to check the quantities of protein loaded in the different lanes. After image acquisition, the band densities were quantitated using the NIH Image Program version 1.61. The results are expressed as -fold increase in phospho-ERK1/ERK2 over basal (Bas). The blot is representative of two independent experiments. D, dose-response curves of OT- and atosiban-induced accumulation of InsP. OTR coupling to Gq was assayed by measuring total InsP production induced by cell exposure for 15 min to increasing concentrations of OT or atosiban. Each point, performed in triplicate, represents the mean of total amount of InsPs produced (expressed in dpm/well). The data are representative of two independent experiments diverging for <20%. E, dose-response curves of OT-induced InsP accumulation in the absence and presence of different concentrations of atosiban. Total InsP production induced by OT (from 10-10 to 10-5m) was measured in the presence of a fixed concentration of atosiban (+ATO 10-8 to 10-5m). The amount of InsP produced at each point is expressed as the percentage of InsP produced at the maximal OT concentration (10-5m) in the absence of atosiban (-ATO) fixed at 100%. The data are representative of two independent experiments diverging for <20%. Each concentration was assayed in triplicate determinations; error bars were not included for the sake of clarity. F, agonist-induced cAMP production. The coupling of OTRs to Gs was assayed by measuring cAMP levels after stimulation with OT (10-7m), atosiban (10-7m), or forskolin (2 μm). The data are representative of two independent experiments diverging for <20%. **, p < 0.01 versus untreated cells (Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As we have shown that the OT-induced growth inhibition of MDCK and HEK293 cells is associated with a long-lasting activation of MAPK (11Rimoldi V.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we investigated whether atosiban can also induce MAPK phosphorylation. To this end, we applied atosiban for an increasing length of time and analyzed ERK1/2 activation by means of Western immunoblotting of cell lysates probed with phospho-specific anti-ERK1/2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, atosiban induced a persistent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, a pattern consistent with inhibition of cell growth, as demonstrated previously in HEK293 and MDCK cells (11Rimoldi V. Reversi A. Taverna E. Rosa P. Francolini M. Cassoni P. Parenti M. Chini B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).We then verified whether atosiban can promote OTR coupling to Gq by measuring the atosiban-induced accumulation of total InsPs; as shown in Fig. 2D, whereas OT caused a concentration-dependent enhancement in the production of InsPs, no effect was observed after atosiban treatment, even at very high concentrations, thus indicating that atosiban is completely devoid on any agonist properties on OTR/Gq coupling. In addition, we verified whether atosiban acted as an antagonist on the OTR/Gq/PLC signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 2E, increasing concentrations of atosiban shifted to the right the dose-response curve of OT-induced InsP production, as expected for a competitive antagonist. This experiment also confirmed that atosiban does not behave as a partial agonist on the human OTR as, if"
https://openalex.org/W2129309450,"Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used drugs for the safe and effective treatment of pain and fever. Acetaminophen works by lowering cyclo-oxygenase products preferentially in the central nervous system, where oxidant stress is strictly limited. However, the precise mechanism of action for acetaminophen on cyclo-oxygenase activity is debated. Two theories prevail. First, it is suggested that acetaminophen selectively inhibits a distinct form of cyclo-oxygenase, cyclo-oxygenase-3. Second, it is suggested that acetaminophen has no affinity for the active site of cyclo-oxygenase but instead blocks activity by reducing the active oxidized form of cyclo-oxygenase to an inactive form. Here, we have used an in vitro model of cyclo-oxygenase-2 activity (A549 cells stimulated with IL-1beta) to show that acetaminophen is an effective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase activity in intact cells. However, acetaminophen, unlike nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cannot inhibit activity in broken cell preparations. The inhibitory effects of acetaminophen were abolished by increasing intracellular oxidation conditions with the cell-permeable hydroperoxide t-butylOOH. Similarly the inhibitory effects of the cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib or the mixed cyclo-oxygenase-1/cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors ibuprofen and naproxen were significant reduced by t-butylOOH. By contrast, the inhibitory effects of indomethacin or diclofenac, which also inhibit both cyclo-oxygenase-1 and cyclo-oxygenase-2, were unaffected by t-butylOOH. These observations dispel the notion that cyclo-oxygenase-3 is involved in the actions of acetaminophen and provide evidence that supports the theory that acetaminophen interferes with the oxidation state of cyclo-oxygease. Moreover, they suggest for the first time that the inhibitory effects of some NSAIDs, including the newly introduced cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib, owe part of their inhibitory actions to effects on oxidation state of cyclo-oxygenase. Our data with t-butylOOH and NSAIDs illustrates an, as yet, undeveloped therapeutic window for the ""cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor"". Specifically, combining active site selectively with actions on enzyme oxidation state would allow for a broader range of tissue selective drugs."

In addition at least two slower migrating “isomer 1 and 2” bands are recovered, not discernible under reducing conditions, which represent minor species that exhibit less efficient secretion. Although rats and mice have two proinsulin genes, three distinct migrating species are also produced upon proinsulin expression from a single wild-type human proinsulin cDNA. The “Akita-type” proinsulin mutation, which causes dominant-negative diabetes mellitus due to point mutation C(A7)Y that leaves B7-cysteine without its disulfide pairing partner, is recovered as a form that near quantitatively co-migrates with the aberrant isomer 1 band of proinsulin. Anomalous migration is also demonstrated for several other mutants lacking a single cysteine. In islets from PERK–/– mice, which exhibit premature loss of pancreatic beta cells, hypersynthesis of proinsulin increases the amount of nonnative proinsulin isomers. Such findings appear consistent with an hypothesis that supranormal production of nonnative proinsulin may predispose to pancreatic beta cell toxicity.

Proinsulin is comprised sequentially of three regions, the amino-terminal B-chain, the proteolytically removable C-peptide, and the carboxyl-terminal A-chain. Proinsulin contains six cysteines that form three evolutionarily conserved disulfide bonds of the insulin/IGF-1 superfamily, including B7-A7 and B19-A20 interchain pairs and the A6-A11 intrachain pair. At 4.5 amino acids translated per second, it may require 25 s or less to synthesize nascent preproinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the three disulfide bonds are expected to form either co-translationally or shortly thereafter (1.Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20417-20423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that B-chain mutants have increased disulfide mispairing in the secretory pathway (2.Guo Z.Y. Shen L. Feng Y.M.

Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Certainly, related members of the insulin/IGF-1 family are predisposed to forming nonnative disulfide bridges during progression through the protein folding pathway (5.Hua Q.X. Chu Y.C. Jia W.

Of the 15 potential disulfide isomers that might be formed, a few specific disulfide mispaired combinations, called swap I and swap II isoforms, may be preferred (8.Hua Q.X. Gozani S.N. Chance R.E.

Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14700-14715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although these conclusions are based primarily on folding studies performed in vitro. Recent hypotheses suggest that a subpopulation of wild-type proinsulin might also misfold in pancreatic beta cells (10.Izumi T. Yokota-Hashimoto H. Zhao S. Wang J. Halban P.A. Takeuchi T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Proinsulin misfolding appears to be linked to the dominant-negative pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus in the “Akita” diabetic mouse, in which one allele of mouse proinsulin-II has the C(A7)Y mutation, which leaves B7-cysteine without its natural disulfide pairing partner (11.Wang J.

However, recent studies have thus far been unable to discern any qualitative or quantitative differences in proinsulin folding either in the islets of Akita mice or in CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. cells expressing the Akita-type mutant proinsulin (10.Izumi T. Yokota-Hashimoto H. Zhao S. Wang J. Halban P.A. Takeuchi T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have been recently engaged in the analysis of disulfide maturation of newly synthesized insulin precursor by nonreducing Tris-Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE, as the method has excellent sensitivity to disulfide mispairing (4.Zhang B.-y.

We now report distinct monomeric proinsulin structures produced in normal pancreatic islets or from the wild-type proinsulin cDNA, as well as a proinsulin cDNA expressing the Akita-type mutation. The results for the first time identify qualitative and quantitative differences in folding between wild-type and mutant proinsulin and also indicate a subpopulation of wild-type proinsulin molecules engaged in intramolecular disulfide mispairing. Materials—Guinea pig anti-insulin was from Linco (St. Charles, MO). Polyclonal anti-BiP was from Affinity BioReagents. Zysorbin was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture was from ICN. Methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM, dithiothreitol, and Ficoll 400 were from Sigma. MG115 was from Calbiochem. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and proteinase inhibtor mixture were from Roche Applied Science. Isolation and Labeling of Rat and Mouse Pancreatic Islets—Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley 200–250-g rats. Isolated islets were washed and recovered overnight in RPMI 1640 with 11.1 mm glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin-streptomycin before experiments. Islets from 18-day-old PERK–/– and PERK+/+ mice (14.Zhang P. McGrath B. Li S. Frank A. Zambito F. Reinert J. Gannon M. Ma K. McNaughton K. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) were also isolated by pancreatic collagenase digestion, harvesting by gradient centrifugation, and finally recovered overnight in serum-containing medium. Islets were washed twice in methionine- and cysteine-deficient medium plus 1% bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml soybean inhibitor, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35. The islets were then metabolically labeled with 35S-labeled amino acids in the same medium, and when a chase was employed (Fig. 1), it included complete medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Proinsulin Mutagenesis—A human proinsulin cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Mutant proinsulin cDNAs were created by three PCR reactions. Reaction 1 used forward and reverse primers to amplify a cDNA stretch encoding the signal peptide and the downstream site of the introduced mutation. Reaction 2 used another set of primers to amplify a cDNA encoding the mutation point as well as the remaining carboxyl-terminal region of proinsulin. The products from reactions 1 and 2 were designed to share ∼20-bp overlap in the region of the introduced mutation. Finally, a third PCR reaction used the primers at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the proinsulin coding sequence along with both gel-purified products from the first two PCR reactions as template, thereby generating the full-length mutant proinsulin cDNA. These were gel-purified and ligated into the pGEM T-vector (Promega). Mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing, and the mutants subcloned into pcDNA3. Transfection and Labeling of Cells in Culture—293T cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were plated into 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. CLA14 cells, a recently described subclone of CHO cells that exhibit IPTG-induced expression of bioactive ATF6 that induces the synthesis of ER molecular chaperones (13.Liu M. Ramos-Castañeda J. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), were treated with 15 mm IPTG beginning 1 day before transfection. 2 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into each well of cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, cells were pulse-labeled with 35S-labeled amino acids for the times indicated. Immunoprecipitation—At the end each experiment, cell lysates (and chase media if any) were treated with a proteinase inhibitor mixture, precleared with Zysorbin, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with guinea pig anti-insulin as described previously (13.Liu M. Ramos-Castañeda J. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in gel sample at a final concentration of 1% SDS, 12% glycerol, and 0.0025% Serva Blue in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8. SDS-PAGE—In this paper, unless expressly stated, all media and subsequently employed buffers were devoid of reducing reagents. In selected experiments, pretreatment of live cells before lysis with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block free thiols had no effect on the fractional recovery of newly synthesized nonnative proinsulin isomers. A resolving gel (11.2% acrylamide, 0.35% bisacrylamide, 10% Prosieve-50, 6.0 m urea, 0.1% SDS in 1.0 m Tris, pH 8.45) was overlaid with a 0.4 cm height of spacer gel containing 9.3% acrylamide, 0.6% bisacrylamide, 0.1% SDS in 1.0 m Tris, pH 8.45, without Prosieve or urea. 125I-Proinsulin gel standard was from Linco (catalog number 9015). Proinsulin Synthesis in Rat Pancreatic Islets—We examined by nonreducing Tris-Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE (13.Liu M. Ramos-Castañeda J. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) the immunoprecipitable proinsulin synthesized in rat pancreatic islets during a 5 min 35S amino acid labeling. The newly synthesized proinsulin existed as a major faster migrating species as well as two faintly detected slower migrating species (arrows highlighted by asterisk, Fig. 1). While proinsulin conversion intermediates also migrate more slowly than proinsulin under these gel conditions (15.Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) 5-min is too short an interval for nascent proinsulin to have initiated proteolytic processing in immature secretory granules (16.Rhodes C.J. Halban P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After a 30-min chase, more slowly migrating bands appeared, consistent with conversion intermediates (bracket, Fig. 1). Under such short labeling conditions, none of the proinsulin forms were co-precipitated from cell lysates during immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against the ER molecular chaperone, BiP. When radiolabeling was extended to 30 min, more 35S-proinsulin was recovered. In conjunction with this was the increased biosynthesis of the two slower migrating species (marked with arrows). During the 30-min labeling period, conversion intermediates (marked with bracket) were already apparent. These bands increased in abundance during a subsequent 30-min chase in conjunction with appearance of the labeled insulin band, but this was not observed for the anomalously slow migrating species of proinsulin. Rather, the slow migrating proinsulin was co-precipitated from cell lysates during immunoprecipitation with anti-BiP. Thus, proinsulin exists as a large native folded subpopulation plus minor isomeric subpopulations that have achieved different, nonnative conformations. Recombinant Proinsulin Synthesis in Heterologous Cells— Rat pancreatic beta cells synthesize both proinsulin-I and proinsulin-II gene products. To determine whether the minor, slower migrating proinsulin species were unique to rat islets, we examined heterologous cells transfected to express human proinsulin, which has a slightly different sequence than that of rat proinsulins. Fig. 2A shows full-length gels derived from insulin immunoprecipitation of untransfected and transfected CLA14 cells and their bathing media; these cells were IPTG-induced to overexpress ATF6 and ER molecular chaperones, which tends to increase recombinant secretory protein expression (13.Liu M. Ramos-Castañeda J. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The first two lanes of Fig. 2A indicate the spectrum of nonspecific radiolabeled bands recovered from these cells and medium. After transfection nonreducing Tris-Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE analysis revealed three newly synthesized proinsulin species (although the band spacing is slightly different than that from rat islets), with the fastest band predominating and already beginning to be secreted during a 50-min chase. These bands collapsed into a single species of slower mobility under reducing conditions, strongly indicating that the minor, slower migrating proinsulin bands are derived from a common translation product. To confirm this point we performed a two-dimensional gel analysis (Fig. 2B). 293T cells were transfected with the proinsulin cDNA and three specific insulin-immunoprecipitable bands were recovered by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (lanes 2 and 3) over and above background from cells transfected with empty vector (lane 1). Individual species were excised from the nonreducing gel. Original samples from mock-transfected or transfected cells (that had not previously been subjected to eletrophoresis) were compared under reducing conditions (lanes 6 and 7) against each of the nonreduced excised bands that were now re-run in a second, reduced, dimension. A standard of chemically purified iodinated proinsulin was run as a control under nonreduced (lane 5) or reduced (lane 11) conditions. Thus the minor bands represent isomers that co-migrate upon reduction (Fig. 2B). When exploring the fate of heterologously expressed proinsulin in 293T cells, we found that these distinct forms do not appear to be handled identically in the secretory pathway. Specifically by 4 h of chase, essentially all of the major, faster migrating proinsulin went on to be secreted (Fig. 2C), while the slower migrating species that were recovered intracellularly at 1 h were not fully recovered at the 4 h chase time, being only partially secreted (see below). Two exposures of the same gel are shown in Fig. 2D, to enhance visibility of more poorly recovered proinsulin forms. Wild-type proinsulin, as before, was recovered primarily as the well secreted native isomer and two more slowly migrating bands that are arbitrarily named isomer 1 and isomer 2, respectively. It is clear from the darker exposure that during the 2.5-h chase the native proinsulin band was secreted with high efficiency (∼90%), while the isomer 1 band was also secreted, but with ∼50% efficiency, and the isomer 2 band was secreted with still lower efficiency. The different percentages of these isoforms recovered from cells versus media and their identity under reducing conditions indicates that the isoforms differ by disulfide pairing and are not created artifactually during sample preparation for electrophoresis. Expression in islet beta cells of proinsulin lacking one of the 6 critical Cys residues (Cys-A7) is responsible for dominant-negative pathogenesis in the Akita diabetic mouse (10.Izumi T.

It was therefore of interest to examine such proinsulin mutants in relation to the electrophoretic mobility of wild-type proinsulin isomers. We began by creating point mutants in the least important and most important proinsulin disulfide bonds (Fig. 2D). It has already been reported that mutation of both A6 and A11 cysteines does not prevent formation of a band with normal gel mobility nor the ability of the protein to be secreted (13.Liu M. Ramos-Castañeda J. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20.Dai Y. Tang J.G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 1049-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the C(A11)S proinsulin mutant yielded two bands: the faster (minor) form essentially co-migrated with native proinsulin and was secreted with high efficiency, and a band running similarly to the isomer 1 band was secreted with ∼50% efficiency. This is consistent with a portion of the C(A11)S single mutant to have a simple unpaired A6-cysteine yet form the critical B7-A7 and B19-A20 disulfide bonds, resulting in a band of normal mobility and secretion behavior. By contrast, most C(A11)S mutant co-migrating with the isomer 1 band is likely to have disturbed formation of either the B7-A7 or B19-A20 disulfide bond, probably because of intramolecular attack by the unpaired A6-cysteine residue. Interestingly, expression of the C(A20)A mutant yielded only a single band: a form of the slowest mobility, nearly co-migrating with the isomer 2 band of proinsulin, unable to be secreted. It has previously been reported that the misfolding of the Akita mutant of mouse proinsulin-II, C(A7)Y, cannot be distinguished from the folding of normal mouse proinsulin-II when expressed either in pancreatic islets or in CHO cells (10.Izumi T. Yokota-Hashimoto H. Zhao S. Wang J. Halban P.A. Takeuchi T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We therefore introduced the C(A7)Y mutation into the human proinsulin cDNA and examined the recombinant product in 293T cells; a representative experiment (in duplicate) is shown in Fig. 3A. A decreased amount of the radiolabeled hAkita mutant was recovered by nonreducing Tris-Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE. Moreover, the recovered hAkita mutant was quite obviously distinct from that of wild-type proinsulin, exhibiting no band comparable with the native proinsulin species, with most of the population co-migrating with the isomer 1 band of proinsulin. Virtually none of the hAkita mutant was secreted at any chase time (data not shown), unlike the (albeit impaired) secretion of the isomer 1 band of wild-type proinsulin. En route to the manufacture of all six single Cys mutants of proinsulin, we have examined the C(B19)A point mutant, which leaves A20-cysteine unpaired. Once again, the mutant proinsulin nearly quantitatively failed to form a band comparable with the native proinsulin isomer and was not secreted. Instead, the C(B19)A proinsulin largely disappeared intracellularly after a 5-h chase in a manner that was partially inhibited by the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG115 (Fig. 3B). Such a finding suggests that at least some of the nonnative proinsulin isomers undergo disposal by ER-association degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Thus, distinct disulfide pairings lead to different fates within the secretory pathway. Proinsulin Isomers in Islet Beta Cells of Mice Deficient for PERK—Mice with knock-out of the PERK gene product develop severely decreased beta cell mass leading to overt diabetes mellitus in the fourth postnatal week (14.Zhang P.

Prior to the onset of diabetes, supranormal biosynthesis of proinsulin in the pancreatic islets has been observed (21.Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The dysregulation of proinsulin biosynthesis is probably the result of a failure of the normal PERK phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translational initiation factor eIF2alpha on residue Ser51, because homozygous mice with knock-in of eIF2α-S51A also display deficiency of pancreatic beta cells (22.Scheuner D.

We therefore chose to examine proinsulin biosynthesis from the islets of wild-type and PERK–/– mice by nonreducing tris-tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE, in relation to total protein synthesis followed by conventional Laemmli SDS-PAGE (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 in islets from wild-type mice, proinsulin synthesis was greater at a prevailing glucose concentration of 17 mm than at 5 mm, and this was accompanied by an increase in total protein synthesis. When comparing islets of PERK–/– mice to wild-type mice, proinsulin biosynthesis was increased relative to total protein synthesis, especially at high glucose. In conjunction with increased proinsulin biosynthesis was an increase in slower migrating proinsulin isomers (marked with downward arrows). These bands were distinct from mouse proinsulin conversion intermediates (standards from beta-TC3 cells shown at right). The slower migrating proinsulin isomers were significantly increased in absolute amounts but not relative amounts. In conjunction with the discovery of dominant-negative diabetes in the Akita mouse, the current results appear consistent with a view that increased abundance of misfolded proinsulin may predispose to pancreatic beta cell toxicity (18.Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. J. Ramos-Castaneda, other members of the Arvan laboratory, and Dr. A.

We analyzed the parentage of a founder population of 130 individuals of the canopy palm Iriartea deltoidea in a 24-year-old second-growth forest in lowland Costa Rica. Among 66 trees in adjacent old-growth forest, only two individuals contributed 56% of the genes in founders. Second-growth trees had lower genetic diversity and larger patches of similar genotypes than old-growth trees. Recovery of genetic diversity of populations in tropical second-growth forests may take many generations and will require continued dispersal from genetically diverse source populations."
https://openalex.org/W1993229466,"A dentary of the oldest known monotreme, the Early Cretaceous Teinolophos trusleri , has an internal mandibular trough, which in outgroups to mammals houses accessory jaw bones, and probable contact facets for angular, coronoid, and splenial bones. Certain of these accessory bones were detached from the mandible to become middle ear bones in mammals. Evidence that the angular (homologous with the mammalian ectotympanic) and the articular and prearticular (homologous with the mammalian malleus) bones retained attachment to the lower jaw in a basal monotreme indicates that the definitive mammalian middle ear evolved independently in living monotremes and therians (marsupials and placentals)."
https://openalex.org/W2075786377,"A major suspected bias in the fossil record of skeletonized groups is variation in preservability owing to differences in shell composition. However, despite extensive changes in shell composition over the 500-million-year history of marine bivalves, genus duration and shell composition show few significant relationships, and of those, virtually all are contrary to bias from preferential loss of highly reactive shell types. Distortion of large-scale temporal patterns in marine bivalves owing to preservability is thus apparently weak or randomly distributed, which increases the likelihood that observed patterns in this and other shelled groups carry a strong biological signal."

LRP and its ligands apolipoprotein E, α2-macroglobulin, and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), are genetically linked to Alzheimer disease and are found in characteristic plaque deposits in brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. To identify which extracellular domains of LRP interact with APP, we used minireceptors of each of the individual LRP ligand binding domains and assessed their ability to bind and degrade a soluble APP fragment.

Although the cause of AD dementia is unknown, it is probably related to the deposition of characteristic extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles found in the brains of patients with AD. Amyloid plaques are composed of fibrillar aggregates of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), which are derived from the processing of a ∼120-kDa transmembrane protein known as β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). APP, which exists in three main isoforms (APP695, APP751, and APP770), can follow two alternate post-translational processing pathways. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved first at a β-secretase site by the enzyme β-site APP-cleaving enzyme and subsequently by a γ-secretase within its intramembrane region to release the Aβ peptide (2Selkoe D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is processed by an α-secretase that clips within the Aβ region, resulting in the release of a soluble APP fragment (sAPPα), which may function in blood coagulation and neurite outgrowth (3Oltersdorf T. Fritz L.C. Schenk D.B. Lieberburg I. Johnson-Wood K.L. Beattie E.C. Ward P.J. Blacher R.W. Dovey H.F. Sinha S.

The APP tail has a YENPTY motif similar to tyrosine-based NPXY and YXXØ endocytic motifs (where X can be any amino acid and Ø is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic group) found in other endocytic receptors (8Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A decrease in APP endocytosis caused either by mutations within its endocytosis motif or by potassium depletion, which inhibits the formation of clathrin-coated pits, results in an accumulation of APP at the cell surface and favors the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP (5Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) interacts with APP, and its expression facilitates APP processing via the amyloidogenic pathway. Cells overexpressing APP that are transiently transfected with LRP produce higher levels of Aβ and lower levels of sAPPα than mock-transfected cells (9Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E.

Expression of the C-terminal fragment of LRP increases Aβ production and decreases the release of sAPPα, similar to the expression of full-length receptor (13Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Blocking the extracellular interaction between APP and LRP with receptor-associated protein (RAP) results in a decrease in Aβ levels and an increase in cell surface APP and sAPPα levels (9Ulery P.G.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9728-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).In this study, we found that minireceptors containing domains II and IV of LRP can bind and degrade a soluble APP fragment. Using endocytosis-deficient LRP minireceptors containing domain IV, we also found that the endocytosis rate of LRP influences the cell surface level of APP and Aβ secretion in the media. Our data establish a relationship between the rapid endocytosis rate of LRP and cellular distribution and trafficking of APP.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—The C-terminal APP antibody BC1 (recognizes amino acids 704–730) was the kind gift of Barbara Cordell (Scios). The monoclonal APP antibody 6E10 raised against residues 1–17 of Aβ was purchased from Signet. A previously described monoclonal anti-HA antibody was used for FACS analysis of LRP minireceptors (15Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). 6E10, 22C11 (RDI, Inc.), and 8E5 (gift from Kelly Bales, Lilly Research Laboratories) were used for FACS analysis of APP. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from BD Biosciences. Soluble APP770α (sAPP770α) was purified from the media of human embryonic kidney cells stably overexpressing APP770 as described previously (18Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Soluble APP695α (sAPP695α) and holotransferrin were purchased from Sigma. For ELISA assays, antibodies 266 (recognizes Aβ 13–28), 21F12 (recognizes Aβ1–42), and 2G3 (recognizes Aβ1–40) were the kind gifts of Kelly Bales (Lilly Research Laboratories). Carrier-free Na125I was purchased from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences. Proteins were iodinated using the IODO-GEN method as described previously (15Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).cDNA Construction—Generation of LRP minireceptors has been described previously (15Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The LRP minireceptors were designated as mLRP1, mLRP2, mLRP3, or mLPR4, with “m” representing “membrane-containing” and the number representing the cluster of cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats (beginning from the amino terminus). A chimeric mLRP4-APPtail minireceptor was generated by excising the cytoplasmic tail of mLRP4 plasmid and ligating a PCR fragment of the APP tail. Constructs were sequenced and their expression tested by in vitro translation using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system in vitro translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of mLRP4 endocytosis mutants has been described previously (15Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO LRP-null cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cells were selected in 700 μg/ml geneticin (and 750 μg/ml zeocin for APP770/minireceptor cell lines), and stable clones were maintained in 350 μg/ml geneticin (and 350 μg/ml zeocin for APP770/LRP minireceptor doubly transfected cell lines).Kinetic Analysis of Endocytosis—Kinetic analysis of receptor-mediated endocytosis was carried out as described previously (15Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In brief, stably transfected cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate and used after overnight culture. Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and then incubated in 0.5 ml of ice-cold ligand binding buffer (minimal Eagle's medium containing 0.6% bovine serum albumin) with 2–5 nm125I-RAP, 125I-anti-HA IgG, or 125I-1G7 anti-APP IgG. The binding of iodinated proteins was carried out at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle rocking. Unbound ligand was removed by washing cell monolayers three times with cold binding buffer. Ice-cold stop/strip solution (0.2 m acetic acid, pH 2.6, and 0.1 m NaCl or PBS, pH 2.0) was added to one set of plates without warming up and kept on ice. The remaining plates were then placed in a 37 °C water bath, and 0.5 ml of prewarmed ligand binding buffer was quickly added to the cell monolayers to initiate internalization. After each time point, the plates were placed on ice, and the ligand binding buffer was replaced with ice-cold strip/stop solution. Ligand that remained on the cell surface was stripped by incubation of cell monolayers with ice-cold stop/strip solution for a total of 10 min and counted. The sum of internalized ligand plus those on the surface after each assay was used as the maximum potential internalization. The fraction of internalized ligand at each time point was calculated and plotted. For degradation assay, cells were plated as described and incubated with 1 nm125I-sAPP770α in serum-free media for 6 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 1 μm RAP. Media was then collected and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Cells were washed and lysed for protein determination.Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Cell extracts were precleared for at least 2 h with Protein-A agarose beads and then incubated overnight with antibody at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with Protein-A agarose beads for 45 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and boiled in SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on 6% or 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk and subjected to incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. For detection of APP, 6E10 antibody was used. For detection of LRP minireceptors, membranes were probed with anti-85kD tail fragment of LRP or anti-HA antibodies. Goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were developed with ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. For quantitation of minireceptor expression in each cell line, equal amounts of protein were separated and transferred as above. After detection with ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences), blots were analyzed using the variable mode imager Typhoon 9410 (Amersham Biosciences).Flow Cytometry Measurements—For cell surface APP analysis, CHO cells were first detached by incubation with non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma). To measure total levels of APP, cells were treated with 0.1% saponin. Successive incubations with anti-APP antibody 6E10 (Signet) or 22C11 (RDI, Inc.) (50 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse Ig-fluorescein isothiocyanate were carried out at 4 °C for 1 h. As a control, background fluorescence intensity was assessed in the absence of primary antibody. All measurements were performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) equipped with an argon ion laser. Laser excitation of 488 nm for fluorescein isothiocyanate was used. Ten thousand cells from each sample were analyzed. Histograms were generated using the CellQuest software; median values, after subtraction of controls, were compared among samples.Aβ Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay of Conditioned Media— Cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The next day, cells were washed two times with serum-free media and incubated in low serum media (containing 1% fetal bovine serum). Media were collected after 24–48 h of conditioning with the addition of proteinase inhibitors and then spun at 20,200 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. Aβ in the media was analyzed by ELISA adapted from previous studies (20Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Aβ in the conditioned media was captured with antibody 2G3 or 21F12 for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, and subsequently detected with biotinylated 266 or 3D6 antibody. Endogenous Aβ values were normalized to the amount of total protein in cell lysates. Human Aβ values were normalized to the amount of APP expression determined by Western blot.Human Aβ Clearance—Conditioned media from primary neurons derived from PDAPP mice were used as source of human Aβ. PDAPP mice overexpress mutated human APPV717F under the platelet-derived growth factor promoter (21Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. Nature. 1995; 373: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Diluted media were added to CHO-pcDNA3 and CHO-mLRP4 cells (∼500 pg of total Aβ), or blank wells without cells. After 24 h, media were collected with the addition of proteinase inhibitors and then spun at 20,200 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. Human Aβ remaining in the conditioned media was analyzed by ELISA using capturing antibody 2G3 for Aβ40 or 21F12 for Aβ42, and subsequent detection with biotinylated 3D6 antibody, specific for human Aβ. Remaining Aβ in the media incubated with cells was subtracted from the amount of Aβ present in the media from empty wells and normalized to the amount of total protein in cell lysates. Values were normalized to that of CHO-pcDNA3 cells.RESULTSTo determine which extracellular domains of LRP are important for an interaction with APP, we assessed the degradation of a soluble purified APP770 fragment (sAPP770α) by cells expressing minireceptors of LRP containing each individual ligand-binding domain (CHO-mLRP1, mLRP2, mLRP3, or mLRP4) (22Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Li Y. Osaka H. FitzGerald D.J. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine receptor-specific degradation, 125I-sAPP770α degradation was assessed in the absence or presence of excess amounts of the LRP antagonist RAP. RAP binds to domains II, III, and IV of LRP with high affinity (23Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We found that 125I-sAPP770α was specifically degraded by CHO-mLRP2 and CHO-mLRP4 cells but not CHO-mLRP1 or CHO-mLRP3 cells (Fig. 1A). We detected similar levels of the 85-kDa subunit of the mature minireceptors among these cell lines (Fig. 1B) suggesting that the differences in the ability to degrade 125I-sAPP770α were not caused by differences in the expression levels of these minireceptors. In addition, mLRP2 and mLRP4, two LRP domain minireceptors that degraded 125I-sAPP770α, exhibited similar rates of endocytosis (Fig. 1C). None of the cell lines tested significantly degraded 125I-sAPP695α, which lacks a KPI domain (data not shown). These findings are in agreement with previous reports that full-length LRP degrades only KPI-containing sAPPα (18Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). These results also suggest that an extracellular interaction between LRP and APP is mediated through the second and fourth ligand-binding domains of LRP and the KPI domain of APP.We hypothesize that LRP, with its fast rate of endocytosis, influences the trafficking of APP through the endocytic pathway. To directly compare the endocytosis rates of LRP and APP, we generated a stable CHO cell line expressing a chimeric receptor containing the fourth ligand binding domain and transmembrane region of LRP and the APP tail (mLRP4-APPtail) (Fig. 2A). The APP tail has a YENP tetrapeptide that is important for its endocytosis and can mediate endocytosis when fused to the human transferrin receptor (7Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B.

Using 125I-RAP to measure the endocytosis of the mLRP4-APPtail chimeric receptor compared with the wild-type LRP minireceptor (mLRP4), we found mLRP4-APPtail had a much slower rate of endocytosis (∼10%/min) than mLRP4 (>70%/min) (Fig. 2B). These results support our hypothesis that LRP endocytosis could facilitate APP internalization and processing to the amyloidogenic pathway.Fig. 2The APP cytoplasmic domain confers a slower endocytosis rate to mLRP4 than the LRP cytoplasmic domain.A, schematic of mLRP4 and mLRP4-APPtail receptors. mLRP4 contains the fourth ligand binding domain of LRP, transmembrane region, and 100 amino acid tail of LRP. mLRP4-APPtail contains the extracellular and transmembrane regions of mLRP4 and the cytoplasmic domain of APP. ▪, mLRP4; □, APP; TM, transmembrane domain.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4259-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we tested whether endogenous APP within CHO LRP-null cells could interact with overexpressed LRP domain IV minireceptors. In a previous study from our laboratory, mLRP4 minireceptors containing site-directed mutations within putative cytoplasmic endocytosis motifs were generated and stably transfected into CHO LRP-null cells (15Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Minireceptors bearing mutations within the YXXL motif (Y63A and L66A) and distal di-leucine repeat (L86A/L87A) (Fig. 3A) have a reduced rate of endocytosis compared with wild-type minireceptor (15Li Y.

To determine whether an extracellular interaction could occur between the minireceptors and endogenous APP, we first examined whether CHO cell APP is KPI-containing APP similar to APP751 or non KPI-containing APP similar to APP695. Lysates from cells transiently transfected with hAPP751 or hAPP695 were compared with CHO LRP-null lysates. Immunoblot of lysates for APP revealed that CHO LRP-null cells contained an APP immunoreactive band that migrated at the same molecular size as APP751 and was larger than the molecular size of APP695, suggesting that endogenous CHO cell APP was primarily KPI-containing APP (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Endogenous KPI-containing APP co-immunoprecipitates with LRP minireceptors.A, schematic representation of mLRP4 and mLRP4 endocytosis mutants. Underlined amino acids are important for rapid endocytosis of LRP. The introduced amino acid substitutions are shown in bold.

C, lysates from CHO LRP-null cells stably transfected with pcDNA3, mLRP4, mLRP4Tailess, or mLRP4(Y63A, L86A/L87A) were immunoprecipitated with anti-APP antibody (6E10) and probed with anti-APP antibody to detect endogenous APP (top) or anti-HA antibody to detect LRP minireceptors (bottom). The precursor form of the minireceptors is marked with solid arrowhead, whereas the furin-processed form is marked with open arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we determined whether endogenous APP could interact with mLRP4 and its endocytosis mutants by co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoblot of APP immunoprecipitates with anti-HA antibody revealed immunoreactive bands that migrate at the same molecular sizes as the furin-cleaved processed form (∼120 kDa) and the unprocessed form (∼210 kDa) of LRP minireceptors (Fig. 3C). No anti-APP or anti-HA signals were detected in lysates immunoprecipitated with control IgG antibody (data not shown). We also detected an interaction between APP and mLRP4Tailess. Because the major form of APP in CHO cells contained the KPI domain that can bridge an extracellular interaction with LRP, it is probably that the association between LRP minireceptors and APP are predominantly extracellular and independent of cytoplasmic interactions.After confirming an interaction between endogenous APP and the LRP minireceptors, we tested whether the rate of LRP endocytosis could influence the trafficking of APP by comparing cell surface APP between cells expressing mLRP4 and mLRP4 endocytosis mutants by FACS analysis. We detected significantly less cell surface APP in CHO-mLRP4 cells compared with CHO-pcDNA3 cells (Fig. 4A). In support of our hypothesis, cells expressing endocytosis mutants of mLRP4, mLRP4(Y63A), mLRP4(L66A), mLRP4(Y63A, L86A/L87A), and mLRP4Tailess exhibited ≥3-fold more cell surface APP compared with CHO-mLRP4 wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). To confirm that the effect of LRP overexpression on APP distribution was specific to APP, we assessed for changes in the amount of another cell surface receptor, the transferrin receptor, within these cell lines. The amount of bound iodinated transferrin to the transferrin receptor did not change because of LRP minireceptor expression, indicating that alterations in the cell surface distribution of APP were specific to an interaction between APP and LRP minireceptors (data not shown). To determine whether LRP minireceptor expression mediated changes in the total cellular level of APP, we measured total levels of APP in CHO stable cell lines by treatment with saponin (a detergent) to permeabilize cell membranes, followed by FACS analysis of APP, and by quantitative Western blotting for APP. We found that expression of mLRP4 or its endocytosis mutants did not alter total cellular APP. By both FACS analysis (Fig. 4C, top) and immunoblot"

Widely used for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic heart disease, the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins may exert anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the impact of inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase with simvastatin on the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in embryonic cardiac myoblasts stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor. Treatment with simvastatin significantly reduced the levels of iNOS mRNA and protein in cytokine-treated rat H9c2 cardiac embryonic myoblasts. Addition of the HMG-CoA reductase product, l-mevalonate, and the by-product of cholesterol synthesis, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, could reverse the statin inhibitory effect on iNOS expression. Simvastatin treatment lowered the Rho GTPase activities, whereas the Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y27632 partially blocked the statin inhibitory effect on nitrite production in the cytokine-treated H9c2 cells. Treatment with simvastatin led to inactivation of NF-κB by elevation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB and reduction of the NF-κB nuclear contents in the cytokine-stimulated H9c2 cells. Hence, treatment with simvastatin can attenuate iNOS expression and NO synthesis in cytokine-stimulated embryonic cardiac myoblasts. The statin inhibitory effect may occur through isoprenoid-mediated intracellular signal transduction, which involves several key signal proteins, such as Rho kinase and IκB/NF-κB.

These data suggest that statin therapy may protect the cardiac myocyte progenitors against the cytotoxicity of cytokine-induced high output of NO production in infarcted or ischemic hearts with inflammation. Transplantation or mobilization of stem cells with growth factors has been emerging as a potentially novel therapy for regenerative medicine. However, one of the major challenges to successful stem cell therapy is the difficulty of stem cell survival and differentiation in the harsh microenvironment of diseased tissues or organs, such as infarcted or ischemic hearts with inflammation (1.Geng Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (NO), 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A; IκB, inhibitor κB; IL-1, interleukin-1; iNOS, inducible NOS; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; eNOS, endothelial NOS; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. a gaseous signaling molecule, plays an important role in the regulation of myocardial metabolism and function (2.Massion P.B. Feron O. Dessy C. Balligand J.L. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Through NO synthases (NOS), cardiovascular cells can transiently synthesize increased levels of NO which, in turn, regulate the heart contractility (3.Kim S.J. Kim Y.K. Takagi G. Huang C.H. Geng Y.J. Vatner S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H423-H428PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to NO at high levels may cause dysfunction of mitochondria (4.Geng Y.-J. Hansson G.K. Holme E. Circ.

Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), can induce expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) that generates large quantities of NO, resulting in cardiac cell degeneration and apoptosis (7.Birks E.J. Yacoub M.H. Burton P.S. Owen V. Pomerance A. O'Halloran A. Banner N.R. Khaghani A. Latif N. Transplantation. 2000; 70: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8.Birks E.J. Yacoub M.H. Coron. Artery Dis. 1997; 8: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cytokine-induced expression of iNOS can occur in both ischemic and nonischemic heart failure, septic cardiomyopathy, cardiac allograft rejection, and myocarditis. Suppression of the cytokine-inducible, NO-synthesizing enzyme may reduce generation of cytotoxic reactive nitrogen radicals, leading to increased survival of grafted or preexisting stem cells in the diseased hearts with inflammation. 3-Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase acts as the rate-limiting enzyme for endogenous cholesterol synthesis. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins or vastatins, are widely used cholesterol-lowering medicines for both primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Statins can effectively diminish endogenous cholesterol synthesis and reduce the plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia (9.Gotto Jr., A.M. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 87: 13B-18BAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10.Gotto Jr., A.M. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 36F-40FAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that by blocking the mevalonate pathway, statins exert pleiotropic effects on vascular cell function which may not be related directly to cholesterol synthesis (11.Laufs U.

Itter G. Rosen R. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates the involvement of the intermediates or by-products, e.g. isoprenoids, from the mevalonate-cholesterol synthesis pathway in the regulation of intracellular signal transduction and activation of transcriptional factors critical for inflammatory proteins and iNOS gene expression in heart failure (13.von Haehling S. Anker S.D. Bassenge E. Heart Fail. Rev. 2003; 8: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, there are controversial reports on the statin regulation of iNOS expression in different cell types. For instance, Pahan et al. (14.Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 15.Pahan K. Liu X. McKinney M.J. Wood C. Sheikh F.G. Raymond J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2288-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) showed that lovastatin inhibits iNOS and cytokine expression in rat macrophages, astrocytes, and microglia by reducing Ras farnesylation and inactivating NF-κB. By contrast, Hattori et al. (16.Hattori Y. Nakanishi N. Kasai K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reported that statins augment cytokine-mediated induction of NO synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells through altering the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, a key cofactor for iNOS, with little influence on NF-κB activities. Recent work has shown that statin treatment may confer cardioprotection in the isolated perfused hearts during ischemia-reperfusion, which is in part the result of a reduction in myocyte apoptosis (17.Di Napoli P. Antonio Taccardi A. Grilli A. Spina R. Felaco M. Barsotti A. De Caterina R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the statin protective effect is unknown. Because stem cells participate in postischemic heart repair, it is of great interest to determine whether statin treatment inhibits cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in premature, undifferentiated cardiac myoblasts. In this study, we employed an in vitro system to determine whether inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by simvastatin alters expression of iNOS in embryonic, undifferentiated cardiac myoblasts exposed to proinflammatory cytokines. Our data showed that simvastatin treatment significantly reduced expression of iNOS in cardiac myoblasts stimulated with cytokines. The statin inhibitory effect might occur through a mechanism in which isoprenoids, an intermediate or similar byproducts from cholesterol synthesis, regulate activation of several key intracellular signaling proteins, such as Rho A kinase and NF-κB. Taken together, our data strongly support the notion that statins have regulatory effects on iNOS expression by undifferentiated myoblasts during the development of cardiac failure and inflammation. Materials—All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Human recombinant IL-1α and TNF-α were from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis). l-Mevalonate was obtained from Sigma. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) were from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth, PA). Rho inhibitor Y27632 was from Calbiochem. Simvastatin obtained from Merck Sharp and Dohme was activated to its active form by alkaline hydrolysis before use. Briefly, 4 mg of simvastatin prodrug was dissolved in an 8-ml solution of 0.1 n NaOH and 0.154 mol/liter NaCl and then incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. The pH was brought to 7.0 by HCl. The final concentration of the stock solution was adjusted to 4 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C. Cell Cultures—H9c2 cells purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) are spontaneously immortalized ventricular myoblasts from the rat embryo, with preservation of several electrical and biochemical characteristics found in adult cardiomyocytes. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum under 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. At subconfluence (70–80%), H9c2 myoblasts cultured in Petri dishes or 24-well plates were preexposed to simvastatin and then stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and TNF-α, in the presence or absence of isoprenoids, the intermediates or by-product from cholesterol synthesis. After certain time intervals, 100 μl/well culture medium was collected for determination of nitrite production. Assay for NO Production—The activity of iNOS was determined in the culture medium by assaying nitrites, taken as an index of NO production, using Griess reagent (1% sulfanilic acid and 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine HCl in 5% phosphoric acid) as reported previously (4.Geng Y.-J. Hansson G.K. Holme E. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1268-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18.Geng Y.J. Petersson A.S. Wennmalm A. Hansson G.K. Exp.

Biol. 1996; 16: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of medium and Griess reagent were mixed, and the purple products were quantified spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. Nitrite concentrations were determined from a linear standard curve constructed with known concentrations of sodium nitrite (0–40 μmol/liter nitrite). Immunoblotting—Total proteins were isolated from H9c2 cells in an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, and 1× protease inhibitor (1 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate). Proteins (15 μg/lane) were separated under reducing conditions (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol) by electrophoresis onto 5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics, Westborough, MA). The membranes were reversibly stained with Ponceau red (Sigma) to verify equal protein loading and/or transfer. After blocking in Tris-buffered saline (0.2 m Tris and 8% NaCl) containing 5% nonfat powdered milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies to 1) iNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); 2) NF-κB p65/Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); 3) Ser32-phosphorylated inhibitor IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, washed, and developed using a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Pierce). The intensity of each immunoreactive protein band was quantified by densitometric analysis. Cytokine-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (Transduction Laboratories) were used as positive controls. RNA Isolation and Reverse transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated by a single extraction using an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method with modification as reported elsewhere (17.Di Napoli P. Antonio Taccardi A. Grilli A. Spina R. Felaco M. Barsotti A. De Caterina R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative multiplex reverse transcription-PCR was performed with a set of specific primers for iNOS. As the housekeeping controls, the 18 S rRNA was also analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR products were visualized and quantified using a computerized densitometric system (Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000, Milan, Italy). Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay—Nuclear proteins were extracted from stimulated or unstimulated H9c2 cells. Cells were harvested and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax T25-tissue homogenizer (Janke and Kunkel) in a low salt solution (0.6% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged for 30 s at 2,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated for 5 min on ice and then centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 rpm. The nuclei were resuspended in a high salt solution (25% glycerol; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 420 mm NaCl; 1.2 mm MgCl2; 0.2 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2 mm benzamidine; 5 g/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Laboratories Protein Assay. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide NF-κB motif (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ and 5′-CCT GGG AAA GTC CCC TCA ACT-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions containing 10 μg of crude nuclear extract were performed using the electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay core system (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For supershift experiments, 1–2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-NF-κB antibody was added into the reaction. Rho Kinase Assay—Cell pellets were homogenized in the lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After the cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were collected for assessing Rho kinase activities using the Rho kinase assay kit (Cyclex MBL International Corporation, Woburn, MA). In brief, the supernatants of lysed cells were measured for protein concentrations and justified to the same protein concentration and then added (10 μl/well) into 96-well plates precoated with a substrate corresponding to the C terminus of the recombinant myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphate (MSB), which contains a threonine residue that may be phosphorylated by Rho kinase. Subsequently, 90 μl of kinase reaction buffer (containing 0.1 mm ATP diluted in kinase buffer)/well was added to the kinase reaction, incubated for 60 min at room temperature, washed five times in washing buffer provided in the kit, and incubated with 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-phospho-specific MSB antibody, which specifically detects only the phosphorylated form of threonine 697 on MSB (provided in the kit). The colored products were developed by incubating with 100 μl of the horseradish peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of stop solution containing 0.5 m H2SO4, The colored products were quantified by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. All samples were assayed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated three times. Purified Rho kinase was used as a positive control, and cell lysates from the cultures treated with the Y27632 were the negative controls. Statistical Analysis—Two-group comparisons were performed by Student's t test for unpaired values. Comparisons of means of multiple groups were performed by analysis of variance, and the existence of individual differences, in case of significant F values at analysis of variance, were tested by Scheffé's multiple contrasts. Simvastatin Inhibits iNOS Expression and Nitrite Production in Cardiac Myoblasts Induced by Proinflammatory Cytokines—Exposure to 20 ng/ml IL-1α or 20 ng/ml TNF-α significantly increased the levels of iNOS mRNA in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts (Fig. 1) compared with those in normal, untreated H9c2 cells. To determine whether statins affect iNOS expression in embryonic cardiac cells, we added simvastatin into the cell cultures simultaneously with the cytokines. We observed that in a concentration-dependent fashion, simvastatin markedly diminished expression of iNOS mRNA in H9c2 cells stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 1). Under the same concentrations, both IL-1α- and TNF-α-stimulated cells showed a similar response to simvastatin in terms of iNOS mRNA expression. In the presence of simvastatin, IL-1α-treated cells showed a dose-dependent decline in iNOS mRNA to the same or similar degrees as that in TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 1). Thus, simvastatin reduced steady-state levels of iNOS mRNA in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokines. Further analysis of iNOS protein expression by immunoblotting with antibodies against iNOS confirmed the presence of high levels of iNOS expression in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts stimulated with IL-1 α and TNF-α. Intense protein bands immunoreactive to anti-iNOS antibody corresponding to a molecular mass of 130 kDa were detected in the cytokine-stimulated H9c2 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). At the same concentrations, both of the proinflammatory cytokines exerted stimulatory effects on iNOS protein expression in the cells. Interestingly, consistent with its effect on iNOS mRNA expression, simvastatin (10–8 to 10–5 mol/liter) reduced expression of iNOS protein in H9c2 cells stimulated with IL-1α (Fig. 2, A and C) as well as TNF-α (Fig. 2, B and D). Thus, treatment with simvastatin inhibited expression of both iNOS mRNA and protein in cardiac myoblasts induced by proinflammatory cytokines. To verify the statin inhibitory effect on iNOS gene expression, we examined the accumulation of nitrite, a stable NO end product reflecting the NOS activities, in the cultures treated with or without IL-1α and simvastatin. Under the base-line condition without cytokine stimulation, H9c2 cells generated nitrite at the rates of ∼0.8 μmol/105 cells/24 h (Fig. 3). Stimulation with 20 ng/ml IL-1α increased nitrite production markedly. The rates of nitrite production were more than 3.5 μmol/105 cells/24 h in the cytokine-stimulated cells for the period of incubation from 24 to 48 h (p < 0.05). Simvastatin (up to 10–6 mol/liter) significantly diminished cytokine-induced nitrite production in H9c2 cells (Fig. 3). The range of simvastatin concentrations leading to inhibition of nitrite production in cytokine-stimulated cells is comparable with the plasma levels of the drug in patients treated (20.Desager J.P. Horsmans Y. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1996; 31: 348-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, at the pharmacological doses, simvastatin markedly reduced production of nitrite by H9c2 cells stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokines.Fig. 3Time course of nitrite production in cardiac myoblasts treated with IL-1α alone or in combination with simvastatin or l-mevalonate. The logarithmic regression curves show the time-dependent nitrite production in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts exposed to 20 ng/ml IL-1α in the presence (closed squares) and absence (closed diamonds) of 10–6 mol/liter simvastatin, or pretreated with simvastatin in combination with 10–4 mol/liter l-mevalonate (closed triangles) for 30 min prior to the addition of IL-1α.

To determine whether the statin inhibition of iNOS gene expression occurred through blocking the HMG-CoA reductase activity or reduction in l-mevalonate synthesis, we added exogenous l-mevalonate into the cultures of H9c2 cells with 20 ng/ml IL-1α in the presence or absence of 10–6 mol/liter simvastatin. We observed that the addition of l-mevalonate in excess amounts significantly increased the nitrite concentrations in the cultures of H9c2 cells exposed to a combination of IL-1α and simvastatin (Fig. 3). Examination of iNOS protein by immunoblotting revealed that l-mevalonate diminished the inhibitory effect of simvastatin by increasing iNOS protein expression in H9c2 cells treated with simvastatin plus IL-1α (Fig. 4, A and C) or TNF-α (Fig. 4, B and D). In the absence of simvastatin, l-mevalonate had no or little effect on cytokine-induced iNOS expression in H9c2 cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that l-mevalonate selectively blocked the simvastatin inhibitory effect on cytokine induction of iNOS in cardiac myoblasts. Because there was no major difference in induction of iNOS expression between IL-1α- and TNF-α-treated cells, the following experiments with simvastatin were performed mainly on the cells stimulated with IL-1α. The Isoprenoid Intermediate GGPP, but Not FPP, Blocks the Simvastatin Inhibitory Effect on iNOS Expression—In addition to l-mevalonate, several downstream intermediates or by-products from the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (21.Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar) may contribute to the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on expression of iNOS protein and activities. To exhaust the endogenous intermediates and by-products from cholesterol synthesis, we pretreated H9c2 cells with 10–8 to 10–7 mol/liter simvastatin up to 24 h and then stimulated the cells with 20 ng/ml IL-1α in the presence or absence of the isoprenoid intermediates, such as GGPP and FPP. Immunoblotting showed that the addition of 10–7 to 10–5 mol/liter GGPP reversed the simvastatin-mediated suppression of the cytokine-induced expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 5, A and B) and nitrite production (Fig. 5C) at almost the same levels as those in the l-mevalonate-treated cells. In contrast, however, treatment with FPP at the same concentrations as GGPP did not alter nitrite accumulation in the cells pretreated with simvastatin and then IL-1α (Fig. 5C). These results suggested that GGPP but not FPP can reverse the statin-induced inhibition of iNOS expression in the cardiac myoblasts stimulated with IL-1α. Rho Kinase Contributes to the Statin Inhibitory Effect on iNOS Expression in Cardiac Myoblasts Treated with IL-1a— The Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins consists of three subfamilies, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, which play important roles in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (22.Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 23.Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The intermediate derivative of l-mevalonate, GGPP, acts as a lipid attachment to the Rho proteins, whereas FPP mainly targets Ras. Therefore, we investigated whether Rho kinase mediates the simvastatin effect on iNOS expression. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (24.Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar) specifically inactivates p160ROCK, a key subunit of this kinase, known to regulate NO synthesis (11.Laufs U. Kilter H. Konkol C. Wassmann S. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We tested whether Y27632 could mimic the regulatory effect of simvastatin on iNOS expression in IL-1-treated H9c2 cells. We observed that inhibition of Rho kinase with Y27632 (10–6 to 10–5 mol/liter) did not alter cytokine-induced iNOS protein expression in H9c2 cells (Fig. 6A). However, addition of the Rho kinase inhibitor into the cell cultures almost abolished the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on iNOS protein expression (Fig. 6A) as well as nitrite production (Fig. 6B). The reversal of the statin-induced reduction in iNOS expression by Y27632 occurred to the same extent as seen in the cells treated with l-mevalonate (Fig. 6B). To elucidate further that Rho kinase A participates in the statin suppression of iNOS expression, we examined the Rho kinase A bioactivities in H9c2 cells treated with both IL-1α and simvastatin with purified Rho kinase as the positive controls and the Y27632-treated cell lysates as the negative controls. We found that simvastatin dose-dependently reduced the Rho kinase activities (Fig. 6C). Thus, the statin-mediated Rho kinase inactivation was concurrent with down-regulation of iNOS expression, albeit in a fashion that was opposite that in Y27632-treated cells. Simvastatin Inactivates NF-κB through Elevation of Intracellular IκB in Cardiac Myoblasts Stimulated with Cytokines— The nuclear transcription factor NF-κB binds to the iNOS gene promoter critical for iNOS gene transcription (25.Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of simvastatin on IL-1α-induced activation of NF-κB in H9c2 cells by using the gel shift assay with a 32P end-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide. The nuclear proteins extracted from serum-starved H9c2 cells showed a stronger NF-κB activity after stimulation by IL-1α for 15 min (Fig. 7A). The specificity of the NF-κB·DNA protein complex formation was verified by competition with unlabeled, cold oligonucleotides and by the addition of anti-NF-κB antibody which super-shifted the bands of NF-κB·DNA complexes (Fig. 7A). In addition, there was no significant binding with the oligonucleotide probe alone or by omitting protein substrate or using the nuclear protein extract from the unstimulated H9c2 cells. In the subsequent experiments, we treated the cells with 1 μm simvastatin before IL-1α stimulation. We found a time-dependent decline in NF-κB·DNA binding (Fig. 7A, lanes 7–10). Simvastatin treatment for 24 h markedly inhibited IL-1α-induced activation of NF-κB (Fig. 7A, lane 11) (p < 0.001 versus IL-1α-stimulated cells). Inclusion of antibody directed against NF-κB in the binding reactions resulted in a further reduction in the IL-1α-induced mobility of the complex (Fig. 7A, lane 12). The reduction in the nuclear NF-κB activity did not appear to be caused by overall inhibition of expression of this transcription factor by the statin because immunoblotting analysis of total cellular NF-κB levels showed no significant difference between simvastatin-treated or untreated cells with cytokine stimulation (Fig. 7, B and C). We further delineated the potential mechanism underlying the simvastatin inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation by performing immunoblotting analysis on the same nuclear protein extracts from IL-1α-stimulated H9c2 cells with an antibody specific for the p65 subunit of NF-κB. We observed a time-dependent decrease in the p65 NF-κB protein nuclear translocation with pretreatment with simvastatin (Fig. 7, D and F). The statin-suppressed NF-κB nuclear translocation was clearly related to the HMG-CoA reductase activity"

Such eyebrow-raising features of time in quantum mechanics have been labeled “the fallacy of delayed choice and quantum eraser” on the one hand and described “as one of the most intriguing effects in quantum mechanics” on the other. In the present paper, we discuss how the availability or erasure of information generated in the past can affect how we interpret data in the present. The quantum eraser concept has been studied and extended in many different experiments and scenarios, for example, the entanglement quantum eraser, the kaon quantum eraser, and the use of quantum eraser entanglement to improve microscopic resolution."

The specific radioactivity of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin in the extracellular medium of lactacystin-treated islets (0.52 ± 0.16 cpm/microunits) was 2-fold greater relative to control islets (0.25 ± 0.06 cpm/microunits).

Over two decades ago it was hypothesized that a significant proportion of newly synthesized proteins do not attain their native structure owing to errors in translation or defects in post-translational protein folding (1Wheatley D.N. Grisola S. Hernandaz-Yago J. J. Theor. Biol. 1982; 98: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by Schubert et al. (2Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C.

Protein quality control and clearance mechanisms, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, are especially important in pancreatic β-cells, whose function is to synthesize and secrete biologically active insulin. Indeed, the relevance of ER quality control to diabetes has been revealed by two diabetic mouse models (6Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In inbred C57BL/6-Ins2Akita mice, an autosomal dominant missense mutation of the Ins2 gene leads to blockage of proinsulin transport from the ER to the Golgi, β-cell dysfunction, and diabetes (9Yoshioka M. Kayo T. Ikeda T. Koizumi A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Takeuchi T. Tanaka S. Kumbo S-K. Kayo T. Lu D. Takata K. Koizumi A. Izumi T. J. Clin.

In addition, a close correlation was observed between the effects of aging on the loss of β-cell mass and the development of hyperglycemia in the Perk–/– mouse, which lacks the protein kinase, PERK (PKR-like ER kinase, also known as PEK; formally eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 3), whose function links protein folding and polypeptide translation (11Harding H.P.

Despite the apparent relevance of protein quality control to diabetes, the role of the proteasome in insulin turnover or any other vital β-cell function has received limited attention (14Baldeon M.E.

Experimental data and a working model are presented to account for the observed alterations in intracellular (pro)insulin turnover and secretion in proteasome-inhibited β-cells. Mouse Islet Isolation and Cell Culture—Mouse islets were isolated from female (phenotypically normal) B6EiC3Sn a/A-Otcspf-ash/J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) at 6–8 weeks of age using a collagenase inflation method (16Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Pancreatic inflations were performed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (unless otherwise specified, cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen) containing 1.6 mg/ml Collagenase P (Roche Applied Science), 4 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma), 9.2 mmol/liter HEPES, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Islets were purified by centrifugation with a Histopaque gradient (17Ablamunits V. Elias D. Cohen I.R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 115: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hand-picked islets were placed in Costar ultralow attachment polystyrene cluster plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY). MIN6 cells were established from β-cell adenomas derived from transgenic mice harboring a hybrid rat insulin promoter-simian virus 40 large T-antigen gene construct (18Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were maintained in 25 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Eagle's minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid supplement, 44 mm sodium bicarbonate, 15 mm HEPES, 10,000 units/ml penicillin plus 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin, 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 250 μl/ml Fungizone (containing 250 μg/ml amphotericin B and 250 μg/ml sodium deoxycholate). MIN6 cells and islets were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Experiments were performed when cells were ∼70% confluent (passages 20–30) and after islets were precultured for 2 days in 5.6 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Measurement of Proteasome Activity and Inhibition—Proteasome activity was inhibited by lactacystin (purchased from E. J. Corey, Harvard University, Boston, MA). Cells were treated with lactacystin for the times indicated at a final concentration of 10 μm. Lactacystin treatment medium was made prior to usage to minimize activity loss (19Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Reichard G.A. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Untreated control cells underwent routine media change similar to the lactacystin-treated cultures. Chymotryptic activity of the proteasome was assessed in cell lysates using the synthetic peptide substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr linked to the fluorometric reporter AMC (20Meiners S. Heyken D. Weller A. Ludwig A. Stangl K. Kloetzel P-M. Krüger E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21517-21525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Mouse islets (50/well) were treated with lactacystin (10 μm) for 1 or 4 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed under hypoosmotic conditions by repeated freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen. After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), lysates were used for determination of protein concentrations and enzymatic activities. The lysates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in incubation buffer containing an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 18 mm KCl, 3 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 3 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 0.2 unit of phosphocreatine kinase) and 0.2 mm Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC. The cleavage of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC and release of fluorogenic AMC was measured (360/460 nm) every 1 min for a 60-min period in 96-well plates using a SpectraMax Gemini microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Measurements were analyzed with SOFTmax Pro version 4.3, Life Sciences Edition (Molecular Devices). Metabolic Labeling Procedure—Two pulse-chase labeling designs were used to assess the effects of lactacystin on glucose-stimulated (pro)insulin synthesis and secretion. To determine the effects of lactacystin on glucose-stimulated (pro)insulin synthesis, islets were pre-treated in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (10 μm) in glucose (5.6 or 20 mm) for 2 h (Fig. 1A). (Pro)insulin synthesis was determined by the incorporation of [3H]tyrosine into (pro)insulin during the labeling period. For labeling, islets or MIN6 cells were incubated in Kreb's Ringers bicarbonate buffer, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (KRB-BSA) for 20 min, collected by gentle centrifugation (40 × g), and incubated in 5.6 or 20 mm glucose KRB-BSA containing [3H]tyrosine at 40 μCi/well (1 mCi = 37kBq) (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min. After labeling, cells were washed and (pro)insulin synthesis was determined. To follow the fate of newly synthesized (pro)insulin, cells were first labeled (as described above) and then chased in 5.6 or 20 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of lactacystin (10 μm) for up to 4 h (Fig. 1B). Islets were washed three times in KRB-BSA, transferred to glycine-BSA buffer (0.2 m glycine-2.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 8.8), and sonicated. The sonicates were then centrifuged (16,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants or cultured media were stored at –20 °C until further analysis. (Pro)insulin Measurements—Total (pro)insulin (microunits/μg DNA) was measured by double antibody radioimmunoassay using an assay validated in our laboratory following a protocol described previously (21Moran C.

Thus, the relative concentrations of proinsulin and insulin were not determined in the experimental samples and, hence, the term (pro)insulin is used throughout. Rat insulin was used as a standard. Standards, antibodies, and 125I-labeled insulin were obtained from Linco Research, St. Louis, MO. The inter- and intraassay coefficients of variation were 9 and 3%, respectively. Immunoprecipitable [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin (cpm/μg DNA) was measured as described previously (22Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Blondel B. Renold A.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2625-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μl of the sonicate or cultured medium (maximum immunoreactive (pro)insulin content 50 ng) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of excess guinea pig anti-rat (pro)insulin antibody (Sigma), total binding capacity 300–400 ng of (pro)insulin (22Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Blondel B. Renold A.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2625-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

After incubation, 5 mg of Protein A-Sepharose was added in 100 μl of glycine-BSA buffer to the samples. Samples were mixed for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitate complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 1 min and washed in phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess debris. Pellets were dissolved in 0.4 ml of 1.5 m acetic acid, 2.5 mg/ml BSA and transferred to liquid scintillation vials. Radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter using 6 ml of Aquasol-2 (universal LSC mixture; Packard, Meriden, CT). Using the above method, [3H]tyrosine-labeled immunoprecipitable (pro)insulin was quantitatively precipitated and recovered (22Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Blondel B. Renold A.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2625-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6003-6006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Halban P.A. Renold A.E. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cellular DNA Quantification and Toxicity Assay—Total DNA concentrations from crude cell homogenates were determined by fluorometry using bisbenzimidazole (Hoechst 33258; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (25Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). A lactate dehydrogenase-based In Vitro Toxicology Assay kit (Sigma) was used to monitor lactacystin toxicity. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Primary antibodies were mouse monoclonal anti-insulin IgG1 (Sigma), polyclonal anti-FK2 clone (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), and rabbit anti-GRP78/BiP (StressGen, Victoria, Canada). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates (Sigma). MIN6 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/chamber in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Cells were preincubated in 25 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ± lactacystin (10 μm) for 4 h. Cells were washed in PBS containing Ca2+ and then fixed for 30 min at room temperature in fresh 3.7% formaldehyde. After fixation, cells were rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS, and blocked and permeabilized in incubation buffer (0.1% saponin, 1 mm EGTA, 4% goat serum) for 30 min on a gyrating platform. Cells were incubated consecutively with primary and secondary antibodies each for 1 h at room temperature on a gyrating platform. Cells were rinsed fives times between and after antibody incubations and mounted with cover glass slides (No. 1, 24 × 50 mm; Corning) in glycerol-based SlowFade Light Anti-fade (Molecular Probes). Samples were viewed using an Olympus Fluoview confocal system with Melles Griot Argon (488 nm), Krypton (568 nm), and HeNe (633 nm) lasers with an Olympus BX50 microscope. Negligible staining was detected for each secondary antibody alone (negative controls). Western Blot Analysis—MIN6 cells were treated in triplicate ± lactacystin (10 μm, 4 h) or tunicamycin (10 μg/ml, 4 h). Equal protein concentrations (15 μg) were size separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for polyubiquitinated proteins and GRP78/BiP. Blots were probed with a polyclonal anti-FK2 clone (MBL), rabbit anti-GRP78/BiP (StressGen), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. Bands were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were scanned by optical densitometry to quantify the relative level of protein expression between treatments. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) from MIN6 cells treated similarly as for Western blot analysis. After quantification by spectrophotometry, equal quantities of RNA/treatment were reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl containing 1000 ng of RNA, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm dNTP, 1.25 μl of RNAsin, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μl of 5 × RT-PCR Buffer, 1.25 μl of random hexamers, and 0.75 μl of MultiScribe™ reverse transcriptase from a GeneAmp® Gold RNA PCR Core kit (Applied Biosystems)). The reaction cycle consisted of a 10-min incubation at 25 °C followed by a 20-min incubation at 42 °C, after which the cDNA was stored at 4 °C. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)—Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed in a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl containing SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 μl of (each) primer, and 5 μl of cDNA template. The primers used to detect 18 S RNA (137 bp) were forward-(5′-CATTCGAACGTCTGCCCTATC-3′) and reverse-(5′-CCTGCTGCCTTCCTTGGA-3′); CHOP/GADD153 (397 bp) were forward-(5′-CACATCCCAAAGCCCTCG-3′) and reverse-(5′-CTCAGTCCCCTCCTCAGC-3′); GAPDH (225 bp), forward-(5′-GGAAGCTTGTCATCAAC-3′) and reverse-(5′-GGTGTGAACCACGAGAAAT-3′); GRP78/BiP (398 bp), forward-(5′-CTGGGTACATTTGATCTGACTGG-3′) and reverse-(5′-GCATCCTGGTGGCTTTCCAGCCATTC-3′); GRP94 (330 bp), forward-(5′-TCTCCCCCTCAATGTTTCCCGT-3′) and reverse–(5′-GATTCCGCCTCCTTTCTGCTTG-3′); insulin1/2 (ins1, 143 bp, ins2, 149 bp), forward-(5′-TCTTCTACACACCCATGTCCC-3′) and reverse-(5′-GTGGATCAGTGCTGCACC-3′), and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, 186 bp), forward-(5′-ACAGCTGGCAGGGAAGCTGA-3′) and reverse-(5′-AGCCTCTGCTGCCAGCAAGA-3′). 18 S RNA or GAPDH were the constitutive controls for determining relative RNA concentrations between samples and for confirming equal efficiency of the reverse transcription reactions. Serial dilutions of the template were prepared to verify that detection occurred in the linear range of amplification. All primers were previously validated in-house and by others (26Siman R.

Standard curves generated for each primer set using MIN6 RNA as control were used to calculate mRNA concentrations. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. for three experiments in each group. Statistical significance of treatment effects was determined by the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Probability values of p <0.05 were considered significant. Effects of Lactacystin on Islet Proteasome Activity—Islets were exposed to 5.6 mm glucose ± lactacystin (10 μm) for up to 4 h to measure the temporal effects of lactacystin on proteasome activity. Lactacystin treatment significantly reduced proteasome activity in islets by 91% after 1 h and by 99% after 4 h of exposure (Fig. 2). Effects of Lactacystin on Glucose-stimulated (Pro)insulin Biosynthesis and Secretion—Total intracellular (pro)insulin concentrations and total (pro)insulin secretion were similar in control and lactacystin-treated mouse islets exposed to 5.6 mm glucose (data not shown). At 20 mm glucose, total secreted (pro)insulin was reduced significantly by 51% in response to lactacystin (10 μm) treatment for 4 h (Fig. 3A). Total intracellular (pro)insulin content was similar between lactacystin-treated and untreated control islets (Fig. 3B). Metabolic labeling studies were performed to assess the effects of lactacystin on glucose-stimulated (pro)insulin biosynthesis. (Pro)insulin synthesis was determined after 2 h of exposure to glucose (5.6 or 20 mm) in the absence or presence of lactacystin (10 μm, Fig. 3C). The incorporation of [3H]tyrosine into (pro)insulin during the 20-min labeling period was taken as the rate of (pro)insulin synthesis (25Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar, 58Oyadomari S. Koizumi A. Takeda K. Gotoh T. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). As expected, for control islets the rate of (pro)insulin synthesis increased significantly in response to high glucose (20 mm) (29Permutt M.A. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schuit F.C. In't Veld P.A. Pipeleers D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31Halban P.A. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In 5.6 mm glucose, lactacystin did not significantly alter (pro)insulin synthesis. However, (pro)insulin synthesis decreased significantly after 2 h of exposure to lactacystin in high glucose (20 mm). To assess the effects of lactacystin on the fate of newly synthesized [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin, islets were first [3H]tyrosine-labeled (prior to lactacystin treatment) and then chased in 20 mm glucose ± lactacystin for up to 4 h. The quantity of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin released was similar between lactacystin-treated and untreated control islets. However, to determine the proportion of newly synthesized (pro)insulin contributing to the total secreted (pro)insulin pool (Fig. 3D), the specific radioactivities were determined by dividing the secreted [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin by the total immunoreactive (pro)insulin (non-labeled plus labeled (pro)insulin). The specific radioactivities of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro-)insulin in the cultured medium of control islets treated with 20 mm glucose were 0.25 ± 0.05 and 0.25 ± 0.06 cpm/microunits during the 2- and 4-h chase periods, respectively. For islets treated with lactacystin, the specific radioactivities of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin in the cultured medium were 0.29 ± 0.04 and 0.52 ± 0.16 cpm/microunits for the 2- and 4-h chase periods, respectively. Therefore, a significantly higher proportion of newly synthesized (pro)insulin was secreted from lactacystin-treated islets after 4 h of lactacystin treatment. Similar to islets, (pro)insulin synthesis was significantly decreased, whereas a significantly higher proportion of newly synthesized (pro)insulin was secreted from lactacystin-treated MIN6 cells (data not shown). Intracellular (Pro)insulin Degradation—The data for secreted and intracellular [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin were used to calculate the effects of lactacystin on intracellular (pro)insulin degradation in mouse islets and MIN6 cells. Degraded intracellular (pro)insulin was determined as the percentage of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin (in cells and the medium) that was not recovered during the chase periods (22Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Blondel B. Renold A.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2625-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). During the 4-h chase period, control islets degraded 25 and 8% of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin when exposed to 5.6 and 20 mm glucose, respectively. The percentages of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin degraded increased to 32 and 24% (p <0.05) in response to lactacystin in 5.6 and 20 mm glucose, respectively. Extracellular degradation of [3H]tyrosine-labeled (pro)insulin (in the medium) might affect the interpretation of the pulse-chase data and assessment of (pro)insulin turnover. However, if extracellular (pro)insulin degradation occurred to a significant extent, control and lactacystin treatments would have been affected equally because the two treatments were incubated under similar conditions. Therefore, the significant differences observed between control and lactacystin-treated cultures were attributed to proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, previous studies by Halban et al. (22Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Blondel B. Renold A.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2625-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1983; 32: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) determined that no more than 6% of (pro)insulin was degraded in the medium during a 24-h period, although the percentage of degradation was not affected by glucose concentration, and there was not significant uptake of (pro)insulin by islets.

The binding constant is 16 mm–1, and the lifetime of the complex is much less than 10 ms. Intermolecular pseudo-contact shifts observed for the plastocyanin amide nuclei, caused by the heme iron, as well as the chemical-shift perturbation data were used as the sole experimental restraints to determine the orientation of plastocyanin relative to cytochrome f with a precision of 1.3 Å. The data show that the hydrophobic patch surrounding tyrosine 1 in cytochrome f docks the hydrophobic patch of plastocyanin. Charge complementarities are found between the rims of the respective recognition sites of cytochrome f and plastocyanin. Significant differences in the relative orientation of both proteins are found between this complex and those previously reported for plants and Phormidium, indicating that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are balanced differently in these complexes.

Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 259-317Crossref Google Scholar). In the cytochrome b6f complex, cytochrome f (Cf) transfers electrons from the Rieske iron sulfur cluster to a soluble metalloprotein that acts as the electron donor for the P700 cofactor of PSI. The Cf subunit consists of a ∼28-kDa N-terminal soluble part anchored to the membrane by a C-terminal helix (4Gray J.C. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 34: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It represents an atypical c-type cytochrome because of both its β-sheet secondary structure and the unusual heme axial coordination (5Martinez S.E. Huang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The long axis of the soluble part is tilted relative to the membrane normal, and the heme is oriented appropriately for approach of the Rieske protein from the membrane side and of plastocyanin (Pc) from the luminal side (6Kurisu G.

In addition to its physiological relevance, the electron transfer reaction between Cf and Pc represents an excellent case to study the transient nature of protein interactions in electron transfer chains (13Bendall D.S. Bendall D.S. Protein Electron Transfer. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1996: 43-64Google Scholar). The lifetime of this kind of complexes is on the order of 1 ms or less. Due to the large amount of functional data available, this reaction has become a very useful model to test theoretical approaches for the prediction of structures of protein-protein complexes (14Pearson D.C.

In plants this reaction shows fast kinetics at 100 mm ionic strength (>108 m–1 s–1) despite both its modest binding constant (∼7 mm–1) under these conditions and the small difference in redox potential (20 mV) between donor and acceptor (21Kannt A.

Acta. 2000; 1456: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Such studies support the importance of electrostatic interactions involving the acidic patches (“site 2”) on Pc and the basic residues of Cf for binding under in vitro conditions (23Soriano G.M.

Notably, the relevance of the electrostatic interactions could not be confirmed in vivo (15Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Tae G.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14590-14598Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the system from Phormidium laminosum, the only cyanobacterium for which the kinetics of the reduction reaction have been analyzed so far, the electrostatic effects appear to be weaker and less optimized compared with plants (28Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Bendall D.S. Howe C.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Hart S.E. Schlarb-Ridley B. Delon C. Bendall D.S. Howe C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The solution structures of two Pc-Cf complexes have been obtained by dissecting the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the chemical-shift perturbations of Pc resonances upon Cf binding. The first one (PDB entry 2PCF) corresponds to the complex between spinach Pc and turnip Cf (30Ubbink M. Ejdebäck M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the second corresponds to the proteins from P. laminosum (31Crowley P.B. Otting G. Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10444-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both structures show modest interface areas (600–850 Å2 per protein). Moreover, in both cases the hydrophobic patch of Pc (“site 1”) lies near Tyr-1 of Cf, thus providing an appropriate environment for efficient electron transfer toward the copper atom through the exposed copper-coordinating His residue. In addition to this, chemical-shift perturbation data have been reported for several heterologous plant and cyanobacterial systems (32Crowley P.B. Vintonenko N. Bullerjahn G.S. Ubbink M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15698-15705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Crowley P.B. Ubbink M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Crowley P.B. Hunter D.M. Sato K. McFarlane W. Dennison C. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Despite their similarities, significant differences are found between the cyanobacterial and the plant complexes. In Phormidium, Pc binds Cf in a “head-on” conformation in which the hydrophobic patch accounts for the whole recognition interface in Pc, contrary to the “side-on” interface that also involves the acidic patches, which is found in the plant complex. Both kinds of complexes have been predicted in theoretical studies using the co-ordinates from plant proteins (15Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Tae G.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14590-14598Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Soriano G.M. Cramer W.A. Krishtalik L.I. Biophys. J. 1996; 73: 3265-3276Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Kostic N.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 42-52Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ionic strength dependences of the structures suggest that in the plant complex electrostatics play a dominant role, whereas in Phormidium complex formation is governed by the hydrophobic effect. It is known that Phormidium is a thermophilic organism (35Castenholtz R.W. Schweiz. Z. Hydrol. 1970; 32: 538-551Google Scholar). A higher ambient temperature could influence the balance between electrostatic forces and hydrophobic effects, making this complex unusual and different from that in other cyanobacteria. Hence, it is unknown if differences between the reported plant and Phormidium complexes are applicable to all cyanobacteria. Here, the structure of the complex between Pc and Cf from another cyanobacterium, Nostoc (formerly Anabaena), has been determined. Interestingly, the results herein presented are consistent with a single conformation in the transient complex between Pc and Cf that resembles the characteristic side-on binding mode present in plants yet has an interface similar to that found in the Phormidium complex. Protein Preparation—Uniformly (99%) 15N-labeled Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 Pc was produced in Escherichia coli JM109 transformed with pEAP-WT (36Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The culture conditions and purification methods will be published elsewhere (64Díaz-Moreno I. Díaz-Quintana A. De la Rosa M.A. Crowley P.B. Ubbink M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cadmium substitution of the copper in plastocyanin was performed as published (37Ubbink M. Lian L.Y. Modi S. Evans P.A. Bendall D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except that a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with a solution of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm CdCl2 was used instead of a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column. The soluble part of Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 Cf was produced in E. coli DH5α transformed with both pEC86, containing the c-type cytochrome maturation cassette (38Schulz H. Fabianeck R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and an expression vector for Cf, pEAF-WT, obtained by insertion of a chimeric petA gene in pBluescript II (Stratagene). This chimeric gene coded for a fusion protein with Cf truncated at the C terminus (at position 253) and the signal peptide of cytochrome c6 (36Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 12 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 6 mg/ml Fe(NH4)3 citrate under semi-anaerobic conditions (39Ubbink M. Van Beeumen J. Canters G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3707-3714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 35.5 °C, 150 rpm for 32 h up to an A600 of 1.3. Protein yields up to 1.5 mg/liter were obtained in this manner. The purification procedure used for Cf expressed from pEAF-WT will be described elsewhere. 2C. Albarrán, J. A. Navarro, F. P. Molina-Heredia, P. del S. Murdoch, M. A. De la Rosa, and M. Hervás, submitted for publication. NMR Sample Preparation—Pc and PCd protein solutions were concentrated to the required volume by ultrafiltration methods (Amicon, YM3 membrane) and exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, H2O/D2O 95:5 solutions. Protein concentrations were determined by absorption spectrophotometry using a ϵ598 of 4.5 mm–1 cm–1 for the oxidized form of Pc and a ϵ278 of 5.5 mm–1 cm–1 for PCd. The PCd ϵ278 was estimated using protein concentration values from Bradford assays. A A278/A598 ratio of 1.0 of the oxidized Pc indicated sufficient purity for characterization by NMR. The stock concentrations were 2.0 mm15N-labeled Pc and 2.7 mm15N-labeled PCd. The soluble domain of Cf was concentrated using Amicon YM10 membrane and exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 3 mm sodium ascorbate, H2O/D2O 95:5 solutions. The concentration determination was based on optical spectroscopy using an ϵ556 of 31.5 mm–1 cm–1 for the reduced Cf (30Ubbink M. Ejdebäck M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A 3.7 mm ferrous Cf stock solution with a A278/A598 ratio of 0.9 was used. Cf was kept in a reduced form with a few equivalents of sodium ascorbate and was stable in this form for days. The ferric form was prepared by the addition of a 5-fold excess of potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]) followed by gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences Superdex G75) to remove ferrocyanide. Complete oxidation was verified by the disappearance of the absorption band at 556 nm. Then, a 2.0 mm ferric Cf stock solution was prepared. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX 600 NMR spectrometer operating at 298 K. The 1H and 15N assignments of reduced Nostoc Pc assignments were taken from Badsberg et al. (40Badsberg U. Jorgensen A.M. Gesmar H. Led J.J. Hammerstad J.M. Jespersen L.L. Ulstrup J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7021-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For sequence-specific assignment of the backbone amide resonances of PCd (Supplemental Table S2), a two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC (41Andersson P. Gsell B. Wipf B. Senn H. Otting G. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy with 150 ms mixing time, and two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC total correlation spectroscopy with 80-ms mixing time spectra were recorded. The effects of complex formation on PCd were followed by acquiring two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra during titrations of aliquots of a 3.7 mm ferrous or 2.0 mm ferric Cf solution into a solution of 0.2 mm 15N-labeled PCd. The spectral widths were 32.0 ppm (15N) and 12.0 ppm (1H), and 256 and 1024 complex points were acquired in the indirect and direct dimensions, respectively. For measurements of the pseudo-contact shifts (PCS) 1H,15N HSQC spectra of free Pc, the oxidized complex and the reduced complex were acquired, always on the same sample. Ferric Cf from a stock solution was added to a 15N-labeled PCd sample with final concentrations of 0.35 and 0.50 mm, respectively. Cf was reduced with 10 mol eq of a concentrated sodium ascorbate solution. Given the final Cf concentration and the binding constant, the percentage of Pc bound was calculated to be 55%. All data processing was performed with AZARA (www.bio.cam.ac.uk/azara), and analysis of the chemical-shift perturbations (ΔδBind) with respect to the free protein was performed in Ansig (42Kraulis P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 627-633Google Scholar, 43Kraulis P.J. Domaille P.J. Campbell-Burk S.L. van Aken T. Laue E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3515-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 44Helgstrand M. Kraulis P. Allard P. Hard T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The spectra were calibrated against the internal standard [15N]acetamide (0.5 mm). Binding Curves—Titration curves were obtained by plotting ΔδBind against the molar ratio of CfII/III:PCd for the most strongly affected signals. Non-linear least squares fits to a 1:1 binding model (21Kannt A. Young S. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were performed in Origin 6.0 (Microcal Inc.). This model accounts for the dilution effect of both proteins during the titration, with the ratio of Cf and PCd and ΔδBind as the independent and dependent variables, respectively. The binding constant (Ka) and the maximum chemical shift change (Δδmax) were the fitted parameters. A global fit of the data was performed in which the curves were fitted simultaneously to a single Ka value, whereas the Δδmax for each resonance was allowed to vary. Chemical Shift Mapping—The shifts observed in the complex PCd-CfII with 3 eq of Cf were extrapolated to 100% bound for all residues using the Ka obtained from the fits. The average chemical-shift perturbation (Δδavg) of each amide was calculated using the following equation (45Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar),Δδavg=(ΔδN/5)2+ΔδH22eq.1 in which ΔδN is the change in the 15N chemical shift, and ΔδN is the change in the 1H chemical shift when the protein is 100% bound to Cf. Restraints Classes—Details of the restraints definitions are provided in the Supplemental Material. Briefly, four groups of restraints were defined. The interface restraints represent the chemical-shift perturbation data for Pc nuclei (Supplemental Table S1). These are satisfied when the nuclei are close the Cf surface. Additional interface restraints were defined to serve as a weak van der Waals repel function. PCS were used to define pseudo-contact restraints and angle restraints according to the procedure described in Ubbink et al. (30Ubbink M. Ejdebäck M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and minimal distance restraints were defined for amide groups that did not experience a PCS. Electrostatic restraints based on kinetic rather than NMR data were used previously (30Ubbink M. Ejdebäck M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) to represent the electrostatic attraction between PCd and Cf. In the Nostoc complex, these were not used because the NMR experimental data were sufficient to obtain a well defined structure. A summary of the restraint groups is listed in Table I. The product between the number of restraints and the scaling factor used in the calculations indicates the importance of each restraint group. Note that the pseudo-contact restraints, which give quantitative information, are dominant.Table IRestraints groupsRestraint groupTypeNumber of restraintsScalingNumber × scalingInterfaceDistance415205Pseudo-contactDistance81201620Minimal distanceDistance9010900AngleAngle81aScaling of the angle restraints is not comparable with that of distance restraints.a Scaling of the angle restraints is not comparable with that of distance restraints. Open table in a new tab Nostoc Cf Homology Model—A homology model of Cf was built using the COMPOSER (46Blundell T. Carney D. Gardner S. Hayes F. Howlin B. Hubbard T. Overlington J. Singh D.A. Sibanda B.L. Sutclife M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) module of SYBYL 6.5 (Tripos Inc.) using X-ray diffraction data from Brassica rapa, PDB entry 1CTM (resolution 2.30 Å (5Martinez S.E. Huang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar)) and PDB entry 1HCZ (resolution 1.96 Å (47Martinez S.E. Huang D. Ponomarev M. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) as templates. Including the structure of Phormidium Cf (PDB entry 1CI3 (48Carrell C.J. Scharlb B.G. Bendall D.S. Howe C.J. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9590-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) as the template did not improve the model. Three sequence stretches (residues 1–9, 13–183, and 198–254) were considered as conserved. These regions showed identities of 66.7, 64.9, and 54.4%, respectively. Two loops corresponding to residues Trp-4—Gln-6 and Ala-184—Val-197 were simulated to allocate 1- and 3-residue insertions, respectively, using the TWEAK option. On average, the r.m.s.d. of backbone atoms of the model of Cf with respect to the above structures was 0.56 Å. The structure of Cf from Mastigocladus (made available only after completion of our calculations, PDB entry 1VF5 (6Kurisu G. Zhang H.M. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar)) shows a similar extension of the small domain of Cf. The Nostoc Cf model shows a 1.16-Å r.m.s.d. with this structure. The largest differences correspond to residues 184–197, which show high B-factors in the Mastigocladus Cf crystal structure, suggesting that this loop may be flexible. Structure Calculations—Structure calculations were performed using XPLOR-NIH Version 2.9.1 (49Brunger A.T. X-PLOR 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar, 50Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). The structures of Nostoc Pc (PDB entry 1NIN (40Badsberg U. Jorgensen A.M. Gesmar H. Led J.J. Hammerstad J.M. Jespersen L.L. Ulstrup J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7021-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) and the homology model of Cf were treated as rigid bodies, and the co-ordinates of Cf were fixed. PCd was placed at a random position and allowed to move in a restrained rigid-body molecular dynamics calculation. None of the standard energy terms was used. Only the groups of experimental restraints described above were applied to dock the proteins. Five thousand cycles (see Supplemental Material) of calculations were performed (9 h on a dual processor Pentium IV PC running under LINUX). Only structures with a total restraints “energy” (Etot) below a threshold were saved, yielding ∼90 structures. To assure sufficient sampling of the orientation space, a large random displacement of Pc occurred when a (local) minimum had been found, as judged from a total restrained energy that had not changed for more than 50% during 10 cycles. About 200 of such displacements occurred in a representative run. As an illustration, Etot has been plotted against the cycle number in Fig. S2 for a sector of one trajectory, corresponding to 200 cycles. The resulting structures were ranked according to total restraint energy and the top ten structures, with total restraint energy values from 28 to 29 arbitrary units subjected to restrained energy minimization of the side chains followed by a short restrained rigid body energy minimization, both using the XPLOR-NIH repulsive van der Waals term with reduced scaling. This largely removed the collisions between Pc and Cf atoms while maintaining the low total restraint energy value. The ten best structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under entry 1TU2. Buried surface areas have been calculated using NACESS (51Hubbard S.J. Campbell S.F. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 507-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Electron Transfer Pathways—To determine the residues that could be involved in the electron transport, the best electron transfer pathway for each of the energy-minimized complex structures was calculated using Greenpath Version 0.971 (52.Regan, J. J. (1994) Greenpath software, Version 0.9771, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). This program performs a Green function analysis based on two-state super-exchange model (53Skourtis S.S. Onuchic J.N. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1993; 209: 171-177Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). No enhanced coupling was used for aromatic rings. For representation purposes, we selected all the coordinates of the residues that appear in any of these paths instead of just representing the bonds and jumps involved. Binding Affinity—To characterize the complex of Pc and Cf from Nostoc, Cf was titrated into a solution of 15N-labeled Cd-substituted Pc, PCd. The copper in Pc was replaced by the redox inactive substitute cadmium to allow for studies with both oxidized and reduced Cf without interference from electron transfer reactions. The effects of the titrations were followed with two-dimensional HSQC experiments. Shifting of resonances during the titration indicated that binding and dissociation were fast on the NMR timescale (>100 s–1). In Fig. 1, the chemical-shift perturbations due to binding to reduced Cf (CfII) are plotted for several residues of PCd. The curves clearly illustrate that the chemical-shift perturbations increase as a function of the CfII concentration. A global fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model (21Kannt A. Young S. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) yielded a binding constant of 16 ± 1 × 103m–1, and the same affinity was obtained with oxidized Cf (KA = 16 ± 2 × 103m–1; data not shown). This value is slightly lower than that obtained for native (Cu(I)) Nostoc Pc (26 ± 1 ×103m–1 (64Díaz-Moreno I. Díaz-Quintana A. De la Rosa M.A. Crowley P.B. Ubbink M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). Hence, it can be concluded that the binding affinity is independent of the oxidation state of Cf but appears to vary slightly between Pc with a singly charged metal and a doubly charged one. Interface Map—In Fig. 2, the size of the chemical-shift perturbations for residues affected upon titration with CfII are color-coded onto the surface of Pc. Perturbed residues map in sequence stretches 7–17, 32–44, 63–72, and 88–100. These stretches form a large area comprising residues from both classical binding sites (10Coleman P.M. Guss J.M. Sugimura Y. Yoshizaki F.Y. Freeman H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 211: 617-632Google Scholar, 25Lee B.H. Hibino T. Takabe T. Weisbeek P.J. Takabe T. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Three proline residues, at positions 37, 38, and 91 (gray), are located in the middle of the interface, close to the copper ligand His-92. In addition to the main interaction area, three isolated residues (Lys-51, Asp-54, and Leu-55) undergo a significant perturbation. These residues are located in a region below site 2, comprising mainly charged residues that have an important role in the Nostoc complex structure, as is explained below. The perturbation map of PCd is similar to that found for Pc(Cu(I)) (64Díaz-Moreno I. Díaz-Quintana A. De la Rosa M.A. Crowley P.B. Ubbink M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The overall sizes of the perturbations and the localized nature of the binding map indicate that the complex between PCd and Cf is well defined according to the classification for well defined versus dynamic complexes, suggested by Worrall et al. (55Worrall J.A.R. Liu Y.J. Crowley P.B. Nocek J.M. Hoffman B.M. Ubbink M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Prudêncio and Ubbink (56Pru"

Noxa is a BH3-containing mitochondrial protein that contributes to apoptosis by disrupting mitochondrial outer membrane integrity. Here we demonstrate potent induction of Noxa expression by exposure of cells to dsRNA, interferon (IFN), and virus. Noxa induction was confirmed by using reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblot analyses in multiple human tumor cell lines. Importantly, Noxa regulation by IFN and dsRNA was independent of p53, thereby identifying a novel mechanism of Noxa induction. Ectopic expression of Noxa in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells enhanced cellular sensitivity to viral or dsRNA/actinomycin D-induced apoptosis, typified by enhanced cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial to the cytosolic fraction and increased cleavage of caspases 3 and 9. Point and deletion mutations of Noxa confirmed that both the BH3 domain and the mitochondrial-targeting domain were necessary for enhanced cellular apoptotic responses to dsRNA, IFN, or virus. Treatment of cells with dsRNA or virus, but not etoposide, induced interaction between Noxa and Bax that required an intact Noxa BH3 domain. Interestingly, the Noxa mitochondrial-targeting domain deletion mutant interacted with Bax in a dsRNA-dependent manner and redirected Bax away from the mitochondria, thus acting as a dominant-negative protein.

Both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulate in infected cells during virus replication, where they induce IFNs and other proinflammatory cytokines (3Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 65-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The IFNs are essential for initiating and coordinating a successful antiviral response by inducing a number of intracellular genes that directly prevent virus replication/cytolysis and stimulate the adaptive arm of the immune system (3Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 65-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). dsRNA can also induce directly a subset of innate immune genes that mediate antiviral/immunomodulatory responses (4Bandyopadhyay S.K.

Cellular mechanisms for preventing viral replication, dissemination, or persistent infections include global inhibition of protein synthesis, blockage of protein transport, and induction of apoptosis.

The human Noxa gene is located on chromosome 18q21 and encodes a 54-amino-acid protein with a single BH3 motif, which is in contrast to the murine Noxa protein that has two putative BH3 domains (9Oda E.

As a BH3-only member of Bcl-2 family, Noxa is proposed to mediate apoptosis by interacting with other pro- or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (such as Bax or Bak) directly or indirectly to promote mitochondrial membrane changes that lead to membrane permeabilization and efflux of apoptogenic proteins (16Wei M.C.

The exact mechanisms of Noxa-induced apoptosis remain undefined, including whether Noxa secondary modification is required for activation. Recent gene profiling experiments have implicated human Noxa as an IFN- and dsRNA-stimulated gene (19Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we confirm that human Noxa mRNA and protein are induced by IFN, dsRNA, and viral stimulation and that induction correlates with sensitization of cells to apoptotic signals. We show also that induction is independent of p53 but does require prototypical IFN- and dsRNA-response pathways. Our studies suggest that the apoptotic function of Noxa contributes to viral-induced cell death and IFN-dependent sensitization of cells to other proapoptotic agents and further highlight the association between the innate immune system and cellular apoptotic machinery. Cell Lines, Plasmids, Transfection, and Retrovirus Production— HT1080 fibrosarcoma, HT1080/GSE56, HT1080/LXSN (23Ossovskaya V.S. Mazo I.A. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Strezoska Z. Kondratov R.

PC-3 and LNCaP prostate tumor cell lines were maintained in Ham's F12K medium and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, both supplemented with 5% bovine growth serum. A full-length human Noxa cDNA was cloned from dsRNA-treated HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell total cellular RNA by using reverse transcriptase-PCR and subsequently sequence-confirmed as wild type Noxa. The cloned Noxa cDNA was inserted into expression vector pcDNA3.1-Myc-His (–) (Invitrogen) under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, yielding plasmid pcD-Noxa. Mutant Noxa constructs were generated from the pcD-Noxa parental plasmid by using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (BD Biosciences). Noxa BH3-D contained a deletion of the BH3 domain (amino acids 29–37), whereas BH3-PM contained a leucine to alanine mutation at position 29 within the BH3 domain. Noxa MTD-D had the entire MTD deleted (amino acids 41–50). Transient and stable transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). To generate stable transfectants, transfected cells were cultured in G418 for 3 weeks, after which individual clones were isolated and Noxa expression was confirmed by using Western blotting with a Noxa monoclonal antibody (Alexis Biochemicals). For retroviral expression of Noxa antisense, the Noxa cDNA was cloned in an antisense orientation into the pBabepuro vector, and infectious retrovirus particles were produced by using GP+ENV AM12 amphotropic packaging cells. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were infected at an m.o.i. = 0.5 and then placed into puromycin selection medium (1 μg/ml) for 1 week. Individual clones were expanded and screened for reduced basal and dsRNA-induced Noxa expression by using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell Treatments—Stocks of dsRNA (2 mg/ml) were prepared by dissolving poly(I) poly(C) (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 50 °C for 1 h. For dsRNA treatment, cells were washed with PBS and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then dsRNA was added to the medium at the desired final concentrations for the indicated times. For apoptosis induction, cells were co-treated with actinomycin D (Act D; 6 ng/ml final concentration). Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or vesicular stomatitis virus were adsorbed to cells at various m.o.i. for 1 h in serum-free medium followed by the addition of complete medium for the indicated times. IFN-β (Rebif; Serono SA) was used at a final concentration of 500 units/ml for the indicated times. Etoposide was dissolved in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml in serum-free medium for 6 h. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences) was dissolved in Me2SO and was used at a final concentration of 300 nm in serum-free medium for 3 h. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then reverse-transcribed (2 μg) using Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Promega) and random hexamer primers in a total volume of 20 μl at 42 °C for 60 min. One-tenth of the RT reaction was subjected to PCR analysis using primer pairs specific for Noxa (5′-CGAGAATTCGAGATGCCTGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGGTACCGGTTCCTGAGCAG-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-AAATCCCATCACCATCTTCC-3′ and 5′-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGC-3′). PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose ethidium bromide gels, bands were visualized on a digital camera (Eastman Kodak Co.), and images were inverted for presentation to give dark bands on a light background. Immunoblotting, Cell Fractionation, and Cytochrome C Release—For immunoblot analysis of protein expression, cell lysates were prepared as described (22Sun Y. Leaman D.W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One hundred μg of protein was resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Noxa detection was carried out with monoclonal antibodies against Noxa (Alexis Biochemicals), p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cytochrome oxidative complex 4 (COX4) (Molecular Probes), cytochrome c (Pharmingen), Bax (Pharmingen), c-Myc (Invitrogen), or actin (Sigma), respectively. Bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected by using chemiluminescence (Pierce) followed by autoradiography. To obtain mitochondria and cytosolic fractions, cells left untreated or treated with dsRNA plus Act D were washed once in cold PBS, resuspended in 6 volumes of mitochondria isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm potassium-EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 21 μg/ml pepstatin, 31 μg/ml aprotinin), and homogenized in an ice-cold tissue grinder with 10 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then twice centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was incubated in 50 μl of lysis buffer for 15 min on ice and then clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 4 min. Protein concentration was measured, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by using SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was used to determine the relative expression of cytochrome c, COX4, Noxa, and actin in the different fractions. Proliferation, Cell Viability, and Apoptosis Assays—For growth assays, cells were seeded at a density of 2,000/well in 96-well plates. After 12 h, cells were treated with dsRNA at the indicated concentration with or without 6 ng/ml Act D co-treatment for 48 h. Alternatively, cells were plated at 10,000 cells/well and infected with EMCV at the indicated m.o.i. for 24 h. Surviving cells were gently washed with PBS and fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (ICN Biomedicals) at room temperature for 1 h, and the plates were washed with 1% acetic acid and air-dried. Dye was eluted in 10 mm unbuffered Tris (Fisher), and the absorbance read was at 490 nm on a V-max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Absorbance data were used to calculate relative cell growth as described previously (8Leaman D.W. Chawla-Sarkar M. Vyas K. Reheman M. Tamai K. Toji S. Borden E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28504-28511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Treatments were conducted in triplicate, and the mean values (±S.D.) of a typical experiment are presented. All experiments were conducted a minimum of three times. Trypan blue exclusion studies were carried out as described above, with the exception that cells were plated at 20,000 cells/ml in 12-well dishes and viable cells were counted at the end of the treatment period. Cells were trypsinized and stained with 0.4% trypan blue solution for 5 min at room temperature, and unstained cells were counted on a hemacytometer. Data were again presented as relative cell numbers (as compared with untreated controls). To assess apoptosis, cells were left untreated or were treated with dsRNA (50 μg/ml) combined with actinomycin D (6 ng/ml) or IFN-β (500 units/ml) or treated with EMCV (m.o.i. = 0.3) for the indicated times. After treatment, cell lysates were prepared, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (Pharmingen), caspase 3 (Cell Signaling), or caspase 9 (Pharmingen) cleavage were assessed by using Western blot analysis. Noxa/Bax Interaction Studies—Cells expressing Noxa protein and the various Noxa mutant proteins were left untreated or treated with dsRNA (50 μg/ml, ±6 ng/ml Act D), EMCV (m.o.i. = 0.3), or etoposide (4 μg/ml) for 6 or 12 h. After that time, cells were lysed (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 4 min. PBS-equilibrated 50% nickelnitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen) was added to the cleared lysates (50 μl/ml) and mixed gently by shaking at 4 °C for 2 h. After two washes (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Bax, Noxa, and Noxa mutant proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antisera. Several recent oligonucleotide gene array profiling studies had implicated human Noxa as an IFN-regulated gene in HT1080 fibrosarcoma (19Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar), WM9, and WM35 melanoma cell lines (20Leaman D.W. Chawla-Sarkar M. Jacobs B. Vyas K. Sun Y. Ozdemir A. Yi T. Williams B.R. Borden E.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2003; 23: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (21Brassard D.L. Delorenzo M.M. Cox S. Leaman D.W. Sun Y. Ding W. Gravor S. Spond J. Goodsaid F. Bordens R. Grace M.J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 455-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Noxa was also implicated as a dsRNA-induced gene in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (22Sun Y. Leaman D.W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and as an IRF-3-regulated gene in Jurkat cells (24Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B. Sen G.C. Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5532-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To confirm Noxa induction by these stimuli, HT1080 cells were treated for the indicated times with 500 units/ml IFN-β and/or 50 μg/ml dsRNA. As a positive control, cells were treated in parallel with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a known regulator of Noxa expression (10Hijikata M. Kato N. Sato T. Kagami Y. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Noxa mRNA induction was observed with all treatments but was maximal with dsRNA treatment (Fig. 1A). Similar Noxa mRNA induction was observed following treatment of A375 melanoma cells with these same stimuli (Fig. 1A). Combined IFN and dsRNA treatments enhanced stimulation only slightly as compared with dsRNA treatment alone (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Noxa protein induction by dsRNA and IFN-β was confirmed in HT1080, A375, and WM9 cells by using immunoblot analysis with a Noxa monoclonal antibody. In all three cell types, Noxa protein was strongly up-regulated with 3 (dsRNA) or 8 h (IFN-β) of stimulation (Fig. 1B). Induction of Noxa by two RNA viruses, EMCV and vesicular stomatitis virus, was also confirmed in HT1080 cells (Fig. 1C), where expression persisted until complete cell lysis was observed (data not shown). Induction of genes by dsRNA or virus can occur directly or via a feedback loop involving production of an IFN intermediate. Although our previous gene array studies had implicated direct Noxa mRNA induction by dsRNA in cells unresponsive to IFNs (22Sun Y. Leaman D.W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we sought to confirm that Noxa protein expression was induced by dsRNA in an IFN-independent manner. dsRNA treatment of IFN-unresponsive U4C cells, a Jak1-deficient cell line derived from HT1080 cells through chemical mutagenesis (25Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), resulted in Noxa protein induction that was similar in magnitude and duration to the induction observed in IFN-responsive parental HT1080 cells (Fig. 1D). These data confirmed that Noxa was regulated directly by dsRNA and did not require IFN feedback. Noxa induction by IFN likely involved the typical Jak/Stat pathway since induction by IFN was not observed in the U4C cells (data not shown). Since Noxa was identified previously as a p53-regulated gene, we sought to determine whether p53 was required for IFN- and/or dsRNA-dependent induction of Noxa. Our first strategy employed HT1080 cells expressing a dominant-negative p53 genetic suppressor element (HT1080 GSE56) or empty vector (HT1080 LXSN) (23Ossovskaya V.S. Mazo I.A. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Strezoska Z. Kondratov R. Stark G.R. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10309-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The GSE56 cells expressed a fragment of the p53 protein (amino acids 275–368) derived from the oligomerization domain that inhibits the activity of the endogenous p53 protein (23Ossovskaya V.S. Mazo I.A. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Strezoska Z. Kondratov R. Stark G.R. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10309-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although p53 protein in the GSE cells accumulates to high levels, it is largely nonfunctional (23Ossovskaya V.S. Mazo I.A. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Strezoska Z. Kondratov R. Stark G.R. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10309-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). When treated with dsRNA (Fig. 2A) or IFN (supplemental data), HT1080 LXSN and HT1080 GSE56 cells both exhibited a time-dependent induction of Noxa. In contrast, the LSXN controls, but not the GSE56 HT1080 cells, exhibited enhanced Noxa expression in response to etoposide (Fig. 2A and data not shown). To extend these data, we compared Noxa induction by dsRNA or etoposide in p53-null PC3 prostate tumor cells with p53-expressing LNCaP prostate tumor cells (26Colletier P.J. Ashoori F. Cowen D. Meyn R.E. Tofilon P. Meistrich M.E. Pollack A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2000; 48: 1507-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Isaacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Noxa by dsRNA was identical in both cell lines, but induction by etoposide was observed only in the p53-positive LNCaP cells (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggest that Noxa can be induced by IFN and dsRNA in a p53-independent manner. To assess the effects of Noxa protein on cellular growth responses to dsRNA, IFN, and virus, HT1080 and A375 cells were stably transfected with pcD-Noxa, which conferred constitutive Noxa expression from a cytomegalovirus promoter. Both cell lines tolerated constitutive Noxa protein expression, consistent with a previous report on Noxa in which normal fibroblasts infected with adenoviral Noxa were unaffected unless stimulated with an additional apoptotic signal (13Shibue T. Takeda K. Oda E. Tanaka H. Murasawa H. Takaoka A. Morishita Y. Akira S. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2233-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A Noxa-expressing HT1080 clone with high level ectopic Noxa protein expression, but normal induction of the endogenous Noxa protein by dsRNA, was selected for further analysis (Fig. 3A). Endogenous and ectopic Noxa proteins were both localized to the mitochondrial fraction, the integrity of which was confirmed by reprobing the blot with antibodies against the mitochondria-specific proteins COX4 and cytochrome c (Fig. 3A). In untreated cells, most of the cytochrome c was associated with the mitochondrial fraction, but in dsRNA/Act D-treated cells, redistribution to the cytoplasm was observed, a feature that was enhanced in the pcD-Noxa stable transfectants (Fig. 3A). To assist in studies on the biological consequence of IFN- or dsRNA-induced Noxa, a Noxa antisense retroviral construct (pBabepuro Noxa-AS) was used to infect HT1080 cells. Over 60 puromycin-resistant clones stably infected with this antisense construct were assessed for Noxa induction by dsRNA. From these, a single clone was identified that exhibited ∼90% reduction in Noxa protein expression as compared with vector controls (Fig. 3B). Importantly, this clone did not exhibit constitutive IFN production that can sometimes plague antisense experiments (28Sledz C.A. Williams B.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), as demonstrated by lack of constitutive IFN-stimulated gene expression or constitutive viral resistance (data not shown). Cells constitutively expressing Noxa had growth characteristics comparable with empty vector-expressing cells and were morphologically similar (data not shown). However, upon treatment with dsRNA/Act D, but not Act D alone, pcD-Noxa HT1080 cells underwent morphological changes consistent with apoptosis, including cell rounding and eventual detachment and overall loss in cell numbers. When cell numbers were assessed in 48-h growth assays, Noxa-expressing cells were roughly 60% more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of dsRNA/Act D as compared with vector controls but were not more sensitive to either stimulus when used as single agents (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the Noxa antisense-expressing cells were less sensitive to dsRNA/Act D treatment as compared with either vector control l"

The structural similarity of the active site of LpxC to metalloproteases led to the proposal that LpxC functions via a metalloprotease-like mechanism. The pH dependence of kcat/Km catalyzed by Escherichia coli and Aquifex aeolicus LpxC displayed a bell-shaped curve (EcLpxC yields apparent pKa values of 6.4 ± 0.1 and 9.1 ± 0.1), demonstrating that at least two ionizations are important for maximal activity. Metal substitution and mutagenesis experiments suggest that the basic limb of the pH profile is because of deprotonation of a zinc-coordinated group such as the zinc-water molecule, whereas the acidic limb of the pH profile is caused by protonation of either Glu78 or His265. Furthermore, the magnitude of the activity decreases and synergy observed for the active site mutants suggest that Glu78 and His265 act as a general acid-base catalyst pair. Crystal structures of LpxC complexed with cacodylate or palmitate demonstrate that both Glu78 and His265 hydrogen-bond with the same oxygen atom of the tetrahedral intermediate and the product carboxylate.

UDP-3-O-((R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) is a zinc-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of UDP-3-O-((R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine (myr-UDP-GlcNAc) to form UDP-3-O-(R-hydroxymyristoyl)glucosamine and acetate (6Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The deacetylation of myr-UDP-GlcNAc is the committed step in the biosynthesis of lipid A (7Anderson M. Bull H. Galloway S. Kelly T. Mohan S. Radika K. Raetz C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19858-19865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, this enzyme is a target for the development of inhibitors as antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative infections (2White R.J.

A comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism and structure of LpxC will facilitate the development of potent and specific inhibitors of this enzyme. The enzyme LpxC belongs to a group of enzymes known as the zinc hydrolases. Mononuclear zinc hydrolases can be broadly categorized by two general catalytic mechanisms as follows: one that uses a single bifunctional general acid-general base catalyst (GABC) (i.e. metalloproteases), and a second mechanism that uses a GABC pair (i.e. histone deacetylases) to carry out catalysis (11Christianson D.W. Lipscomb W.N. Acc. Chem. Res. 1989; 22: 62-69Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 12Aoki S. Kimura E. Comp. Coord. Chem. II. 2004; 8: 601-640Google Scholar, 13Lipscomb W.N. Strater N. Chem.

The structure of Aquifex aeolicus LpxC (AaLpxC) has been solved using x-ray crystallography (15Whittington D.A. Rusche K.M. Shin H. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and NMR spectroscopy (16Coggins B.E. Li X.C. McClerren A.L. Hindsgaul O. Raetz C.R.H. Zhou P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This structure (Fig. 2) reveals that LpxC contains a unique fold and a novel zinc-binding motif, both of which distinguish LpxC from other known zinc hydrolases (15Whittington D.A. Rusche K.M. Shin H. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One bound zinc ion is an essential cofactor for LpxC catalytic activity (ZnA), whereas excess zinc leads to enzyme inhibition (6Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) by ZnB (Fig. 2b) (15Whittington D.A. Rusche K.M. Shin H. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The catalytic zinc ion (ZnA) is coordinated by His79, His238, Asp242, and a solvent molecule, whereas the inhibitory ZnB ion is coordinated by Glu78, His265, a fatty acid, and a bridging solvent molecule. Previous mutagenesis experiments suggest that three active site residues (Glu78, Asp246, and His265) are important for catalytic activity, as mutation of these residues to Ala decreases the catalytic activity >102-fold (17Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the basis of these structural and mutagenesis data, LpxC was proposed to function via a metalloprotease-like mechanism using a single general acid-base catalytic side chain (Glu78) and a zinc-water nucleophile to catalyze deacetylation of its substrate (Fig. 3A), as described in detail for metalloproteases (11Christianson D.W. Lipscomb W.N. Acc. Chem. Res. 1989; 22: 62-69Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 12Aoki S. Kimura E. Comp. Coord. Chem. II. 2004; 8: 601-640Google Scholar, 13Lipscomb W.N. Strater N. Chem.

A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The ZnA ion and His265 provide stabilization of the transition states and oxyanion intermediate prior to protonation of the amine leaving group and collapse of the oxyanion intermediate. In contrast, the deacetylation mechanism for histone deacetylases has been proposed to use a pair of His side chains, one functioning as a general acid and the other as a general base to activate the zinc-water nucleophile (12Aoki S. Kimura E. Comp. Coord. Chem. II. 2004; 8: 601-640Google Scholar, 18Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). The details of the LpxC catalytic mechanism have not yet been fully elucidated. The pH dependence of AaLpxC wild-type and mutants has been reported recently (19McClerren A.L. Zhou P. Guan Z. Raetz C.R.H. Rudolph J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that Glu78 functions as a general base.Fig. 3The proposed mechanisms for LpxC using either a single bifunctional GABC (A) or a GABC pair (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here we investigate the catalytic mechanism of LpxC using metal substitution, mutagenesis, pH dependence, and x-ray crystallography. The kcat/Km for E. coli LpxC (EcLpxC) has a bell-shaped dependence on pH with two pKa values of ∼6.4 and 9.1 similar to values recently reported for AaLpxC (19McClerren A.L. Zhou P. Guan Z. Raetz C.R.H. Rudolph J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Metal substitution and mutagenesis experiments suggest that the basic limb of the pH profile represents ionization of a metal-coordinated group, such as the zinc-water molecule. Kinetic evaluation of LpxC mutants and crystal structures of LpxC complexed with cacodylate or palmitate support a mechanism in which Glu78 and His265 function as a general acid-base catalyst pair, wherein the His265 side chain functions as a general acid to protonate the amine leaving group, whereas Glu78 functions as a general base to activate the zinc-water nucleophile. Mutagenesis and Protein Expression—All mutant plasmids were prepared using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The LpxC variants were overexpressed and purified according to published procedures (6Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A.

For expression of less stable LpxC mutants, cells were incubated overnight at 25 °C following addition of isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside. Additionally, 100 μm isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside and 200 μm ZnSO4 were added at induction for expression of the D246A EcLpxC mutant. All purification steps were carried out at room temperature and 4 °C for AaLpxC and EcLpxC, respectively. Following lysis using a microfluidizer, the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Both AaLpxC and EcLpxC were eluted with a linear gradient (0–250 mm KCl). The LpxC was further fractionated using a Reactive Red 120 column with a linear gradient (0–250 mm KCl for EcLpxC and 150–500 mm KCl for AaLpxC). The LpxC enzymes were >95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE and were stored at –80 °C. All metals were removed from the purified enzymes by incubation with 20 mm dipicolinic acid, as described previously (6Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The apoLpxC was reconstituted with stoichiometric amounts of ZnSO4, CoSO4, or NiSO4 prior to use in assays (6Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The final metal-enzyme stoichiometry was determined using inductively coupled plasma emission mass spectrometry. For LpxC prepared using these methods, no fatty acid contaminants were detected by mass spectrometry following extraction of LpxC with methylene chloride. Preparation of Substrate—[14C]UDP-3-O-((R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine was prepared from [14C]UDP-GlcNAc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) catalyzed by UDP-3-O-acyltransferase (LpxA) and purified according to procedures used for preparation of [32P]UDP-3-O-((R)-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine (6Jackman J.E.

Bull H. Galloway S. Kelly T. Mohan S. Radika K. Raetz C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19858-19865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate was obtained in 90–99% yield, as determined by scintillation counting. TLC analysis verified that the purification procedures removed any contaminating UDP-GlcNAc. Additionally, >90% of the synthesized myr-UDP-GlcNAc was cleaved by LpxC. LpxC Assay—The deacetylase activity was measured as described previously (6Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Sorensen P.G. Lutkenhaus J. Young K. Eveland S.S. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, assay mixtures containing buffer, bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free, 1 mg/ml), triscarboxyethylphosphine (0.5 mm), and [14C]UDP-3-O-((R)-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine were pre-equilibrated at the assay temperature (EcLpxC at 30 °C, AaLpxC at 60 °C), and the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. After incubation for various times, the reaction was quenched by the addition of sodium hydroxide, which also cleaves the myristate substituent for ease of separation. The substrate and product were separated on PEI-cellulose TLC plates (0.1 m guanidinium HCl) and quantified by scintillation counting. The initial rate of product formation (<20% reaction) was determined from these data. For the EcLpxC mutants the initial rate was measured in 20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 7.5, at seven to nine different concentrations (25 nm to 8 μm) of myr-UDP-GlcNAc. The steady-state parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were obtained by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the initial linear velocities measured at various substrate concentrations. For the pH dependence experiments, LpxC activity was assayed under kcat/Km conditions at several concentrations of myr-UDP-GlcNAc (50–200 nm) to demonstrate a linear dependence on substrate concentration ([S] < Km) in the pH range of 5.5–10.5. Wild-type and the mutant LpxC enzymes were linearly dependent on substrate concentration with the exception of E78A and E78A/H265A at high pH where little turnover was observed at concentrations below 200 nm, consistent with a Km > 200 nm. The buffers were either a combination of 100 mm acetate, 50 mm bis-Tris, 50 mm triethanolamine over the entire pH range or 20 mm MES, pH 5.5–6.5, 20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 7–9.1, or 20 mm CAPS, pH 9.8–10.7. Equation 1 (two ionizations) was fit to the pH rate profiles. (kcatKm)obx=k1(1+[H]Ka1+Ka2[H]) (Eq. 1) Equation 2 was fit to the pH rate profiles for the E78A/H265A mutants, (kcatKm)obx=k1+k2([H]/Ka1)(1+[H]Ka1+Ka2[H]) (Eq. 2) where k1 is the kcat/Km at the pH optimum, and k2 is the pH independent value of kcat/Km at low pH. LpxC is stable over this pH range under the assay conditions. The catalytic activity of LpxC decreases ≤2-fold after incubation at the altered pH for ≤5 min followed by measuring the activity at pH 7.5. For the solvent isotope effect experiments, the initial rates at subsaturating substrate concentrations in H2O were compared with the initial rates in ∼95% D2O. The pD values obtained for the D2O buffers using the pH meter readings were corrected by adding 0.4 to these values (24Srere P.A. Kosicki G.W. Lumry R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 50: 184-&Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Crystallography—The C193A/ΔAsp284–Leu294 variant of A. aeolicus LpxC was used for crystallography experiments as described (15Whittington D.A. Rusche K.M. Shin H. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Crystallization was achieved by equilibrating a hanging drop containing 3 μl of protein solution (3 mg/ml LpxC, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 180 mm NaCl, 9–14% PEG3350, and 0.5 mm ZnSO4) and 3 μl of precipitant buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 180 mm NaCl, 9–14% PEG3350, and 0.5 mm ZnSO4) over a reservoir containing ∼1 ml of precipitant buffer. Crystals with maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm3 grew within 3 days and were gradually transferred to a stabilization buffer of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 180 mm NaCl, 11–16% PEG 3350, 0.5 mm ZnSO4, and 1% glycerol. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen following cryoprotection with 22% glycerol and diffracted x-rays to 2.1 Å at the Argonne National Laboratory (IMCA-CAT, Argonne, IL). Crystals were isomorphous with those prepared at pH 7.0 (15Whittington D.A. Rusche K.M. Shin H. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and belong to space group P61 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 101.3 Å, c = 122.7 Å. Data were indexed and merged using the program HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 306-326Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the zinc-inhibited enzyme, excluding all zinc ions, solvent, and fatty acid molecules, as a search probe for rotation and translation functions calculated with the program AmoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). It was clear in initial electron density maps that the inhibitory metal ion, ZnB, had dissociated and that a tetrahedral cacodylate anion was coordinated to the catalytic metal ion ZnA. In native AaLpxC, a fatty acid interpretable as myristate or disordered palmitate occupied the hydrophobic tunnel and coordinated to ZnB; because fatty acids were not included in the crystallization medium, this fatty acid must be a remnant of heterologous expression in E. coli. The fatty acid remained bound in the LpxC-cacodylate complex, and its carboxylate group was displaced to two alternate conformations as a consequence of ZnB dissociation. Iterative cycles of refinement and model rebuilding were performed with the programs CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have suggested that residues Glu78, His265, and Asp246 are important for catalytic activity. Therefore, the steady-state parameters Km, kcat, and kcat/Km were determined for the E78A, H265A, D246A, and E78A/H265A EcLpxC mutants and compared with the values obtained for WT EcLpxC (Table II). The E78A, D246A, and H265A single mutations all decreased kcat/Km values by 400–2200-fold, whereas the largest decrease in kcat/Km was measured for the E78A/H265A double mutant (∼1.5 × 104-fold). The decrease in kcat/Km values observed for the LpxC mutants is predominantly explained by a decrease in the kcat values for these enzymes. The smallest decrease in kcat was observed for the E78A mutant (18-fold), whereas the largest decrease was observed for the E78A/H265A mutant (1.6 × 103-fold). These mutations have more modest effects on the Km values, with the E78A mutation causing the largest increase (23-fold). The observed changes in the Km values rule out the possibility that the activity in the mutants is because of WT contamination.

https://openalex.org/W2016875014,"Laminar shear stress (LSS) represents a major athero-protective stimulus. However, the mechanisms for this effect are poorly characterized. As chemokine receptors modulate endothelial cell functions, we hypothesized that at least some LSS effects on endothelial cells (ECs) may be due to LSS-dependent changes in chemokine receptor expression and function. Exposure of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to 15 dynes/cm2/sec(-1) LSS strongly inhibited CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression at the transcriptional level and impaired stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1/CXCL12-driven chemotaxis. On the contrary, low shear stress (SS; 4 dynes/cm2/sec(-1)) only marginally affected CXCR4 expression when compared with static control cells. Differently from CXCR4, the expression of SDF-1 mRNA was not affected by LSS treatment. CXCR4 overexpression induced a dose-dependent endothelial cell apoptosis that was enhanced by SDF-1 treatment and was caspase-dependent. CXCR4 overexpression inhibited the LSS-mediated antiapoptotic effect on ECs and was associated to impairment of LSS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that LSS-induced CXCR4 down-regulation may contribute to endothelial cell survival. Interestingly, the expression of the proatherogenic chemokines MCP-1 and IL-8 was induced by SDF-1 treatment and by CXCR4 overexpression in HUVECs. Further, the known LSS-induced inhibition of MCP-1 expression was impaired in CXCR4 overexpressing ECs. Finally, CXCR4 was abundantly expressed by human atherosclerotic plaque endothelium that is exposed to low/absent shear stress, while it was poorly expressed by minimally diseased carotid artery endothelium. In conclusion, LSS-dependent CXCR4 down-regulation may contribute to atheroprotection by favoring the integrity of the endothelial barrier and by inhibiting MCP-1 and IL-8 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2144097678,"Skp1 is a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein of eukaryotes best known as an adaptor in SCF ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases. In Dictyostelium, Skp1 is subject to 4-hydroxylation at Pro143 and subsequent O-glycosylation by α-linked GlcNAc and other sugars. Soluble cytosolic extracts have Skp1 prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) activity, which can be measured based on hydroxylation-dependent transfer of [3H]GlcNAc to recombinant Skp1 by recombinant (Skp1-protein)-hydroxyproline α-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase. The Dictyostelium Skp1 P4H gene (phyA) was predicted using a bioinformatics approach, and the expected enzyme activity was confirmed by expression of phyA cDNA in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme (P4H1) was dependent on physiological concentrations of O2, α-ketoglutarate, and ascorbate and was inhibited by CoCl2, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetate, as observed for known animal cytoplasmic P4Hs of the hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIFα) class. Overexpression of phyA cDNA in Dictyostelium yielded increased enzyme activity in a soluble cytosolic extract. Disruption of the phyA locus by homologous recombination resulted in loss of detectable activity in extracts and blocked hydroxylation-dependent glycosylation of Skp1 based on molecular weight analysis by SDS-PAGE, demonstrating a requirement for P4H1 in vivo. The sequence and functional similarities of P4H1 to animal HIFα-type P4Hs suggest that hydroxylation of Skp1 may, like that of animal HIFα, be regulated by availability of O2, α-ketoglutarate, and ascorbate, which might exert novel control over Skp1 glycosylation.

Many proteins have been identified as substrates for these ligases, including cell division kinase inhibitors, transcription factor subunits, and a cytoplasmic cAMP phosphodiesterase in Dictyostelium (2Mohanty S.

In the SCF complex, Skp1 serves as an adaptor linking the F box protein, a member of a family of target recognition proteins, and the cullin-1/Rbx1 dimer, which in turn binds the catalytic ubiquitin carrier protein (3Zheng N.

Collagen-type P4Hs coordinate Fe2+ in their active sites using two critical His residues, a Glu/Asp residue, α-ketoglutarate, and O2 and catalyze the coupled cleavage of O2 with decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate and 4-hydroxylation of the target Pro residue (17Myllyharju J.

This appears to be an important pathway of O2 sensing in invertebrate and vertebrate animal cells (24Safran M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).Glycosylation of Skp1 is required for its concentration in the nucleus and also appears to influence cell size and maximal cell density in axenic media (8West C.M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Prolyl hydroxylation is required for Skp1 glycosylation (16Sassi S. Sweetinburgh M. Erogul J. Zhang P. Teng-umnuay P. West C.M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and might regulate this post-translational modification. To investigate this possibility further, the fully sequenced Dictyostelium genome was scanned for sequences containing the critical Fe2+-coordinating amino acid triad and other P4H motifs using BLAST (25Glockner G. Eichinger L. Szafranski K. Pachebat J.A. Bankier A.T. Dear P.H. Lehmann R. Baumgart C. Parra G. Abril J.F. Guigo R. Kumpf K. Tunggal B. Cox E. Quail M.A. Platzer M. Rosenthal A. Noegel A.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Five candidate coding regions predicted to encode cytoplasmic proteins were identified (12West C.M. van der Wel H. Sassi S. Gaucher E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These sequences are diverse based on phylogenetic analysis of P4H-like sequences from many organisms. A similar search in the genomes of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and the oomycete Phytophthora sojae identified, in each, a novel candidate bifunctional gene predicted to encode both P4H activity and Skp1 α-GlcNAc-transferase activity. The Dictyostelium sequence most closely related to the diatom and oomycete P4H-like sequence, implicated in the Skp1 modification pathway by its association with an Skp1 GnT1-like sequence, was also the most closely related of the five to the HIFα class of animal P4H sequences. This gene, referred to as phyA, is shown here to encode Skp1 P4H based on its biochemical activity and its requirement for Skp1 glycosylation in vivo. This finding in the model system Dictyostelium suggests that HIFα P4Hs are an ancient enzyme family that had its evolutionary origins in lower eukaryotes or even prokaryotes and opens new lines of studies into O2 and metabolite regulation of cell physiology in microbes, including parasites and pathogens of plants and animals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDictyostelium Cell Culture—Dictyostelium strain Ax3 and its derivatives were passaged axenically in HL-5 medium or on SM agar in the presence of Klebsiella aerogenes as described (16Sassi S.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E1 showed that rSkp1 was readily observed as one of several major Coomassie Blue-stained bands (data not shown).rGnT1—rGnT1 was produced in E. coli transformed with pGnT51-CBD, which encodes the full-length coding region of Skp1 GlcNAc-transferase-1 fused to the C terminus of a chitin-binding domain via a self-cleaving intein linker. E. coli was induced and extracted as described above, and spontaneously cleaved rGnT1 was recovered from the retarded flow-through fraction of a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (15Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H.

This fraction was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose fast flow (Hi-Sub) column equilibrated in 20% (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (see above).

This pool was concentrated 100-fold in a Centriprep 30 centrifugal concentrator (Amicon, Inc.), with an activity yield of 50%.Purification of P4H from Dictyostelium—An S100 fraction from stationary phase cells was prepared and subjected to serial anion exchange and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as described previously for GnT1 (15Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H.

P4H was assayed using the two-step method described above.Cloning P4H1 Genomic DNA—Primers PHF-S and PHF-AS, which included the putative start and stop codons respectively (underlined in Fig. 2), were used to amplify the coding part (including introns) of the P4H1 gene from CsCl-purified Dictyostelium genomic DNA based on standard procedures (30van der Wel H.

The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into pCR4TOPO (Invitrogen), yielding pTOPOgPH1. pTOPOgPH1 was sequenced using the M13(F) and M13(R) primers, which exactly confirmed the genomic sequence reported for chromosome 2 in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank (accession number AC115612.2; nucleotides 87226–88296) and the primary model for this gene at dictyBase (dictyBaseID DDB0169393; available at www.dictybase.org).Disruption of the Dictyostelium P4H1 Gene—pTOPOgPH1 was digested with BstBI, which cuts at position 535 of P4H1 (see Figs. 2 and 3). The bsr (blasticidin Sresistance) cassette was released from plasmid pBsR519 (31Puta F. Zeng C. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1998; 44: 185-188PubMed Google Scholar) using ClaI. Both digests were electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) SEAKEM GTG-agarose (BioWhittaker) gel, and linearized pTOPOgPH1 and the released bsr cassette were retrieved using a freeze-squeeze method (32Thuring R.W. Sanders J.P. Borst P. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and EtOH-precipitated. Linearized pTOPOgPH was treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by inactivation at 65 °C for 20 min. The DNA fragments were ligated for 3 h at 22 °C using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs Inc.), which was then inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min. The resulting plasmid, pTOPO-PH1-BsR, was expressed in TOP10 E. coli cells (Invitrogen) and digested with SpeI and NotI. The P4H1-BsR insert was gel-purified as described above and treated briefly with Bal-31 exonuclease (New England Biolabs Inc.) to remove terminal residues derived from pCR4TOPO, which improved transformation frequency (data not shown) (33Zhang Y. Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bal-31 was inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 m EGTA, and the DNA was EtOH-precipitated and redissolved in 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Strain Ax3 cells were transformed by electroporation as described (34Pang K.M. Lynes M.A. Knecht D.A. Plasmid. 1999; 41: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).

The first strand of DNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and primer PHF-AS (see Fig. 2). DNA was then amplified by adding primer PHF-S using PCR as described above. The resulting cDNA was cloned into pCR4TOPO, yielding pTOPOcPH1 and sequenced as described above to confirm fidelity.Overexpression of P4H1 in D. discoideum—P4H1 cDNA was amplified from pTOPOcPH1 using primers PHF-pVS (5′-GACTGGTACCGAAAATAAAATAAAAAAATGGATATTTCTAACTTACCCCCTCAC) and PHF-pVAS (5′-CAAGATCTATAAATCCAAGTTGTAATTGCAATTCTT) (KpnI and BglII cloning sites are in boldface, and underlined regions correspond to terminal coding DNA) as described above and cloned into pCR4TOPO. After sequencing to ensure fidelity, the resulting plasmid was digested with KpnI and BglII, and the open reading frame was directionally cloned into a similarly digested preparation of Dictyostelium expression vector pVS (33Zhang Y. Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which removed the signal peptide encoded by pVS. This plasmid, pVS-P4H1, placed the P4H1 open reading frame under the control of the discoidin-1γ promoter and appended a C-terminal c-Myc epitope tag. pVS-P4H1 was electroporated into strain Ax3 cells, and transformants were selected using 10 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Research Products International Corp.) in HL-5+ medium as described above. Cultures were grown through three passages in 20 or 120 μg/ml G418 and cloned by growth on K. aerogenes on SM media plates. S100 and P100 fractions were generated from cell lysates by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min.

The crystal structure of E. coli FolC is described in this paper. It showed strong similarities to that of the FPGS enzyme of Lactobacillus casei within the ATP binding site and the catalytic site, as do all other members of the Mur synthethase superfamily. FolC structure revealed an unexpected dihydropteroate binding site very different from the folate site identified previously in the FPGS structure. The relevance of this site is exemplified by the presence of phosphorylated dihydropteroate, a reaction intermediate in the DHFS reaction. L. casei FPGS is considered a relevant model for human FPGS. As such, the presence of a folate binding site in E. coli FolC, which is different from the one seen in FPGS enzymes, provides avenues for the design of specific inhibitors of this enzyme in antimicrobial therapy.

Folate molecules (tetrahydrofolate and derivatives) are used as cofactors in various metabolic pathways. Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) is essential for normal cell growth and replication, and its metabolic pathway has been the target for cytotoxic drugs in cancer therapy (1Costi M.P. Ferrari S. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 135-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Folates are synthesized de novo in many organisms (plants and most bacteria), but other organisms such as mammals or Lactobacillus casei must obtain folates through uptake. During the biosynthesis of folates, dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFS) 1The abbreviations used are: DHFS, dihydrofolate synthetase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; DHF, dihydrofolate; DHP, dihydropteroate; DHP-P, dihydropteroate-phosphate; FPGS, folylpolyglutamate synthetase; mTHF, 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate.1The abbreviations used are: DHFS, dihydrofolate synthetase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; DHF, dihydrofolate; DHP, dihydropteroate; DHP-P, dihydropteroate-phosphate; FPGS, folylpolyglutamate synthetase; mTHF, 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. activity adds l-glutamate to dihydropteroate to form dihydrofolate. After the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase, the folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) adds a second and third glutamate by γ-linkage to form polyglutamates (Fig. 1). These polyglutamate products are the in vivo cofactors of folate-dependent enzymes.FPGS activity seems to be ubiquitous. The polyglutamation of folates allows their retention in the cell and increases their affinity for some of the folate-dependent enzymes. In mammals, folate cofactors are also stored in mitochondria for use in various folate-dependent reactions such as glycine synthesis (2Moran R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of FPGS in the folate pathway makes it interesting for cancer therapy, as folates are essential in cell growth, and some of the folate analogs used as inhibitors of the folate pathway increase their potency by being polyglutamylated in the cell (2Moran R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar). DHFS activity is present only in organisms that synthesize folates de novo. It can be associated on the same protein with FPGS activity as in Escherichia coli or Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and this protein will be called FolC in this paper. Different enzymes can also carry out DHFS and FPGS activities, sometimes in different compartments as in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (3Sun X. Bognar A.L. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).DHFS activity has been shown to be essential in Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli (4Pyne C. Bognar A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and N. gonorrhoeae (5Fussenegger M. Meyer T.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in Gram positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus or Streptomyces coelicolor (6Burger A. Brandt B. Süsstrunk U. Thompson C.J. Wohlleben W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 159: 283-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it is not present in mammals. Because of its ubiquity in pathogenic bacteria, its essentiality for these organisms, and its absence in humans, the inhibition of DHFS activity would appear to be a promising target for antimicrobial therapy. There are strong similarities between DHFS and FPGS enzymes at both the sequence level and the mechanism level. A sequence search using the E. coli FolC sequence as a reference finds DHFS/FPGS/FolC enzymes, irrespective of their specificity, with at least 25% identity between any two of these sequences, and they cluster mainly according to their origin and not to their specificity. Furthermore, the reactions (Fig. 1a) are supposed to be identical and to follow an ordered Ter Ter mechanism (7Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5663-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate is first added to the folate substrate upon hydrolysis of the ATP to form an acyl-phosphate intermediate. The second step of the reaction is suggested to be a nucleophilic attack by the amine of l-glutamate, producing a tetrahedral intermediate. In the last step, the tetrahedral intermediate collapses to yield ADP, the glutamylated folate, and inorganic phosphate (Fig. 1b).The structure of the L. casei FPGS enzyme, free (3Sun X. Bognar A.L. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and bound to its substrates (8Sun X. Cross J.A. Bognar A.L. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), shows that it is made of two domains folded consecutively and joined by a six-residue linker. ATP binds in a channel sandwiched between the two domains. A significant rearrangement of the ATP binding mode is observed upon the binding of a folate molecule from a folate-unbound form with the ribose ring in a C3′-endo conformation to a folate-bound form in anti conformation. A rigid body movement of the two domains is also observed, closing on the inter-domain cleft into which the folate molecule binds.Analysis of the L. casei FPGS active site reveals that it belongs structurally to the Mur ADP-forming ligase superfamily (9Bertrand J.A. Fanchon E. Martin L. Chantalat L. Auger G. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which also comprises the structures of MurD (10Bertrand J.A. Auger G. Fanchon E. Martin L. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3416-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and MurE (11Gordon E. Flouret B. Chantalat L. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). MurD catalyzes the addition of d-glutamate to UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine in the presence of ATP. The proposed mechanism for this reaction is similar to that of FPGS. The superimposition of the structures reveals a very conserved catalytic site, the presence of a similar phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) in the nucleotide binding site, and very similar phosphate binding pockets. The β- and γ-phosphates of ATP are held in place by their interactions with a magnesium ion, which is further coordinated by a conserved lysine at the end of the P-loop, a conserved glutamate, and another residue which, in L. casei FPGS, is Ser73 of the Ω-loop, a feature specific to FPGS enzymes. This loop contains residues whose properties are conserved among all DHFS/FPGS sequences and especially a Ser-cis-Pro motif (Ser73-Pro74 in L. casei) in the active site. A second magnesium site is present in the substrate-containing structures. It is hexacoordinated by four water molecules arranged in a plane, an oxygen of the γ-phosphate on one side of the water plane, and a conserved histidine on the other side. Two of the water molecules are further coordinated by a conserved carbamylated lysine. This lysine seems to be present in all members of the Mur synthethase superfamily including MurD, MurE, MurF, cyanophycin synthethase, and FPGS enzymes (12Dementin S. Bouhss A. Auger G. Parquet C. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Dideberg O. van Heijenoort J. Blanot D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5800-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); the precise role of the carbamate in the enzymatic activity is difficult to assess but is supposed to be important for spatial stabilization of the two water molecules that correctly position the Mg2+. Mutagenesis experiments indicate that the carbamylated lysine is essential for activity.The sequence similarities between FPGS, DHFS, and FolC enzymes suggest that both the ATP binding site and the catalytic site are conserved at the three-dimensional level in all these enzymes. Hence, differences in specificity should mostly result from differences in the binding of the various folate molecules to the enzymes.To verify this hypothesis, we decided to study the E. coli enzyme. The folC gene is an essential gene in E. coli (4Pyne C. Bognar A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its product (FolC) catalyzes both DHFS and FPGS reactions. Biochemical studies suggested that it was bifunctional (13Bognar A.L. Osborne C. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5625-5630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of independent mutants could be made that affect both activities similarly (14Keshavjee K. Pyne C. Bognar A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19925-19929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations can be mapped, using the L. casei FPGS structure, either to the ATP binding site or to the catalytic site. These two studies suggest that FolC has a single ATP binding site and a single catalytic site but might have several binding sites or binding modes for its various substrates. Presently, it remains unclear how FolC can perform the two reactions and whether it qualifies as an attractive target for designing selective inhibitors against the folate binding enzymes. Our work addresses these important issues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Production—The E. coli folC gene was cloned in plasmid pET29. The resulting plasmid, pVRC1432, was transferred into the E. coli BL21 (λDE3) strain. This strain was grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium in presence of 50 mg/liter kanamycin. When A600 reached 0.8, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture until A600 reached 1.5. After centrifugation, cell pellets (8 g of frozen cells) were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, containing 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication.The supernatant (50 ml) was loaded on a Q-Sepharose Hi Load 16/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7. The column was washed with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted with a 200-ml gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in the buffer. Fractions (10 ml) were checked by SDS-PAGE. The fraction containing the larger amount of the FolC protein was applied to a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7. Elution was performed with the same buffer. 2-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Using this protocol, 95 mg of pure FolC protein was obtained.Biochemical Data—The enzyme was incubated in 10 mm glycine-OH, 10 mm MgSO4,50mm KCl, pH 9.5, with DHP for measurement of DHFS activity or aminopterin for FPGS activity in the presence of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, ATP, and glutamate (cf.Table I for concentrations). The reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl (20 μl, 1 n). 300 μl was transferred to a microplate injection system for separation by high performance liquid chromatography (Gilson apparatus). 250 μl was injected onto a Macherey-Nagel Nucleodur column (105-mm C8). A gradient between buffer A (H2O and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and buffer B (acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied for 5 min 20 s with a flow rate of 2.2 ml/min. The peak of dihydrofolate (DHF) was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (λEX, 285 nm; λEM, 420 nm). In the conditions of measurement of DHFS activity, the Km values of DHP, ATP, and glutamate were 150 nm, 11 μm, and 142 μm, respectively.Table IConditions of the enzymatic tests for the two biochemical activities of E. coli FolCDHFSFPGSEnzyme4 nm100 nmSubstrateDHP (1 μm)Aminopterin (100 μm)TCEPaTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.1 mm1 mmATP100 μm1 mmGlutamate1.5 mm1.5 mmTotal volume500 μl500 μlIncubation time15 min1 hTemperature22 °C37 °Ca Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.

It is then incubated overnight with the ligand of interest at 0.4 mm. Crystals are obtained by the hanging drop method in 1.2–1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and Bicine, pH 8.7. The crystals were then frozen in a buffer containing 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 25% glycerol, and Bicine, pH 8.7. Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on line ID14. Molecular replacement was done using Amore (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Sequence Alignments—A sequence search was carried out using the E. coli FolC sequence as a reference, and an overall sequence alignment was done on the 47 bacterial sequences thus obtained using programs of the Vector NTI suite. Even though there is at least 25% identity between any two of these proteins, the overall sequence identity was very low (4%), with 39% overall sequence similarity. Important residues (ADP binding site, active site residues) are conserved among all sequences, validating the alignment. Sequences cluster in bacterial families, but this alignment does not distinguish between the different specificities of the enzymes.RESULTSThree-dimensional Structure of E. coli FolC—The 25% identity in sequence between E. coli FolC and L. casei FPGS was also found at the three-dimensional level. The proteins share the same overall structure. Both individual N-terminal and C-terminal domains of E. coli FolC superimposed with those of L. casei FPGS with a root mean square fit of 1.6 Å for the N-terminal domains and 1.9 Å for the C-terminal domains, although their relative orientations are different in these two structures.

The C-terminal domain is formed of helices A10 (307–319), A11 (338–346), A11′ (365–372), A12 (381–391), and A13 (404–417) and β-strands B11 (291–294), B12 (299–302), B13 (326–330), B14 (351–354), B15 (376–377), and B16 (397–401).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal domain presents some differences with its FPGS counterpart, namely an ordered loop between α1 and α2 (which, as will be seen later, has some functional role), shorter β-strands 8 and 9, and a shorter α8. All residues of the C-terminal domain are clearly visible, revealing an additional α-helix between β-strands 14 and 15 in a region that is disordered in FPGS (Fig. 2b).ATP Binding Site—E. coli DHFS crystals grow only in the presence of nucleotides, ADP, ATP, or AMP-PNP. Extensive crystallization trials were carried out to find crystallization conditions for the apo-form of the enzyme, but this approach remains unsuccessful. In all cases, in the presence or absence of another substrate (DHF) the nucleotide adopts the same conformation, which corresponds to the “activated” conformation found in FPGS.In this conformation, the nucleotide molecule sits in a narrow channel sandwiched between the N and C domains (Fig. 3). It is covered by ordered water molecules on the adenosine site and is opened toward the catalytic site on the other side. The sides of the channel are made up by the N-terminal parts of α-helices 3 and 8, the inter-domain linker, and the loop joining β-strand 10 and α-helix 10. The adenosine moiety is stacked between the glycine-rich loop (P-loop, residues 56–59) and Tyr312 of α-helix 10. The ribose moiety is in hydrogen-bond interactions with Asp302, equivalent to Asp313 of L. casei FPGS and the major contributor to the ribose binding site. The α-phosphate makes interactions with the P-loop on one side and with the linker residue Arg289 side chain on the other side. The β- and γ-phosphates interact as already described in L. casei. The Ω-loop, containing a cis-Pro, adopts the same conformation, thus positioning the carbonyl of Ser83 to coordinate the first magnesium ion. The second magnesium ion is also coordinated in the same way as in FPGS, with the carbamylated Lys188 fixing the position of two of the water molecules around the metal ion.Fig. 3ATP binding site. The surface of the protein is in cyan, residues are in green (carbon atoms), blue (nitrogen atoms), and red (oxygen atoms), and the secondary structure is in green. Water molecules are represented by small red balls, and magnesium ions are denoted by magenta spheres. The ADP molecule is colored pink (carbon), red (oxygen), blue (nitrogen), and magenta (phosphate). Broken lines represent H-bonds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A significant rearrangement of ATP was described in L. casei FPGS upon the binding of a folate molecule (8Sun X. Cross J.A. Bognar A.L. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By superimposing the L. casei and E. coli ATP binding sites, the binding site of the C3′-endo conformation of ATP appeared blocked in E. coli,asGly314 of L. casei was replaced by Val303 in a position that would clash with the adenosine moiety.All attempts to obtain crystals of the complex between DHFS and ATP resulted in a structure in which the nucleotide was at least partly hydrolyzed. AMP-PNP shows full binding in the same “anti” conformation as ADP, even in the absence of substrate. From these observations, even though it is not possible to discard the possibility of a C3′-endo binding mode of ATP in E. coli FolC, such a movement seems ruled out because of the steric hindrance with Val303.Folate Binding Site—E. coli FolC was crystallized in the presence of Mg-ADP or Mg-ATP and either DHF or thiopteroate at 1 mm (Fig. 5). DHF is the product of the DHFS reaction, and the unsaturated thiopteroate is not active against the enzyme. In the absence of a bound folate molecule, residues 24–26 are not visible in the electron density (“open” conformation; Fig. 4a). Upon the binding of DHF, additional electron density shows up unambiguously corresponding to a pteroic cycle, and the loop becomes ordered. The pteroic cycle fits into a narrow pocket, stacked on one side against Phe124 of α-helix 5 and Ala155 and on the other side against Ile28 and Leu30. These two hydrophobic residues are further stabilized by their stacking against Trp176. All atoms from the pteroate moiety, which have H-bonds capabilities, are engaged in productive interactions with neighboring residues (Fig. 4b). A water molecule, coordinated by the Thr27 and Phe124 main chain as well as the pteroic cycle, further occupies the pocket. It would seem that the binding of a pteroate molecule stabilizes residues 24–32; this induced fit mechanism is further supported by the structure obtained from the crystal grown in the presence of thiopteroate (weak binder and thus not present in the structure); in this case residues 24–26 are not visible, the rest of this loop adopts an open conformation, and Trp176 has a different orientation. The DHP binding loop (residues 25–32) is not conserved in the sequence of L. casei FPGS. The equivalent loop, ordered only in the structure of the ternary complex, adopts a more open conformation and thus does not form the pteroate binding pocket.Fig. 5Two dimensional structure of dihydropteroate and thiopteroate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4a, DHP binding loop. The loop is ordered in the complex structure of FolC/DHP (in cyan) but disordered in the empty structure (yellow). b, DHP binding site.

Because the pteroic cycle of thiopteroate did not show binding to the protein in the biochemical test, it is suggested that the interaction of the protonated N8 with Asp154 is one of the leading forces in the specific binding of dihydropteroate molecules to FolC. Of all residues involved in pteroate binding in FolC, only the loop comprising residues 28–32 is not conserved among bacterial DHFS/FPGS sequences, even though groups of enzymes contain this pattern. This observation suggests a possible sequence marker for DHFS activity. It is difficult to verify this hypothesis, as the function of most DHFS/FPGS/FolC enzymes is not fully characterized. Nevertheless, such a work has been done in yeast (15Cherest H. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14056-14063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), where both an FPGS and a DHFS enzyme have been identified, and in A. thaliana (16Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S. Grunwald D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15360-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In these DHFS enzymes a similar pattern of residues could be identified, namely hydrophobic (D/E)LGL. This pattern is present in the 13 enterobacteria FolC sequences analyzed, suggesting that this novel site might exist in a reduced number of bacteria.The rest of the DHP molecule, following the pteroate moiety, is clearly visible. Loop 147–150 of the enzyme delineates a platform for the benzoate moiety, which points toward the active site, at the right distance for the addition of phosphate, the first step in the DHFS reaction. Loop 147–150 is a highly conserved sequence (G(L/I/M)(G/A)G) present in all DHFS/FPGS/FOLC enzymes, just before residue Asp154.Catalytic Site—The catalytic site where addition of phosphate and subsequently glutamate takes place is identical to that of L. casei FPGS. In the absence of a pteroate molecule ATP has been hydrolyzed to ADP, and its γ-phosphate is held in place by two magnesium ions. The additional partners of the first magnesium ion are two water molecules, the main-chain oxygen of Ser83 (whose position is constrained by the conserved cis-Pro84 of the Ω-loop), a carboxylate oxygen of Glu146, and one of the oxygens of a putative sulfate molecule. Because of the presence of >1 m ammonium sulfate in the crystallization conditions, the density at this position was interpreted as a sulfate but could also be modeled as a phosphate resulting from the hydrolysis of ATP. The second magnesium ion (Mg2) is hexacoordinated by four water molecules, an oxygen of the γ-phosphate on one side of the water plane, and His173 on the other side. Two of the water molecules are further coordinated by the conserved carbamylated Lys188.Mechanism—The DHFS reaction is presumed to be a Ter Ter sequential reaction (7Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5663-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate is first added to the dihydropteroate upon hydrolysis of the ATP (forming DHP-P), before the addition of the l-glutamate and the dissociation of the phosphate ion. E. coli FolC crystallized in the presence of 2 mm DHF and 10 mm Mg-ADP, and all residues are in an extremely well defined density. However the glutamate moiety of DHF was not visible and was very likely hydrolyzed. The DHF was back-transformed into DHP-P, probably because of the presence of residual phosphate in solution. A control experiment was done using DHF and ATP, and the structure obtained contained a mixture of DHP-P/ADP and DHP/ATP (data not shown).As described previously, the pteroic cycle lies in its binding pocket, sandwiched between α-helix 5 and the DHP binding loop (Fig. 4a). The benzoate moiety points toward the ADP binding site, and the phosphate moiety lies in well defined density. The phosphate is stabilized via interactions with the two magnesium ions, whereas one of the water molecules coordinating Mg2 has been displaced by the carbonyl oxygen of DHP-P (Fig. 6). The third oxygen of the phosphate is not in direct interaction with any atom but it is at ∼3.4 Å of the NH of His305, suggesting a role of this residue in the next step of the reaction.Fig. 6Catalytic site. a, surface representation of the protein is in cyan.

Our model shows that during steady-state ATP hydrolysis, myosin X exhibits a duty ratio (i.e. the fraction of the cycle time spent strongly bound to actin) of around 16%, but most of the remaining myosin heads are also actin-attached even at moderate actin concentrations in the so-called “weak” actin-binding states. Contrary to the high duty ratio motors myosin V and VI, the ADP release rate constant from actomyosin X is around five times greater than the maximal steady-state ATPase activity, and the kinetic partitioning between different weak actin-binding states is a major contributor to the rate limitation of the enzymatic cycle. Two different ADP states of myosin X are populated in the absence of actin, one of which shows very similar kinetic properties to actomyosin·ADP. The nucleotide-free complex of myosin X with actin shows unique spectral and biochemical characteristics, indicating a special mode of actomyosin interaction.

The nucleotide-free complex of myosin X with actin shows unique spectral and biochemical characteristics, indicating a special mode of actomyosin interaction. Myosin X is a recently described member of the myosin superfamily that is expressed in vertebrate tissues as a single isoform (1Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The heavy chain of myosin X consists of an N-terminal motor domain containing the actin- and ATP-binding sites, a neck region that binds three calmodulin (or possibly other) light chains, a putative coiled-coil region that may bring about heavy chain dimerization, and a tail region consisting of several domains of effector function (three pleckstrin homology (PH3) 1The abbreviations used are: PH3, pleckstrin homology domain 3; mant, methylanthraniloyl-; MDCC-PBP, fluorescently labeled bacterial phosphate-binding protein; MOPS, N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; mX-S1, recombinant subfragment-1 like bovine myosin X construct; S1, subfragment-1; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: PH3, pleckstrin homology domain 3; mant, methylanthraniloyl-; MDCC-PBP, fluorescently labeled bacterial phosphate-binding protein; MOPS, N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; mX-S1, recombinant subfragment-1 like bovine myosin X construct; S1, subfragment-1; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). domains, a MyTH4, and a FERM domain) (1Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the PH3 domains in the myosin X tail is a unique feature among myosins, and it enables this myosin to directly bind to the plasma membrane via phosphatidylinositol phospholipids (1Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15274-15280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Myosin X has been shown to localize to regions of dynamic actin and to exhibit remarkable patterns of intrafilopodial motility (1Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, myosin X localizes to the tips of filopodia, which appears to be an active process requiring myosin X motor function (4Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Myosin X induces elongation of filopodia by transporting the Mena-VASP complex (an inhibitor of actin filament capping) to filopodial tips (5Tokuo H. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Myosin X activity is also necessary for phagocytosis (6Cox D. Berg J.S. Cammer M. Chinegwundoh J.O. Dale B.M. Cheney R.E. Greenberg S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as well as the localization and function of integrins (7Zhang H. Berg J.S. Li Z. Wang Y. Lang P. Sousa A.D. Bhaskar A. Cheney R.E. Stromblad S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).The above functional studies indicate a cellular role for myosin X as a plasma membrane-associated cargo transporter. This setting is unique within the myosin superfamily, which implies that this class of motors may have adapted to its role by acquiring distinctive molecular properties. All myosins exert their motile activity during a cyclic interaction with actin filaments and ATP. The enzymatic parameters are key determinants of the motile output of motor proteins, and it has been shown in numerous cases that the biochemistry of different myosins reflects precise and profound functional adaptations to their widely differing cellular roles (for a review see Ref. 8De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Studies on a heavy meromyosin-like recombinant fragment of myosin X have shown that myosin X exhibits actin-activated ATPase activity and in vitro motility directed toward the barbed end of actin filaments (9Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34348-34354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Its mechanism of action, however, has not been investigated in detail. To assess the biochemical and enzymatic properties of myosin X, we used the baculovirus-Sf9 expression system to produce a single-headed myosin X construct (named mX-S1) that retains the catalytically active portion of the molecule. We performed steady-state and transient kinetic, fluorescence spectroscopic, and other biochemical measurements to show that myosin X spends a relatively small fraction (16%) of its ATPase cycle time in the so-called strong actin-binding states. This behavior suggests that myosin X does not use a myosin V-like single molecule processive stepping mechanism. However, the total actin attachment ratio of myosin X during steady-state ATP hydrolysis is notably high even at moderate actin concentrations (>50% attachment at 20 μm actin). This feature is due to the kinetic partitioning between different “weak” actin-binding states, which may greatly aid in maintaining continuous actin attachment and therefore proper functioning of a small array of membrane-bound motors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification of mX-S1—A truncated (subfragment-1-like) fragment of the bovine myosin X heavy chain cDNA (gift of Dr. David Corey, Harvard Medical School) encoding the motor domain and all three light chain-binding motifs (first 810 amino acids of the heavy chain) was cloned into the pVL1392 expression vector. This construct (referred to as mX-S1 throughout this paper) was coexpressed with calmodulin in the baculovirus-Sf9-expression system. A C-terminal FLAG tag (sequence DYKDDDDK) was appended to the heavy chain that enabled high purity (>99%) preparation of recombinant mX-S1. Expression and purification procedures were as described earlier for non-muscle myosin IIA heavy meromyosin (10Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Typically, 2–5 mg of mX-S1 could be purified from 4 × 109 Sf9 cells. Purified mX-S1 was stored in a high ionic strength (I = 525 mm) buffer and used within 4 days of preparation or flash-frozen immediately. The construct was not soluble at low ionic strengths in the absence of actin and nucleotide. Therefore, ionic strengths of >30 mm had to be used in most experiments. A 2-fold molar excess of extra calmodulin was added to mX-S1 after purification in order to fully saturate the binding sites on the mX-S1 heavy chain, thereby preventing protein aggregation. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay using smooth muscle myosin subfragment-1 as a standard. Stopped-flow-based active site titrations with mant-ATP indicated that the error of protein concentration determinations was below 10%.Other Materials—Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin and subfragment-1 (S1) were prepared as described in Refs. 11Margossian S.S.

In acrylamide quenching, steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, and temperature dependence measurements, samples containing pyrene-actin were excited at 347 nm (1 nm bandwidth), and emission was monitored at 406 nm (5 nm bandwidth). Background signal measured with assay buffer alone was subtracted from all fluorescence records before analysis.Acto-S1 Cosedimentation—Samples were set up at room temperature under the same buffer conditions as in the spectroscopic measurements (or using 20 mm instead of 100 mm KCl to yield a final I = 45 mm where indicated) and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants and pellets were run on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In samples involving ATP but not ADP, contaminating amounts of ADP were removed by the addition of 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate.

MDCC-PBP fluorescence was excited at 436 nm (6 nm bandwidth), and emission was collected through a 450 nm long-pass filter.

The volume ratio was 1:1 in all single mixing, and 5:2:5 in double-mixing experiments. Nucleotide-free mX-S1 and acto-mX-S1 were prepared by incubation with 0.01 units/ml apyrase for 15 min at room temperature. In phosphate release measurements, all solutions were preincubated with a “Pi mop” consisting of 0.02 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 0.5 mm 7-methylguanosine.Data Analysis and Kinetic Modeling—Reported means and S.D. are those of two to six rounds of experiment. Fitting of the data sets to mathematical functions was done using the KinTek SF-2001 software and OriginLab 7.0 (Microcal Corp.). Kinetic simulations and global fitting analyses were performed using the Gepasi version 3.21 software (Pedro Mendes, Virginia Bioinformatics Institute).RESULTSBasal ATPase Mechanism of mX-S1—In all experiments of the present study, we used a single-headed myosin X construct (mX-S1) that contains the catalytically active motor domain as well as the entire neck region comprising three light chain-binding IQ motifs and three calmodulin molecules as light chains.The tryptophan fluorescence emission of mX-S1 showed a 6% increase and a small (3 nm) blue shift on the addition of ADP (Fig. 1A). The addition of ATP to mX-S1 caused a similar blue shift and a 20% fluorescence enhancement compared with the nucleotide-free state, indicating that at least one intermediate of higher fluorescence than the mX-S1·ADP complex is significantly populated during steady-state ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1A). Mixing mX-S1 with ATP under pseudo first-order conditions in the stopped-flow apparatus yielded single exponential tryptophan fluorescence transients (traces not shown). The dependence of the fitted observed rate constants (kobs) of these traces on ATP concentration showed signs of saturation above 250 s-1 as shown in Fig. 1B. This behavior suggests that ATP binding to mX-S1 is a two-step process (K1 and k2 in Scheme 1), and the maximal kobs value largely reflects a first-order isomerization step during the binding process (k2). The ATP hydrolysis step (k3 + k-3) is associated with a further increase in tryptophan fluorescence (cf. Scheme 1), and it may therefore have contributions to the ATP-binding kobs values of Fig. 1B. The quasi-linear part of the plot at low [ATP] indicated an apparent second-order ATP-binding rate constant (k2/K1) of 1.1 μm-1 s-1 (Fig. 1B and Table I). kobs values for ATP binding obtained by monitoring the signal of mant-ATP, a fluorescently labeled substrate, showed a very similar profile to the tryptophan results (Fig. 1B and Table I).Scheme 1Equilibrium constants are expressed as dissociation constants or for first-order transitions in a left-to-right direction in all schemes.Arrows for associating or dissociating components are omitted for clarity in all schemes except Scheme 4.

In a single turnover experiment shown in Fig. 1C, cleavage of ATP followed a biphasic time profile with the fast burst phase being rate-limited by ATP binding and the slow phase by product release that is slower than the ATP cleavage step. The equilibrium constant of ATP hydrolysis in the enzyme-bound state (K3) was 0.3 ± 0.1, as calculated from the amplitude data (K3 = Afast/Aslow). The results of multiple turnover quenched-flow experiments in which 1 μm mX-S1 was mixed with a large excess of ATP (50 μm) confirmed the above K3 value and gave a kobs of the burst of 67 ± 15 s-1, indicating that ATP binding is still rate-limiting at this ATP concentration (i.e. the ATP hydrolysis rate constant (k3 + k-3) is greater than this kobs value, traces not shown; see Fig. 1B and Table I).Phosphate release from the mX-S1·ADP·Pi complex was monitored using a fluorescently labeled Pi-binding protein (MDCC-PBP). The time course of Pi release on mixing 1 μm mX-S1 with 0.6 μm ATP (single turnover conditions) was a single exponential with a kobs of 0.03 s-1, a value identical to the steady-state ATPase activity of mX-S1 in the absence of actin, as measured by an NADH-linked coupled assay (traces not shown; Table I). This indicates that the Pi release is rate-limiting in the basal (i.e. in the absence of actin) ATPase cycle of mX-S1, with its kobs being determined by the kinetic partitioning in the hydrolysis step (K3) and the fundamental Pi release rate constant (k4) as kobs,Pi = k4K3/(1 + K3) (Scheme 1 and Table I).Although most of the above features of the basal mX-S1 ATPase cycle are similar to those of other myosins, the ADP interaction of mX-S1 showed some remarkably unusual properties. On mixing mX-S1 with ADP in the stopped-flow under pseudo first-order conditions, the single exponential kobs values of the recorded tryptophan fluorescence transients slightly increased with increasing [ADP] and saturated around the low value of 4 s-1 (Fig. 2A). At first glance, the data could seem to indicate a low affinity single step binding mechanism with a relatively high intercept (koff ≈2 s-1) and a small linear slope (kon < 0.1 μm-1 s-1). However, the ADP binding affinity should then be low (Kd = koff/kon >20 μm), which is ruled out by the fact that the amplitudes of the transients showed saturation at much lower ADP concentrations (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.2 μm, Fig. 2A, inset). Another possible explanation for the obtained kobs values comes from a two-step model (cf. the right part of Scheme 1 comprising K5 and K6, viewed right to left in the direction of ADP binding). In this model the ADP-binding process consists of an initial rapid equilibrium (K6, no signal change on this step) followed by a slower reversible isomerization accompanied by a fluorescence increase (K5). The intercept of Fig. 2A will thus be mostly determined by k5 (≈1.5 s-1, going left-to-right in Scheme 1); the maximal kobs will indicate k5 + k-5 (≈4.5 s-1), and half-saturation will occur at [ADP] = K6 (≈5 μm). To test further the validity of this model, we performed ADP “chasing” stopped-flow experiments in which equilibrium mixtures of mX-S1 and ADP were rapidly mixed with mant-ATP in at least 5-fold excess over ADP to ensure that ADP dissociation after the rapid mix is essentially irreversible (Fig. 2B). The observed mant-ATP fluorescence transients were biphasic throughout the examined [ADP] range (Fig. 2B, inset). The fractional amplitude of the slow phase (Aslow/(Afast + Aslow)) was saturated at 0.73 ± 0.02 and reached half-maximum at 1.7 ± 0.2 μm ADP. These data are consistent with the above two-step mechanism inasmuch as the fractional amplitude of the fast phase is determined by the combined fractional population of the M and MD species (cf. Scheme 1) that allows fast binding of mant-ATP, whereas the slow phase comes from M*D first slowly isomerizing to MD, then losing ADP, and binding mant-ATP. At high [ADP], the Afast/Aslow ratio will then equal [MD]/[M*D] (because[M] = 0 in the preincubation mixture) and thus K5 = 0.37 ± 0.03. Furthermore, at high [ADP], kfast and kslow will equal k6 (= 15 s-1, left-to-right in Scheme 1, cf. Fig. 2B, inset) and k5 (= 1.3 s-1), respectively. From the experimental data shown in Fig. 2, A and B, all rate and equilibrium constants of the two-step ADP-binding process can be calculated as shown in Table I.Fig. 2ADP interaction of mX-S1 in the absence of actin.A, observed rate constants (kobs) of single exponential fits to tryptophan fluorescence transients obtained on mixing 0.4 μm mX-S1 with different concentrations of ADP in the stopped-flow. The inset shows relative amplitudes of the same reactions (fluorescence level before mix was taken as unity). A hyperbolic fit to the amplitude data yielded a maximal relative amplitude of 0.085 ± 0.002 with half-saturation at 1.0 ± 0.2 μm ADP. Note the breaks in the x axes of both panels. B, fractional amplitude of the slow phase (= Aslow/(Afast + Aslow))of the double exponential mant-ATP fluorescence transients on rapid mixing of 0.5 μm mX-S1 plus the indicated ADP concentrations with mant-ATP (in at least 5-fold molar excess over ADP) in the stopped flow. The data were fitted to a hyperbola to yield a maximal fractional amplitude of 0.73 ± 0.02 for the slow phase with half-saturation at 1.7 ± 0.2 μm ADP. The inset shows traces for two of the data points. Trace 1 was obtained on mixing 0.5 μm mX-S1 and 2 μm ADP with 50 μm mant-ATP (kfast = 48 s-1 (59% amplitude); kslow = 2.8 s-1 (41%)). In trace 2, 0.5 μm mX-S1 and 60 μm ADP was mixed with 300 μm mant-ATP (kfast = 13 s-1 (29% amplitude); kslow = 1.3 s-1 (71%)). Pre-mixing concentrations are indicated in this panel. C, observed rate constants (kobs) of single exponential fits to tryptophan fluorescence transients recorded on rapidly mixing 0.7 μm mX-S1 with a pre-mixture of 50 μm ATP plus ADP at the indicated concentrations (solid symbols). The open symbols indicate the fitted rate constants of simulated time courses obtained using the kinetic model described in the text. Traces 1–3 of the inset are experimental tryptophan fluorescence transients of the data points at 0, 50, and 500 μm ADP, respectively (fitted rate constants are 70, 12, and 3.9 s-1). Conditions were as in Fig. 1. Error bars indicate fitting errors of kobs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2C shows experiments that provide a further confirmation of the above model. Here 0.7 μm mX-S1 was mixed in the stopped flow with a nucleotide mixture consisting of 50 μm ATP and various ADP concentrations. The resulting tryptophan fluorescence transients were fitted to single exponentials (Fig. 2C, inset). It is noteworthy that when the two nucleotides were in equimolar amounts, the kobs of the trace (12 s-1, trace 2 in Fig. 2C, inset) was only 17% that in the absence of ADP (70 s-1, trace 1). This behavior rules out a slow, single step binding of ADP with a kobs around 4 s-1 (cf.Fig. 2A). The open symbols in Fig. 2C show the kobs values of single exponential fits to simulated fluorescence transients based on a model of competitive binding of ATP (k2/K1 = 1.4 μm-1 s-1) and ADP (k5 = 1.1 s-1, k-5 = 3.1 s-1, k6 = 15 s-1, k-6 = 3 μm-1 s-1, cf.Scheme 1, rate constants estimated from the above experimental results) to mX-S1 where the tryptophan fluorescence enhancement assigned to ATP binding was twice that of the MD ↔ M*D transition (no fluorescence change occurs on step 6). The simulated transients were clearly double exponential in most cases, but single exponential approximations were applied because the experimental signal-to-noise ratio did not allow the resolution of multiple phases (cf.Fig. 2C, inset). This approximation was fully suitable for the discrimination of the two ADP-binding models discussed above.A chasing experiment in which the pre-mixture of 0.7 μm mX-S1 and 50 μm ADP was rapidly mixed with 500 μm ATP gave a tryptophan fluorescence increase transient with a fitted single exponential kobs of around 16 s-1 (trace not shown). This value is remarkably higher than the intercept of the ADP-binding transients in Fig. 2A. This behavior is consistent with the two-step model described in the previous paragraph, which predicts this experiment to yield a transient consisting of a major phase dominated by k6 (≈15 s-1) and a slower phase (k5 ≈1.2 s-1) with a small amplitude (the two phases did not appear separate because of the low experimental signal-to-noise ratio).Actin Activation of the Steady-state ATPase Activity—The steady-state ATPase activity of mX-S1 was ∼100-fold activated by actin to a Vmax around 4 s-1 as measured by an NADH-linked coupled enzyme assay (Table II and Fig. 3). Although the Vmax value was fairly independent of solution ionic strength, the actin concentration needed for half-maximal activation (KATPase) markedly increased with increasing ionic strength (Table II). This behavior is characteristic of myosins in which the so-called weak actin-binding (ATP or ADP·Pi-bound) myosin states are the predominant steady-state intermediates in the actomyosin ATPase cycle. The steady-state data are in line with those reported by Homma et al. (9Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigated the role of IRS-2 in skin epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Although skin is not a classical insulin target tissue, we have previously demonstrated that insulin, via the insulin receptor, is essential for normal skin cell physiology. To identify the role of IRS-2 in skin cells, we studied cells isolated from IRS-2 knock-out (KO) mice. Whereas proliferation and differentiation were not affected in the IRS-2 KO cells, a striking effect was observed on glucose transport. In IRS-2 KO keratinocytes, the lack of IRS-2 resulted in a dramatic increase in basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The increase in glucose transport was associated with an increase in total phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt activation. In contrast, fibroblasts lacking IRS-2 exhibited a significant decrease in basal and insulin-induced glucose transport. We identified the point of divergence, leading to these differences between keratinocytes and fibroblasts, at the IRS-PI 3-kinase association step. In epidermal keratinocytes, PI 3-kinase is associated with and activated by only the IRS-1 protein. On the other hand, in dermal fibroblasts, PI 3-kinase is exclusively associated with and activated by the IRS-2 protein. These observations suggest that IRS-2 functions as a negative or positive regulator of glucose transport in a cell-specific manner. Our results also show that IRS-2 function depends on its cell-specific association with PI 3-kinase. The insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) protein is one of the major insulin-signaling substrates.

Our results also show that IRS-2 function depends on its cell-specific association with PI 3-kinase. The insulin-signaling pathway exists in many cells, and is mediated through the insulin receptor (IR). 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; dGlc, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IRS-1 KO, IRS-1 knockout; IRS-2 KO, IRS-2 knockout; PI, phosphatidylinositol; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. However, the effects it has on various tissues are diverse. It is well known that liver, muscle, and adipocytes are the major targets of insulin. In these tissues, insulin-induced signaling pathways regulate major metabolic responses. These include increased glucose transport into muscle and adipocytes, increased glycogen and lipid synthesis, and decreases in gluconeogenesis and glucose release from the liver. However, through its receptor, insulin regulates processes in nonclassical insulin target tissues as well. For example, the lack of IR in pancreatic β-cells results in defective pancreatic development (1Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), which leads to a selective impairment of glucose-dependent insulin release and diabetes. In the heart (2Belke D.D. Betuing S. Tuttle M.J. Graveleau C. Young M.E. Pham M. Zhang D. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Litwin S.E. Taegtmeyer H. Severson D. Kahn C.R. Abel E.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), insulin signaling plays an important developmental role in regulating postnatal cardiac size, myosin isoform expression, and the switching of cardiac substrate utilization from glucose to fatty acids. It has also been found that deleting IR in neurons results in increased food intake and moderate diet-dependent obesity as well as impaired spermatogenesis and ovarian follicle maturation due to the hypothalamic dysregulation of luteinizing hormone (3Bruning J.C. Gautam D. Burks D.J. Gillette J. Schubert M. Orban P.C. Klein R. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. Kahn C.R. Science. 2000; 289: 2122-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). These surprising observations raise a question as to the molecular basis behind the different effects of insulin among the various tissues, especially among the nonclassical insulin target tissues. To answer it, the specific molecules participating in the insulin-induced signaling pathways in each tissue must be identified. After being activated by insulin, the IR engages and phosphorylates downstream signal proteins, initiating an intracellular signaling cascade. The first known downstream proteins phosphorylated by the activated IR are the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family of proteins (4White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Of the IRS family, the IRS proteins that are considered to play the most important role in mediating insulin signaling are IRS-1 and IRS-2. The IRSs act as docking proteins between the IR and a complex network of intracellular signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 domains. One such signaling protein is the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (4White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 5Giovannone B. Scaldaferri M.L. Federici M. Porzio O. Lauro D. Fusco A. Sbraccia P. Borboni P. Lauro R. Sesti G. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which plays a central role in the metabolic actions of insulin (4White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). To understand the role of these individual proteins in the diverse molecular mechanisms activated by insulin, knockout mice carrying null mutations of the genes encoding IRS-1 (6Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) or IRS-2 (7Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) were developed. From studies performed on inactivated IRS-1 and IRS-2, it became clear that each of these proteins has a unique role. Disruption of IRS-1 in mice retarded animal growth, but diabetes did not develop (6Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In contrast to the IRS-1 KO mice, disruption of IRS-2 impaired both peripheral insulin signaling and pancreatic β-cell function. As a result, IRS-2-deficient mice showed progressive deterioration of glucose homeostasis and developed diabetes (7Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). From these findings, it is clear that the IRSs are essential in mediating the specific metabolic roles of insulin in the classical insulin target tissues and that they participate in insulin-regulated processes in other tissues as well. For the last few years, we have investigated the role of insulin signaling in skin. In previous studies, we have shown that functional IR is expressed in cultured murine skin keratinocytes (8Wertheimer E. Trebicz M. Eldar T. Gartsbein M. Nofech-Mozes S. Tennenbaum T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 24-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have also shown that insulin increases the glucose transport rate, induces proliferation, and enhances differentiation in epidermal cells. Moreover, we have found that a lack of IR expression abolishes these insulin-induced processes (9Wertheimer E. Spravchikov N. Trebicz M. Gartsbein M. Accili D. Avinoach I. Nofech-Mozes S. Sizyakov G. Tennenbaum T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, there are several skin pathologies associated with impaired insulin signaling, the most severe being impaired wound healing (10Wertheimer E. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2004: 1411-1422Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that insulin signaling in skin is essential for normal skin function. Following our understanding that each of the IRS proteins possesses a unique role in the insulin-signaling pathway in different tissues, we focused in the present study on the role of the IRS-2 protein in skin cells. We used the IRS-2 KO mouse model to determine the impact of IRS-2 on the two major components of skin, the dermal compartment and the overlying epidermis. Our results clearly demonstrate that the role of IRS-2 in mediating insulin-induced glucose transport is divergent in the skin epidermal keratinocyte and dermal fibroblasts. Moreover, these results further suggest that impairment in IRS-2 function can lead to an abnormality in cellular functions and may contribute to the development of diabetes-associated skin pathologies. Animals—Homozygous IRS-2 null mice and wild type (WT) littermates were obtained by crossing heterozygous IRS-2 null mice, as previously described (7Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J.

Mice were genotyped using the PCR method (7Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Animal experiments were approved by the appropriate institutional committee and performed in compliance with the rules for animal care of the National Institutes of Health. Cell Culture and Protein Lysate Preparation—Primary mouse keratinocytes were prepared and maintained as previously described (8Wertheimer E. Trebicz M. Eldar T. Gartsbein M. Nofech-Mozes S. Tennenbaum T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 24-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated keratinocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries), 1% antibiotics, and Ca2+ at a concentration adjusted to 0.05 mm. The cells were grown for 6–7 days in culture, depending on the experimental design. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and grown to confluence. Cells were then harvested by scraping them into lysis buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 200 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was spun down at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge, and the Triton-soluble supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Lowry assay (DC Protein Assay Kit; Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting Analysis—The protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (11Wertheimer E. Barbetti F. Muggeo M. Roth J. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7587-7592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the IR β subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), the anti-p85 PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit, which recognizes all the isoforms of the regulatory subunits (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt antibody recognizing phosphorylated Ser473 of mouse Akt1 (Cell Signaling, Inc., Beverly, MA), and monoclonal antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine residues (Upstate Biotechnology). Filters were then incubated with the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) or anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) antibodies. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence protein detection kit (SuperSignal; Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation—Confluent cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 or 15 min, in the presence or absence of 10–6m insulin (Sigma). The reaction was terminated by aspiration of the incubation medium, followed by quick washes with ice-cold PBS on ice. Cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the aforementioned antibodies and incubated on protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 16–20 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with cold lysis buffer, subjected to immunoblotting, and visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Roche Applied Science). 2-Deoxy-[3H]Glucose Uptake—Glucose transport was evaluated by measuring 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose ([3H]dGlc) according to a previously described method (12Wertheimer E. Sasson S. Cerasi E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with insulin (10–6m; Sigma) or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; 10–7m; PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) and then washed three times with PBS. A solution of 0.1 mm dGlc/PBS with trace amounts of [3H]dGlc (1 μCi/plate; ARC, St. Louis, MO) was added to the cells. Uptake was allowed to continue for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by three quick washes with 1 ml of cold PBS on ice. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100. The samples were counted in the 3H window of a Tricarb scintillation counter. Uptake was linear under these conditions for up to 15 min (data not shown). Mean values were determined from measurements of triplicate samples. Thymidine Incorporation—Cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml; ICN, Irvine, CA) for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100. The radioactivity incorporated into the cells was counted in the 3H window of the Tricarb liquid scintillation counter. Mean values were determined from measurements of triplicate samples. Adenovirus Vectors—The recombinant adenoviral construct, which encodes a WT IRS-2 protein, was constructed as described (13Lingohr M.K. Dickson L.M. McCuaig J.F. Hugl S.R. Twardzik D.R. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An adenoviral construct containing a luciferase reporter gene was used as a control to exclude the effects of the infection procedure. For infection, the proliferated cells were cultured in medium containing the adenoviruses for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were subjected to experiments 48 h after infection. The adenoviruses were applied at the multiplicity of infection indicated in each experiment. PI 3-Kinase Activity Assay—In vitro phosphorylation of PI was carried out as follows. Total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated as described above, using anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with the following buffers; buffer I (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), buffer II (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and buffer III (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 100 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2 containing 0.1 mg/ml sonicated PI (Sigma) and 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) for 10 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μlof1 m HCl, and the phospholipids were extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v). After centrifugation for 10 min, the organic phase was collected and extracted again with an equal volume of 1 m HCl/MeOH (1:1, v/v). Aliquots (30 μl) from the bottom organic phase were spotted on a silica gel TLC plate (Merck). The plate was developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (90:70:17:3), dried, and visualized by autoradiography with x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The Expression Profile of Insulin-signaling Molecules Is Similar in Both Epidermal and Dermal Skin Cells—The goal of the present study was to compare insulin signaling in two nonclassical insulin target cells composing the skin tissue, epidermal keratinocytes, and dermal fibroblasts. These two cell types are not only proximal to each other; they also work coordinately in many processes regulated by insulin, in particular the wound healing process. In the present study, we focused mainly on the role of one of the insulin-signaling molecules, the IRS-2 protein, by comparing its roles in skin epidermal and dermal cells. For this purpose, we utilized transgenic mice lacking IRS-2 expression. Initially, we followed the expression and phosphorylation of the first steps of the insulin-signaling pathway, of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2, in primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts. As expected, Western blot experiments revealed that in the WT cells, these three insulin-signaling molecules are expressed and activated in response to insulin. In the IRS-2 KO cells, IRS-2 protein was not detected in either keratinocytes or fibroblasts (Fig. 1, A and B). IR was similarly expressed and phosphorylated in the WT and IRS-2 KO skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts, regardless of the level of IRS-2 expression. There was only a slight increase in the expression and insulin-induced activation of IRS-1 protein in both IRS-2 KO cell types. These results suggest that there is only a partial compensatory mechanism of insulin-induced IRS-1 activation in skin cells lacking IRS-2 expression. IRS-2 Is Not Involved in Regulating the Proliferation of Skin Cells—Insulin is an essential growth factor for the proliferation of many cells, including skin cells (8Wertheimer E. Trebicz M. Eldar T. Gartsbein M. Nofech-Mozes S. Tennenbaum T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 24-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This is supported by the reduction in the proliferation rate of skin cells lacking IR (9Wertheimer E. Spravchikov N. Trebicz M. Gartsbein M. Accili D. Avinoach I. Nofech-Mozes S. Sizyakov G. Tennenbaum T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether keratinocytes and fibroblasts lacking IRS-2 expression retain their ability to proliferate. We studied the cellular proliferation of primary cultured cells isolated from WT and IRS-2 KO mice by measuring thymidine incorporation. As can be seen in Fig. 2, A and B, no significant change in thymidine incorporation rate was detected in IRS-2 KO keratinocytes or fibroblasts in comparison with their WT counterparts. We can therefore conclude that IRS-2 is not involved in skin proliferation. In subsequent experiments, we followed the involvement of IRS-2 in another process known to be regulated by insulin, namely skin epidermal differentiation (8Wertheimer E. Trebicz M. Eldar T. Gartsbein M. Nofech-Mozes S. Tennenbaum T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 24-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Wertheimer E. Spravchikov N. Trebicz M.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and again, direct regulation by IRS-2 was not apparent (data not shown). Differential Effects of the Lack of IRS-2 Protein on Glucose Transport in Skin Cells—Both skin epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts are nonclassical insulin target tissues. Neither of these cell types responds to acute insulin stimulation by rapidly increased glucose transport. However, in previous studies, we have demonstrated the importance of insulin and the IR in chronic regulation of glucose transport into skin cells (9Wertheimer E. Spravchikov N. Trebicz M. Gartsbein M. Accili D. Avinoach I. Nofech-Mozes S. Sizyakov G. Tennenbaum T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Spravchikov N. Sizyakov G. Gartsbein M. Accili D. Tennenbaum T. Wertheimer E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We thus aimed to evaluate the function of IRS-2 in the regulation of glucose transport into skin cells. We examined basal and insulin-induced glucose uptake in proliferating keratinocytes isolated from IRS-2 KO and WT mice (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, the lack of IRS-2 resulted in a 2-fold increase in basal glucose transport into skin epidermal keratinocytes relative to the WT mice. There was an even more dramatic increase, 4–10-fold, in the glucose transport rate in response to insulin stimulation, as compared with the response in WT epidermal cells. One possible explanation for the increase in glucose transport in the IRS-2 KO cells may be a change in expression or cellular localization of one of the glucose transporters (15Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). From the family of glucose transporters, GLUT-1 is the main glucose transporter expressed in primary skin keratinocytes (9Wertheimer E. Spravchikov N. Trebicz M. Gartsbein M. Accili D. Avinoach I. Nofech-Mozes S. Sizyakov G. Tennenbaum T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we have studied the expression and localization of the GLUT-1 protein, and there was no relationship between the increase in glucose uptake in cells of the IRS-2 KO mice and the cellular or membranal expression of the GLUT-1 protein (data not shown). Following these intriguing findings, we studied the effects of a lack of IRS-2 on the glucose transport rate into the second major skin cell type, dermal fibroblasts. In contrast to epidermal cells, we witnessed a decrease in basal glucose transport in IRS-2 KO fibroblasts compared with the WT cells (Fig. 3B). Insulin stimulation resulted in an increase in glucose transport into the IRS-2 KO fibroblasts, but it remained slower than the glucose transport rate into the WT cells. Therefore, we propose that in skin epidermal cells, IRS-2 plays a unique inhibitory role in the regulation of glucose transport. Consequently, the lack of IRS-2 results in removal of the inhibitory effects, and as a result, there is an increase in the glucose transport rate into the cells. In contrast, in dermal fibroblasts, IRS-2 plays a stimulatory role in the regulation of glucose transport, and the lack of its expression leads to a down-regulation of the glucose transport rate into the cells. Effects of IRS-2 Overexpression on Glucose Transport Rate in Skin Cells—To further confirm this unexpected finding, we undertook the opposite experiment; IRS-2 was overexpressed in both epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Overexpression of IRS-2 resulted in a marked decrease in basal glucose uptake into epidermal keratinocytes as well as into epidermal keratinocytes chronically stimulated by insulin (Fig. 4A). In contrast, IRS-2 overexpression in dermal fibroblasts had no such effect (Fig. 4B). These results further support the putative negative regulatory role that IRS-2 plays in glucose transport into skin keratinocytes. Differential Activation of PI 3-Kinase in Skin Cells Lacking IRS-2 Expression—To further support our theory, we studied the activation of proteins downstream of IRS-2 in the signaling pathway of glucose transport regulation. Our goal was to determine whether they are similarly activated. IRS proteins are known to mediate their effects on glucose transport via the PI 3-kinase-Akt/protein kinase B signaling pathway. Thus, we first investigated the effects of a lack of IRS-2 on total PI 3-kinase phosphorylation and activity rates in both skin epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 5, A, B, and C and D, E, and F, respectively). As shown in Fig. 5, A–C, overall basal and insulin-induced PI 3-kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 5A) and activation (Fig. 5, B and C) were elevated in the IRS-2 KO epidermal keratinocytes as compared with the WT. On the other hand, a slight decrease in the total cellular PI 3-kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 5D) and activity rates (Fig. 5, E and F) was observed in the IRS-2 KO dermal fibroblasts as compared with the normal cells. Differential Activation of Akt in WT and IRS-2 KO Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts—To further support these results, we assessed the phosphorylation levels of Akt, known to be a key downstream mediator of PI 3-kinase in cellular glucose transport. As can be seen in Fig. 6, A and B, there was an increase in Akt phosphorylation levels in the IRS-2 KO keratinocytes compared with the WT. These results are in agreement with the observed increase in the glucose transport rate in the IRS-2-deficient keratinocytes and are consistent with the proposed inhibitory role of IRS-2 in the IRS-1-PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. In contrast, in the IRS-2-deficient fibroblasts, a significant insulin-induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation levels was observed (Fig. 6, C and D), consistent with the suggested stimulatory role that IRS-2 plays in mediating glucose transport in the fibroblasts. The IRS-PI 3-Kinase Association Is the Point of Divergence between the Signaling Pathways of Normal Skin Epidermal Keratinocytes and Dermal Fibroblasts—As already mentioned, the lack of IRS-2 expression differentially affects the regulation of glucose transport in skin epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that despite the lack of IRS-2 in epidermal keratinocytes, the activity of the PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway, which mediates glucose transport, is elevated. In contrast, we showed that the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway is inhibited in dermal fibroblasts lacking IRS-2 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that the differences in glucose transport regulation are upstream of PI 3-kinase and that different proteins associate with this kinase. Therefore, our next step was to investigate the mediation of PI 3-kinase association and activation by either IRS-2 or IRS-1. Cells were stimulated with insulin, and total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against IRS-2 or IRS-1. The IRS-associated PI 3-kinase was identified by immunoblotting with anti-PI 3-kinase antibody or by in vitro PI 3-kinase activity assay. In skin epidermal keratinocytes, PI 3-kinase was exclusively associated with and activated by IRS-1. PI 3-kinase did not associate with IRS-2 (Fig. 7, A–C). In contrast, in fibroblasts, the insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase was exclusively associated with and activated by IRS-2. PI 3-kinase did not associate with IRS-1 (Fig. 7, D–F). We concluded that the differential association of the IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins with PI 3-kinase probably indicates a point of divergence between the IRS proteins in the two cell types. Insulin-stimulated PI 3-Kinase Activation in IRS-2-deficient Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts—To study whether the IRS-1-PI 3-kinase interaction is affected by the absence of IRS-2, we measured IRS-2 and IRS-1 association with PI 3-kinase as well as the IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity resulting from this interaction, skin cells isolated from the IRS-2 KO mice, and control littermates. A lack of IRS-2 in either epidermal keratinocytes or dermal fibroblasts was not compensated by increased interaction between PI 3-kinase and the IRS-1 protein (Fig. 8, A and C, respectively); nor was there an increase in the IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in these cells (Fig. 8, B and D, respectively). These findings are intriguing due to the fact that the total PI 3-kinase activity in the IRS-2 KO keratinocytes was increased (Fig. 5), suggesting a non-IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activation process. Insulin is a central metabolic regulatory hormone, involved in the regulation of glucose transport into muscle, fat, and liver, the classical insulin target tissues. In recent years, however, the significance of other effects of insulin in “nonclassical” tissues has been under investigation. This field of research has markedly expanded due to the availability of tissue-specific KO mice, in which the insulin effects on an individual tissue can be studied without the development of general metabolic consequences (16Kitamura T.

Here we present evidence that Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, requires PLD activation to mediate survival pathways in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells under oxidative stress. The H2O2-induced phosphorylation of two Pyk2 sites (Tyr580, and Tyr881) was suppressed by 1-butanol, an inhibitor of transphosphatidylation by PLD, and also by transfection of catalytically negative mouse PLD2K758R (PLD2KR). Furthermore, we found that PLD2 was associated with Pyk2 and Src, and that activation of PLD2 was required for H2O2-enhanced association of Src with Pyk2 leading to full activation of Pyk2. H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and was abolished by 1-butanol but not t-butanol. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt activation in response to H2O2 was reduced by transfection of either PLD2KR or the dominant negative Pyk2DN. This study is the first demonstration that PLD2 activation is implicated in Src-dependent phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881) by promoting the complex formation between Pyk2 and activated Src in PC12 cells exposed to H2O2, thereby resulting in activation of the survival signaling pathway PI3K/Akt/p70S6K.

Direct or indirect tyrosine phosphorylation has been thought to be involved in PLD activation in response to H2O2 exposure. In HL60 cells, PLD1 is directly phosphorylated by peroxyvanadate (20Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20660-20664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Min et al. (13Min D.S. Kim E.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Our previous studies have suggested that Pyk2 and/or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and ERK1/2 were involved in H2O2-induced PLD activation by using their inhibitors in PC12 cells (14Ito Y.

However, despite many investigations, the biological roles and the exact mechanisms of the oxidant-induced PLD activation remains to be elucidated. Several reports show that the survival signaling via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is activated by stresses such as heat, hyperosmotic stress, and H2O2 (21Konishi H.

There are reports suggesting that the PLD stimulation participates in the pro-survival signaling at the early stage of the apoptotic process (16Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Foster D.A.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that actinomycin D-induced apoptosis was prevented by PLD1 or PLD2 overexpression through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting the notion that PLD plays a role in stimulation of cell survival pathway (28Yamada M. Banno Y. Takuwa Y. Koda M. Hara A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism underlying the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway via PLD has not been defined. In the present study, we have attempted to gain further insight into the role of PLD activation in response to oxidative stress in PC12 cells and have shown that PLD activation was involved in the PI3K/Akt activation through protein-tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Src. Thus, these results provided evidence indicating a novel role for PLD2 in the Pyk2/PI3K/Akt pathway that acts as a survival signaling in response to H2O2.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-PLD1 and -PLD2 antibodies were prepared as described previously (28Yamada M. Banno Y. Takuwa Y. Koda M. Hara A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and the chemiluminescence kit (ECL system) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Expression plasmids containing wild-type and catalytically negative mouse PLD2 (K758R) in pCGN were kindly supplied by Dr. Michael A. Frohman (Center for Developmental Genetics and Department of Pharmacology, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY). All other reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources. Cell Culture and Transfections—The PC12 cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Y. Sugimoto (Shirakawa Institute of animal Genetics, Fukushima, Japan). PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 100 units of penicillin G/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml as described previously (14Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to the subconfluent stage at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transient transfection PC12 cells were plated at 8 × 105 in 100-mm dishes and transfected with plasmid DNA (pCGN-catalytically inactive mouse PLD2 (K758R) or PRK5-dominant negative Pyk2 (Tyr402F,Y881F)) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the following day the transfected cells were placed in serum-free medium and left for 6 h before treatment with H2O2 in the presence of vanadate. Measurement of PLD Activity—PLD activity was assessed by measuring the formation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol by transphosphatidylation. PC12 cells were subcultured in 35-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish and grown for 3 days. The subconfluent cells were labeled for 3 h with [3H]palmitic acid (3 μCi/dish), washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitors and 100 μm Na2VO4, and 1-butanol was added at a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v) and further incubated for 10 min. Cells were then treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by removal of the assay medium followed by the immediate addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/methanol (2:5, v/v) mixture to the culture dishes. After extraction of cellular lipids, [3H]phosphatidylbutanol was separated by TLC on silica gel LK6D plates using a solvent system of an upper phase of ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/water (13:2:3:10, by volume) as previously described (14Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The amount of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol formed was expressed as the percentage of the total radioactivity recovered from the TLC plate. Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Assay—PI3K activity was assayed as described previously (27Banno Y. Takuwa Y. Yamada M. Takuwa N. Ohguchi K. Hara A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 363-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) and p110β PI3K antibodies, and PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitates was assayed using PI as substrate. Western Blot Analysis—After growing to subconfluence in growth medium in 100-mm dishes, PC12 cells were incubated for 6 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and with 100 μm Na2VO4 or other agents for 30 min before treatment with 0.5 mm H2O2 or EGF, harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium cholate, 1% SDS,1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4), and sonicated. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The total cell lysate (50–100 μg protein) was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylation of Akt, ERKs, p70S6K, Pyk2, and Src was measured by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Ser473-phosphorylated Akt, Tyr204-phosphorylated ERK1/2, Thr421/Ser424-phosphorylated p70S6K, Tyr401-, Tyr580-, and Tyr881-phosphorylated Pyk2, and Tyr416-phosphorylated Src, respectively. Total amounts of Akt, ERK1/2, p70S6K, Pyk2, and Src were determined by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt, ERKs, p70S6K, Pyk2, or Src, respectively. After repeated washes, bound antibodies were detected using the ECL Western-blotting detection system. The density of protein bands was determined with a densitometer (Atto densitograph, Version 2.5; Atto Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitation Analysis—For immunoprecipitation, 300 μg of protein of cell lysate was diluted with 300 μl of the buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride, pH 7.4, and 2 μg of the appropriate antibody (anti-PLD2, anti-Pyk2, or anti-Src) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose 4B overnight. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with the same buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and then boiled for 10 min. Proteins were separated as described for Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of Src and Pyk2 in H2O2- or EGF-stimulated PC12 Cells—Our previous studies have demonstrated that H2O2-induced PLD activation in PC12 cells was inhibited by protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as PP2, genistein, and herbimycin, but enhanced in the presence of vanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (14Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J.

Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2271-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These observations lead us to assume that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 expressed in this cell may regulate its activity. However, PLD2 tyrosine phosphorylation by H2O2 was marginal, and direct phosphorylation of the enzyme was unlikely to stimulate the activity. Other studies also report that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD enzyme is not involved in the regulation of its activity (29Parinandi N.L. Roy S. Shi S. Cummings R.J. Morris A.J. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Mehta S. Maglio J. Kobayashi M.S. Sipple A.M. Horwitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The depletion of exogenous Ca2+ by EGTA resulted in a complete abolishment of H2O2-mediated PLD activation in PC12 cells (14Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2278-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was then considered that Src-type protein-tyrosine kinase and a Ca2+-dependent proline-rich cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase (Pyk2), which is highly active in PC12 cells, should be involved in H2O2-mediated up-regulation of PLD activity in PC12 cells. It has been reported that autophosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr402) leads to Src activation, which causes further phosphorylation of two other tyrosine residues (Tyr580, Tyr881) in the C terminus of Pyk2, resulting in the full activation of Pyk2 (31Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 32Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K.

Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). We examined phosphorylation of Src and Pyk2 (Tyr402, Tyr580, and Tyr881) after H2O2 treatment of PC12 cells. For site-specific phosphorylation of Pyk2, the antibodies were used that specifically recognize phospho-Pyk2 (Tyr402, autophosphorylation and Src binding site; Tyr580, regulatory kinase activation loop; Tyr881, Grb2-SH2 binding site) in PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, in the presence of vanadate, H2O2 induced a rapid, remarkable tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and three Pyk2 sites (Tyr402, Tyr580, and Tyr881). Similar levels of Pyk2 phosphorylation were observed in three tyrosine phosphorylation sites. On the other hand, upon stimulation with EGF, tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and these three Pyk2 sites was much weaker. The PLD activation in response to H2O2 was much higher than EGF stimulation in PC12 cells (data not shown), suggesting involvement of PLD activation in phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Src. Involvement of PLD Activation in Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Src and Pyk2 in PC12 Cells Exposed to H2O2—We examined involvement of Src and PLD in site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. As depicted in Fig. 2A, the blockade of Src kinase by PP2 prevented phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881) but not autophosphorylation at Tyr402, which is the binding site for the SH2 domain of Src (31Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In fact, the dominant negative Pyk2 (Y402F,Y881F; Pyk2DN) prevented H2O2-induced Src phosphorylation in PC12 cells (data not shown). Therefore, activation of Src via Pyk2-dependent mechanism was likely to occur in PC12 cells exposed to H2O2. To examine the involvement of PLD in the Pyk2 and Src tyrosine phosphorylation, we used 1-butanol, which inhibits PA generation by PLD activation and t-butanol, its inactive analogue. As shown in Fig. 2, A and C, 1-butanol, but not t-butanol, caused reduction of phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881) but not Pyk2 (Tyr402) and Src tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, there were no inhibitory effects of 1-butanol on EGF-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Src (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that PLD activation is involved in phosphorylation at Tyr580 and Tyr881 but not Tyr402 of Pyk2 and Src phosphorylation. To ascertain the involvement of PLD activation in Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881) phosphorylation induced by H2O2, we have transfected catalytically inactive PLD2-cDNA (K758R; PLD2KR) into PC12 cells and examined phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881). Overexpression of PLD2KR significantly reduced the H2O2-induced phosphatidylbutanol formation as compared with that of the vector control (Fig. 3A). In PLD2KR-overexpressed PC12 cells, H2O2-induced Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881) phosphorylation was much reduced (Fig. 3, B and C), whereas phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr402) and Src was not affected. These results provided confirmative support for data from the experiments with 1-butanol (Fig. 2, A and C), indicating that PLD2 was implicated in phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881) via Src activation in PC12 cells exposed to H2O2. Association of PLD2 with Pyk2 and Src in Control and PLD2KR-overexpressed PC12 Cells—It has been known that Pyk2 has both kinase and scaffolding functions and that in many cell systems, Pyk2 is associated with Src and other SH2-containing proteins including PI3K (32Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Avraham H. Park V. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells the requirement for both Pyk2 and Src in H2O2-induced PLD activation suggests that these kinases would be associated with PLD2. Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach, we found that PLD2 and Pyk2 were co-immunoprecipitated in PC12 cells stimulated with H2O2 or EGF, indicating that PLD2 and Pyk2 are physically associated in PC12 cells (Fig. 4, A–D). Furthermore, to confirm the role of PLD2 activity in association with Pyk2, we examined the Pyk2 association in PLD2KR-overexpressed PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 4E, the PLD2KR overexpression attenuated both basal and H2O2-induced association of Pyk2 with PLD2. This suggests that the PLD2 association with Pyk2 requires its catalytic site. Next, we examined the association of PLD2 and Src. The cell lysates of PC12 cells stimulated with H2O2 or EGF were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibody. As shown in Fig. 4F, PLD2 was co-immunoprecipitated with Src, suggesting association of PLD2 with Src as observed in other cell types (29Parinandi N.L. Roy S. Shi S. Cummings R.J. Morris A.J. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Ahn B.H. Kim S.Y. Kim E.H. Choi K.S. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.H. Chang J.S. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Min D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3103-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the association of PLD2 with Src was increased 2-fold by stimulation of H2O2 but not EGF. Furthermore, this association was markedly reduced by enforced expression of PLD2KR in PC12 cells exposed to H2O2 compared with the vector control (Fig. 4G, upper panel). It has previously been shown that Src interacts with Pyk2 upon stimulation of PC12 cells with various agonists, leading to phosphorylation of Pyk2 (31Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 32Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol.

Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). We have then checked involvement of the PLD activation induced by H2O2 in the association of Src and Pyk2. As shown in Fig. 4G, lower panel, stimulation with H2O2 induced association of Src with Pyk2 in empty vector-transfected cells, but this association was greatly suppressed in PLD2KR-expressed cells. It is, thus, of great interest to note that PLD2 activation is required for complex formation between Pyk2 and activated Src. Further studies are required to define the mechanism by which PLD activation regulates its association with Src and the Pyk2/Src interaction, although intracellularly generated PA via PLD2 activation would be considered to participate in these interactions. Taken together, it was indicated that the association of PLD2 with Pyk2 and with Src is independent of and dependent on PLD2 activation, respectively, and also that the Pyk2/Src interaction is enhanced by PLD2 activation. Involvement of PLD2 Activation in Phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in H2O2-treated PC12 Cells—Previous studies have suggested that the H2O2-induced PLD2 activation in PC12 cells is involved in the anti-apoptotic process (16Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the precise mechanism of the role of PLD2 activation remains to be elucidated. It has been reported that oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces the activation of mitogenic or survival signaling, including serine/threonine protein kinase Akt and ERK1/2 (6Guyton K.Z.

In PC12 cells, both Akt and Erk1/2 were phosphorylated by H2O2 in a time-dependent manner, although their temporal profiles were distinct from those observed in EGF stimulation (Fig. 5A). Phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 by H2O2 showed slow increases peaking at 10 and 20 min, respectively, whereas EGF induced rapid increases in their phosphorylation. In PC12 cells, bradykinin, and carbachol have been shown to transactivate EGF receptor leading to ERK1/2 activation (35Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 36Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, Pyk2 is implicated in calcium ionophore- and phorbol ester-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation via a direct interaction with Src (32Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To know which pathway mediates H2O2-induced Akt and ERK activation, we examined the effect of a specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor-tyrosine kinase, AG1478, on phosphorylation of these kinases in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment of PC12 cells with AG1478 reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to H2O2 by ∼80%, whereas it completely blocked EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. On the other hand AG1478 had no significant effect on the H2O2-induced Akt phosphorylation under the condition where EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation was completely abolished. These results suggest that H2O2-induced ERK1/2 activation was largely dependent on EGF receptor transactivation, but Akt activation was not. To examine the upstream events of H2O2-induced Akt activation, PC12 cells were pretreated with various inhibitors, including genistein, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), and calcium chelator (EGTA) and then exposed to H2O2. H2O2-induced Akt phosphorylation was reduced by LY294002 and genistein in a dose-dependent manner and was diminished by EGTA (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that Akt phosphorylation in response to H2O2 was mediated by PI3K and calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase, Pyk2. Next, we examined involvement of PLD activation in Akt and ERK1/2 activation after H2O2 treatment. As depicted in Fig. 6C, the pretreatment of PC12 cells with 1-butanol abolished H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Akt but not ERK1/2. However, the same treatment did not affect EGF-induced phosphorylation of either Akt or ERK1/2. It is, thus, interesting to note that PLD activation participates in H2O2-induced Akt activation but not in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 was independent of PLD activation. As described above, H2O2-induced Akt activation was likely to be dependent on PI3K by using LY294002 (Fig. 6, A and B). To ascertain this notion, we examined PI3K activation by H2O2 exposure. H2O2 caused marked stimulation of PI3K activity, but this activation was suppressed by 1-butanol (Fig. 7A), suggesting involvement of PLD in PI3K activation. However, PI3K activation by EGF stimulation was not prevented by 1-butanol (data not shown). It was also observed that p110 β-type, but not p110α-type, was attributed to the H2O2-induced PI3K activation (Fig. 7B). Moreover, to assess whether PLD activity is involved in H2O2-induced PI3K activation, PC12 cells were transfected with PLD2KR-cDNA. Fig. 7B showed that overexpression of PLD2KR attenuated activation of PI3Kβ. The activation of PI3Kβ by H2O2 was also repressed in Pyk2DN-overexpressed cells (Fig. 7, B and D). Accordingly, as expected, Akt phosphorylation induced by H2O2 was reduced by overexpression of either PLDKR or Pyk2DN (Fig. 7, C and D). Taken together, it was indicated that PLD2 activity was implicated in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway mediated through Pyk2/Src in PC12 cells exposed to H2O2. It has recently been reported that PLD activation is involved in the proliferation signaling pathway through mTOR/p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), where mTOR is activated by direct interaction with PA generated by PLD activation (39Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells p70S6K was markedly phosphorylated by stimulation with H2O2 (Fig. 8). However, the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K was completely abolished by either LY294002 or 1-butanol. In contrast, p70S6K phosphorylation induced by EGF was not affected by these inhibitors. These results suggested that PI3K-dependent p70S6K activation induced by H2O2 was regulated by the upstream PLD activation, which is required for full activation of Pyk2. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that PLD2 is associated with Pyk2 and Src in PC12 cells where the Pyk2 acts as a scaffold protein. As indicated in Fig. 9, we could demonstrate a possible implication of PA generated by H2O2-induced PLD2 activation in Src-dependent phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr580 and Tyr881). Furthermore, we showed that PLD2 activation by H2O2 was most likely to participate in stimulation of the PI3K/Akt/p70S6K pathway via Pyk2/Src activation involved in regulation of cell survival of PC12 cells. On the other hand, the major pathway of H2O2-induced ERK activation, which is mediated by transactivation of EGF receptor, was independent of PLD2 activation in PC12 cells."

Unassembled immunoglobulin heavy chains are retained intracellularly by delayed folding of the CH1 domain and irreversible interaction of BiP with this domain. Here we show that the three CH1 cysteines play a central role in immunoglobulin folding, assembly, and secretion. Remarkably, ablating all three CH1 cysteines negates retention and enables BiP cycling and non-canonical folding and assembly. This phenomenon is explained by interdependent formation of intradomain and interchain disulfides, although both bonds are dispensable for secretion. Substituting Cys-195 prevents formation not only of the intradomain disulfide, but also of the interchain disulfide bond with light chain, BiP displacement, and secretion. Mutating the light chain-interacting Cys-128 hinders disulfide bonding of intradomain cysteines, allowing their opportunistic bonding with light chain, without hampering secretion. We propose that the role of CH1 cysteines in immunoglobulin assembly and secretion is not simply to engage in disulfide bridges, but to direct proper folding and interact with the retention machinery.

Not only do conformation, structure, and oligomeric state control quality and functional properties of antibodies, but they are also critical for Ig secretion. Two heavy (HC) and two light (LC) chains form disulfide-bonded HC2LC2 molecules. Each Ig chain consists of several similar compact domains, each comprising two twisted β sheets stabilized by a single intradomain disulfide (1Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IgG assembly is stabilized by an interchain disulfide between CL, the LC constant domain, and CH1, the first HC constant domain (2Secher D.S. Milstein C. Adetugbo K. Immunol.

The CH1 domain confers retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on unassembled HCs, and despite its high degree of similarity to other constant domains, only CH1 is retarded in folding and is unable to cycle from the ER chaperone BiP (3Vanhove M. Usherwood Y. Hendershot L.M. Immunity. 2001; 15: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Only upon LC expression is BiP displaced from CH1, which completes its folding, allowing assembly of HC2LC2 and secretion (4Haas I.G. Wabl M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar), its associations with Ig HC and LC are among the best characterized. In vivo, BiP binds transiently to nascent LC via the unfolded VL domain and is released when this domain folds (9Knittler M.R. Haas I.G.

BiP also binds HC, where in addition to its interaction that seems irreversible with CH1, it binds transiently other domains. In vitro studies defined specific heptameric sequences throughout LC and HC, which serve as BiP binding sites (18Davis D.P. Khurana R. Meredith S. Stevens F.J. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3842-3850PubMed Google Scholar, 20Knarr G. Gething M.J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The affinity for binding sites in CH1 is not obviously different from that for other heptamers, so presumably, BiP binding sites in the incompletely folded CH1 remain exposed, enabling continued interaction with BiP and ER retention (3Vanhove M. Usherwood Y. Hendershot L.M. Immunity. 2001; 15: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Kaloff C.R. Haas I.G.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that CH1 is unique in its propensity to expose BiP binding sites following CH2 and CH3 homodimerization, because CH1 is the only constant domain unable to homodimerize (7Kaloff C.R. Haas I.G. Immunity. 1995; 2: 629-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Knarr G. Gething M.J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recognizing the unique folding status of CH1, we undertook to identify structural elements within this domain, which control folding, chaperone interactions, and retention of unassembled HC. Several lines of evidence focused our attention on cysteines in CH1. Contribution of exposed thiols to ER retention is well documented (22Davis A.C. Roux K.H. Pursey J. Shulman M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of LC, CH1-conferred retention could have resulted from continued exposure of the LC-interacting cysteine. However, even without such a cysteine, a truncated γ1 HC containing only VH and CH1 was still not secreted (21Lee Y.K. Brewer J.W. Hellman R. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although this construct could no longer form the CL-CH1 disulfide, its CH1 oxidative folding, reflected by intradomain disulfide bond formation and consequent secretion, still required LC (21Lee Y.K. Brewer J.W. Hellman R. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hence, possible contribution of the LC-interacting cysteine to CH1-conferred retention should be in the context of the two additional CH1 cysteines, which form the intradomain disulfide. In this work we studied possible interrelations between all three CH1 cysteines, and, as shown below, substituting each of them with serine, singly or in combinations, yielded surprising structure-function relationships with respect to folding, assembly, and secretion. Remarkably, a mutant chain lacking all three CH1 cysteines was secretion-competent. We provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon by showing that, although in CH1 neither the intradomain nor the interchain native disulfide was essential for secretion, these bonds affect each other's formation. In addition to providing a molecular basis for the coordinated folding of CH1 and its assembly with LC (7Kaloff C.R. Haas I.G. Immunity. 1995; 2: 629-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we discuss a model in which CH1 cysteines employ thiol-mediated retention, and their interplay maintains the stable BiP binding of unassembled Ig HC. Plasmid Construction—All mutant γ constructs were based on pJDEVNPCγ2b, containing genomic DNA encoding full-length murine γ HC with a known constant region (Ref. 28Kataoka T. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Yamagishi H. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; accession number j00461). The CH1 exon, flanked by intronic sequences, was excised with EcoRI and PvuII. A NotI-containing linker was ligated to the vector at the EcoRI and PvuII sites, generating the CH1-less pJDEVNPCγ2bΔCH1. Exons CH1, CH2, or CH3 were PCR-amplified, using primers (Table I) and pJDEVNPCγ2b as a template, and subcloned into pBluescript (pBS, Stratagene) at EcoRI and XbaI sites, to generate pBS-CH1, pBS-CH2, and pBS-CH3, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses of CH1 were performed using pBS-CH1 as a template and either forward mutagenic primer (Table I) or the complementary (reverse) mutagenic primer. The mutated CH1 was cut by EcoRI and XbaI and inserted into pBS. Double and triple mutations in CH1 were introduced successively. All DNA constructs were sequenced. Wild-type and mutated CH1, as well as CH2 and CH3, were excised from the respective pBS constructs and re-introduced into pJDEVNPCγ2bΔCH1 with EcoRI and NotI. Amplification and mutagenesis of λI was performed by PCR (see primers in Table I) on pTM1-λI cDNA (29Elkabetz Y. Kerem A. Tencer L. Winitz D. Kopito R.R. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol.

Cells (∼50% confluent) were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (30Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with 5 μg of the various γ constructs, with or without equimolar amounts of the pJDEλI vector encoding genomic full-length murine λI LC (14Dul J.L.

Where indicated, 8 μg of constructs encoding HA-tagged wild-type or T19G BiP (31Davis P.D. Raffen R. Dul L.J. Vogen M.S. Williamson K.E. Stevens J.F. Argon Y.

Metabolic Labeling and Steady-state Analyses—Secretion was monitored by re-feeding cells with 1.5 ml of fresh medium that was collected after 3–5 h. For metabolic labeling, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine-deficient medium and then either pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml) and chased in complete medium, or labeled for 3–4 h. In all experiments, cells and media were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (300 μl/2 × 106 cells) in ice-cold NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 100 units/ml aprotinin (Roche Applied Science). For samples analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, the phosphate-buffered saline and NET buffers included freshly added N-ethylmaleimide (20 mm, Sigma). Cell lysates were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were collected. Immunoprecipitation, Treatment with Glycosidases, and Electrophoresis—Protein A-Sepharose (Repligen) was added to cell lysates or media to quantitatively precipitate γ and associated proteins. To promote BiP release, 10 mm Mg2+-ATP was added to the lysates, whereas otherwise apyrase (10 units/ml, Sigma) was included to prevent the release of BiP (3Vanhove M. Usherwood Y. Hendershot L.M. Immunity. 2001; 15: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Samples were rotated for 4 h at 4 °C, washed three times with borate wash buffer (7Kaloff C.R. Haas I.G. Immunity. 1995; 2: 629-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Where indicated, immunoprecipitated proteins were treated with endoglycosidase H (endo H) or peptide: N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. For detection of metabolically labeled proteins, blots were autoradiographed and quantified by densitometry. Subsequently, blots were probed with the following antibodies: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse γ2b (SouthernBiotech), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse λI (SouthernBiotech), biotin-conjugated anti-BiP (SouthernBiotech) followed by HRP-conjugated avidin (Jackson), anti-HA (clone 12CA5) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson). The HRP was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis of intracellular HCs was carried out on Protein A precipitates under optimized time, temperature, and enzyme concentrations. Papain (Sigma) was added at 5 μg/ml to precipitates resuspended in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5)/50 mm cysteine/1 mm EDTA and incubated at 37 °C. Precipitates resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline were either incubated at 30 °C with 5 μg/ml of trypsin (Difco) or at 37 °C with 0.1 μg/ml elastase (ICN). Homology Modeling and Sequence Alignment—The potential BiP binding sites were based on alignment of high BiP-binding score heptapeptides (32Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) with CH1 sequence of γ2b (28Kataoka T. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Yamagishi H. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Structural alignment of CH1 of γ2b was carried out via the Swiss-Model web site and using as template the sequence of an identical CH1 whose structure is available (Protein Data Bank ID: 1MAM (33Rose D.R. Przybylska M. To R.J. Kayden C.S. Oomen R.P. Vorberg E. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). The coordination between CH1 oxidative folding and its covalent assembly with CL (7Kaloff C.R. Haas I.G. Immunity. 1995; 2: 629-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the well documented contribution of exposed thiols to ER retention raised the possibility that the 3 CH1 cysteines are key determinants in these processes. This hypothesis was tested by Cys-to-Ser substitutions of relevant cysteines, singly, or in combinations. We disrupted formation of either intradomain or interchain disulfides and investigated in vivo the interrelations between these bonds. Based on conserved cysteine positions in multiple Ig constant domains (1Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rose D.R. Przybylska M. To R.J. Kayden C.S. Oomen R.P. Vorberg E. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we anticipated that in CH1 of mouse γ2b HC (designated γ), Cys-140 and Cys-195 formed the intradomain disulfide, whereas Cys-128 formed the interchain bond with LC (see Fig. 6, below). Each mutant was expressed with or without λI LC (designated λ) in non-lymphoid COS-7 cells, where its fate could be assayed in the absence of endogenous HC and LC. We first validated COS-7 cells as a system to study the intracellular fate of γ, based on retention of wild-type HC (WT; Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 13; Fig. 1B; for intracellular expression of the non-secreted WT, see Fig. 3A, lane 1) and efficient secretion ofaCH1-deleted HC (ΔCH1; Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 14; Fig. 1B) or upon replacement of CH1 by either CH2orCH3 domains ((CH2)2 or (CH3)2, respectively; Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 15, 4, and 16; Fig. 1B). These experiments confirm and extend previous reports, that, despite their similar fold, neither CH2 nor CH3 can confer retention even when grafted in place of CH1. Importantly, all secreted HC consisted mostly of γ2, indicating that CH1 absence did not hamper HC homodimerization.Fig. 3Hindered formation of CH1 intradomain disulfide in C128S allows opportunistic disulfide bonds that involve the normal Cys214 of λ LC.A, COS-7 cells were transfected with genomic constructs encoding WT or C128S mutant of γ with (+) or without (–) λ-encoding construct. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with genomic constructs encoding WT or C128S mutant of γ together with cDNA encoding either wild-type (WT) or mutants λ (C214S and C214A). Cells were lysed, and γ was precipitated by Protein A-Sepharose (IP: Protein A) from medium (m) or from lysed cells (c). Precipitated proteins were resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (PAGE: NR) and electroblotted, and blots were probed with anti-γ2b (IB: anti-γ; A, lanes 1–8; B, lanes 1–12) and re-probed with anti-λ (IB: anti-λ; A, lanes 9–16; B, lanes 13–24) antibodies. The lower panels represent longer exposures of the monomeric γ section (γox, γred) from blots probed with the anti-γ2b antibody. The remnants of γ2 (panel B, lanes 16–24) probably reflect incomplete stripping from the abundant γ2 prior to re-probing, because anti-λ does not recognize γ when used first. The data are representative of four independent experiments. γ, HC monomers; γox, γred, monomers with oxidized or reduced CH1; γ2, homodimers; γλ, γ2λ, γ2λ2, assembly species; λ, co-precipitated non-covalently bound LC; arrows, the altered migration of C128S-containing γ2λ and γ2λ2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Secretion of WT was restored in the presence of λ LC (Fig. 1, B and C). Because λ was not directly precipitated by Protein A (Ref. 12Hellman R. Vanhove M. Lejeune A. Stevens F.J. Hendershot L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and Fig. 1D), its co-precipitation reflected covalent assembly into the secreted species γλ, γ2λ, and γ2λ2 (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 13, and 25). In addition, λ escorted the γ2λ intermediate non-covalently, as shown by co-precipitation of monomeric λ in addition to a 125kDa species (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 25). This conclusion was verified by size-exclusion chromatography, where all secreted WT species were ∼150-kDa tetramers, regardless of their covalent assembly status (Supplemental Fig. S1). HCs lacking CH1 (either deleted or replaced) did not interact with co-expressed λ (Fig. 1C, lanes 26–28) nor was their secretion improved by λ (Fig. 1, A–C), corroborating their LC-independent secretion. The association of BiP with intracellular WT, but not when CH1 was either deleted or replaced (Fig. 1E), confirmed that the CH1-conferred retention was due to BiP binding. BiP was displaced from WT by co-expression of λ, and to a lesser extent by ATP (Fig. 1E, lanes 1–3; Fig. 1F). The only partial dissociation of HC and BiP by ATP (Fig. 1F) likely reflects their rebinding as nucleotide is degraded (see Ref. 18Davis D.P. Khurana R. Meredith S. Stevens F.J. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3842-3850PubMed Google Scholar). Ablation of All Three CH1 Cysteines Negates CH1-conferred Retention—Substituting each of the 3 CH1 cysteines with serine, singly or in combinations, yielded surprising structure-function relationships with respect to folding, assembly, and secretion. When expressed without LC, these mutants could be divided into two categories. The majority resembled WT and were retained intracellularly, whereas a few mutants were secreted, resembling HCs that lacked CH1 altogether. The most remarkable example of a mutant that was secreted efficiently in the absence of LC was the triple mutant C128S/C140S/C195S (Fig. 1A, lanes 11 and 23; Fig. 1B). In this mutant all 3 CH1 cysteines, which normally stabilize the conserved Ig fold, were ablated. Moreover, C128S/C140S/C195S did not interact with λ LC, even non-covalently (Fig. 1C, lane 35), and neither its interaction with BiP (Fig. 1F) nor its secretion (lanes 11 and 23 in Fig. 1, A and C; Fig. 1B) were affected by LC. Several lines of evidence confirmed the bona fide secretion of C128S/C140S/C195S. First, similar maturation of N-glycans, reflected by retarded mobility and resistance to endo H, was observed for WT secreted in the presence of LC (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) or for C128S/C140S/C195S secreted without LC (Fig. 2A, lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16). Interestingly, secreted C128S/C140S/C195S was resolved into γ and a unique higher assembly species designated γ2* (see below), both resistant to endo H and sensitive to peptide: N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2A, lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16; arrows). Second, C128S/C140S/C195S acquired galactose residues, as detected by Ricinus communis agglutinin, 2Y. Elkabetz, Y. Argon, and S. Bar-Nun, our unpublished observation. indicating that this mutant traversed the trans-Golgi. Third, secretion of both γ and γ2* was completely blocked by brefeldin A (Fig. 2B). Although γ2* was preferentially detected in the medium, its accumulation in brefeldin A-treated cells (Fig. 2B, lane 3) indicated that it assembled within cells and was immediately secreted. Mutation of Cys-195 Hampers Interchain Disulfide Formation, Causes Misfolding, and Prevents Secretion—The secretion of C128S/C140S/C195S may appear as a hierarchical contribution of exposed thiols to HC retention. As shown in Fig. 1A and quantified in Fig. 1B, when all three cysteines were present, HC retention was complete (lanes 1 and 13); substituting Cys-128 (C128S) enabled only slight LC-independent secretion (lanes 5 and 17); substituting both Cys-128 and Cys-140 (C128S/C140S) led to more significant secretion (lanes 8 and 20), and ablating all 3 CH1 cysteines resulted in efficient LC-independent secretion (lanes 11 and 23). However, this apparent hierarchy did not apply to every cysteine in CH1. Disruption of the CH1 intradomain disulfide by substituting both Cys-140 and Cys-195 did not alleviate retention (Fig. 1B). Moreover, co-expression of LC allowed us to use the ability of the various mutants to assemble with λ, dissociate from BiP, and be secreted as a criterion to further divide the non-secreted HCs into two categories: the properly folded ones that resembled WT and were secreted, and the misfolded ones that were not secreted even in the presence of LC. In this respect, the CH1 domain of the C140S/C195S was severely misfolded, because this mutant was unable to assemble with λ, either covalently or non-covalently (Fig. 1C, lane 34), even though Cys-128 was intact (see Fig. 6). We next asked whether disrupting the intradomain disulfide by singly mutating Cys-140 or Cys-195 was equivalent to the pairwise substitution in C140S/C195S. Evidently, a mutant lacking only Cys-195 resembled the double mutant C140S/C195S, because C195S was neither secreted (Fig. 1B) nor assembled with λ (Fig. 1C, lane 31), and what appeared as LC-facilitated secretion was negligible and hardly contained γ-only species not associated with LC (Fig. 1, B and C (lanes 7, 19, and 31)). Intracellular C195S seemed to be as misfolded as C140S/C195S, because even in the presence of λ it associated with BiP in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 1F) and did not bind LC (Fig. 1C, lane 31) even though Cys-128 was intact. Indeed, ablation of Cys-128 in addition to Cys-195 (C128S/C195S) resulted in a phenotype very similar to that of C195S (Fig. 1, A–C; see also Fig. 6). When the intradomain disulfide bond was disrupted by mutating Cys-140 alone, the resulting C140S was as efficiently retained as C195S or C140S/C195S (Fig. 1, A (lanes 6 and 18) and B). However, unlike these mutants, C140S responded to the presence of LC like WT. C140S assembled reasonably efficiently into γ2λ and γ2λ2 (Fig. 1C, lanes 18 and 30), dissociated from BiP (Fig. 1F) and was secreted (Fig. 1, B and C (lanes 6, 18, and 30)). We conclude that a CH1 domain lacking Cys-140, one of the two cysteines that make up the native intradomain disulfide bond, is not misfolded, whereas CH1 lacking its partner Cys-195 is (see Fig. 6). Mutation of Cys-128 Retards CH1 Oxidation and Allows Opportunistic Interchain Disulfides without Hampering Secretion—The failure to form the interchain disulfide in the absence of Cys-195, which forms the intradomain disulfide, suggested interrelations between these two bonds. We therefore performed a reciprocal experiment and disrupted the interchain disulfide by substituting Cys-128. Without LC, C128S was secreted only marginally (5% of ΔCH1 secretion; Fig. 1B). However, C128S was not nearly as misfolded as C195S, because it resembled WT (Fig. 3A). In the presence of LC, C128S dissociated from BiP (Fig. 1F) and was secreted efficiently (Figs. 1B, 1C (lanes 5, 17, and 29), and 3A). As expected, the major secreted covalent form of C128S was γ2 rather then γ2λ or γ2λ2 (Figs. 1C (lanes 17 and 29) and 3A). Because WT γ2 was hardly secreted (Fig. 3A, lane 4), it suggested that when a LC-interacting cysteine was absent, the secreted γ2 species of C128S was associated non-covalently with two λ LCs, as corroborated by the abundant free LC co-precipitated by Protein A (Fig. 3A, lane 16). Interestingly, a λ-containing species of ∼47kDa, which was not formed when λ was expressed alone (Fig. 1D), was also co-precipitated from cells and media of C128S-expressing cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 15 and 16). This species is most likely disulfide-bonded λ2 homodimers that are formed only when Cys-128 is absent, as discussed elsewhere. 3Y. Elkabetz, A. Ofir, Y. Argon, and S.

https://openalex.org/W2116069895,"The mammalian molecule melanotransferrin (mTf), also called p97, is a member of the transferrin family of molecules. It exists in both secreted and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored forms and is thought to play a role in angiogenesis and in transporting iron across the blood brain barrier. The binding affinity of iron to this molecule has not been formally established. Here, the binding of ferric ion (chelated with a 2-fold molar ratio of nitrilotriacetate) to mTf has been studied using isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. One iron-binding site was determined for mTf with similar binding characteristics to other transferrins. In the absence of bicarbonate, binding occurs quickly with an apparent association constant of 2.6 × 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>–1</sup> at 25 °C. The presence of bicarbonate introduces kinetic effects that prevent direct determination of the apparent binding constant by isothermal titration calorimetry. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms of mTf unfolding in the presence and absence of iron were therefore used to determine the apparent binding constant in the bicarbonate-containing system; at pH 7.5 and 25 °C, iron binding occurs in a 1:1 ratio with a <i>K<sub>app</sub></i> of 4.4 × 10<sup>17</sup> m<sup>–1</sup>. This affinity is intermediate between the high and low affinity lobes of transferrin and suggests that mTf is likely to play a significant role in iron transport where the high affinity lobe of transferrin is occupied or where transferrin is in proportionally low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1980234995,"In addition to the σ32-mediated heat shock response, the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE molecular chaperone system of Escherichia coli directly adapts to elevated temperatures by sequestering a higher fraction of substrate. This immediate heat shock response is due to the differential temperature dependence of the activity of DnaJ, which stimulates the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP, and the activity of GrpE, which facilitates ADP/ATP exchange and converts DnaK from its high-affinity ADP-liganded state into its low-affinity ATP-liganded state. GrpE acts as thermosensor with its ADP/ATP exchange activity decreasing above 40 °C. To assess the importance of this reversible thermal adaptation for the chaperone action of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system during heat shock, we used glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and luciferase as substrates. We compared the performance of wild-type GrpE as a component of the chaperone system with that of GrpE R40C. In this mutant, the thermosensing helices are stabilized with an intersubunit disulfide bond and its nucleotide exchange activity thus increases continuously with increasing temperature. Wild-type GrpE with intact thermosensor proved superior to GrpE R40C with desensitized thermosensor. The chaperone system with wild-type GrpE yielded not only a higher fraction of refolding-competent protein at the end of a heat shock but also protected luciferase more efficiently against inactivation during heat shock. Consistent with their differential thermal behavior, the protective effects of wild-type GrpE and GrpE R40C diverged more and more with increasing temperature.

The chaperones recognize and interact with hydrophobic peptide segments, which are exposed by nascent polypeptide chains during synthesis and by misfolded proteins during stress, in particular heat shock. The irreversible formation of protein aggregates thus is reduced, increasing the yield of properly folded and refolded native protein.

In DnaK and DnaJ, no conformational changes have been observed between 15 and 48 °C. Consistent with the structural data, the rate of the DnaJ-triggered T→ R conversion follows an Arrhenius temperature dependence, whereas the rate of the GrpE-dependent R→ T conversion increases less and less with increasing temperature and even decreases above 40 °C (12Grimshaw J.P.A.

This familiar heat shock response is mediated by σ32, which directs RNA polymerase to transcribe the particular set of heat shock genes. Within minutes after heat shock, the cellular concentrations of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE are increased ∼2-fold (17Connolly L. Takashi Y. Gross C.A. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts.

Recent experiments with the isolated DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE/ATP chaperone system have shown that a mere increase in temperature suffices to sequester a higher fraction of fluorescence-labeled peptide substrates (11Siegenthaler R.K. Grimshaw J.P.A. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This direct thermal response of the chaperone system is due to the differential temperature dependence of the two co-chaperones, resulting in a shift toward R-state DnaK with high affinity for substrates. Here, we compare the co-chaperone efficiencies of wild-type (WT) GrpE with intact thermosensor and GrpE R40C with desensitized thermosensor during heat shock. The DnaK system with WT GrpE proved superior to that with GrpE R40C in protecting protein substrate against both heat inactivation and aggregation, indicating the importance of the GrpE thermosensor for efficient chaperone action under heat shock conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DnaK was expressed and purified as described previously (19Feifel B.

Throughout this report, the indicated protein concentrations refer to the protomer. Apyrase (grade III) from potato was purchased from Sigma. Its stock solution in water (1 unit/μl) was stored at –80 °C. ATP-Na2 (purity >98%) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were from Fluka. Photinus pyralis luciferase was from Roche Applied Science. The concentration of G6PDH stored in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, at –20 °C was determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard. Luciferase (1 mg/ml) was stored in 0.5 m Tris acetate, pH 7.5, at –80 °C as recommended by the manufacturer.Prevention of Protein Aggregation during Heat Shock Measured by After-heat-shock Refolding in the Presence of the Complete Chaperone System—Thermostable G6PDH, a dimeric enzyme of 104 kDa, was denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6. For heat treatment, the G6PDH solution was prediluted into assay buffer and added (40 μl) to test tubes on ice containing various combinations of the components of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE/ATP system in 30 μl and incubated at 45 °C. Guanidine hydrochloride was thereby diluted 94 times. After heat shock, the lacking components of the chaperone system were added (30 μl) and the solution was incubated at 25 °C. The experiments with luciferase, a thermolabile monomeric enzyme of 60 kDa, were performed the same way with the exception that luciferase was directly denatured by heat. The temperature was controlled with a water bath (±0.1 °C). The extent of ATP hydrolysis during the time course of the experiments was determined as described previously (10Pierpaoli E.V.

E, co-chaperone activity of WT GrpE (•) and GrpE R40C (○) as a function of temperature.

The formation of protein aggregates upon heat denaturation has been measured in vitro by several methods including sedimentation analysis, light scattering, and Congo Red or thioflavin T staining (24Watanabe Y.H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15723-15727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B.

The fraction of aggregated protein that is detected depends on the analytical method used as well as the solubility, size, and shape of the aggregates formed. In this study, we used enzymes as substrates and determined the fraction of refolding-competent protein rather than that of aggregated protein, i.e. we measured the amount of active enzyme recovered after heat shock. To assess the effect of the individual components of the DnaK chaperone system on preventing protein aggregation during heat shock, we subjected the protein substrate to heat shock in the presence of different combinations of chaperones and then let it refold with the complete DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE/ATP chaperone system present. Any observed differences in the yield of refolding thus could be unequivocally attributed to the differential conditions during heat shock. As protein substrates, we used G6PDH and luciferase. Both enzymes had previously been shown to form stable protein aggregates at heat shock temperatures as observed with size exclusion chromatography and light scattering (25Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 28Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol.

After dilution of the denaturant, G6PDH was exposed to a temperature of 45 °C for 15 min in the presence of various combinations of the components of the chaperone system. During the heat shock, G6PDH remained inactive (Fig. 3A) (see also Ref. 29Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9688-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After heat shock, G6PDH was reactivated at 25 °C in the presence of the fully active chaperone system to ∼60% of the activity prior to denaturation if the complete chaperone system including ATP had already been present during heat shock. If ATP had been absent during heat shock, the yield of active enzyme was only ∼30% of the initial activity. The same yield was obtained in the absence of either DnaJ or GrpE during heat shock. When no chaperones had been present during heat shock, the fraction of refolding-competent G6PDH was <10%.Fig. 3The DnaK chaperone system prevents protein aggregation during heat shock.A, chemically denatured G6PDH (see “Experimental Procedures”) was incubated at 45 °C for 15 min in the presence of the indicated components of the chaperone system: DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP (•); DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (▪); DnaK, DnaJ, and ATP (▴); DnaK, GrpE, and ATP (▾); and no chaperone and no ATP (♦). Final concentrations (as indicated throughout) were 250 nm G6PDH, 3.5 μm DnaK, 0.7 μm DnaJ, 0.35 μm GrpE, and 10 mm ATP. After heat shock, the samples were complemented with the lacking components of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE/ATP chaperone system and incubated at 25 °C. The enzymic activity of G6PDH was measured during and after heat shock at different time points and expressed as percentage of the initial activity. The data points were fitted with a double-exponential equation. B, an analogous experiment was performed with 250 nm luciferase. In the case of heat-labile luciferase, the chemical denaturation preceding the heat shock was omitted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In analogous experiments, thermolabile luciferase (25Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) was directly inactivated by heat denaturation at 45 °C (Fig. 3B). After heat shock, luciferase was reactivated at 25 °C to ∼75% of the initial activity if the complete chaperone system including ATP had been present during heat shock. Almost no refolding occurred if DnaJ or ATP had been absent during heat shock. In the absence of GrpE during heat shock, the fraction of refolding-competent luciferase decreased to ∼50%. Apparently, the prevention of aggregation of both G6PDH and luciferase is a dynamic process requiring a continuously running T-R cycle of DnaK. The control of the ATP-driven chaperone cycle not only by DnaJ (30Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The rate of the DnaJ-stimulated T→ R conversion increases exponentially with increasing temperature, whereas the rate of the GrpE-facilitated R→ T conversion increases less and less and even decreases above 40 °C (Fig. 4E) (12Grimshaw J.P.A. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The resulting shift of DnaK toward its R state increases the fraction of substrate that is sequestered by high-affinity DnaK (11Siegenthaler R.K. Grimshaw J.P.A. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).In a first series of experiments, we investigated the protective effect of the chaperone system against protein aggregation as a function of GrpE concentration. To focus on the heat shock phase and to minimize the chaperone effect on the protein substrates during the refolding phase, we inhibited the chaperone system after the heat shock by depleting it of ATP and measured the amount of spontaneously refolding protein substrate (instead of providing identical refolding conditions after heat shock as in Fig. 3). For removing ATP, we used apyrase, an ATP diphosphohydrolase that hydrolyzes ATP into AMP and inorganic phosphate. Apyrase completely inhibits the chaperone-assisted refolding (Fig. 4F). Chemically denatured G6PDH was subjected to a temperature of 48 °C for 15 min in the presence of DnaK, DnaJ, ATP, and varying GrpE concentrations. Subsequently, apyrase was added and the spontaneous refolding of G6PDH at 25 °C was monitored. The fraction of refolding-competent G6PDH depended on the concentration of GrpE (Fig. 4A). The maximum yield of reactivated G6PDH was obtained at a GrpE concentration of ∼1 μm (Fig. 4B). Both lower and higher GrpE concentrations resulted in a lower amount of refolded G6PDH. GrpE shifts the steady state of the DnaK ATPase cycle from the R state toward the T state. Apparently, maximum protection of G6PDH against aggregation requires an optimum steady-state R-state/T-state ratio. The thermosensor control of GrpE thus may be assumed to have an effect on the prevention of protein aggregation during heat shock provided that a temperature-induced decrease in nucleotide exchange activity of GrpE (see Fig. 4E) has the same effect as a decrease in its concentration.In the following series of experiments, we examined with a similar set-up the role of the thermosensor action of GrpE in the protection of protein substrate against aggregation during heat shock. We compared the co-chaperone efficiency of WT GrpE with t"

Previous studies indicated a possible regulatory function of VP22 within nuclei, but how VP22 enters nuclei is unknown. Despite the abundance of basic residues within this protein, no classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif has been identified. To identify the signal directing nuclear accumulation, a series of truncations, internal deletions, and point mutations were constructed. Fluorescence microscopy of cells transfected with VP22 constructs indicated that a sequence of 103 residues is necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. This NLS sequence is conformation-sensitive in contrast to a classical sequential NLS. Energy depletion assays and co-immunoprecipitation suggested that this NLS sequence also binds histone H4, resulting in nuclear retention of VP22. In addition, a mitochondrial targeting sequence was identified at the C-terminal 49 amino acids, which overlapped the sequence required for nuclear targeting. Our findings demonstrate the diversity of VP22 protein to localize within the cell and provide the opportunity for VP22 to direct cargo specifically to different subcellular compartments.

Our findings demonstrate the diversity of VP22 protein to localize within the cell and provide the opportunity for VP22 to direct cargo specifically to different subcellular compartments. VP22 is a major component of the herpesvirus tegument, a viral compartment located between the capsid and envelope. As is true for many viral tegument proteins, the function of VP22 in viral replication and infection is yet to be elucidated. Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: BHV, bovine herpesvirus; NLS, nuclear localization signal; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. VP22 is dispensable for viral growth in cell culture, but deletion of VP22 from the virus genome delays virus growth and greatly reduces virus yield (1Liang X. Chow B. Li Y. Raggo C. Yoo D. Attah-Poku S. Babiuk L.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A herpes simplex virus-1 mutant expressing a truncated form of VP22 has been characterized (2Pomeranz L.E. Blaho J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10041-10054Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly a deletion mutant of VP22 is avirulent in infected cattle, suggesting that VP22 is an important virulence factor and may play a modulatory role in BHV-1 in vivo infection (3Liang X. Chow B. Babiuk L.A. Vaccine. 1997; 15: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although VP22 has no “classical” nuclear localization signal (NLS), it accumulates in the nucleus of infected cells by an unknown mechanism. In the nucleus, VP22 associates with a variety of viral and cellular factors. For example, VP22 binds VP16, an important viral transactivator of early gene expression, and is considered to regulate the function of VP16 (4Elliott G. Mouzakitis G. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7932-7941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VP22 also interacts with template-activating factor I, a chromatin-remodeling protein. Template-activating factor I promotes an ordered transfer of histones to naked DNA, and binding of VP22 to template-activating factor I may regulate the function of template-activating factor I and interfere with nucleosomal deposition of the virus genome in early infection (5Van L.H. Okuwaki M. Hong R. Chakravarti D. Nagata K. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2501-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We previously reported that BHV VP22 also binds nucleosomes, interfering with acetylation of histone H4 (6Ren X.D. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible regulatory role of VP22 in virus infection. Interestingly expression of VP22 in transfected cells up-regulates the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 inducing apoptosis (7Qiu Z. Zhu J. Harms J. Friedrichsen J. Splitter G.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, herpes simplex virus VP22 can bind and traffic mRNA to adjacent cells where the mRNA is translated (8Sciortino M.T. Taddeo B. Poon A.P. Mastino A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8318-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). By importing specific mRNA to target cells, VP22 may prepare cells for the arrival of herpesvirus. Despite a variety of potential functions for VP22 within nuclei, little is known regarding how this protein is transported into the nuclei. BHV-1 VP22 localizes to nuclei in transiently transfected cells in the absence of other viral proteins, suggesting that this process is independent of other viral factors (6Ren X.D. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Harms J.S. Ren X.D. Oliveira S.C. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to delineate the nuclear localization signal of VP22. We constructed a series of truncations and internal deletions of VP22 as fusion proteins with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to visualize their subcellular localization in transfected cells. Our results indicated that nuclear accumulation requires an unusually long sequence comprising 103 amino acid residues. This localization signal is sensitive to disruption of protein conformation, suggesting a non-conventional signal, which depends on its complex protein structure. Energy-depleting assays and co-immunoprecipitation indicated that nuclear retention, resulting from association of the VP22 nuclear retention sequence with histones, is also involved in nuclear accumulation of VP22. Furthermore the C-terminal 49 amino acids of VP22 were identified as a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which functioned only when the conformation of the nuclear localization signal was disrupted. The potential roles of these overlapping signal sequences directing VP22 to different subcellular locations are discussed. Cells—Canine osteosarcoma (D17) cells (ATCC CCL-183), Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (ATCC CCL-22), and mouse neuroblastoma (NXS2) cells (from R. Reisfeld, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mol/liter l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids and Expression Constructs—Plasmids were constructed by subcloning PCR products of VP22 truncations fused to YFP and inserting the products in the BamHI and AgeI sites of pEYFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences). VP22 fragments smaller than 50 amino acids were amplified as a VP22-YFP fusion gene from appropriate VP22-YFP plasmids and digested with BamHI/HpaI and then cloned into the pEYFP-N1 vector. Mutant DNA lacking the encoding sequence for 8 amino acids was synthesized by PCR using pEYFP-VP22-(118–258)-YFP as a template and appropriate forward and reverse primers. The resulting PCR products, containing the entire sequence of vector pEYFP-VP22-(118–258)-YFP except the targeted 8 amino acids, were blunt end-ligated with T4 ligase. A similar method was used to construct glycine substitution mutants (forward primer, 5′-GGC GGG TAC GCC CGG CAG GCG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-GCC CCC GAG CGC GAC GGC CTC-3′). Plasmids that expressed VP22 fragments fused to the SV40 large T antigen NLS (PPKKKRKV) were constructed by amplifying the appropriate VP22 gene segment with forward primers containing the NLS encoding sequence (underlined) (5′-GGG GAT CC A TG CCG CCG AAG AAG AAG CGA AAG GTC ATG GCC CGG TTC CAC AGG CCC-3′ for NLS-VP22-(1–123) and NLS VP22-(1–221); 5′-GGG GAT CC A TG CCG CCG AAG AAG AAG CGA AAG GTC ATG GGG TCC TCC GGC GGC GCC GGG-3′ for NLS VP22-(118–221)) and appropriate reverse primers, and the resulting PCR products were cloned into pEYFP-N1 in the BamHI and AgeI sites. All mutations were verified by sequencing, and expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-YFP antibody (JL-8, BD Biosciences) or rabbit anti-VP22 antiserum prepared in our laboratory. All PCRs were performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Restriction enzymes and T7 DNA ligase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Transfection, ATP Depletion, and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown in 4-well Lab-Tek chambered coverglasses (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) to semiconfluence and transfected with 0.3 μg of DNA/well using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Thirty hours after transfection, cells were washed and examined with an Axiovert S100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). To visualize mitochondria, cells were incubated with 500 nm MitoFluor Red 589 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 40 min at 37 °C, then washed, and examined for YFP or mitochondrial staining. Photographs were taken using a Zeiss Axiocam HRm cooled charge-coupled device camera, and images were edited or overlaid using Zeiss Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss). To block active nuclear import, ATP was depleted by incubating D17 cells with 50 mm sodium azide (Sigma) 30 h after transfection (10Sorg G. Stamminger T. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Fagerlund R. Melén K Kinnunen L Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30072-30078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cells were then examined by fluorescence microscopy 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h after adding sodium azide. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Thirty hours after transfection with VP22 constructs, D17 cells were harvested, and nuclei were separated from cytoplasm using Nuclei EZ Prep (Sigma). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants containing the cytoplasmic components were subjected to Western blot analysis. Briefly nuclei were washed twice with lysis buffer and dissolved in sample buffer. The nuclear or cytoplasmic extract was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Mitochondria were isolated using a mitochondria/cytosol fractionation kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) and detected by Western blot using an anti-mitochondria specific antibody (MTC02, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). VP22-YFP fusion protein was detected with anti-YFP antibody (JL-8, BD Biosciences) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Pierce) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Expression of VP22 containing an internal deletion was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-VP22 antiserum. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—D17 cells were transfected with constructs encoding either NLS-VP22-(1–123) or VP22-(130–232). Cells were collected 40 h after transfection and lysed in 1 ml of M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell extract was precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce) and then incubated with anti-histone H4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads were then added to the cell lysate for a 2-h incubation at room temperature. Agarose beads were washed once with lysis buffer and three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the precipitate was recovered by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Nuclear Accumulation of VP22 Requires a Minimal 103-amino Acid Sequence—Previously we showed that only the C-terminal residues (118–258) were involved in nuclear accumulation (6Ren X.D. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To more precisely define and characterize the NLS within this fragment, successive truncations from either the C or N terminus of VP22-(118–258) were performed. Each truncated VP22 fragment was fused at its C terminus to YFP (Fig. 1A). We investigated the subcellular localization of the VP22 truncations by transfecting plasmids into D17 cells and examining the cells 30 h after transfection by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B). Removal of 12 additional residues from the N terminus or 26 residues from the C terminus of VP22-(118–258) did not alter its nuclear localization pattern (Fig. 1B, panel E). In contrast, further removal of residues from the N or C terminus abolished nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein (Fig. 1B, panels F and G). Thus, the core NLS is comprised of amino acid 130 to a residue between 226 and 232 (Fig. 1B, panels H, I, J, and K). To test whether fragment 130–232 was sufficient for nuclear translocation, VP22-(130–232) was fused to YFP and expressed in D17 cells. As expected, VP22-(130–232)-YFP fusion protein accumulated in nuclei (Fig. 1, B and C, panel L). To confirm the fluorescence microscopy results, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of D17 transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-YFP antibody (Fig. 1C). The presence of fusion protein in the nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts was generally in agreement with the subcellular location observed by fluorescence microscopy except for cells expressing VP22-(1–123)-YFP and YFP alone. In those cells, VP22-(1–123)-YFP or YFP was not detected in nuclei by Western blot, whereas the fluorescence signal appeared evenly distributed throughout the cell. We suspect that the diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm made it appear that these proteins were distributed in the nucleus by fluorescence microscopy. Disruption of a Potential Helix within VP22-(130–232) Severely Impaired Nuclear Transport—Conventional nuclear localization signals involve a short stretch of amino acids (12Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The relatively long amino acid sequence required for VP22 nuclear localization suggests that secondary or higher structure may be critical for nuclear accumulation. Secondary structure prediction software (3D-PSSM, www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm (13Fischer D. Barret C. Bryson K. Elofsson A. Godzik A. Jones D. Karplus K.J. Kelley L.A. Maccallum R.M. Pawowski K.

Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar)) predicted three helices within this region that had 22% similarity to the histone fold motif. To test the importance of the helices, amino acids 180–183 (VAAE) within the long helix of VP22-(130–232) were substituted with four glycine residues. Since glycine disrupts helix formation (15Lyu P.C. Liff M.I. Marky L.A. Kallenbach N.R. Science. 1990; 250: 669-6673Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 16Sahr K.E. Coetzer T.L. Moy L.S.

Kurumizaka H. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12780-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this substitution was predicted to perturb nuclear accumulation of VP22. As expected, when the glycine substitutions were introduced in VP22-(130–232) (Fig. 2A), the resulting mutant lost nuclear accumulation with only diffuse distribution in cells (Fig. 2B, panel B). This result supports the concept that residues within a putative helix in the histone foldlike structure may be critical for nuclear transport or retention. Nuclear Accumulation Correlates with the Ability of VP22 Fragments to Associate with Histone—We previously reported the interaction of full-length VP22 and histones (6Ren X.D. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Association with histones might contribute to VP22 nuclear localization. To address this question, the association between VP22 fragments and histones was examined by an immunoprecipitation assay. An NLS peptide from SV40 large T antigen comprised of 8 amino acids was fused to the N terminus of VP22-(1–123)-YFP, a VP22 truncation that fails to accumulate in the nucleus. The resulting fusion protein localized to the nucleus, most likely through the classic nuclear import pathway, with an efficiency similar to that of VP22-(130–232). However, when cell lysate containing either NLS-VP22-(1–123)-YFP or VP22-(130–232)-YFP was incubated with anti-histone H4 antibody and protein A/G beads, only VP22-(130–232)-YFP co-immunoprecipitated with histone H4 (Fig. 3). Thus, VP22-(130–232) retained nuclear localization and possessed the region that binds histones, whereas NLS-VP22-(1–123) failed to interact with histones. To determine whether VP22 nuclear accumulation correlated with nuclear retention of VP22 through histone binding, an energy-depleting assay was performed. Sodium azide, an ATP-depleting agent, can inhibit active nuclear import and lead to the redistribution of classic NLS-containing proteins throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm (18Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Stochaj U. Rassadi R. Chiu J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2130-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, when protein is retained in the nucleus through association with nuclear components, sodium azide will not affect the distribution of this protein. As expected, nuclear accumulation of VP22-(130–232)-YFP was not altered following a 2-h incubation with sodium azide (Fig. 4A). However, when the NLS-VP22-(1–123)-YFP-transfected cells were incubated with sodium azide, redistribution of NLS-VP22-(1–123)-YFP from nucleus to cytoplasm was observed within 30 min as demonstrated by increased cytoplasmic staining coupled with decreased nuclear staining (Fig. 4B, lower panels). An 8-amino Acid Internal Deletion within the VP22 C-terminal Region Relocates the Fusion Protein to a Different Subcellular Compartment—To further analyze the VP22 nuclear targeting sequence, VP22-(118–258)-YFP was used as a template to construct a series of successive internal deletions, each lacking 8 amino acids (Fig. 5A). Interestingly all internal deletions no longer demonstrated nuclear localization (Fig. 5B). Of the 12 deletions, 10 fragments with internal deletions covering amino acids 130–209 displayed a cytoplasmic filamentous network in the transfected cells, whereas deletions of amino acids 210–217 or 225–233 no longer bound to this network (Fig. 5B, panels J and L). The internal deletions did not possess nuclear trafficking ability and did not interact with histones by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The C-terminal 49 Amino Acids of VP22 Are a Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence—Closer microscopic examination revealed that the abundance and polyphenotype of this cytoplasmic network resembled mitochondria. To confirm whether network-targeting VP22-YFP fusions localized to mitochondria, cells were treated with the mitochondria-specific dye MitoFluor Red prior to microscopy. An overlay of the fluorescent signals from VP22-YFP and MitoFluor Red revealed co-localization of mitochondria and the VP22 fusion-associated cytoplasmic network (Fig. 6, panels A, C, and E). No co-localized image was observed in cells expressing VP22 constructs that did not target mitochondria (Fig. 6, panels B, D, and F). Thus, the 49-amino acid sequence at the C terminus of VP22 is a mitochondria-targeting sequence. Mitochondrial Targeting by VP22-(210–258) Occurs in Other Cells—To determine that mitochondrial targeting by VP22-(210– 258) was not cell type-specific, the fusion protein was expressed in cells other than D17. The VP22 construct was transfected into murine NXS2 neuroblastoma cells followed by fluorescence microscopy. Again the fusion protein localized to a filamentous cytoplasmic network that co-localized with mitochondria stained by MitoFluor Red (Fig. 7, upper panels). In addition, the mitochondrial association was observed in all transfected NXS2 cells, whereas in transfected D17 cells, a diffuse pattern with bright fluorescence intensity was observed in a subpopulation. The diffuse staining pattern likely resulted from extraordinarily high expression of VP22 in these D17 cells, and the subcellular structures were obscured by the intense fluorescence emission from VP22 fusion protein produced in the cytoplasm. The lower expression of VP22 fusion protein did not obscure mitochondrial staining in NXS2 cells. Mitochondrial targeting of VP22-(210–258)-YFP was also observed in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, which are derived from the natural host for bovine herpesvirus (Fig. 7, lower panels). Thus, VP22-(210–258) targeting to mitochondria is not a cell-specific phenomenon. Additional support for VP22 interaction with mitochondria was observed when mitochondria were isolated from cytoplasmic extract, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated with full-length VP22 followed by anti-VP22 antibody. VP22 bound two proteins (60 and 85 kDa) present only in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 8), suggesting specificity of VP22 for mitochondria. To determine whether truncated VP22-(210–258)-YFP could also associate with mitochondria, mitochondria were isolated from transfected cells and subjected to Western blot analysis using a mitochondria-specific or anti-YFP specific antibody (Fig. 9). The data support the trafficking of VP22-(210–258)-YFP to the mitochondria.Fig. 9VP22-(210–258) localizes to mitochondria and is present in the cytoplasm. D17 cells were transfected with VP22-(210–258)-YFP, mitochondria were isolated from cytoplasm, and Western blotting was performed with mitochondria-specific antibody (MTC02, Abcam, 1:2,000) or anti-YFP antibody (JL-8, BD Biosciences, 1:2,000). The mitochondria-specific antibody detected a 60-kDa protein only in the mitochondrial preparation, whereas the anti-YFP antibody detected a 35-kDa protein in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Therefore, VP22-(210–258) associates with mitochondria and is present in the cytoplasm.

Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 22Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), whereas a bipartite NLS consists of two clusters of basic residues separated by 10–12 amino acids, often including proline residues (23Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Previously a C-terminal VP22 fragment (amino acids 118–258) was shown to possess nuclear accumulation similar to that of full-length VP22 (6Ren X.D. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and in the present study, we searched for an NLS within 118–258. A 103-amino acid sequence from residues 130 to 232 was sufficient for nuclear localization, and deletion or insertion of 8 amino acids within this 103-amino acid sequence prevented VP22 accumulation in the nucleus. We reasoned that the 8-amino acid internal deletion may disrupt the secondary or higher structure of the C-terminal domain, a structure that may be required for nuclear localization. The relatively long amino acid sequence required for nuclear localization compared with the classic NLS and the unusual sensitivity to truncations and deletions suggests VP22 does not possess a sequential NLS but rather a conformation-dependent NLS. Recently an increasing number of cellular or viral proteins have been found to utilize nonclassical NLSs for nuclear localization (24Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 25Kretsovali A. Spilianakis C. Dimakopoulos A. Makatounakis T. Papamatheakis J. J. Biol.

Virol. 2002; 76: 7049-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of VP22 has yet to be elucidated, but the minimal 103-amino acid sequence required for VP22 nuclear localization is predicted to be highly structured, containing several potential α-helices including a histone foldlike motif as well as β-turns (3D-PSSM program, www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm). A histone fold motif containing three helices is common to all four core histones as well as a variety of DNA-binding and multimeric proteins (30Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). Interestingly recent studies suggest that a histone fold motif may also be critical for the non-conventional conformation-dependent NLS within the globular domain of core histones (18Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if nuclear localization of VP22 was sensitive to conformational changes, then disrupting the helix structure within the histone foldlike motif might similarly impair nuclear accumulation. Interestingly when the integrity of the longest putative helix was disrupted by substituting four adjacent residues with glycine, the efficiency of nuclear localization by full-length VP22 was greatly reduced, whereas the same point mutations in VP22-(130–232) eliminated nuclear localization (Fig. 2). These findings further support that the non-conventional nuclear localization sequence of VP22 may be sensitive to conformational change. The nuclear localization and retention of VP22 occurs by a non-classical NLS. This VP22 NLS does not have similarity to other known non-classical NLSs such as in Tat or Antennapedia or bipartite NLSs such as in parathyroid hormone-related protein (www.ncbi.hih.gov/blast). An NLS is not identified in VP22 using a SORT or Prosite search. Indeed in a data base search and comparison, the only proteins with sequence similarity to BHV-1 VP22 are VP22 and VP22 homologs encoded by the UL49 gene from other herpesviruses (www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33). In contrast, a BLAST search for similar sequences to the C terminus (amino acids 210–258) revealed only the full-length BHV-1 VP22 (BLAST, FastA). The C terminus of the VP22 homologs is the region of highest diversity, likely leading to the variation in function observed among members of this family. Although further study is needed, this lack of homology suggests several potential mechanisms for the novel functions of VP22-(210–258). There may be conformational or charge factors, or VP22-(210–258) might bind to another mitochondria-targeted protein and piggyback to the mitochondria. The molecular mass of VP22-(130–232)-YFP is ∼40 kDa, which would permit passive diffusion. Small proteins like VP22-(130–232)-YFP can diffuse across the nuclear envelope, and their accumulation would require either constitutively active import rendered by nuclear transport signals, retention in the nucleus by nuclear retention signals, or both. Efficient nuclear accumulation involving both active import and nuclear retention has been demonstrated for other proteins (29Lombardo E. Ramírez J.C. Garcia J. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7049-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We previously reported the interaction of full-length VP22 with histones by far-Western blot analysis (6Ren X.D. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), an observation that makes the retention mechanism attractive. In the present study, retention of VP22-(130–232)-YFP was supported by an energy-depleting assay. When constitutively active import was blocked by sodium azide, VP22-(130–232)-YFP was retained in the nucleus, whereas VP22-(1–123)-YFP redistributed back to the cytoplasm within 30 min. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that VP22-(130–232)-YFP but not VP22-(1–123)-YFP associated with histones, indicating that interaction with histones contribute, at least partially, to nuclear retention of VP22-(130–232). Interestingly two other VP22 truncations, VP22-(210–258) and VP22-(210–232) (data not shown), that did not localize in nuclei still contained information for nuclear retention. Thus, the energy-depleting assay suggested that VP22-(130–232) contains a nuclear retention signal as well as an NLS. Also by studying BHV VP22 internal deletions and truncations, we identified the unusual property of a 49-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence located at the C terminus. Although VP22-(210–258) can target the YFP fusion protein to mitochondria, it is still unclear whether this targeting signal is functional in the context of full-length VP22. We failed to observe mitochondrial association of full-length VP22 in transiently transfected cells. Also conformational change might expose a cryptic linear targeting sequence that directs the deletions to a new subcellular compartment. The target signal requires residues within 210–217 and 225–233. In addition, VP22-(210–258) alone can function as the new targeting sequence (Fig. 5, B and C, panel M), whereas further deletions from the C terminus resulted in loss of cytoplasmic network targeting (Fig. 5B, panel N). Also Fig. 5B, panels A, J, L, and N, shows diffuse staining, whereas other panels show a staining reminiscent of endoplasmic reticulum. Additional studies are required to identify such differences. Recent studies have indicated that mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis. Mitochondrial membrane permeability can be induced during the onset of apoptosis resulting in leakage of apoptogenic factors into the cytoplasm from the mitochondrial intermembrane space leading to a cascade of activated caspases, nuclear damage, and cell death (18Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Lombardo E. Ramírez J.C. Garcia J. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7049-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Virus infection triggers numerous cellular defense responses to limit viral replication; one cellular defense mechanism is apoptosis of the host cells. Some viral proteins, like PB1-F2 of influenza virus, target mitochondria to induce apoptosis and kill host immune cells responding to virus infection (14Kelley L.A. Maccallum R. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that full-length VP22 can induce apoptosis by up-regulating the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 (7Qiu Z. Zhu J. Harms J. Friedrichsen J. Splitter G.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Whether VP22 can affect apoptosis of host cells through interaction with mitochondria during virus infection is of future interest. Here we identified a 103-amino acid sequence that is sufficient for VP22 to target nuclei. The NLS sequence is conformation-sensitive and binds histone H4 permitting nuclear retention. Also a mitochondrial targeting sequence was identified comprising the C-terminal 49 amino acids of VP22 that overlaps the nuclear targeting sequence. These findings demonstrate the diversity of intracellular localization for VP22 and provide the opportunity to specifically direct cargo to a given subcellular compartment. We thank Jerome Harms and Gerard Marriott for helpful discussions."

With these papers, Einstein provided the framework for understanding modern astrophysical phenomena. Conversely, astrophysical observations provide one of the most effective means for testing Einstein's theories. Here, I review astrophysical advances precipitated by Einstein's insights, including gravitational redshifts, gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, the Lense-Thirring effect, and modern cosmology. A complete understanding of cosmology, from the earliest moments to the ultimate fate of the universe, will require developments in physics beyond Einstein, to a unified theory of gravity and quantum physics."
https://openalex.org/W1964441911,"The location of regions that regulate transcription of the murine Emilin1 gene was investigated in a DNA fragment of 16.8 kb, including the entire gene and about 8.7 and 0.6 kb of 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences, respectively. The 8.7-kb segment contains the 5'-end of the putative 2310015E02Rik gene and the sequence that separates it from Emilin1, whereas the 0.6-kb fragment covers the region between Emilin1 and Ketohexokinase genes. Sequence comparison between species identified several conserved regions in the 5'-flanking sequence. Most of them contained chromatin DNase I-hypersensitive sites, which were located at about -950 (HS1), -3100 (HS2), -4750 (HS3), and -5150 (HS4) in cells expressing Emilin1 mRNA. Emilin1 transcription initiates at multiple sites, the major of which correspond to two Initiator sequences. Promoter assays suggest that core promoter activity was mainly dependent on Initiator1 and on Sp1-binding sites close to the Initiators. Moreover, one important regulatory region was contained between -1 and -169 bp and a second one between -630 bp and -1.1 kb. The latter harbors a putative binding site for transcription factor AP1 matching the location of HS1. The function of different regions was studied by expressing lacZ constructs in transgenic mice. The results show that the 16.8-kb segment contains regulatory sequences driving high level transcription in all the tissues where Emilin1 is expressed. Moreover, the data suggest that transcription in different tissues is achieved through combinatorial cooperation between various regions, rather than being dependent on a single cis-activating region specific for each tissue."

Cdc13p is the single essential cyclin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and a member of the cyclin B family. Cdc13p abundance rises during G2-phase and falls as cells progress through mitosis and G1. Cdc13p degradation, mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex, is an important mechanism of Cdk1p inhibition and mitotic exit.

The Cdk1p-cyclinB complex drives entry into mitosis in all eukaryotes (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, progression through the cell cycle requires the function of its Cdk1p (encoded by the cdc2+ gene) both in G1 before the initiation of S-phase and at the G2-M boundary (2Nurse P. Bissett Y. Nature. 1981; 292: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The activity of S. pombe Cdk1p oscillates throughout the cell cycle, peaking as cells enter M-phase (reviewed in Ref. 3Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). This periodicity of Cdk1p is dependent on its cell cycle-specific association with various cyclins, its phosphorylation state, and the activity of an inhibitor of Cdk1p-cyclin function, Rum1p (reviewed in Ref. 1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Unlike many other organisms, S. pombe cells produce relatively few cyclin partners for Cdk1p. Cdc13p is the single essential cyclin in S. pombe (4Martin-Castellanos C. Labib K. Moreno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Mondesert O. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1527-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Fisher D.L. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and a member of the cyclin B family (reviewed in (7Fisher D. Nurse P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). Cdc13p abundance rises during G2-phase and falls slowly as cells progress through mitosis and G1 (8Creanor J. Mitchison J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It functions both to drive the events of mitosis and prevent re-initiation of S-phase (9Hayles J. Fisher D. Woollard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The degradation of Cdc13p as cells exit mitosis is an important mechanism of Cdk1p inhibition and occurs through ubiquitin-triggered proteolysis mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex ubiquitin ligase. The motif specifying Cdc13p degradation has been mapped to its N terminus, similar to other cyclin Bs (10Yamano H. Gannon J. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5268-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Truncation of the first 70 amino acids or deletion of the 9 amino acid destruction box stabilizes the protein in an in vitro assay for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Overproduction of stable Cdc13p fragments in S. pombe cells results in high Cdk1p activity, an accumulation of cells in anaphase and a block to septation (10Yamano H. Gannon J. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5268-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These stable fragments of Cdc13p retain a conserved stretch of 150 amino acids that is a hallmark of cyclin proteins and is the region through which cyclins bind Cdks and promote their activation (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Transiently expressed anaphase-promoting complex activators are probably involved in the recognition of the “destruction box” motif within the N terminus of Cdc13p. In S. pombe, five such anaphase-promoting complex activators, members of the CDC20 protein family, are predicted by the genome sequence and three have been studied as follows: Slp1p (present in mitosis) (11Matsumoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Yamada H.Y. Matsumoto S. Matsumoto T. J.

Indeed, Ste9p/Srw1p is required for Cdc13p degradation when cells arrest in G1 in preparation for mating (13Blanco M.A. Sanchez-Diaz A. de Prada J.M. Moreno S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3945-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Yamaguchi S. Okayama H. Nurse P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3968-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi S.

For some time, it has been appreciated that mitotic Cdk1p-cyclin B1 complexes shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, accumulating in the nucleus during mitosis (18Ohi R. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Preventing nuclear accumulation of Cdk1p-cyclin B1 appears to be one mechanism of preventing entry into mitosis during a DNA damage-induced checkpoint delay (19Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J.

Cdk1p-Cdc13p accumulates in the nucleus during S- and G2-phases and also can be detected at the nucleolus, at the spindle pole body, and along the mitotic spindle (22Alfa C.E. Ducommun B. Beach D. Hyams J.S. Nature. 1990; 347: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Alfa C.E. Booher R. Beach D. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci.

Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ability of Cdk1p to enter the nucleus is Cdc13p-dependent (23Alfa C.E. Booher R. Beach D. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1989; 12: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other organisms, phosphorylation plays a key role in regulating the intracellular distribution of cyclins. Cyclin B1, as an example, has a cytoplasmic retention sequence (26Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) that contains a nuclear export sequence (20Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

However, this is insufficient to explain the kinetics of mitotic entry. Additional phosphorylations within the cytoplasmic retention sequence are important to create a nuclear import signal that is essential for the timely onset of mitosis (29Yang J. Song H. Walsh S.

The protein was purified from E. coli as inclusion bodies and resolved from contaminants by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Serum from two bleeds (fifth and sixth) of one of the rabbits was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and resuspension and is used throughout this study (GJG56). This aliquot of anti-Cdc13p serum has been used extensively in previous studies (39Berry L.D. Feoktistova A. Wright M.D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2535-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Berry L.D. Gould K.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 635-646PubMed Google Scholar, 41Chang L. Morrell J.L. Feoktistova A. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6681-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vivo labeling of cells was accomplished as described (42Den Haese G.J. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Gould K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). S. pombe cell lysates were prepared as detailed previously (43Gould K.L. Moreno S. Owen D.J. Sazer S. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3297-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cdc13p was recovered from denatured cell lysates using the GJG56 serum described above. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis and Phosphopeptide Mapping— [32P]Cdc13p bands were cut from Immobilon-P membranes, and slices were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 60 min at 110 °C (44Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) or subjected to trypsinization as described (45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Partial acid hydrolysis products were separated by electrophoresis in two dimensions on thin-layer cellulose plates at pH 1.9 and 3.5 (45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) using the Hunter thin-layer electrophoresis system (C.B.S. Scientific, Del Mar, CA). Phosphopeptides were separated on thin-layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 for 30 min at 1 kV and ascending chromatography (45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids and phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography or with Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager screens. Site-specific Mutagenesis—A 3.3-kb SalI-BamHI genomic fragment containing the cdc13+ open reading frame was cloned into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Chameleon or QuikChange kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the oligonucleotide used to alter Ser177, Ser180, and Ser183 to alanines is 5′-CCCAAACTTCATCGCGATGCTGTTGAGGCTCCCGAAGCTCAAGATTGG-3′. The sequences of other oligonucleotides are available upon request. The oligonucleotides used for alanine substitutions also introduced a NruI restriction site without further altering amino acid specification. Those for aspartic acid introduced a BamHI site. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutants were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pIRT2 (46Russell P. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1989Google Scholar). To create a gene replacement strain, this vector was transformed into a diploid heterozygous for the cdc13 deletion allele with the relevant genotype cdc13:ura4+/cdc13+leu1–32/leu1–32. Leu+ Ura+ transformants were selected and induced to sporulate. Haploid Ura4+ Leu+ progeny then were isolated. They were grown in yeast extract for approximately five generations and plated on minimal plates containing leucine, uracil, adenine, and 57 μm 5-fluoro-orotic acid. A haploid colony that was Leu-Ura-Ade- was then selected as a possible gene replacement strain. The cdc13+ open reading frame was amplified from this strain and sequenced to check that the mutations were present. Microscopy Methods—S. pombe cells in liquid culture were collected by centrifugation, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and stained with a DNA-specific fluorescent dye (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) as described previously (47Balasubramanian M.K. McCollum D. Gould K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged Cdc13p was visualized in live cells. Microscopy was performed using a spinning disk confocal microscope (Ultraview LCI, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Ultraview LCI software (version 5.2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for image acquisition. Images were processed using Velocity software (version 1.4.2, Improvision). Z-series optical sections were taken at 0.5-μm spacing for three-dimensional reconstructions. Cdc13p Is a Phosphoprotein—To test whether Cdc13p is a phosphoprotein, wild-type S. pombe cells were labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate and a denatured protein lysate was prepared. A single phosphoprotein of the expected size was immunoprecipitated specifically by anti-Cdc13p but not preimmune serum (Fig. 1A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of [32P]labeled Cdc13p indicated that it was phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues (Fig. 1B). Only a small percentage of [32P]Cdc13p was ever released from PDVF or nitrocellulose membranes or eluted from gel slices (data not shown). However, better recovery was obtained with chromytrptic digestion than with tryptic digestion and separation of Cdc13p chymotryptic phosphopeptides revealed a complex pattern (Fig. 1C), raising the possibility that Cdc13p might be phosphorylated on several sites (Fig. 1C). Cdc13p is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle—Cdc13p levels vary during the cell cycle (8Creanor J. Mitchison J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Booher R.N. Alfa C.E. Hyams J.S. Beach D.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 485-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To determine whether the extent of Cdc13p phosphorylation varied independently of its abundance, which would be an indicator of a possible regulatory role, different cell cycle mutants, wild-type cells, wild-type cells treated with drugs that block cell cycle progression, and wild type cells overproducing Cdc13p were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and Cdc13p was immunoprecipitated from denatured cell lysates of each. The following mutants and drugs were chosen: a cdc10–129 mutant (G1-phase arrest), hydroxyurea (S-phase arrest), cdc25–22 (G2 arrest) and cdc25–22 cells that had been arrested in G2 and then released for 20 min into nocadazole (M-phase arrest). In large measure, the level of Cdc13p phosphorylation paralleled its abundance (Fig. 2A). This was confirmed by quantitation of three such experiments (Fig. 2B). Specifically, the amount of [32P] incorporation into Cdc13p in each instance was determined by scintillation counting of gel slices containing the immunoprecipitates and compared with its abundance that was determined by immunoblotting and densitometry of Cdc13p immunoprecipitates. The amount of label and protein in a cdc25–22 mutant was arbitrarily defined as 100%. We conclude that although early in the cell cycle there appeared to be a somewhat higher stoichiometry of Cdc13p phosphorylation, Cdc13p phosphorylation increased with increasing levels of Cdc13p and was not restricted to any particular cell cycle stage. Confirming Cdc13p phosphorylation sites—As mentioned above, it was not possible to recover enough [32P]labeled Cdc13p from gel slices or PVDF membranes to enable the sites of phosphorylation to be determined by standard approaches (45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). However, sites of Cdc13p phosphorylation were identified using a mass spectrometric approach in which Cdc2p complexes purified by a tandem affinity approach were analyzed (35MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates 3rd., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Careful analyses of the mass spectrometric data suggested that at least one and possibly all three serines at positions 177, 180, and 183 were in vivo phosphorylation sites, but it was not possible to identify the exact residue(s) (35MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates 3rd., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). These assignments were particularly encouraging given that Ser177, Ser180, and Ser183 are predicted to be contained in large hydrophobic tryptic or chymotryptic peptides that would resist removal from PVDF membranes. To confirm that one or more of these serines represented bona fide in vivo Cdc13p phosphorylation sites and to assess their importance to Cdc13p function, they were altered by site-directed mutagenesis individually and in combination to the non-phosphorylatable amino acid alanine to create cdc13-S177A, cdc13-S180A, cdc13-S183A, and cdc13–3A (in which all three sites were mutated). All were able to complement both the cdc13–117 mutant at its restrictive temperature (Fig. 3A) and the cdc13:ura4 null allele (data not shown and see below), indicating that phosphorylation at these sites is not essential for Cdc13p function. To determine whether there were any subtle changes to cell cycle regulation resulting from the absence of Cdc13p phosphorylation, gene replacement strains were constructed in which these mutants were integrated into the genome in the place of wild type cdc13+. These mutant strains all divided at normal rates and at a normal size. No cell cycle defect could be discerned (data not shown). To validate the mass spectrometric identification of Cdc13p phosphorylation sites, wild-type and cdc13–3A strains were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and Cdc13p was immunoprecipitated from each (Fig. 3B). As before, 32P-labeled Cdc13p was detected in wild-type cells. In contrast, no labeled Cdc13p was detected from cdc13–3A. This is not due to the absence of Cdc13p protein in the labeled cells (Fig. 3C). This result confirms that Ser177, Ser180, and/or Ser183 represent in vivo phosphorylation sites. Moreover, this result indicates that there are no other phosphorylation sites within Cdc13p, at least under normal growth conditions. This was a possibility given that the 91.7% sequence coverage of Cdc13p by mass spectrometry left some regions of the protein unanalyzed (35MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates 3rd., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Given the lack of effect, we have not determined which of the three serines becomes phosphorylated or whether the phosphorylation occurs at two or all three sites. The Absence of Cdc13p Phosphorylation Does Not Affect Cdc13p Intracellular Localization—Phosphorylation of mammalian cyclin B1 plays an important role in its intracellular localization (reviewed in Refs. 18Ohi R. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 49Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E73-E79Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). As one response to genotoxic stress, cyclin B1 is also retained or shuttled into the cytoplasm (19Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Smeets M.F. Mooren E.H. Begg A.C. Radiother. Oncol. 1994; 33: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation or the lack thereof affected Cdc13p localization, cdc13+ and cdc13–3A were tagged at their endogenous locus with sequences encoding GFP. Live cell imaging of these strains indicated that Cdc13p-3A localized normally (Fig. 4, upper right panel). Similar to wild-type Cdc13p (Fig. 4, upper left panel), Cdc13p-3A was present in the nucleus with nucleolar concentration at the spindle pole bodies and also decorated the mitotic spindle. To determine whether checkpoint activation and cell cycle delay affected its localization, wild-type and cdc13–3A cells were incubated for 4 h in hydroxyurea and the localization of Cdc13 proteins was examined. After this treatment, it was clear that cells had arrested in interphase and were somewhat elongated (Fig. 4, lower panels). Moreover, Cdc13p and Cdc13p-3A had both accumulated at the spindle pole bodies and in the nucleus with nucleolar localization being particularly evident (Fig. 4, lower panels). We conclude that the absence of Ser177, Ser180, and/or Ser183 phosphorylation does not adversely affect the ability of Cdc13p to gain entry into the nucleus or localize to the nucleolus either normally or upon activation of the DNA replication checkpoint. Because we did not detect an alteration in cell growth or checkpoint response when Cdc13p was not phosphorylated, we considered the possibility that dephosphorylation rather than phosphorylation of Cdc13p might play a regulatory role. To test this theory, we altered the cdc13+ cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis to encode proteins in which the serine phosphorylation sites were replaced with aspartic acid residues (S177D, S177D, and S180D and S177D, S180D, and S183D) in the hope of mimicking constitutive phosphorylation. Each of the three mutants were integrated into the genome in single copy by replacing the cdc13 null allele. All three mutant strains were viable and exhibited wild type morphology in liquid medium (Fig. 5, A–C). Given the apparent lack of functional changes, we examined the localization of only the triple mutant that we named Cdc13p-3D. cdc13–3D was tagged at its endogenous locus with sequences encoding GFP. Live cell imaging of this strain indicated that it localized normally (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, cdc13–3D cells arrested normally in hydroxyurea and the Cdc13–3Dp accumulated in the nucleus, particularly the nucleolus (Fig. 5E). To determine whether DNA damage precluded Cdc13p concentration in the nucleus and whether this was altered by phosphorylation, the cdc13-GFP, cdc13–3A-GFP, and cdc13–3D-GFP strains were treated with camptothecin for 3 h (50Dunaway S. Walworth N.C. Methods. 2004; 33: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In each case, the Cdc13 protein accumulated in the nucleus, particularly the nucleolus (Fig. 5, F–H). These results indicate that neither phosphorylation nor dephosphorylation of Cdc13p influences its intracellular localization. Numerous studies have determined that cyclin B phosphorylation in vertebrate cells is an important influence on its intracellular localization. As observed in other organisms, we have shown here that Cdc13p, the only essential B-type cyclin of S. pombe, is a phosphoprotein. It is phosphorylated on one to three sites in close proximity to one another that lie N-terminal to the cyclin box and C-terminal of the destruction box. However, our evidence suggests that phosphorylation of this region is unnecessary for the function or regulation of Cdc13p. Although 32P incorporation into Cdc13p was detected by us earlier, 2W. Hayes McDonald, G. Den Haese, and K. L. Gould, unpublished observations. advances in mass spectrometry were required to provide information on the residues involved (35MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates 3rd., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). These residues lie next to one another at amino acid positions 177, 180, and 183, and it is still not clear whether a single amino acid or all three sites serve as the phosphoacceptor residues. In retrospect, it is clear why conventional approaches used successfully to identify phosphorylation sites in other proteins (45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) failed to reveal the identity of Cdc13p phosphorylation sites. Sequences surrounding Ser177, Ser180, and Ser183 dictate that tryptic and chymotryptic peptides containing these sites are large and hydrophobic and therefore poorly recoverable from either gel slices or PDVF membrane. Interestingly, despite the lack of functional effect upon mutation of these sites to either alanine or aspartic acid residues, two of these three residues (Ser177 and Ser180) are conserved within Cig2p, a closely related but non-essential S. pombe cyclin B. However, they are not generally conserved among cyclin B molecules. One of the serines (Ser180) is followed by a proline residue and thus is a potential S-P Cdk1 autophosphorylation site. Although Cdk1p·Cdc13p complexes do undergo some autophosphorylation in vitro, this is not affected in quality or quantity by mutation of Ser180 to alanine. 3A. Feoktistova and K. L. Gould, unpublished data. Thus, autophosphorylation sites are not related to the sites studied here and may be in vitro artifacts because the sites analyzed here are the only ones detected in Cdc13p molecules isolated from cells. It appears from our data that cytoplasmic sequestration of the Cdc13p is not involved in the fission yeast cell response to DNA replication- or DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. This contrasts with the situation in vertebrate cells in which Cyclin B accumulates in the cytoplasm in response to DNA damage (19Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Smeets M.F. Mooren E.H. Begg A.C. Radiother. Oncol. 1994; 33: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rather, our data suggests that Cdc13p is sequestered in the nucleolus when cells are delayed in G2-phase by activation of G2 checkpoints and that nucleolar accumulation does not require changes in Cdc13 phosphorylation state. The different strategy of sequestering Cdk1p activity within the nucleolus in S. pombe may obviate the need for controlling nuclear access through a checkpoint signaling pathway. Nucleolar localization of Cdc13p was first detected more than a decade ago (22Alfa C.E. Ducommun B. Beach D. Hyams J.S. Nature. 1990; 347: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Alfa C.E. Booher R. Beach D. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1989; 12: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the sequences within Cdc13p responsible for this localization pattern have not been elucidated. Whereas Cdc13p phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometry, a substantial portion of the protein (>10%) was not accounted for in the mass spectrometric data and, even in the regions covered, it is possible to miss some sites of modification (35MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates 3rd., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remained possible that other Cdc13p phosphorylation sites existed in these unidentified parts of the protein. This possibility is strongly disfavored by the fact that a S177A, S180A, and S183A triple mutant protein fails to incorporate any 32P when cells are labeled with orthophosphate, and it is highly probable that these serines represent the only in vivo phosphorylation sites in the protein. Consistent with the lack of regulatory influence, our data indicate that the amount of Cdc13p phosphorylation parallels the accumulation of the protein whether it occurs in a prolonged G2 arrest induced by cdc25 mutation or G2 checkpoint activation. Although the lack of functional consequence of Cdc13p phosphorylation is unexpected, this study has illustrated the power of combining a mass spectrometric approach with site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo labeling to comprehensively analyze the potential functions of protein phosphorylation events. We thank Dr. Nancy Walworth for the generous gift of camptothecin."
