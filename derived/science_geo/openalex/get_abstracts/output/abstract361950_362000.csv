https://openalex.org/W2161830466,"Stimulation of death receptors by agonists such as FasL and TNFα activates apoptotic cell death in apoptotic-competent conditions or a type of necrotic cell death dependent on RIP1 kinase, termed necroptosis, in apoptotic-deficient conditions. In a genome-wide siRNA screen for regulators of necroptosis, we identify a set of 432 genes that regulate necroptosis, a subset of 32 genes that act downstream and/or as regulators of RIP1 kinase, 32 genes required for death-receptor-mediated apoptosis, and 7 genes involved in both necroptosis and apoptosis. We show that the expression of subsets of the 432 genes is enriched in the immune and nervous systems, and cellular sensitivity to necroptosis is regulated by an extensive signaling network mediating innate immunity. Interestingly, Bmf, a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, is required for death-receptor-induced necroptosis. Our study defines a cellular signaling network that regulates necroptosis and the molecular bifurcation that controls apoptosis and necroptosis.

Interestingly, Bmf, a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, is required for death-receptor-induced necroptosis. Our study defines a cellular signaling network that regulates necroptosis and the molecular bifurcation that controls apoptosis and necroptosis. Cell death has been traditionally classified as apoptosis or necrosis. While apoptosis is known as a regulated cellular mechanism, necrosis is known as passive cell death caused by overwhelming stress. Necrosis is characterized by rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity, organelle swelling and mitochondrial dysfunction, and the lack of typical apoptotic features such as internucleosomal DNA cleavage and nuclear condensation. Although necrosis is known to occur under a variety of pathological conditions, little effort has been made to study necrosis due to the belief in its unregulated nature. Support for a regulated necrosis mechanism came from studies of the death receptors. Activation of the Fas and TNFR family of death receptors induces a “prototypic” apoptotic pathway through the recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as FADD, and upstream caspases, such as caspase-8. Interestingly, it was discovered that, in certain cell types, stimulation with FasL or TNFα under apoptosis-deficient conditions could induce cell death with morphological features of necrosis (Kawahara et al., 1998Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Caspase-independent cell killing by Fas-associated protein with death domain.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, Vercammen et al., 1997Vercammen D. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Fiers W. Tumour necrosis factor-induced necrosis versus anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in L929 cells.Cytokine. 1997; 9: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The fact that the activation of Fas/TNFα receptors may lead to cell death with features of either apoptosis or necrosis argues strongly for the existence of a regulated cellular necrosis mechanism, discrete from apoptosis, which we termed “necroptosis” (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). RIP1 is a death-domain-containing kinase associated with the death receptors, but its kinase activity is dispensable for the induction of death-receptor-mediated apoptosis (Grimm et al., 1996Grimm S. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. RIP and FADD: two “death domain”-containing proteins can induce apoptosis by convergent, but dissociable, pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 10923-10927Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In apoptosis-deficient conditions, however, RIP1 kinase activity has been found to be required for the activation of necroptosis by death receptor agonists (Holler et al., 2000Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Fas triggers an alternative, caspase-8-independent cell death pathway using the kinase RIP as effector molecule.Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we have isolated multiple small molecule inhibitors of necroptosis termed necrostatins (Necs) (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem.

Wagner G. et al.Identification of RIP1 kinase as a specific cellular target of necrostatins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have shown that Nec-1 is an allosteric inhibitor of RIP1 kinase activity (Degterev et al., 2008Degterev A. Hitomi J. Germscheid M. Ch'en I.L. Korkina O. Teng X. Abbott D. Cuny G.D. Yuan C. Wagner G. et al.Identification of RIP1 kinase as a specific cellular target of necrostatins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Using Nec-1 as a tool, necroptosis has since been found to contribute to a wide range of pathologic cell death paradigms, including ischemic brain injury, myocardial infarction, excitotoxicity, and chemotherapy-induced cell death (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A.

Here, we have broadly explored the molecular mechanism and functional significance of necroptosis by carrying out a genome-wide siRNA screen for genes required for necroptosis. Our study defines a genetic profile for a cellular necrotic pathway, elucidates the connection between apoptosis and necroptosis, and implicates necroptosis as a critical regulatory pathway for innate immunity and suggests a potential role of necroptosis in human disease. The treatment of L929 cells with zVAD.fmk has been shown to induce necroptosis, which can be inhibited by Nec-1 (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Using this model, we screened the Dharmacon siRNA library covering the mouse genome (16,873 genes) for genes required for necroptosis (Figure 1A). RIP1 siRNA was used as a positive control as knockdown of RIP1 efficiently blocked necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk (Figure 1B). In the nontargeting siRNA-transfected cells (Dharmacon), the treatment of zVAD.fmk induced ∼80% cell death. A siRNA was scored as positive if its ATP level (a surrogate for cell survival) was > 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean ATP level of the plate. Using this criterion, 666 genes were scored as candidates required for zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis in L929 cells. As expected, rip1 was scored as a hit in this assay, providing a validation for our approach (Figures 1B and 1C). To confirm the screening result, we rescreened the 666 primary siRNA hits using four individual siRNAs for each gene. In order to restrict our analysis to genes that have major impacts on cellular sensitivity to necroptosis, we required that at least two out of the four siRNAs increased cell survival for > 3 SD above that of cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA control and showed at least 60% of the viability of cells expressing the positive control rip1 siRNA. Using these criteria, 432 genes were scored positive. RIP1 was again one of the validated hits, with all four siRNAs showing a protective effect against necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk (data not shown). We examined the expression of genes identified in the zVAD.fmk screen across 61 normal mouse tissues using microarray data files from the Novartis GNF mouse expression atlas resource (Su et al., 2004Su A.I. Wiltshire T. Batalov S. Lapp H. Ching K.A. Block D. Zhang J. Soden R. Hayakawa M. Kreiman G. et al.A gene atlas of the mouse and human protein-encoding transcriptomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6062-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar) and found clusters of hits showing increased expression in immune and neuronal cells/tissues (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05) (Figure 2A and Tables S1 and S2 available online). To further define the immune cell types, we also analyzed a larger mouse immune microarray panel comprising gene expression profiles from 119 mouse cell/tissue samples, of which 83% represent various types of primary immune cells (Hijikata et al., 2007Hijikata A. Kitamura H. Kimura Y. Yokoyama R. Aiba Y. Bao Y. Fujita S. Hase K. Hori S. Ishii Y. et al.Construction of an open-access database that integrates cross-reference information from the transcriptome and proteome of immune cells.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We observed a cluster of genes from the zVAD.fmk screen exhibiting increased expression in macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells and another cluster showing enhanced expression in B and T lymphocytes (Figure 2B and Tables S3 and S4). The enriched expression in cells of the immune system also suggests a role of necroptosis in regulating immune function. To further confirm a functional role of necroptosis in the immune system, we tested the sensitivity of primary peritoneal macrophages to Nec-1. As shown in Figure 2C, spontaneous as well as zVAD.fmk-induced cell death of macrophages was inhibited by Nec-1, suggesting that necroptosis plays a role in regulating the survival of activated primary macrophages, one of the key cell types involved in innate immunity. On the other hand, death-receptor-mediated cell death of epithelial cell lines, such as HeLa cells, 293 cells (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar), and MCF10A (data not shown), is not sensitive to the inhibition of Nec-1. CYLD, a tumor suppressor and a deubiquitinating enzyme encoded by a gene that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (Simonson et al., 2007Simonson S.J. Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S. CYLD: a DUB with many talents.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 601-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was identified in the microarray data sets as having increased gene expression in immune and neuronal cells/tissues (Tables S1 and S2). CYLD is known to be recruited to the TNFα receptor upon its activation, and, furthermore, RIP1 has been identified as a CYLD substrate (Wright et al., 2007Wright A. Reiley W.W. Chang M. Jin W. Lee A.J. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Regulation of early wave of germ cell apoptosis and spermatogenesis by deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that CYLD may represent a key regulatory factor in the necroptotic pathway. To confirm the role of CYLD in necroptosis, we compared the efficiency of cyld knockdown with necroptosis inhibition. As shown in Figure 3A, we found an excellent correlation between the efficiency of cyld knockdown by individual siRNAs and protection against zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis in L929 cells. To further confirm the role of cyld in necroptosis, we used siRNAs against human cyld to inhibit its expression in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells. We found that inhibition of cyld expression in Jurkat cells also attenuated necroptosis (Figure 3B). Execution of necroptosis is associated with activation of autophagy and increased formation of its marker, LC3II, which is efficiently inhibited by Nec-1 (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Consistently, knockdown of cyld also inhibited LC3II induction in L929 cells treated with zVAD.fmk (Figure 3C). Since CYLD regulates TNFα signaling (Wright et al., 2007Wright A. Reiley W.W. Chang M. Jin W. Lee A.J. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Regulation of early wave of germ cell apoptosis and spermatogenesis by deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the requirement of cyld suggests that autocrine regulation of TNFα signaling might be involved in regulating cellular sensitivity to necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk. Consistent with this possibility, TNFR1 (TNFRSF1a) was identified as one of the genes required for zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis (Table S6). Since inhibition of caspases by expression of crmA, a caspase inhibitor encoded by cowpox virus, or by multiple peptide caspase inhibitors was found to sensitize L929 cells to TNFα-induced necrosis (Vercammen et al., 1998Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Inhibition of caspases increases the sensitivity of L929 cells to necrosis mediated by tumor necrosis factor.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), our results indicate that an autocrine regulation of TNFα contributes to necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk. To gain insights into the function of genes scored in our siRNA screen, we used a gene set approach to identify common pathways associated with these gene clusters. Using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. et al.Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (20168) Google Scholar), which provides a catalog of some 3000 sets of genes divided into various annotation groupings, we interrogated human orthologs of the 432 genes involved in zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis against curated gene sets (canonical pathways) and motif-based gene sets (transcription factor targets) from the MSigDB. We identified canonical pathways that were found to be significantly enriched (p < 0.05) among zVAD.fmk hits compared to the full set of genes screened in the siRNA library to which human orthologs could be mapped. Involvement of the TNFR1 pathway is very clear, as multiple hits in the zVAD.fmk screen, such as tnfr1 (tnfrsf1a), ripk1, cyld, jun, and grb2, have established roles in TNF signaling. In addition, the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, which was identified to be significantly enriched in the canonical pathway analysis, is also likely to be involved in necroptosis, as several zVAD.fmk hits, such as ripk1, cyld (Meylan et al., 2004Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. RIP1 is an essential mediator of Toll-like receptor 3-induced NF-kappa B activation.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, Yoshida et al., 2005Yoshida H. Jono H. Kai H. Li J.D. The tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD) acts as a negative regulator for toll-like receptor 2 signaling via negative cross-talk with TRAF6 AND TRAF7.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41111-41121Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), multiple members of the interferon family (ifna1, ifna7, and ifna13), and an IFN-induced gene, LRG47/Irgm1, are also known to have roles in the TLR pathway. Interestingly, our analysis identified that at least 70 out of 432 genes identified in the zVAD.fmk screen are connected through an extensive network surrounding innate immune pathways to TNFR1 and TLR signaling using pathway components, ripk1, jun, cd40, and spp1, which are also zVAD.fmk hits, as anchor points (Figure 4A). An important role of necroptosis in innate immunity is consistent with the enriched expression of zVAD.fmk hits in the immune system. This network provides a framework for future explorations into the mechanisms by which cellular sensitivity to necroptosis is regulated in response to multiple TLR and death receptor family members. Although it was not known that the treatment with zVAD.fmk would lead to the activation of some of the signaling processes involved in the TNFR1 and TLR pathways, the agonists of TNFR1 and TLR have been previously shown to induce caspase-independent necrosis that we termed necroptosis (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 19179-19187Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of TNFR1 in zVAD-induced necroptosis, neutralization of TNFα by antibody protected L929 cells from necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk (Figure 4B). Furthermore, we found that L929 cells can be induced to die by cotreatment with IFNγ and polyI:C (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid), a synthetic double-stranded RNA agonist of TLR3 commonly used to mimic viral infection, and the cell death was inhibited by Nec-1 (Figure 4C). Thus, consistent with the connection of necroptosis and innate immunity, the cell death induced by the activation of TLR3 in L929 cells in the presence of IFNγ requires RIP1 kinase activity to induce necroptosis. The canonical pathway enrichment analysis also uncovered the involvement of the glutathione metabolic pathway, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol pathway, proteins involved in translation (including translation initiation factors), and ribosomal proteins (Table S5). The protection offered by reducing the levels of glutathione peroxidase (gpx4) and glutathione S-transferases (gsta3 and gsto2), which is expected to increase the availability of free glutathione, is consistent with the fact that RIP1 activation leads to increases in the cellular levels of free radical species, which plays an important role in mediating necroptosis (Xu et al., 2006Xu Y.

Dutta S. Welsh S. Liu Z. Freundt E. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M. Autophagic programmed cell death by selective catalase degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 4952-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis by knockdown of pgap1, pigl, and pigm is consistent with the requirement of GPI in TNFα signaling (Fukushima et al., 2004Fukushima K. Ishiyama C. Yamashita K. Recognition by TNF-alpha of the GPI-anchor glycan induces apoptosis of U937 cells.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Identification of these canonical pathways provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk as well as a validation for our screen. Of the 432 genes involved in zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis, 291 (67%) and 281 (65%) could be classified into broad molecular function (Figure 5A and Table S6) and biological process (Figure 5B and Table S7) categories for mouse genes, respectively. There appears to be an enrichment trend for nucleic acid binding (unadjusted hypergeometric p = 0.01) and nucleic acid metabolism (hypergeometric p = 0.003) categories in the set of genes involved in zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis relative to their representation in the global set of genes examined in the siRNA screen. None of the functional enrichments were significant at the 0.05 level after being adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg's (BH) method, but this may be overly conservative since the functional categories are not independent. Interestingly, 43 genes in the zVAD.fmk hit list encode transcription factors (Table S6). To begin to characterize the regulation of necroptosis, we explored the promoter regions of genes identified in our siRNA screen to see whether we could find shared transcription factor binding sites as defined in the TRANSFAC database (www.gene-regulation.com) and the MSigDB collection of transcription factor (TF) targets (i.e., motif-based gene sets) (Xie et al., 2005Xie X. Lu J. Kulbokas E.J. Golub T.R. Mootha V. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kellis M. Systematic discovery of regulatory motifs in human promoters and 3′ UTRs by comparison of several mammals.Nature. 2005; 434: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). We found an enrichment of binding sites (unadjusted hypergeometric p < 0.05) for TFs such as myog/nf1, meisb1/hoxa9, nrf2, hnf4, lef1, ar, pax4, and pparg in the promoters of genes involved in zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis (Figure 5C), suggesting the involvement of these cis elements in the underlying transcriptional regulatory control of genes involved in zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis. Consistent with this proposal, a binding site for the androgen receptor (AR) was found to be enriched in the promoters of genes involved in necroptosis, and AR was also a hit in the screen for genes involved in zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis (Table S6). This provides further evidence for the importance of transcriptional control of necroptosis. In contrast to death-receptor-mediated apoptosis, which is sensitized by the inhibition of protein synthesis via inhibition of the NF-κB transcriptional response, inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX has been shown to inhibit necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk (Yu et al., 2004Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Regulation of an ATG7-beclin 1 program of autophagic cell death by caspase-8.Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), but not by TNFα (Figure S1). Thus, the protection provided by the inhibition of some of the essential cellular machinery involved in protein translation, such as eif3s10, eif4a1, eif4e, eif4ebp2, eif5b, and pcbp1, as well as multiple ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in mRNA splicing (Table S6), is likely due to the inhibition of protein translation. Consistent with necroptosis being a cellular program of necrotic cell death, transcription and translation may be essential for the progression of necroptosis, at least under certain conditions. Furthermore, these data suggest an intriguing possibility that availability of the translational machinery might represent another factor determining cellular choice in executing cell death. To examine the transcriptional profile associated with cellular sensitivity to necroptosis, we performed microarray analysis on L929 cells, which are sensitive to necroptosis, and NIH 3T3 cells, which we have shown previously to be unable to undergo necroptosis (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). By comparing the expression profiles of the 432 hit genes from the zVAD.fmk screen in these two cell types, we identified 60 zVAD.fmk hits that were expressed at significantly higher levels in L929 cells relative to NIH 3T3 cells (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05; fold-change > 1.5) (Table S8). To determine whether this transcriptional profile is preserved in other cell lines known to be sensitive or resistant to necroptosis, we next examined gene expression data for four human cell lines (Jurkat, HeLa, HEK293, and HEK293T) from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Foundation (GNF) cell line collection. The trend appears to be consistent for the nine genes that we examined (edd1, mpg, ca9, slc25a15, sirt5, npepl1, dcc1, cd40, and col4a3bp) (Figure 5D). These genes exhibited elevated expression in necroptosis-sensitive Jurkat cells relative to HeLa, HEK293, and HEK293T cells, which are resistant. These results suggest that increased expression of a subset of zVAD hit genes might convey cellular sensitivity to necroptosis. Treatment of L929 cells with TNFα strongly induces necroptosis (Fiers et al., 1995Fiers W. Beyaert R. Boone E. Cornelis S. Declercq W. Decoster E. Denecker G. Depuydt B. De Valck D. De Wilde G. et al.TNF-induced intracellular signaling leading to gene induction or to cytotoxicity by necrosis or by apoptosis.J. Inflamm. 1995; 47: 67-75Google Scholar). TNFα, however, also induces the activation of NF-κB, which requires the intermediate domain of RIP1 (Ting et al., 1996Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. RIP mediates tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 activation of NF-kappaB but not Fas/APO-1-initiated apoptosis.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Since activation of NF-κB is prosurvival, necroptosis of L929 cells induced by TNFα cannot be inhibited by RIP1 siRNA (Figure 6A). On the other hand, since Nec-1 targets RIP1 kinase activity specifically and does not affect the activation of NF-κB, Nec-1 inhibits TNFα-induced necroptosis of L929 cells (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A.

Since RIP1 is specifically recruited to the TNFα receptor in the activation of necroptosis (Zheng et al., 2006Zheng L. Bidere N. Staudt D. Cubre A. Orenstein J. Chan F.K. Lenardo M. Competitive control of independent programs of tumor necrosis factor receptor-induced cell death by TRADD and RIP1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3505-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the genes required for TNFα-induced necroptosis are predicted to be specifically downstream and/or regulators of RIP1 kinase activity. We screened the 666 primary siRNA hits from the zVAD.fmk screen for genes required for necroptosis induced by TNFα (Figure 1A). In nontargeting siRNA-transfected cells, TNFα caused ∼80% cell death. tnfr1 siRNA, which provided a strong protection against necroptosis induced by TNFα, was used as a positive control. A gene was scored as positive if at least two out of four of its siRNAs increased cell survival to at least 50% of the level provided"
https://openalex.org/W2096592632,Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been available from inbred mice since 1981 but have not been validated for other rodents. Failure to establish ES cells from a range of mammals challenges the identity of cultivated stem cells and our understanding of the pluripotent state. Here we investigated derivation of ES cells from the rat. We applied molecularly defined conditions designed to shield the ground state of authentic pluripotency from inductive differentiation stimuli. Undifferentiated cell lines developed that exhibited diagnostic features of ES cells including colonization of multiple tissues in viable chimeras. Definitive ES cell status was established by transmission of the cell line genome to offspring. Derivation of germline-competent ES cells from the rat paves the way to targeted genetic manipulation in this valuable biomedical model species. Rat ES cells will also provide a refined test-bed for functional evaluation of pluripotent stem cell-derived tissue repair and regeneration.

The lack of rat embryonic stem (ES) cells has restricted the availability of transgenic technologies to create genetic models in this species. Here, we show that rat ES cells can be efficiently derived, propagated, and genetically manipulated in the presence of small molecules that specifically inhibit GSK3, MEK, and FGF receptor tyrosine kinases. These rat ES cells express pluripotency markers and retain the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. Most importantly, they can produce high rates of chimerism when reintroduced into early stage embryos and can transmit through the germline. Establishment of authentic rat ES cells will make possible sophisticated genetic manipulation to create models for the study of human diseases.

Most importantly, they can produce high rates of chimerism when reintroduced into early stage embryos and can transmit through the germline. Establishment of authentic rat ES cells will make possible sophisticated genetic manipulation to create models for the study of human diseases. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of preimplantation blastocysts (Brook and Gardner, 1997Brook F.A. Gardner R.L. The origin and efficient derivation of embryonic stem cells in the mouse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5709-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). They can be maintained in culture indefinitely while retaining the capacity to generate nearly any type of cell in the body (Keller, 2005Keller G. Embryonic stem cell differentiation: emergence of a new era in biology and medicine.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1129-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The pluripotency of ES cells, combined with the ease with which they can be manipulated genetically, has provided a powerful means to elucidate gene function and create disease models via the generation of transgenic, chimeric, and knock-out animals. Although ES cells have been routinely derived from mice since 1981 (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos.Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6067) Google Scholar, Martin, 1981Martin G.R.

USA. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar), authentic rat ES cells have never been established. In general, rats are more relevant to humans, both physiologically and pharmacologically, than mice, providing an important experimental model system for the study of human diseases (Jacob and Kwitek, 2001Jacob H.J. Kwitek A.E. Rat genetics: attaching physiology and pharmacology to the genome.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 3: 33-42Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). For example, rats have been used extensively in studies of hypertension (Rapp, 2000Rapp J.P. Genetic analysis of inherited hypertension in the rat.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of rat ES cells, the generation of novel rat models for studying specific aspects of human diseases largely depends on selection for specific traits using existing rat strains. Although strategies based on chemical mutagenesis using the supermutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) or mutagenesis using the L1 retrotransposon have been developed to introduce random mutations into rats (Ostertag et al., 2007Ostertag E.M. Madison B.B. Kano H. Mutagenesis in rodents using the L1 retrotransposon.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: S16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Smits et al., 2006Smits B.M. Mudde J.B. van de Belt J. Verheul M. Generation of gene knockouts and mutant models in the laboratory rat by ENU-driven target-selected mutagenesis.Pharmacogenet. Genomics. 2006; 16: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar), germline-competent ES cells will be required to achieve robust, facile, and precise genetic modification in this species. Derivation and maintenance of the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells originally relied on cocultivation with feeder cells, usually mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and the presence of serum. Later, it was shown that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is the key cytokine secreted by feeders in supporting mouse ES cell self-renewal (Smith et al., 1988Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D.

Myeloid leukaemia inhibitory factor maintains the developmental potential of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 1988; 336: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) can replace serum and act together with LIF to maintain mouse ES cell self-renewal (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I.

Several groups have attempted to derive ES cells from rats under similar culture conditions developed for mouse ES cells; however, no authentic rat ES cell lines have ever been established (Brenin et al., 1997Brenin D.

Cell Res. 2000; 258: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Pluripotent EpiSCs (postimplantation epiblast-derived stem cells) have been derived from rat embryos at 7.5 days postcoitus (dpc) (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. et al.Derivation of pluripotent epiblast stem cells from mammalian embryos.Nature. 2007; 448: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). However, EpiSCs do not contribute to chimeras, seriously limiting their potential use. Although rat and mouse take much the same course of embryogenesis during the early stages of development, the early embryos differ significantly in their differentiation potential in vitro or in vivo when they are transplanted to an ectopic site. For instance, the isolated mouse epiblast can no longer regenerate parietal endoderm (Gardner, 1985Gardner R.L. Regeneration of endoderm from primitive ectoderm in the mouse embryo: fact or artifact?.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 88: 303-326PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the rat epiblast predominantly differentiates into parietal endoderm cells in culture (Nichols et al., 1998Nichols J. Smith A. Buehr M. Rat and mouse epiblasts differ in their capacity to generate extraembryonic endoderm.Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1998; 10: 517-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse egg cylinders form teratocarcinomas containing pluripotent embryonic carcinoma stem cells after being implanted to ectopic sites (Solter et al., 1970Solter D. Skreb N. Damjanov I. Extrauterine growth of mouse egg-cylinders results in malignant teratoma.Nature. 1970; 227: 503-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Stevens, 1970Stevens L.C. The development of transplantable teratocarcinomas from intratesticular grafts of pre- and postimplantation mouse embryos.Dev. Biol. 1970; 21: 364-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). When the same procedure is carried out in the rat, only a yolk sac carcinoma develops (Damjanov and Sell, 1977Damjanov I. Sell S. Yolk sac carcinoma grown from rat egg cylinders.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 58: 1523-1525PubMed Google Scholar). These differences may account for the failure of rat ES cell derivation using conditions developed for mouse ES cell cultures. Although the derivation of putative ES-like cells from other species has been reported, only ES cells from mice have proven to be able to efficiently contribute to chimeras and re-enter the germline, which is the defining feature of true ES cells. Extrinsic stimuli are thought to be necessary for the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal. These stimuli may be provided in an integrated manner by a cellular microenvironment or by administration of cocktails of growth factors and cytokines in vitro (Smith, 2001Smith A.G. Embryo-derived stem cells: of mice and men.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Recently, we have made a striking discovery in understanding mouse ES cell self-renewal (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). We found that, contrary to dogma, mouse ES cell self-renewal does not require activating signals from the LIF/STAT3 and BMP/SMAD pathways, but only that ES cells be shielded from inductive differentiation cues. On the basis of these findings, we developed a culture medium containing three inhibitors (3i): CHIR99021, PD184352, and SU5402. CHIR99021 is a well-characterized highly selective small molecule inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (Murray et al., 2004Murray J.T. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Auld G.C. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Peggie M. Bain J. Bloomberg G.B. Grahammer F. et al.Exploitation of KESTREL to identify NDRG family members as physiological substrates for SGK1 and GSK3.Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). PD184352 and SU5402 are selective pharmacological inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor tyrosine kinase, respectively (Davies et al., 2000Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Specificity and mechanism of action of some commonly used protein kinase inhibitors.Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3848) Google Scholar, Mohammadi et al., 1997Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Structures of the tyrosine kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor in complex with inhibitors.Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). 3i can support efficient derivation and maintenance of ES cells from different strains of mice (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the effect of 3i on rat ES cell derivation to determine whether this principle may be more broadly applicable. We report for the first time that germline-competent rat ES cells can also be established under 3i conditions. To examine the effect of 3i on sustaining the undifferentiated state of rat pluripotent stem cells, we plated E4.5 Dark Agouti (DA) rat blastocysts on MEFs in serum-free N2B27 medium with or without 3i. The expression of the pluripotency marker Oct4 was used as an assay for the presence of undifferentiated stem cells in the primary outgrowths of rat blastocysts. In the presence of 3i, Oct4 expression was maintained in the majority of the outgrowths (six out of nine) 10 days after plating (Figure 1A). In contrast, Oct4 was rapidly extinguished in all outgrowths of rat blastocysts placed in N2B27 medium alone (zero out of eight) or in cultures supplemented with LIF and serum (zero out of eight) conditions permissive for mouse ES cell derivation (Figures 1B and 1C). These data suggest that the uncommitted state in the primary culture of rat blastocysts can also be sustained in 3i conditions, as we have previously demonstrated in different strains of mice (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). To investigate whether 3i conditions can support the long-term expansion of these rat blastocyst-derived undifferentiated cells, we dissociated the outgrowths of DA rat blastocysts 5–7 days after in 3i culture and replated them into wells of 4-well plates under the same MEF/3i condition. Cells loosely attached to the feeders and proliferated to form morphologically undifferentiated colonies (Figure 1D). These cells could be passaged repeatedly, resulting in the establishment of stable cell lines (Figure 1E). We established 11 cell lines from 32 plated DA blastocysts. These established lines exhibited positive staining for alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Figure 1F) and expressed pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 (Figures 1G–1J). The expression of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 was also verified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1K). We routinely passage these cells every 3–4 days by dissociating them into single cells using trypsin and replating onto wells preseeded with MEFs in 3i medium. Cultures have been expanded for over 60 passages without overt differentiation. We also found that these 3i rat ES cells, like mouse ES cells, can be cryopreserved and recovered with high efficiency by standard techniques. We tested the MEF/3i condition for the derivation of ES cells from other strains of rats. We have so far established six Sprague Dawley (SD) rat ES cell lines from 20 blastocysts and five Fischer 344 (F344) rat ES cell lines from 18 blastocysts. To further confirm the identity of these cells, we examined genome-wide gene expression using an Affymetrix GeneChip Rat gene 1.0 ST array. These 3i rat cells express most of the pluripotency-related genes at high levels (Table S1 available online). We also performed hierarchical clustering analysis to compare with the global gene expression patterns of rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) and mouse ES cells. This microarray analysis shows that the gene expression profile of 3i rat cells resembles mouse ES cells, and is distinct from that of REFs derived from the same strain (Figure S1). All of these data together suggest that these rat cells derived and maintained in 3i conditions remain undifferentiated. Mouse and human ES cells have a distinct expression pattern of cell surface markers that characterize the undifferentiated state (Ginis et al., 2004Ginis I. Luo Y. Miura T. Thies S. Brandenberger R. Gerecht-Nir S. Amit M. Hoke A. Carpenter M.K. Itskovitz-Eldor J. et al.Differences between human and mouse embryonic stem cells.Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 360-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). SSEA-1 is expressed in mouse ES cells but is absent in human ES cells, whereas SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81 are expressed in human ES cells but not in mouse ES cells. To test whether rat ES cells are similar to mouse or human ES cells in terms of cell surface marker expression, we performed immunofluorescence staining for cell-surface antigens SSEA-1, SSEA-4, and GCTM-2. Antibody GCTM-2 recognizes a 200 kD keratan-sulfate proteoglycan that also bears the TRA-1-60 antigen. We found that, similar to mouse ES cells, rat ES cells expressed SSEA-1, but not SSEA-4 or GCTM-2 (Figure 1L). ES cells have some epigenetic features that are distinguishable from those of differentiated cells. One such feature is that a set of promoters in ES cells carry both trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3 chromatin marks, which are associated with gene activation and repression, respectively. These so-called “bivalent domains” preferentially occur at transcription start sites (TSSs) of key developmental genes in mouse ES cells and function to silence these genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for lineage-specific activation and repression (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3738) Google Scholar, Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S. Ku M. Jaffe D.B. Issac B. Lieberman E. Giannoukos G. Alvarez P. Brockman W. Kim T.K. Koche R.P. et al.Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar). To determine whether rat ES cells also have this epigenetic feature, we analyzed H3K4 and K27 trimethylation patterns of ten selected genes that have been shown to contain bivalent promoters in mouse ES cells and resolve to monovalent state (H3K4me3 or H3K27me3) or remain bivalent in MEFs (Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S. Ku M. Jaffe D.B. Issac B. Lieberman E. Giannoukos G. Alvarez P. Brockman W. Kim T.K. Koche R.P. et al.Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and qPCR, we found that six genes (Hoxa5, Irx3, Maf, Hoxa9, Dlx1, and Pax9) were associated with bivalent promoters in rat ES cells, with four resolving into either Lys4 or Lys27 trimethylation and two remaining bivalent in REFs (Figures 2A and 2B). Interestingly, the other four genes (Ramp2, Sall3, Pou4f1, and Shh) were marked predominantly by either Lys4 or Lys27 trimethylation in rat ES cells. They remained the same modification in REFs except one (Sall3) (Figures 2A and 2B). Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that genes marked by H3K4me3 were expressed at high levels, whereas those associated with H3k27me3 or bivalent domains were barely detectable (Figure 2C). These results suggest that some developmental genes are also marked by a bivalent chromatin structure in rat ES cells, although divergences of chromatin modification may exist between mouse and rat ES cells. Generation of a genome-wide map of chromatin states is needed to better understand epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation in rat ES cells. Another important epigenetic feature of ES cells is that the promoter regions of key pluripotency genes are unmethylated (Meissner et al., 2008Meissner A. Mikkelsen T.S. Gu H. Wernig M. Hanna J. Sivachenko A. Zhang X. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Jaffe D.B. et al.Genome-scale DNA methylation maps of pluripotent and differentiated cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). We used bisulfite sequencing to examine the DNA methylation status of the Oct4 and Nanog promoters in rat ES cells and REFs. As shown in Figure 2D, both Oct4 and Nanog promoter elements were fully unmethylated in rat ES cells. However, the Oct4 promoter became hypermethylated in REFs, and the Nanog promoter was also methylated, but to a lesser extent. The classical method to induce ES cell differentiation is to allow ES cells to grow in suspension and form three-dimensional aggregates known as embryoid bodies (EBs) (Keller, 1995Keller G.M. In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Within the EBs, ES cell differentiation proceeds on a schedule similar to that in the embryo. We performed rat ES cell differentiation using this EB method. Dissociated rat ES cells were plated into noncoated dishes in the presence of serum. Instead of forming EBs, the majority of rat ES cells died 2 days after plating. The presence of 3i and feeders seems to be critical for the survival of rat ES cells. We made two modifications to the EB protocol: (1) 3i was still added at half of the original concentration for the first 2 days of differentiation, and (2) GMEM/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-conditioned medium collected from feeders was then substituted for 3i to instigate EB formation. Under these conditions, rat ES cells formed EBs (Figure 3A), although at much lower efficiency compared with EB formation from mouse ES cells. We examined the expression of markers of pluripotency and lineage commitment by RT-PCR during the process of EB differentiation. Oct4 was significantly downregulated, whereas the expression of markers for ectoderm (nestin), primitive endoderm (Gata4 and Sox17), endoderm (AFP), and mesoderm (Flk1) was induced in EBs (Figure 3B). We plated day 4 EBs onto matrigel-coated dishes with either serum-free N2B27 medium (Figure 3C) or serum-containing medium (Figures 3D and 3E). In N2B27 medium, a large proportion of cells differentiated into βIII-tubulin-positive neurons (Figure 3C). We observed spontaneously beating areas in the cultures with serum (Movie S1). The cells within the beating areas were positive for myosin staining (Figure 3D). In the outgrowth of EBs, large proportions of cells displayed morphology typical of parietal endoderm cells and were positive for Gata4 staining (Figure 3E). These results suggest that the rat ES cells derived and maintained in 3i conditions are pluripotent. The defining feature of authentic ES cells is their capacity to incorporate into the developing embryo and transmit through the germline (Smith, 2001Smith A.G. Embryo-derived stem cells: of mice and men.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). We injected rat ES cells into blastocysts to determine their potential to form germline chimeras. A total of 43 F344 blastocysts were injected with DAc2 cells (female, Figure 4A) and transferred to five pseudopregnant SD rats. Seven pups were born, among which two male and three female exhibited coat coloring indicative of the presence of DA rat cells (Figure 4B and Table 1). DA rat ES cells have an agouti (A/A) genetic background, whereas F344 and SD rats are both albino (c/c). The albino coat color mutation is recessive to agouti; thus, when only one allele is present, there should be no partial expression. As a result, when a DA/F344 or DA/SD chimeric rat is mated with a SD rat, the germline transmission of DA rat ES cells can be easily identified by the presence of agouti coat color. These DA/F344 chimeras were mated with SD rats, and all three female chimeras have produced offspring with agouti coat color, indicating the germline transmission of the DA rat ES cell genome (Figure 4C). Microsatellite analysis further confirmed the presence of the DA rat ES cell genome in the resulting germline offspring (Figure 4D and Table S2). One of the female germline offspring has developed into a fertile adult and produced a total of nine pups; six had an albino coat color, one was agouti/berkshire, one was agouti/hooded, and one was black/hooded (Figure 4E). The two agouti pups and two out of the six albino pups carried both the agouti gene from DA genetic background and the nonagouti gene from the SD rat, whereas the black/hooded and other four albino pups only had the nonagouti gene, as expected (Figure 4F and Table S3) (Kuramoto et al., 2001Kuramoto T. Nomoto T. Sugimura T. Ushijima T. Cloning of the rat agouti gene and identification of the rat nonagouti mutation.Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Four more DA/F344 chimeras (three male, one female) were generated with a male DA rat ES cell line DAc3 (Figure S2A). Two male chimeras were infertile, whereas the female and the other male chimeras produced all white pups. DAc3 cells had an abnormal karyotype, which may account for their inability to transmit through the germline (Table 1). We have also generated one highly pigmented male DA/F344 chimera using karyotypically normal DAc8 cells (Table 1 and Figure S2B).

Open table in a new tab M, male; F, female. The genetic backgrounds of the host embryos and the donor ES cells are critical for germline transmission of the resulting chimeras in mice (Schwartzberg et al., 1989Schwartzberg P.L. Goff S.P. Robertson E.J. Germ-line transmission of a c-abl mutation produced by targeted gene disruption in ES cells.Science. 1989; 246: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This is also likely to be true in the rat. We have generated a total of 16 DA/SD chimeras by injection of DA ES cells into SD blastocysts (Table 1 and Figure S2C). All the 16 DA/SD chimeras developed into fertile adults and produced over 200 offspring. However, none of these offspring, as judged by coat color, were products of the transmission of the DA ES cell genome through the germline. This result suggests that SD blastocysts may be not suitable as a host embryo for DA ES cells. We also injected F344 rat ES cells into a total of 29 DA blastocysts and transferred them to three pseudopregnant SD rats. Three pups were born, and none of them were chimeras (Table 1). Germline competent rat ES cells can be derived at relatively high efficiency and can be maintained in long-term culture under the MEF/3i condition, as shown above. However, we found that rat ES cells adhere poorly and tend to form small clumps that easily detach from feeders under this MEF/3i condition. Cell adhesion is mainly mediated by the integrin receptor family. The majority of integrins are expressed at a low level or are absent in rat ES cells, as suggested from microarray analysis and qRT-PCR results (Table S4 and Figure S3). Interestingly, integrin α7 and integrin α6 are highly expressed in rat ES cells, suggesting that rat ES cells may attach well if the right extracellular matrix (ECM) is provided. We have tested over 20 different types of cells as feeder layers for the growth of rat ES cells. Although rat ES cells did not adhere, or adhered poorly, to most of the feeders tested, we found that L cells, which were derived from subcutaneous connective tissues of adult male C3H/An mice, can efficiently support adherent growth of undifferentiated rat ES cells. We also found that the viability and growth of rat ES cells can be further improved if we use a more potent MEK inhibitor PD0325901 to replace both PD184352 and SU5402 (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L.

https://openalex.org/W2111350536,"Evidence for active DNA demethylation in vertebrates is accumulating, but the mechanisms and enzymes remain unclear. Using zebrafish embryos we provide evidence for 5-methylcytosine (5-meC) removal in vivo via the coupling of a 5-meC deaminase (AID, which converts 5-meC to thymine) and a G:T mismatch-specific thymine glycosylase (Mbd4). The injection of methylated DNA into embryos induced a potent DNA demethylation activity, which was attenuated by depletion of AID or the non enzymatic factor Gadd45. Remarkably, overexpression of the deaminase/glycosylase pair AID/Mbd4 in vivo caused demethylation of the bulk genome and injected methylated DNA fragments, likely involving a G:T intermediate. Furthermore, AID or Mbd4 knockdown caused the remethylation of a set of common genes. Finally, Gadd45 promoted demethylation and enhanced functional interactions between deaminase/glycosylase pairs. Our results provide evidence for a coupled mechanism of 5-meC demethylation, whereby AID deaminates 5-meC, followed by thymine base excision by Mbd4, promoted by Gadd45.

DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing, and plays important roles in mammalian development and genomic imprinting (Reik, 2007Reik W. Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development.Nature. 2007; 447: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Misregulation of DNA methylation also contributes to cancer development by causing genomic instability and inappropriate silencing of tumor suppressor genes (Esteller, 2008Esteller M. Epigenetics in cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). Although the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes that generate 5-methylcytosine (5-meC) in vertebrates are well studied (Goll and Bestor, 2005Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Eukaryotic Cytosine Methyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar), evidence for a vertebrate enzyme exhibiting reproducible DNA demethylation either in vitro or in vivo is lacking. However, various studies have provided evidence for a replication-independent (active) mode of DNA demethylation. For example, in activated T cells a promoter-enhancer element of interleukin-2 gene undergoes demethylation within 20 min of stimulation (Bruniquel and Schwartz, 2003Bruniquel D. Schwartz R.H. Selective, stable demethylation of the interleukin-2 gene enhances transcription by an active process.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Also, targets of the estrogen receptor (ERα) show cyclical DNA demethylation uncoupled to replication (Metivier et al., 2008Metivier R. Gallais R. Tiffoche C. Le Peron C. Jurkowska R.Z. Carmouche R.P. Ibberson D. Barath P. Demay F. Reid G. et al.Cyclical DNA methylation of a transcriptionally active promoter.Nature. 2008; 452: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). During mouse embryonic development, the paternal genome undergoes demethylation in a replication-independent manner (Mayer et al., 2000Mayer W. Niveleau A. Walter J. Fundele R. Haaf T.

Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development.Nature. 2007; 447: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in zebrafish embryos, the demethylation of injected methylated DNA can occur in a replication-independent manner (Collas, 1998Collas P. Modulation of plasmid DNA methylation and expression in zebrafish embryos.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and quantification of methylation levels suggests active demethylation at fertilization (Mhanni and McGowan, 2004Mhanni A.A. McGowan R.A. Global changes in genomic methylation levels during early development of the zebrafish embryo.Dev. Genes Evol. 2004; 214: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Notably, pioneering work in plants provides strong evidence for a set of glycosylase/lyase enzymes (Demeter, ROS, DML2, DML3) in the removal of the 5-meC in various biological contexts (Gehring et al., 2006Gehring M. Huh J.H. Hsieh T.F. Penterman J. Choi Y. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Fischer R.L.

DNA demethylation in the Arabidopsis genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6752-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism is only one of many proposed but unproven mechanisms for DNA demethylation in vertebrates, which include: (1) direct removal of the methyl group, regenerating cytosine, (2) direct removal of the base (via glycosylase/lyase base excision activity, as in plants), followed by repair/replacement with cytosine, (3) conversion of the base to thymine (via deamination), followed by removal and subsequent repair, and (4) excision of one or more nucleotides surrounding 5-meC, followed by repair. In regard to the first mechanism, vertebrates contain orthologs of the bacterial AlkB demethylases (dioxygenases) which operate through direct methyl removal in prokaryotes (Morgan et al., 2005Morgan H.D. Santos F. Green K. Dean W. Reik W. Epigenetic reprogramming in mammals.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14 Spec No 1: R47-R58Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, Sedgwick, 2004Sedgwick B. Repairing DNA-methylation damage.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, none of the vertebrate orthologs have yet displayed direct 5-meC demethylation activity. Although the jumanji family of histone demethylases (HDMs) share homology to bacterial AlkB (Ozer and Bruick, 2007Ozer A. Bruick R.K. Non-heme dioxygenases: cellular sensors and regulators jelly rolled into one?.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) none have been reported to direct DNA demethylation. Earlier work suggested that methyl-binding domain protein 2b (Mbd2b) could directly remove the methyl group, leaving cytosine and methanol as products (Bhattacharya et al., 1999Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. A mammalian protein with specific demethylase activity for mCpG DNA.Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, as Mbd2b lacks an enzymatic domain, this activity remains controversial. The second mechanism (observed in plants) is also plausible, as vertebrates contain two demonstrated glycosylases: thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), and methyl-binding domain protein 4 (Mbd4). However, both TDG and Mbd4 have only weak 5-meC base excision activity, relative to their activity on thymine (Cortazar et al., 2007Cortazar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schar P. The enigmatic thymine DNA glycosylase.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2000Zhu B. Zheng Y. Angliker H. Schwarz S. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost J.P. 5-Methylcytosine DNA glycosylase activity is also present in the human MBD4 (G/T mismatch glycosylase) and in a related avian sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4157-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For the third mechanism, certain enzymes in the cytidine deaminase family (Activation Induced deaminase (AID) and Apolipoprotein B RNA-editing catalytic component-1 (Apobec-1)) have been shown to deaminate 5-meC in single-stranded DNA (generating thymine and yielding a G:T mismatch), establishing their candidacy in vivo (Morgan et al., 2004Morgan H.D. Dean W. Coker H.A. Reik W. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates 5-methylcytosine in DNA and is expressed in pluripotent tissues: implications for epigenetic reprogramming.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52353-52360Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AID and Apobec-1 are coexpressed with pluripotency genes in oocytes, embryonic germ cells and embryonic stem cells (Morgan et al., 2004Morgan H.D. Dean W. Coker H.A. Reik W. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates 5-methylcytosine in DNA and is expressed in pluripotent tissues: implications for epigenetic reprogramming.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52353-52360Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Finally, an intriguing recent study provided evidence that the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B may function either as a DNMT, or alternatively as a 5-meC deaminase in conditions of low cofactor (S-adenosylmethionine, see Discussion) (Metivier et al., 2008Metivier R. Gallais R. Tiffoche C. Le Peron C. Jurkowska R.Z. Carmouche R.P. Ibberson D. Barath P. Demay F. Reid G. et al.Cyclical DNA methylation of a transcriptionally active promoter.Nature. 2008; 452: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Elegant work by many groups has shown that enzymes of the AID and Apobec family are structurally related zinc-dependent cytidine deaminases that can operate on both RNA or DNA, with some members showing moderate deamination of 5-meC (Conticello et al., 2007Conticello S.G. Langlois M.A. Yang Z. Neuberger M.S. DNA deamination in immunity: AID in the context of its APOBEC relatives.Adv. Immunol. 2007; 94: 37-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Morgan et al., 2004Morgan H.D. Dean W. Coker H.A. Reik W. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates 5-methylcytosine in DNA and is expressed in pluripotent tissues: implications for epigenetic reprogramming.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52353-52360Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we will refer to their zebrafish orthologs collectively as AID/Apobec proteins. However, the use of 5-meC deamination as the first of two steps for 5-meC demethylation has been reasonably questioned, due to the creation of a mutagenic G:T intermediate. However, the physical coupling of a 5-meC deaminase with a thymine glycosylase could, in principle, rapidly remove the mutagenic thymine, enabling cytosine replacement by base excision repair (BER). Two potential glycosylase candidates are TDG and Mbd4, discussed above. Notably, MBD4 contains a methylated-DNA binding domain as well as a glycosylase domain that prefers to remove the thymine from a G:T mismatch (Hendrich et al., 1999Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. The thymine glycosylase MBD4 can bind to the product of deamination at methylated CpG sites.Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Although mice lacking Mbd4 are viable, they show a higher frequency of mutations at CpG sites (Millar et al., 2002Millar C.B. Guy J. Sansom O.J. Selfridge J. MacDougall E. Hendrich B. Keightley P.D. Bishop S.M. Clarke A.R. Bird A. Enhanced CpG mutability and tumorigenesis in MBD4-deficient mice.Science. 2002; 297: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Wong et al., 2002Wong E.

Mbd4 inactivation increases Cright-arrowT transition mutations and promotes gastrointestinal tumor formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 14937-14942Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, a role for the non-enzymatic factor Gadd45α in promoting demethylation was reported (Barreto et al., 2007Barreto G. Schafer A. Marhold J. Stach D. Swaminathan S.K. Handa V. Doderlein G. Maltry N. Wu W. Lyko F. Niehrs C. Gadd45a promotes epigenetic gene activation by repair-mediated DNA demethylation.Nature. 2007; 445: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Gadd45α knockdown lead to hypermethylation of bulk genome in human cells and its overexpression clearly reduced the DNA methylation status of the bulk genome and Oct-4 promoter (Barreto et al., 2007Barreto G. Schafer A. Marhold J. Stach D. Swaminathan S.K. Handa V. Doderlein G. Maltry N. Wu W. Lyko F. Niehrs C. Gadd45a promotes epigenetic gene activation by repair-mediated DNA demethylation.Nature. 2007; 445: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, a recent study questioned the sufficiency of Gadd45 overexpression to elicit DNA demethylation in human cells (Jin et al., 2008Jin S.G. Guo C. Pfeifer G.P. GADD45A does not promote DNA demethylation.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000013https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000013Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here we provide data that may help reconcile these observations, both supporting a role for Gadd45 while revealing Gadd45 as only one factor in a system of proteins involved in the demethylation process. Currently, the enzymes that may cooperate with Gadd45 to perform demethylation have remained unknown, though a link to DNA repair has been suggested (Barreto et al., 2007Barreto G. Schafer A. Marhold J. Stach D. Swaminathan S.K. Handa V. Doderlein G. Maltry N. Wu W. Lyko F. Niehrs C. Gadd45a promotes epigenetic gene activation by repair-mediated DNA demethylation.Nature. 2007; 445: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), and here candidate cooperating enzymes are evaluated. Taken together, we provide evidence for a coupled mechanism for 5-meC demethylation; deamination by AID/Apobec followed by thymine base excision by MBD4, can occur in zebrafish embryos, and is promoted by Gadd45. Previous work in zebrafish embryos revealed the in vivo demethylation of an in vitro-methylated DNA fragment (or plasmid) occurring during a particular window of embryo development (Collas, 1998Collas P. Modulation of plasmid DNA methylation and expression in zebrafish embryos.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of regulated DNA demethylation activity. In that study, and in our initial assay, the steady-state methylation status of a methylated DNA fragment (M-DNA, 736 bp, injected at the single-cell stage) was assessed by susceptibility to the restriction enzyme HpaII (which is methylation-inhibited). Four HpaII/MspI sites (CCGG) are present (Figure 1A), with HpaII or MspI digestion of the unmethylated (U) 736 bp DNA fragment generating five smaller fragments: two comigrating fragments of 250 bp and 240 bp, one of 176 bp, and two that are too small for detection (32 and 38 bp). MspI digestion (which is methylation insensitive) generates this spectrum from either unmethylated or fully methylated M-DNA (Figures 1A and 1B). Full methylation of the DNA fragment by HpaII methylase (which methylates the internal cytosine of an HpaII/MspI restriction enzyme site, CmeCGG) and the digestion behavior of the substrate was verified in vitro (Figure 1B). Following M-DNA injection into single-cell fertilized embryos, M-DNA was reisolated from the embryo at different developmental time points, treated with HpaII or MspI, and cleavage assessed via Southern analysis (note: the cleaved products (176-250 bp) transfer much more efficiently to the membrane that does the intact 736 bp M-DNA substrate, providing greater signal). We find that M-DNA remained largely methylated at ∼4 hr postfertilization (hpf), was slightly demethylated at ∼8 hpf (75% epiboly, Figure 1C, lane 5), became clearly demethylated at 13 hpf (early somite stage, Figure 1C, lane 8) and then became largely remethylated by 28 hpf (prim stage, Figure 1C, lane 11). This temporal pattern of demethylation/remethylation was also observed with an injected methylated closed circular plasmid (Figure S1 available with this article online). In addition, we noticed that a threshold level (∼50–100 pg) of M-DNA was required to elicit demethylation (Figure 1C and data not shown). Unexpectedly, M-DNA injection (or a methylated plasmid, > 100 pg) caused the demethylation of 20%–40% of the bulk genome at 13 hpf, as determined by mass spectrometric analysis of 5-meC content (Figure 1D) and HpaII sensitivity of the bulk genome (Figure S1). This genome-wide demethylation could also be elicited by the injection of the unmethylated 736 bp DNA fragment (U-DNA, Figure 1D), though not to the same extent as M-DNA. However, bisulphite sequencing revealed the methylation of > 50% of the CpGs on this fragment by 6 hpf (data not shown), in keeping with previous observations that injected DNA acquires methylation in early zebrafish embryos (Collas, 1998Collas P. Modulation of plasmid DNA methylation and expression in zebrafish embryos.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Notably, remethylation of the DNA fragment and the bulk genome subsequently occurred by 28 hpf (Figures 1C and S1), showing that DNA methylation systems remain functional. Taken together, genome-wide demethylation can be induced in zebrafish embryos by the injection of methylated DNA in a time and concentration dependent manner. To help focus our studies on particular enzyme candidates, we tested whether candidate enzymes were transcriptionally upregulated during or just prior to the peak of M-DNA demethylation (though a lack of upregulation does not exclude their involvement). First, we tested for upregulation of the three annotated members of the AID/Apobec deaminase family (AID, Apobec2a, and Apobec2b), all six annotated members of the AlkB dioxygenase family, four of the six Gadd45-family proteins, and the sole zebrafish homolog of human Mbd4, zMbd4. We note that zebrafish lack Apobec1/3 families as they are restricted to placental mammals. M-DNA injection upregulated the three AID/Apobec members (at 13 hpf), but not AlkB-related factors or zMbd4 (Figure 1E and data not shown), in a time and concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1F). Finally, RT-PCR analysis revealed exceptionally high levels of AID and zMbd4, and very low levels of zTDG, in the single-cell-stage embryo (30 min postfertization, Figure S2), where bulk DNA demethylation has most clearly been demonstrated in other studies (Mhanni and McGowan, 2004Mhanni A.A. McGowan R.A. Global changes in genomic methylation levels during early development of the zebrafish embryo.Dev. Genes Evol. 2004; 214: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore focused on AID/Apobec enzymes and Mbd4 for our studies. Involvement of AID/Apobec enzymes in demethylation was assessed by knockdown experiments using antisense morpholino-modified oligonucleotides (hereafter referred as morpholinos). We note that AID knockdown was only partial, whereas Apobec2a/b knockdowns were efficient (Figures S3A–S3C), with Apobec knockdowns verified by immunoblot analysis using antisera we raised against zebrafish Apobec2a or 2b. Knockdown of all three AID/Apobec members (but not each separately) attenuated demethylation of injected M-DNA and demethylation of the bulk genome caused by M-DNA injection at 13 hpf (Figure 1G and 1H, respectively). To test whether AID/Apobec enzymes affect the methylation status of the genome during normal development, in the absence of M-DNA injection, we measured global methylation levels in embryos injected with morpholinos against all three deaminase members (AID, Apobec2a and Apobec2b; termed AAAmo). Notably, at 24 hpf, AAAmo embryos harbor ∼12% more methylation than wild-type embryos (WT, 8.55+/−0.04%, AAAmo = 9.61+/−0.28%). Together, these results suggest that AID/Apobec enzymes normally reduce steady-state methylation levels. Notably, AID or Apobec2a/b overexpression (by RNA injection at the single-cell stage) had little or no impact (at 13 hpf) on HpaII cleavage of the bulk genome or the injected M-DNA fragment, or on 5-meC levels assessed by mass spectrometry (Figures 2A and 2B). This suggests that overexpressed AID/Apobec enzymes were either not targeted, or not activated, or both. Furthermore, the predicted product of successful deamination (a G:T mismatch) is not cleavable by HpaII; restoration of cleavage requires thymine removal (possibly by base excision) and cytosine reincorporation by repair or replication. We therefore tested whether coupling the deaminase with a glycosylase would provide demethylation. However, the current zebrafish genome-build remains incomplete, and lacks the 5′ end of zMbd4. Therefore, our overexpression studies instead employed full-length human Mbd4. The relevance of this approach is supported by the common observation that human orthologs effectively complement their zebrafish orthologs in knockdown/complementation studies (Lan et al., 2007Lan F. Bayliss P.E. Rinn J.L. Whetstine J.R. Wang J.K. Chen S. Iwase S. Alpatov R. Issaeva I.

As with AID/Apobec enzymes, overexpression of hMbd4 alone had little or no affect on methylation status (Figures 2A and 2B). Remarkably, coexpression of AID or Apobec2a/b along with hMbd4 provided clear DNA demethylation at 13 hpf as assessed by several methods and at multiple loci: HpaII cleavage of genomic DNA (Figure 2A, lane 11), mass spectrometric analysis of the bulk genome (Figure 2B, upper panel, lanes 13–15), HpaII cleavage of M-DNA (coinjected at 5 pg (subthreshold), Figure 2B, lower panel, lanes 13–15), and the bisulphite sequencing of M-DNA (Figure 2C), where demethylation was pronounced. AID involvement was not entirely unexpected given its known ability to deaminate 5me-C in single-stranded DNA in vitro; however the efficacy of Apobec2a/b (especially Apobec2b) was somewhat unexpected, as substrates have heretofore been elusive. Furthermore, demethylation required the catalytic activity of each AID/Apobec enzyme (Figures 2A and 2B), and mutation of the catalytic residue did not affect enzyme abundance (Figures S5A–S5C). Notably, the combination of AID/Apobec and hMbd4 overexpression, but not catalytic mutants, caused lethality by 24 hpf, consistent with observations in mice and zebrafish that even moderate changes in DNA methylation are highly detrimental or lethal (Ooi and Bestor, 2008Ooi S.K.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7077-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, we emphasize that AID or Apobec expression alone did not prevent MspI cleavage of M-DNA or the bulk genome. Here, deamination of 5-meC (if it occurred) would prevent MspI cleavage due to creation of G:T mismatches, but was not observed. These results suggest that deamination activity by AID/Apobec may not occur unless Mbd4 (and possibly other factors) are present and/or activated, explored below. Our overexpression experiments showed reductions in bulk methylation which we wanted to validate by the definitive bisulphite sequencing method. To this end, we examined the methylation status of two repetitive elements. Here, LINE-1 elements showed a clear difference in methylation pattern but little change in total methylation levels (Figure 2D, top panels), whereas KenoDr1 showed moderate demethylation (Figure 2D, bottom panels). As these loci are highly and constitutively methylated, we did not expect them to be normal targets of the demethylase system in somatic cells, but may have been targeted to these loci by overexpression and the presence of an MBD on Mbd4. Gene/promoter targets of the system are characterized later, following phenotypic analysis of morphants, and characterization of the demethylation mechanism. To test whether the demethylation reaction following AID and MBD4 coexpression proceeded through a G:T intermediate, two assays were performed on M-DNA (5 pg, coinjected with AID and Mbd4) reisolated from 13 hpf embryos: (1) PCR analysis of all four HpaII/MspI sites on M-DNA for the presence of a G:T base pair. The technique uses a ‘forward’ primer with a 3′-terminal adenosine complementary to the thymine base derived from the deamination of 5-meC at the initial G:5meC base pair in M-DNA (Figure 3A). The “reverse” primer is perfectly complimentary to a downstream region of M-DNA. Here, a PCR product will be generated only when a G:T intermediate is formed. (2) Isolation and sequencing of the M-DNA fragment for the frequency of 5-meC > T transitions (48 clones). Here, we reasoned that following deamination by AID, the thymine base of the mutagenic G:T intermediate is likely rapidly removed by Mbd4 glycosylase activity. To stabilize the putative G:T intermediate, and prevent rapid thymine removal, we coexpressed a catalytically inactive hMbd4 derivative (D560A) along with wild-type AID. Using our PCR strategy (Figure 3A), we clearly detected the diagnostic PCR product of the G:T intermediate (Figure 3B, lane 4) at all four initial HpaII sites (see Figure 1A), and on both DNA strands. In addition, sequencing of the recovered M-DNA fragment revealed a small number (2/48) of C > T transitions at the internal cytosine of the HpaII/MspI site, but no other mutations. Importantly, when wild-type AID and wild-type hMbd4 were coinjected neither assay yielded evidence for the proposed G:T intermediate (Figure 3B, lane 5). Furthermore, the catalytically inactive Mbd4 derivative (D560A) was expressed at levels equivalent to active hMbd4 (Figure S5D). Together, these results provide evidence that the G:T intermediate is created by AID deaminase activity and removed by Mbd4 glycosylase activity, and also suggest the possible physical coupling of the deaminase and the glycosylase to help ensure rapid thymine removal, addressed further below. We next addressed the regulation of the DNA demethylation activity and the coupling of deamination and thymine base excision by a glycosylase. Above, we showed that M-DNA demethylation occurs in a window of development and requires a threshold of DNA, raising the possibility that DNA damage signaling pathways activate this demethylation system. Notably, we found that Gadd45α (and Gadd45α-like), a gene activated by DNA damage (Hollander and Fornace, 2002Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Genomic instability, centrosome amplification, cell cycle checkpoints and Gadd45a.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6228-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and implicated previously in DNA demethylation (Barreto et al., 2007Barreto G.

However, zebrafish contain six Gadd45-family members (α/β/γ and α/β/γ-like, all highly similar to their human counterparts) making a comprehensive analysis of the entire family untenable. Therefore, we focused on the family member best associated with DNA damage signaling, Gadd45α, and extended our work to other family members when appropriate. Zebrafish Gadd45α overexpression elicited moderate demethylation of the M-DNA fragment (injected at 5 pg, below the threshold level for eliciting demethylation on its own, Figure 4B), and of the bulk genome (causing a ∼15% (or 9%) red"

Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.

We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings. Decision making affects all aspects of human behavior, on time scales varying from seconds to hours to days. For instance, imagine you are driving your car toward a busy intersection and your brakes fail. Within a few hundred milliseconds, you have to decide where to steer your car. Although this is a task we handle relatively easily, in fact it involves three separate, and nontrivial, stages. First, sensory evidence must be accumulated over time. Here, the sensory evidence consists of the image of cars and people in the intersection. Second, the accumulation must be stopped at some point (waiting too long can have disastrous consequences in this situation). Third, an action must be selected. This task is difficult because the sensory evidence and the response are continuous variables, the reliability of the sensory evidence is a priori unknown, and it can vary greatly over time. For instance, as you get closer to the intersection, your ability to distinguish different objects improves. The reliability of the visual information can also vary from day to day: it is much easier to analyze the scene on a sunny day than on a foggy one. There is currently no neural model that can deal with this type of decision optimally, where by optimal, we mean that the accumulation of evidence is done without loss of information and that the chosen option is the most likely one given the sensory evidence (we do not address the issue of when to make the decision; see Discussion). Yet, it is essential to understand optimal decision making in the face of multiple choices and unknown and time-varying reliability, since most decisions we make fall into this category. Most models are concerned only with binary decision making, and even with this limitation, cannot deal optimally with sensory evidence of unknown and continuously changing reliability. This problem is conceptual: these models have no clear probabilistic interpretation or, when they do, are limited to situations in which the evidence has a constant and known reliability over time and over trials. As a result, it is unclear how, or even if, they are related to the general case we consider in this paper. Here, we present the first neural model of decision making that performs sensory evidence accumulation and response selection optimally when there are multiple or a continuum of possible decisions and the reliability of the sensory input varies over time or across trials. This model is built around the observation that spike counts in the brain are close to what we call “Poisson-like” (Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A.

Given this observation, our main contributions are twofold. First, we show that for Poisson-like distributions, optimal evidence accumulation can be performed through simple integration of neural activities, while optimal response selection can be implemented through attractor dynamics. Second, we show (again for Poisson-like distributions of neural activity) that neurons encode the posterior probability distribution over the variables of interest at all times. This latter contribution has far-reaching implications, since it suggests that neurons implicated in simple perceptual decisions represent quantities that are directly relevant to inference, confidence, and belief.

However, it goes beyond previous neural models in three ways. First, it captures the speed-accuracy trade-off and the physiology of LIP cells in experiments involving four choices. Second, as previously indicated, it predicts that neural activity in LIP encodes a probability distribution over actions. This is a new prediction about the response of LIP neurons, which we have tested and verified using data from area LIP recorded while monkeys engaged in a decision among two or four alternatives. Third, it makes predictions for the responses of cells in LIP and SC when there are multiple choices, a continuum of choices, and when the reliability of the cue varies over time. For concreteness, we consider a motion direction task that has been extensively used to study decision making in humans and animals. In this task, an observer sees a random-dot kinematogram in which a fraction of the dots move coherently in a particular direction while all the other dots move randomly (Figure 1A). The task of the observer is to report the direction of motion with a saccadic eye movement to a choice target that is associated with that direction of motion. The reliability of the sensory evidence can be controlled by changing the percentage of dots moving coherently. In most experiments, this task is restricted to binary decision making (right versus left) and constant coherence over the course of a trial. We also consider a more general setting in which the mean direction of moving dots and the direction of the saccade can take any value (Figure 1B) and the reliability of the motion information (the coherence) can vary not only across trials, but also during a trial. A minimal model of this task (and, in fact, any decision-making task that involves integrating evidence over time) requires three distinct populations of neurons: an input layer, an evidence accumulation layer, and a readout layer where motor output is generated (Figure 1C). Here, we label these MT (middle temporal), LIP (lateral intraparietal), and SCb (superior colliculus, in particular those cells that exhibit a motor burst; hence the index “b”), based on what is known about the functions of these regions. These labels are used for convenience only: it is quite likely that the sensory integration involves many other cells beside the ones in LIP, and that the motor burst is not generated solely in the SC. We denote the population activity of M neurons in area MT at time tn by a vector rMT(tn) (see Figure 1C for an example), where rMT ≡ {r1MT,…, rMMT} and riMT(tn) is the spike count of neuron i in the time interval [(n-1)δt, nδt]. In our simulations we set δt to 50ms, although our results are insensitive to that choice. The stimulus is characterized by a direction of motion, s, and task-irrelevant variables such as contrast and motion coherence, which we refer to as nuisance parameters and collectively denote c (where c = {c(t1),c(t2),…,c(tN)}). When a stimulus (s,c) is presented, MT generates a series of patterns of activity over time, denoted rMT(t1:tN) ≡ {rMT(t1),…, rMT(tN)}. Because of neural variability, rMT(t1:tN) is not the same on every presentation of (s,c), but follows a probability distribution p(rMT(t1:tN)|s,c). If we assume that the activity is uncorrelated on timescales of 50 ms, this distribution can be written as a product over time,p(rMT(t1:tN)|s,c)=∏n=1Np(rMT(tn)|s,c(tn)).Given a series of activity patterns rMT(t1:tN) and assuming that one knows c, the optimal strategy for inferring the direction of motion is to apply Bayes' rule to compute a probability distribution over s, given rMT(t1:tN). If the prior on s is flat, this so-called posterior distribution is given byp(s|rMT(t1:tN),c)∝∏n=1Np(rMT(tn)|s,c)p(rMT(tn)|c).(1) This distribution captures everything there is to know about s given all the data from MT since the beginning of the trial, and as such, it retains all the information in the MT activity. Therefore, if the brain uses a Bayesian approach to decision making, the goal of the accumulation layer (LIP) should be to generate a pattern of activity at time tn that encodes this distribution (Equation 1). An even better solution would be to encode a posterior distribution p(s|rMT(t1:tN)) that does not depend on c, the nuisance parameters (or in the jargon of probabilistic inference, a posterior in which c has been marginalized out; p(s|rMT)=∫dcp(s|rMT,c)p(c|rMT)). This would allow downstream areas to perform optimal computations over LIP activity without having to estimate the nuisance parameters. In other words, we should seek a set of feedforward connections between MT and LIP, and lateral connections within LIP, such thatp(s|rLIP(tN))=p(s|rMT(t1:tN)).(2) It is critical to note that the approach we have just outlined requires that neural responses in MT and LIP represent probability distributions. In MT, rMT(tn) represents p(s|rMT(tn)), which is obtained from the response distribution, p(rMT(tn)|s) (sometimes called the noise distribution) through Bayes' rule: p(s|rMT(tn)) ∝ p(rMT(tn)|s), (we are assuming a flat prior over s for this encoding step; nonflat priors can be incorporated into our approach but are not central to the current argument). The same idea also applies to LIP. We refer to populations that represent probability distributions in this way as probabilistic population codes (Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The existence of such codes is central to our approach: neurons represent probability distributions via Bayes' rule and, as a result, neural computations, such as accumulation of evidence, can be optimized by tailoring neural operations to the encoded distributions. Once the accumulation is stopped, an action must be selected. The optimal strategy under many reasonable cost functions is to choose the action corresponding to the most likely stimulus. This value, denoted sˆ, is given bysˆ=argmaxsp(s|rMT(t1:tstop)),(3) where tstop is the stopping time. Note that, for simplicity, we use the same variable s to refer to both the direction of motion and the direction of a saccade, since they are indistinguishable in this experiment. In a minimal optimal network, the third layer should encode the estimate, sˆ, as a stereotyped motor command. This is a task for which attractor networks are ideally suited, because they can take a noisy hill of activity as input and produce a smooth hill of stereotyped shape and height as output (Zhang, 1996Zhang K. Representation of spatial orientation by the intrinsic dynamics of the head-direction cell ensemble: a theory.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2112-2126PubMed Google Scholar) (see top layer in Figure 1C). Stereotyped hills like these are observed, for instance, in the motor layer of the superior colliculus (SC), where the position of the peak of a hill determines the direction and amplitude of the upcoming saccade (Lee et al., 1988Lee C. Rohrer W.H. Sparks D.L. Population coding of saccadic eye movements by neurons in the superior colliculus.Nature. 1988; 332: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The fact that the hill is smooth in Figure 1C might appear unrealistic, but see the Supplemental Data available online for why this is in fact not a significant concern. The question we address in the rest of the paper is how to implement optimal accumulation (Equation 2) and optimal response selection (Equation 3) in neural hardware. Not surprisingly, the network connectivity needed to achieve optimality depends strongly on how the information about the stimulus is represented in MT, which in turn depends on the structure of the neuronal variability. Here, we assume that the variability in MT conditioned on the value of a stimulus belongs to the exponential family with linear sufficient statistics (Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). This choice is a natural one, since it is consistent with experimental measurements in a wide range of cortical areas (Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Specifically, we assume that p(rMT(tn)|s, c(tn)) has the formp(rMT(tn)|s,c(tn))=Φ(rMT(tn),c(tn))exp(h(s)⋅rMT(tn))(4) where Φ(rMT(tn), c(tn)) is an arbitrary function of rMT(tn) and c(tn), and “·” is the standard dot product: h(s)·rMT(tn) = Σihi(s)riMT(tn). Note that the nuisance parameter, c(tn), does not appear in the kernel h. In the rest of the paper, we refer to distributions with the property that h depends only on s as Poisson-like. Independent Poisson variability is a special case of the Poisson-like family, with hi(s) being the log of the tuning curve of neuron i. Importantly, correlated neuronal responses (as observed in the brain) are also in the Poisson-like family, although there are restrictions on the nuisance parameters (Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). These restrictions arise because h(s) is not independent of the tuning curves and the covariance matrix, but is related viah′(s)=Σ−1(s,c(tn))f′(s,c(tn))(5) where f(s,c(tn)) is the tuning curve (the mean of r as a function of s), a prime denotes a derivative with respect to s, and Σ(s,c(tn)) is the covariance matrix of r. Since the right-hand side of Equation 5 depends on c(tn) and the left-hand side does not, satisfying this equation is not trivial. There is, however, a rather natural condition under which it is satisfied: c(tn) is contrast (Sclar and Freeman, 1982Sclar G. Freeman R. Orientation selectivity in the cat's striate cortex is invariant with stimulus contrast.Exp. Brain Res. 1982; 46: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This is because contrast has a multiplicative effect on both tuning curves (Anderson et al., 2000Anderson J.S. Lampl I. Gillespie D.C. Ferster D. The contribution of noise to contrast invariance of orientation tuning in cat visual cortex.Science. 2000; 290: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Sclar and Freeman, 1982Sclar G. Freeman R. Orientation selectivity in the cat's striate cortex is invariant with stimulus contrast.Exp. Brain Res. 1982; 46: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and covariance (Gershon et al., 1998Gershon E.D. Wiener M.C. Latham P.E. Richmond B.J. Coding strategies in monkey V1 and inferior temporal cortices.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1135-1144PubMed Google Scholar, Kohn and Smith, 2005Kohn A.

The statistical reliability of signals in single neurons in cat and monkey visual cortex.Vision Res. 1983; 23: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), so f′(s,c(tn)) is proportional to some monotonic function g(c(tn)), Σ−1(s,c(tn)) is proportional to 1/g(c(tn)), and thus the c(tn) dependence disappears from the right-hand side. (This is also the case when c(tn) is stimulus intensity for tactile stimuli.) Whether or not Equation 5 is satisfied for other nuisance parameters must be checked on a case-by-case basis. If the activity in MT satisfies Equation 4, then we can insert Equation 4 into Equation 1, and we see that the right-hand side is independent of c. Thus, the probability of the stimulus given the entire history of MT activity is given byp(s|rMT(t1:tN))∝exp(h(s)⋅∑n=1NrMT(tn))(6) where the constant of proportionality depends on MT activity but not on s. Consequently, when the prior is flat, we see that Equation 2 is satisfied if the LIP activity is constructed by simply adding the MT activity,rLIP(tN)=∑n=1NrMT(tn).(7) The problem with this simple summing operation, however, is that LIP activity would saturate very quickly. Fortunately, it is possible to show that global inhibition can be used to alleviate this problem while preserving optimality (see Supplemental Note). Finally, to guarantee that the SCb activity peaks at the optimal location (at sˆ in Equation 3 and in Figure 1C), we must introduce recurrent connectivity so that the SCb layer can support a hill of activity without input. In addition, input to the SCb must be gated, so that it receives no input until decision time. Once a decision is made, the instantaneous activity in the LIP layer is used to initialize the SCb activity. After initialization, the LIP activity is removed, and the SCb layer evolves under its own dynamics. As shown in the Supplemental Note, if the neuronal variability is Poisson-like in LIP, the SCb layer peaks at sˆ whenv†SC(s)∝h′(s)(8) where v†SC(s) is the left null eigenvector of the Jacobian evaluated on the attractor implemented by the SCb and h′(s) is the same function that appears in Equation 5. Importantly, v†SC(s) can be tuned to satisfy Equation 8 by adjusting network parameters such as the weights of lateral connections in SCb. Consequently, when the neuronal variability is Poisson-like in LIP, there exists a set of parameters for which the superior colliculus generates a maximum-likelihood estimate. Note that if the variability in LIP is not Poisson-like, attractor dynamics is no longer guaranteed to be optimal. In fact, there is no known optimal network for most distributions. It is therefore quite remarkable that, of all distributions, the cortex appears to exhibit those for which attractor dynamics can be tuned to be optimal. There are several important features of our network that are somewhat hidden by the above analysis. First, if the neurons are Poisson-like, Equation 7 leads to optimal accumulation of evidence (i.e., Equation 2 is satisfied) even when the reliability of the sensory information varies from trial to trial or over the course of a single trial. This might sound counterintuitive at first. Consider, for example, an image whose contrast increases over time. Since the data become progressively more reliable, the decision should be based more strongly on the information acquired at later times. A way to implement this would be to boost the weights from MT onto LIP as the contrast increases. However, this reweighting would have to be done on very short timescales and would require a constantly updated and reliable estimate of contrast. With Poisson-like variability, there is no need to reweight the input over time, because both MT and LIP represent probability distributions at all times and in a manner which is invariant to the value of contrast. This is easy to see in the case of contrast: as contrast increases, the reliability of the sensory evidence increases, but so does the amplitude of the population activity in MT. Since the MT activity is added on top of LIP activity, its impact scales with its amplitude, and therefore, in proportion to its reliability. A second feature of our network is that the reliability of the data (encoded in the nuisance parameters, c) plays no role in estimating the stimulus, in the sense that even if we knew c our estimate of the posterior over the stimulus would not improve. This is a strong result, and one that is highly unusual in Bayesian inference. Much more typical is that the nuisance parameters are either estimated, or integrated out of the posterior, both of which introduce additional uncertainty in the inference process. The ramification of this is that, assuming no loss of information in processing after the SCb layer, the posterior in LIP exactly reflects the behavioral performance. For instance, if the posterior in LIP on a given trial is Gaussian with a standard deviation of 10° at decision time, and the decision involves computing the maximum-likelihood estimate, the discrimination threshold of the animal should be around 10° as well, across multiple trials of the same type. As we will discuss later, this prediction can be tested with existing data. Importantly, this prediction does not apply to the SCb layer in our model: instead, variability in this region, estimated on a trial-by-trial basis, would encode the motor error for the saccadic eye movement. We have shown so far that if the responses of MT neurons have Poisson-like statistics, optimal evidence accumulation can be performed by adding spikes over time, and optimal action selection can be performed with a single attractor network. Importantly, the attractor network can extract the maximum-likelihood estimate of the stimulus, s, without any need to know either the nuisance parameters, c, or how much time has elapsed since the start of the trial (M.N. Shadlen et al., 2006, Soc. Neurosci., abstract). These results are important but they are based on assumptions that are not necessarily exactly true in vivo. For instance, real neurons do not simply add spikes over time. Moreover, the response of MT neurons to random-dot kinematograms may not be exactly Poisson-like (in fact, it is not exactly Poisson-like according to the current models of MT; see Experimental Procedures). It is therefore essential that we test our theory in biologically realistic networks. In particular, we want to address two critical questions in the simulated network: (1) Does the LIP layer accumulate evidence optimally? (2) Can a single attractor network extract the maximum-likelihood estimate from LIP activity, for all coherences and at all times? For these simulations, we use a network similar to the one depicted in Figure 1C. For the LIP layer, we use linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) neurons (Plesser and Gerstner, 2000Plesser H.E. Gerstner W. Noise in integrate-and-fire neurons: from stochastic input to escape rates.Neural Comput. 2000; 12: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with a long time constant (1 s) (Renart et al., 2003Renart A. Song P. Wang X.J. Robust spatial working memory through homeostatic synaptic scaling in heterogeneous cortical networks.Neuron. 2003; 38: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures for details). We use LNP neurons because they provide a good approximation to real neurons, while producing spikes with realistic count statistics close to the exponential family (Paninski, 2004Paninski L. Maximum likelihood estimation of cascade point-process neural encoding models.Network: Computation in Neural Systems. 2004; 15: 243-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Plesser and Gerstner, 2000Plesser H.E. Gerstner W. Noise in integrate-and-fire neurons: from stochastic input to escape rates.Neural Comput. 2000; 12: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The LIP layer receives spatially correlated spike trains from area MT (Britten et al., 1993Britten K.H. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A. Responses of neurons in macaque MT to stochastic motion signals.Vis. Neurosci. 1993; 10: 1157-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, Zohary et al., 1994Zohary E. Shadlen M. Newsome W. Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implication for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The feedforward connections from MT to LIP, which are purely excitatory, connect neurons with similar direction preferences using a Gaussian weighting profile. The LIP layer also has lateral connections with short-range excitation and long-range inhibition; i.e., the weights are excitatory between neurons with similar preferred directions and inhibitory otherwise. The inhibition is used to prevent saturation. Finally, rather than constructing the SCb network, we make use of the fact that the line attractor implements a local linear estimator which can be tuned to be optimal (Deneve et al., 1999Deneve S. Latham P. Pouget A. Reading population codes: A neural implementation of ideal observers.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, Latham et al., 2003Latham P.E. Deneve S. Pouget A. Optimal computation with attractor networks.J. Physiol. (Paris). 2003; 97: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; see Supplemental Note). We focus first on the binary case, for which dots move at either 0° or 180°. Figure 2A shows the average activity in the LIP layer over time for a stimulus moving at 180°. The average posterior distribution encoded by these activity patterns is illustrated in Figure 2B. As expected, the probability corresponding to 180° grows over time while the probability corresponding to 0° decreases. In Figure 2C, we show firing rate versus time for all coherences and for the neurons optimally tuned to 180° and 0°. The neurons in the model behave quantitatively like actual LIP neurons, as can be seen in Figure 2D (data from Roitman and Shadlen, 2002Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Response of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area during a combined visual discrimination reaction time task.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9475-9489PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the LIP layer accumulates evidence optimally, we first consider experiments in which coherence is fixed within a trial. Here, we take “optimal” to mean that when LIP updates its estimate of the direction of motion of the moving dots, it takes into account both its own uncertainty about direction and the uncertainty in MT. From a quantitative point of view, this implies that the expected log odds of making a correct choice (log[pcorrect/(1-pcorrect)] where pcorrect is the probability of ma"

In the central nervous system (CNS), environmental stimuli regulate the development and function of neural circuits that underlie behavior and cognition. Sensory experience, which leads to an increase in neurotransmitter release onto individual neurons in the CNS, promotes both the maturation of synapses and the elimination of excess synapses within various neural circuits during postnatal development (Hua and Smith, 2004Hua J.Y. Smith S.J. Neural activity and the dynamics of central nervous system development.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and drives experience-dependent changes in synaptic connectivity that underlie learning and memory (Malinow and Malenka, 2002Malinow R. Malenka R.C. AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). One way increased neurotransmitter release triggers changes in circuit connectivity is through new gene transcription. Increased synaptic activity leads to calcium influx into the postsynaptic cell, which activates calcium-dependent signaling pathways that in turn regulate transcription factors within the nucleus (Flavell and Greenberg, 2008Flavell S.W. Greenberg M.E. Signaling mechanisms linking neuronal activity to gene expression and plasticity of the nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 563-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors that mediate neuronal activity-dependent transcription in neurons, including CREST and NeuroD, control early steps of neural circuit development such as dendritic outgrowth (Aizawa et al., 2004Aizawa H. Hu S.C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A.

Despite evidence that individual activity-regulated transcription factors control specific aspects of neural circuit development, the molecular mechanisms by which these factors coordinate complex processes such as dendritic outgrowth and synaptic development remain unclear. Previous studies have for the most part identified the target genes of activity-dependent transcription factors one at a time. Thus, the diversity and complexity of the activity-regulated gene networks remain to be investigated. For example, except perhaps for CREB, which has been suggested to control hundreds of target genes in neuronal cell lines (Impey et al., 2004Impey S. McCorkle S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Defining the CREB regulon: a genome-wide analysis of transcription factor regulatory regions.Cell. 2004; 119: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), it is not known if a given activity-regulated transcription factor regulates the expression of several or perhaps hundreds of target genes in order to coordinate a specific aspect of neural circuit development. MEF2 family transcription factors are critical for the development and function of many types of cells, including those found in the musculoskeletal, cardiac, vascular, immune, and nervous systems (Potthoff and Olson, 2007Potthoff M.J. Olson E.N. MEF2: a central regulator of diverse developmental programs.Development. 2007; 134: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In all of these contexts, MEF2 transcriptional activity is tightly regulated by extracellular stimuli. In neurons, MEF2 can be activated by neurotrophin stimulation as well as calcium influx resulting from increased neurotransmitter release at synapses. The neuronal activity-dependent activation of MEF2 induces a program of gene expression that restricts the number of excitatory synapses formed onto hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule neurons, and medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens both in vitro and in vivo (Barbosa et al., 2008Barbosa A.C.

Furthermore, the disruption of MEF2 expression in vivo in the hippocampus or the nucleus accumbens results in deficits in behavioral plasticity that are correlated with an increase in excitatory synapse number (Barbosa et al., 2008Barbosa A.C. Kim M.S. Ertunc M. Adachi M. Nelson E.D. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Kavalali E.T. Monteggia L.M.

Consistent with a widespread role for MEF2 in synapse development, a similar function for MEF2 has also been identified in species as distant from mammals as the nematode C. elegans, where mef-2 negatively regulates excitatory synaptic function at the cholinergic neuromuscular synapse (Simon et al., 2008Simon D.J. Madison J.M. Conery A.L. Thompson-Peer K.L. Soskis M. Ruvkun G.B. Kaplan J.M. Kim J.K. The microRNA miR-1 regulates a MEF-2-dependent retrograde signal at neuromuscular junctions.Cell. 2008; 133: 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of MEF2 as a mediator of activity-dependent synaptic development in a wide range of species, the mechanisms by which MEF2 orchestrates synaptic maturation are not known. To examine how MEF2 coordinates synapse development in response to neuronal activity, we have applied genome-wide strategies to identify the full complement of target genes that are controlled by MEF2 in neurons during the process of activity-dependent synapse development. This approach of understanding the function of a transcription factor through the identification of its target genes has the potential to reveal mechanistic insights into transcription factor function that might be missed by traditional loss-of-function experiments (through RNAi or gene targeting). Using the loss-of-function approach, it is often difficult to discern the direct effects of transcription factor removal (resulting from altered expression of its direct target genes) from the homeostatic effects that arise as an indirect consequence of altering the expression of an entire transcriptional program for several days. In this study, we have used genome-wide approaches to identify 182 activity-dependent MEF2 target genes that regulate a variety of different aspects of synaptic function including excitatory synapse weakening, excitatory synapse maturation, inhibitory synapse development and presynaptic vesicle release. Mutations in several of the MEF2 target genes in the human population result in an increased susceptibility to neurological disorders such as epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders, suggesting that these disorders may be caused at least in part by disruption of activity-dependent gene networks that control synapse development. One striking feature of the gene network controlled by MEF2 is that in response to neuronal activity there is a switch in polyadenylation site usage at many MEF2 target genes that results in the activity-dependent production of truncated mRNAs, many of which are predicted to have functions that are distinct from their pre-existing, full-length counterparts. Taken together, these experiments reveal new mechanisms by which the activity-regulated transcription factor MEF2 coordinates synaptic maturation during brain development. As a first step toward defining the activity-regulated MEF2-dependent transcriptional program that controls synapse development, we conducted an mRNA profiling experiment to identify activity-regulated genes in hippocampal neurons undergoing synapse development. Hippocampal neurons harvested from embryonic day 18 (E18) rats were grown in dissociated cultures for 10 days in vitro (DIV). Hippocampal neurons at this stage in their development are undergoing extensive changes in both synapse number and synaptic strength, and we have previously shown that the manipulation of MEF2 activity in these cells alters the course of synapse development (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To identify activity-regulated genes that might control synapse development, we exposed neurons to elevated levels of extracellular potassium chloride (KCl), which leads to membrane depolarization and calcium influx via L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Using Affymetrix RAE230.2 microarrays that include ∼30,000 probe sets, we identified 643 probe sets that are upregulated after 1 or 6 hr of membrane depolarization (Figure 1A). Importantly, a large number of the genes we identified are also activated by physiological levels of neurotransmitter release in vivo, including c-fos, bdnf, gadd45b, nr4a1(or nur77), egr1, arc, and many others (Majdan and Shatz, 2006Majdan M. Shatz C.J. Effects of visual experience on activity-dependent gene regulation in cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 650-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine which of these activity-regulated genes might be targets of MEF2 that control synapse development, MEF2 expression in neurons was reduced by introducing into the neurons MEF2A- and MEF2D-specific shRNAs using lentiviral vectors. By comparing the microarray results between the control (scrambled shRNA expression) and MEF2 RNAi conditions both before and after membrane depolarization, we were able to identify a large set of genes whose expression is altered as a result of MEF2 knockdown (1365 probe sets identified; Figure 1B). When the genes whose expression is downregulated in the presence of MEF2 RNAi (at any time point) are pooled together into a single gene set, there is a highly significant level of overlap between this gene set and the activity-regulated gene set (151 overlapping probe sets, p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test; Figure 1D). The genes that are present in both gene sets are most often decreased in their expression in the presence of MEF2 RNAi either one or six hours after membrane depolarization (147/151, or 97%), but only rarely in unstimulated cells (25/151, or 17%). Importantly, the majority (70%) of the activity-regulated genes identified in our initial analysis are induced normally even in the presence of MEF2 RNAi. This indicates that the knockdown of MEF2 does not prevent activity-dependent gene expression generally, but instead alters the expression of a subset of activity-regulated genes. It is possible that in the MEF2 loss-of-function experiments we might have failed to identify particular activity-regulated MEF2 target genes because another transcription factor compensates for the loss of MEF2 at the promoters of these genes. To circumvent this potential problem, we performed a MEF2 gain-of-function experiment in hippocampal neurons at the time that synapses are forming and maturing. For these experiments we employed an inducible form of MEF2 in which the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) is fused to the C terminus of the constitutively active MEF2-VP16 fusion protein to generate MEF2-VP16-ER. We have previously shown that in the absence of the ER ligand 4-OH-Tamoxifen (4OHT), MEF2-VP16-ER remains sequestered in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons and is inactive (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, upon addition of 4OHT to the culture media MEF2-VP16-ER rapidly translocates to the nucleus and activates MEF2-dependent transcription. Hippocampal neurons were transduced with a lentivirus that drives the expression of MEF2-VP16-ER and mRNA profiling experiments were performed in the absence or presence of 4OHT using the same microarray platform described above. To control for the nonspecific effects that 4OHT application or MEF2-VP16-ER expression might have on gene expression, we generated a lentivirus that expresses a DNA binding-deficient control version of MEF2-VP16-ER (MEF2ΔDBD-VP16-ER) and performed a parallel series of experiments using neurons transduced with this virus. Probe sets that were upregulated in response to 4OHT application in both MEF2-VP16-ER- and MEF2ΔDBD-VP16-ER-expressing neurons were excluded from further analysis. We identified 251 probe sets that display increased expression in neurons expressing MEF2-VP16-ER within 1 or 2.5 hr of 4OHT application, but not in neurons expressing MEF2ΔDBD-VP16-ER (Figure 1C). We asked whether these probe sets overlap with the activity-regulated gene set or the set of genes whose expression is downregulated in the presence of MEF2 RNAi. In both cases there was a highly significant degree of overlap (75 and 55 probe sets, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both comparisons, Fisher's exact test; Figure 1D), whereas the group of probe sets that were downregulated as a consequence of 4OHT application to MEF2-VP16-ER-expressing neurons did not significantly overlap with either of the other gene sets. Moreover, the MEF2-VP16-ER-induced gene set did not overlap with genes whose expression is increased in the presence of MEF2 RNAi or genes whose expression decreased upon KCl treatment. These data demonstrate that the gain-of-function approach to MEF2 target gene identification largely corroborates the loss-of-function approach. Because the genes identified by the KCl depolarization, MEF2 RNAi and MEF2-VP16-ER experiments overlap in a manner that is statistically significant and converge on a common set of genes (Figure 1D), it is likely that the genes that are present in more than one of these gene sets include the bona fide activity-regulated MEF2 target genes in hippocampal neurons. In our subsequent studies we only considered genes identified in at least two of these three gene sets. This approach allows for the possibilities that any single one of the approaches to MEF2 target gene discovery might not have detected all of the activity-regulated MEF2 target genes and that some of the genes present in one particular gene set might not be bona fide activity-regulated MEF2 target genes. We found that 221 probe sets were present in at least two of these three gene sets (Table S1). These probe sets map to 182 nonredundant genes that can be confidently mapped in the rat genome and were therefore the subject of further analysis. We randomly selected 15 of these genes for validation by an independent method, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and found that over 95% of the expression changes that were initially identified by the microarray analysis were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Figures S1–S3). These data indicate that the results from these microarray experiments have a low false-discovery rate. Because these initial experiments were performed using cultured neurons, we examined whether the set of candidate MEF2 target genes identified in these experiments are also induced upon physiological stimulation of neurons in the intact brain. To address this issue, we conducted a microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression is increased in response to sensory experience. To enhance levels of sensory experience, rats that had been housed in a standard laboratory cage (control) were placed for 3 hr in a novel cage containing objects of different shapes and colors that induce exploratory behavior, a procedure that has previously been shown to lead to new gene transcription in neurons in the forebrain (novel environment; Nithianantharajah and Hannan, 2006Nithianantharajah J. Hannan A.J. Enriched environments, experience-dependent plasticity and disorders of the nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, Ramanan et al., 2005Ramanan N. Shen Y. Sarsfield S. Lemberger T. Schutz G. Linden D.J. Ginty D.D. SRF mediates activity-induced gene expression and synaptic plasticity but not neuronal viability.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We identified 304 probe sets that display increased expression in the forebrains of rats exposed to a novel environment (n = 6 animals per condition; Figure 1E). These microarray results were also validated by RT-qPCR (Figure S4). The candidate MEF2 target genes characterized in cultured hippocampal neurons represent a large fraction (16%, or 48/304) of the genes that are upregulated in vivo in response to new sensory experience. Moreover, 22% (48/221) of the candidate MEF2 target genes that are upregulated as a result of membrane depolarization of cultured neurons are also induced by new sensory experiences in vivo, a level that is far greater than would be expected by chance alone (p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). Consistent with these results, a large number of the candidate MEF2 target genes were also identified in a screen for genes whose expression is increased in neurons in primary visual cortex in response to visual stimulation (including c-fos, bdnf, gadd45b, nur77, egr1, arc, and many others; Majdan and Shatz, 2006Majdan M. Shatz C.J. Effects of visual experience on activity-dependent gene regulation in cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 650-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For individual genes, the fold increase in gene expression in response to KCl treatment in vitro was highly correlated with the fold increase in gene expression in response to exposure to a novel environment (R2 = 0.36; p < 0.0001), although the level of induction was consistently less robust in the novel environment experiment. This suggests that these two types of stimulation activate gene expression through similar mechanisms. However, the in vivo experiment appears to be less sensitive at detecting activity-regulated changes in gene expression, likely due to the heterogeneity of the cell population. Nevertheless, because the gene expression changes detected by these two approaches are highly correlated and overlap significantly, we conclude that a large fraction of the candidate MEF2 target genes identified in cultured neurons are induced in the brains of animals exposed to novel sensory experiences. The mRNA profiling experiments described above do not address whether the genes identified are direct or indirect targets of MEF2. To determine which of these genes are directly regulated by MEF2 and to provide additional confirmation that our microarray experiments had indeed identified MEF2 target genes, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by tiling microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) to identify MEF2D-binding sites within the regulatory regions of these 182 genes. We developed ChIP conditions under which a MEF2D-specific antibody immunoprecipitated DNA fragments of the nur77 proximal promoter, a genomic region known to be bound by MEF2 (Figure S5; Youn et al., 2000Youn H.D. Chatila T.A. Liu J.O. Integration of calcineurin and MEF2 signals by the coactivator p300 during T-cell apoptosis.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4323-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Preabsorption of the anti-MEF2D antibody with the peptide antigen used to generate the antibody blocked its ability to immunoprecipitate MEF2D proteins as well as nur77 promoter DNA fragments (Figure S5). Because these polyclonal anti-MEF2D antibodies might nonspecifically immunoprecipitate some DNA fragments and therefore lead to the misidentification of MEF2D binding sites, we used the MEF2 peptide-absorbed anti-MEF2D antibody as a negative control in all of the MEF2D ChIP-chip experiments described below. We performed MEF2D ChIP-chip using a custom tiling microarray containing the genomic loci of the 182 genes identified in our mRNA profiling experiments (including 10 kb 5′ and 3′ to the genes). In these experiments, we also mapped the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) within the putative MEF2 target genes by performing ChIP-chip with an antibody that specifically recognizes RNA polymerase II when bound to sites of transcription initiation (Figures 2C and 2D; Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S. Ku M. Jaffe D.B. Issac B. Lieberman E. Giannoukos G. Alvarez P. Brockman W. Kim T.K. Koche R.P. et al.Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). To identify regions of MEF2D and RNA polymerase II occupancy, we developed a “peak-calling” algorithm that identified reproducible regions of MEF2D or RNA polymerase II binding that were not detected in negative control ChIP experiments conducted in parallel. Binding of MEF2D to a subset of the genomic regions identified through ChIP-chip was verified by subsequent ChIP-qPCR experiments (92%, or 12 of the 13 regions tested; Figure S6). These data indicate that the ChIP-chip approach can be used to identify regions of MEF2D occupancy in the rat genome. Of the 182 genes examined, 78 (43%) have MEF2D binding sites within the gene (including gene exons and introns) or within 10 kb 5′ or 3′ of the gene (Table S2). This represents a notable increase over the background level of MEF2 binding detected on a separate chromosomal tiling microarray that was carried out as a control (8.8%) and MEF2 binding to arbitrarily selected control genes that were included on our custom tiling microarray (21%). These experiments demonstrate that the genes identified in our expression analyses display an enrichment of nearby regions of MEF2D occupancy and indicate that a large number of the genes identified by the gene expression analyses are likely to be direct targets of MEF2. To determine whether the genomic regions of MEF2D occupancy that we identified serve as functionally important MEF2-binding sites, we performed several analyses. First, we reasoned that if these genomic regions play critical roles in gene regulation, the nucleotide sequences within these regions should be highly conserved through vertebrate evolution. Indeed, compared to other sequences included on the tiling microarray, the MEF2D-bound regions are significantly enriched for evolutionarily conserved nucleotides (p < 0.001, χ2 test; Figure 2E). Second, we asked whether a specific nucleotide sequence motif was more commonly found within the MEF2D-bound genomic regions than elsewhere in the rat genome. An unbiased analysis of these genomic regions identified a ten-nucleotide motif that is significantly enriched within these regions and can be found in 80% of the regions of MEF2D occupancy. This sequence [(C/T)TA(T)4TAG] is nearly identical to the previously characterized MEF2 binding site, (C/T)TA(T/A)4TA(G/A), also termed the MEF2 response element (MRE; Figure 2F; Potthoff and Olson, 2007Potthoff M.J. Olson E.N. MEF2: a central regulator of diverse developmental programs.Development. 2007; 134: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Compared to identical sequences found elsewhere in the rat genome (this sequence is predicted to occur randomly every ∼350 base pairs), the MREs found within regions of MEF2D binding are significantly more likely to be conserved through vertebrate evolution (p < 0.01, χ2 test; Figure 2G), suggesting that they are likely to be functionally important. Taken together with the mRNA profiling experiments, these analyses strongly suggest that MEF2, by binding to evolutionarily conserved MREs near MEF2 target genes, directly regulates the expression of a large set of activity-regulated genes in neurons at the time that synapses are developing and maturing. The sites of MEF2D binding were often (28% of the sites) located close to the 5′ ends of Reference Sequence (RefSeq)-annotated mRNAs transcribed from the MEF2-regulated genes, sugg"

Here, we show that energy deprivation induces phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha (eIF2alpha-P), which increases the translation of BACE1. Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2alpha-P phosphatase PP1c, directly increases BACE1 and elevates Abeta production in primary neurons. Preventing eIF2alpha phosphorylation by transfection with constitutively active PP1c regulatory subunit, dominant-negative eIF2alpha kinase PERK, or PERK inhibitor P58(IPK) blocks the energy-deprivation-induced BACE1 increase. Furthermore, chronic treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with energy inhibitors increases levels of eIF2alpha-P, BACE1, Abeta, and amyloid plaques. Importantly, eIF2alpha-P and BACE1 are elevated in aggressive plaque-forming 5XFAD transgenic mice, and BACE1, eIF2alpha-P, and amyloid load are correlated in humans with AD. These results strongly suggest that eIF2alpha phosphorylation increases BACE1 levels and causes Abeta overproduction, which could be an early, initiating molecular mechanism in sporadic AD."
https://openalex.org/W1979417055,"Ultraviolet (UV) light-induced pyrimidine photodimers are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Photolesions have biophysical parameters closely resembling undamaged DNA, impeding discovery through damage surveillance proteins. The DDB1-DDB2 complex serves in the initial detection of UV lesions in vivo. Here we present the structures of the DDB1-DDB2 complex alone and bound to DNA containing either a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photodimer (6-4PP) lesion or an abasic site. The structure shows that the lesion is held exclusively by the WD40 domain of DDB2. A DDB2 hairpin inserts into the minor groove, extrudes the photodimer into a binding pocket, and kinks the duplex by approximately 40 degrees. The tightly localized probing of the photolesions, combined with proofreading in the photodimer pocket, enables DDB2 to detect lesions refractory to detection by other damage surveillance proteins. The structure provides insights into damage recognition in chromatin and suggests a mechanism by which the DDB1-associated CUL4 ubiquitin ligase targets proteins surrounding the site of damage."
https://openalex.org/W2088189569,"Availability of genome-scale in situ hybridization data allows systematic analysis of genetic neuroanatomical architecture. Within the hippocampus, electrophysiology and lesion and imaging studies demonstrate functional heterogeneity along the septotemporal axis, although precise underlying circuitry and molecular substrates remain uncharacterized. Application of unbiased statistical component analyses to genome-scale hippocampal gene expression data revealed robust septotemporal molecular heterogeneity, leading to the identification of a large cohort of genes with robust regionalized hippocampal expression. Manual mapping of heterogeneous CA3 pyramidal neuron expression patterns demonstrates an unexpectedly complex molecular parcellation into a relatively coherent set of nine expression domains in the septal/temporal and proximal/distal axes with reciprocal, nonoverlapping boundaries. Unique combinatorial profiles of adhesion molecules within these domains suggest corresponding differential connectivity, which is demonstrated for CA3 projections to the lateral septum using retrograde labeling. This complex, discrete molecular architecture provides a novel paradigm for predicting functional differentiation across the full septotemporal extent of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2111419867,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mitogen and permeability factor for endothelial cells that plays a central role in angiogenesis, vascular maintenance, inflammation, and cancer. VEGF also mediates the homeostatic adaptation to hypoxic conditions by promoting an increase in vascular density to compensate for decreased oxygenation. This process is triggered by an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1α), which becomes active in hypoxic tissues, leading to the synthesis and secretion of VEGF. The role of HIF1α in other processes that involve angiogenesis such as in inflammation is less clear. Of interest, endothelial cells not only respond to but also store and secrete VEGF, which is required for the maintenance of the integrity of the vascular system. How this intracellular pool of VEGF is regulated is still not understood. Here, we found that CXCL8/IL8, a potent proangiogenic and inflammatory chemokine, up-regulates VEGF mRNA and protein levels in endothelial cells by acting on its cognate receptor, CXCR2, and that this results in the autocrine activation of VEGFR2. Surprisingly, this process does not involve HIF1α but instead requires the activation of the transcription factor NFκB. Furthermore, we identified the components of the CBM complex, Carma3, Bcl10, and Malt1, as key mediators of the CXCL8/IL8-induced NFκB activation and VEGF up-regulation.

Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7868) Google Scholar). These molecules are essential for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during development and are required for vascular maintenance in adults (2Lee S. Chen T.T. Barber C.L. Jordan M.C. Murdock J. Desai S. Ferrara N. Nagy A. Roos K.P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). VEGF-A, referred herein as VEGF, is the best studied member of the family and has been extensively implicated in a multitude of physiological and pathological conditions (3Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7476) Google Scholar). The production and secretion of VEGF is regulated by a now well understood mechanism by which cells deprived of oxygen induce the expression of this potent angiogenic factor through the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1), which in turn increases the formation of blood vessels and thus restores the supply of nutrients and oxygen (4Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). The HIF1 transcription factor is composed of two subunits, HIF1α and HIF1β, the former being synthesized in most cells but rapidly degraded by a mechanism that involves its oxygen-dependent ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome (4Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1α accumulates and translocates to the nucleus where it binds together with HIF1β to specific hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs), thereby activating the transcription of target genes. The crucial role of HIF1 in VEGF regulation is underscored by the observation that homozygous deletion of HIF1α results in embryonic lethality at midgestation (embryonic day 10.5) due to severely impaired vascular formation among other abnormalities (5Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Recent elegant studies in which the VEGFA gene was conditionally deleted in endothelial cells in adult mice revealed that these cells not only respond to VEGF but also express VEGF and that the latter is required for the maintenance of the integrity of the vascular system (2Lee S. Chen T.T. Barber C.L. Jordan M.C. Murdock J. Desai S. Ferrara N. Nagy A. Roos K.P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that HIF1-independent mechanisms regulating VEGF expression may also exist (6Arany Z. Foo S.Y. Ma Y. Ruas J.L. Bommi-Reddy A. Girnun G. Cooper M. Laznik D. Chinsomboon J. Rangwala S.M. Baek K.H. Rosenzweig A. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). For instance, the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL8/IL8 can rescue the proangiogenic phenotype in HIF1α-deficient cancer cells, probably by preserving VEGF expression and secretion by a HIF1α-independent mechanism (7Mizukami Y. Jo W.S. Duerr E.M. Gala M. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Zukerberg L.R. Kohgo Y. Lynch M.P. Rueda B.R. Chung D.C. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). As how the endogenous pool of VEGF in endothelial cells is regulated is still unknown, these findings prompted us to examine whether CXCL8/IL8 may control VEGF expression in endothelial cells. Indeed, we show here that CXCL8/IL8 promotes the NFκB-dependent autocrine activation of VEGFR2 receptors in endothelial cells by modulating their intracellular VEGF pool, which in turn may contribute to the proangiogenic response to inflammatory processes. Cell Lines, Tissue Culture, and Transfections-SV40-immortalized murine endothelial cells (SVEC4–10) where purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cell culture, DNA transfections using ExGen 500 (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) and transfection of siRNAS (Qiagen) at a final concentration of 50 nm using HiPerFect (Qiagen) were performed as described (8Gavard J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). At least two target sequences were used for each knockdown experiment: Carma3, Mm_Card10_1 and_2; Bcl10, Mm_Bcl10_1 and _2; Malt1, Mm_Malt1_1 and _2; TAK1, Mm_Map3k7_1 and _2; HIF1α, Mm_HIF1α_1 and _2. pGIPZ shRNA lentivectors targeting murine CXCR2 were from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) (RMM4431-99211322). Lentiviral production was performed using standard protocols. Reporter Activity, Nuclear NFκB Assays, and VEGF Levels-SVEC cells were transfected with different expression vectors in combination with 100 ng of a 5× NFκB luciferase reporter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or a human VEGFA promoter, pGL3 VEGFA(–2274 + 379) (9Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S.

Luciferase activity and NFκB binding assays using nuclear extracts (TransAM NFκB p65, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) were performed as described (10Martin D. Galisteo R. Ji Y. Montaner S. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). VEGF levels in serum-free cell supernatants were determined using the mouse VEGF Quantikine immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Immunoblot Assays-Western blotting was performed as described previously (10Martin D. Galisteo R. Ji Y. Montaner S. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Carma3 was purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Goat polyclonal anti TAK1 (M-17), rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl 10 (H-197), and Malt1 (H-300) and mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-VEGF (C-1) and anti-tubulin (TU-02) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal p-IκBα (Ser-32/36), rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphorylated IKK (α/β), anti-IKKβ, and anti IκBα were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc (Danvers, MA). Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). Representative Western blots of experiments that were repeated 3–4 times are shown in every case. Quantitative PCR-Total RNA was isolated from cultures and processed as described (10Martin D. Galisteo R. Ji Y. Montaner S. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One μg of cDNA was used as template for quantitative PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Samples were analyzed using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ multicolor real-time PCR detection system. Oligonucleotides used for amplification were: murine Vegfa, forward, 5′-atgaactttctgctctcttgggtg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gacttctgctctccttctgtcgtg-3′; murine Gapdh, forward, 5′-gaaggtgaaggtcggagtc-3′, and reverse, 5′-gaagatggtgatgggatttc-3′. Statistical Analysis-ANOVA followed by the Tukey t test was used to analyze the differences between experimental groups. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). As CXCL8/IL8 is a proangiogenic chemokine (11Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), we asked whether this inflammatory mediator affects the endogenous levels of VEGF in endothelial cells. Using immortalized murine endothelial cells in monolayer cultures, we observed that CXCL8/IL8 promotes the accumulation of Vegfa mRNA and protein in endothelial cells under normoxic conditions, reaching levels comparable with those provoked by the exposure to hypoxia (1% O2) (Fig. 1, A and B). This effect was reflected by the enhanced secretion of VEGF to the culture media (Fig. 1C). However, the release of VEGF was more limited, in response to both CXCL8/IL8 and hypoxia, in line with the existence of an intracellular pool of VEGF in endothelial cells (2Lee S. Chen T.T. Barber C.L. Jordan M.C. Murdock J. Desai S. Ferrara N. Nagy A. Roos K.P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Increased expression of VEGF in response to CXCL8/IL8 was paralleled by the accumulation of the active, phosphorylated form of VEGFR2, to an extent similar to that achieved under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the effect of CXCL8/IL8 was dependent on the activation of its cognate receptors, we examined whether the induction of VEGF expression was sensitive to the blockade by a specific CXCR2 inhibitor, SB-225002. As shown in Fig. 1D, SB-225002 prevented the increase of VEGF levels in response to IL8. We further confirmed these results by knocking down CXCR2 using specific shRNAs. In cells where CXCR2 was effectively knocked down, CXCL8/IL8-mediated up-regulation of VEGF was impaired (Fig. 1E). In most cell types, including tumor cells, VEGF secretion is up-regulated in response to hypoxia through the HIF1α/HIF1β transcription factor. As hypoxic conditions are unlikely to occur in capillary endothelial cells, which are exposed to the general circulation and have a similar PO2 as arterial blood (12Nathan A.T. Singer M. Br. Med. Bull. 1999; 55: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we wanted to address the contribution of HIF1 to CXCL8/IL8 induction of VEGF expression and secretion in endothelial cells. First, as shown in Fig. 2A, hypoxia treatment induced HIF1α accumulation, likely reflecting its stabilization, but CXCL8/IL8-treated cells did not. Furthermore, using HIF1α siRNA that led to the selective knockdown of HIF1α (Fig. 2B), we observed that hypoxia, but not CXCL8/IL8, induced an HRE reporter system (9Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). However, under conditions in which HIF1α function is inhibited, CXCL8/IL8 still retained the ability to induce a large increase in VEGFA promoter-driven transcription (Fig. 2D), as well as Vegfa mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2, E and F), thus strongly suggesting that the mechanism by which CXCL8/IL8 induces VEGF in endothelial cells is HIF1-independent. The murine Vegfa promoter contains, in addition to the hypoxia-responsive elements, two putative proximal NFκB-response elements (13Ramanathan M. Pinhal-Enfield G. Hao I. Leibovich S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which prompted us to examine whether this transcription factor contributes to VEGF expression in response to CXCL8/IL8. Activation of the NFκB family of transcription factors involves two main molecular routes described as canonical and non-canonical pathways. Ultimately these mechanisms converge on the activation of the IKK complex, formed by the kinases IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory subunit IKKγ (14Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar), leading to the phosphorylation of the IκB inhibitory proteins and nuclear translocation of the NFκB dimers, which regulate the expression of multiple genes (14Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). Of interest, CXCL8/IL8 is a prototypical target of NFκB, but whether this proinflammatory cytokine induces NFκB remains largely unexplored. Thus, we first examined whether CXCL8/IL8 induces NFκB activation. As shown in Fig. 3A, CXCL8/IL8 rapidly increased the phosphorylation of IKBα with the concomitant decrease on the levels of IκB followed by the recovery of IκB at later time points due to the NFκB transcriptional response of the IκB promoter (15Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The increased phosphorylation of IκB was significantly inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment (Fig. 3B), suggesting the contribution of a G protein of the Gi family in this response. The activation of NFκB in response to CXCL8/IL8 was reflected by increased NFκB-driven promoter expression (Fig. 3C) and NFκB nuclear binding activity to its response elements (Fig. 3D). These responses were also significantly inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment (not shown). In all cases, the potent NFκB inducer TNFα was used as a control. To explore the role of NFκB in CXCL8/IL8 stimulation in VEGF expression, we used an IκB mutant (IκBα S32A/S36A, IκB superrepressor, IκBsr) protein resistant to phosphorylation and degradation, acting as a constitutive repressor (16Squarize C.H. Castilho R.M. Sriuranpong V. Pinto Jr., D.S. Gutkind J.S. Neoplasia (N.Y.). 2006; 8: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As show in Fig. 3E, CXCL8/IL8 induced a 4-fold activation of an NFκB-Luc reporter plasmid, and this activation was completely inhibited by IκBsr. Furthermore, IκBsr prevented the stimulation of the VEGFA promoter reporter by CXCL8/IL8 but had no effect on the activation induced by hypoxia (Fig. 3F). In addition, IκBsr effectively reduced the levels of CXCL8/IL8-induced Vegfa mRNA and the production and secretion of VEGF (Fig. 3, G and H). These results provided evidence that an NFκB-dependent mechanism drives the expression of VEGF induced by CXCL8/IL8. Although recent efforts addressing how cytokine receptors, such as TNFα and IL1, activate NFκB have provided a detailed molecular understanding of this process (14Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar), the molecular events by which the large family of G protein-coupled receptors activate NFκB is still much less understood. Recent evidence suggests that lysophosphatidic acid receptors stimulate NFκB through a molecular complex known as CBM, which is formed by Carma3, Bcl10, and Malt1 (17Klemm S. Zimmermann S. Peschel C. Mak T.W. Ruland J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, we used an siRNA-mediated knockdown approach to address whether this complex is also implicated in the activation of NFκB by CXCR2-CXCL8/IL8. We identified siRNA duplexes that effectively knock down the expression of Carma3, Bcl10, Malt1, and also the kinase TAK1, which is essential in mediating the activation of NFκB induced by TNFα (14Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, knockdown of any of the components of the CBM complex significantly reduced the activation of NFκB in response to CXCL8/IL8, whereas TAK1 siRNA had only a marginal effect (Fig. 4B). Conversely, Carma3, Bcl10, and Malt1 had no effect on NFκB activation induced by TNFα, whereas knockdown of TAK1 strongly impaired TNFα induced activation of NFκB (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the levels of Vegfa mRNA and VEGF expression and secretion were drastically reduced by the knockdown of Carma3, Bcl10, and Malt1, whereas diminishing TAK1 levels had minimum or no effect (Fig. 4, E and F). Consistently with these findings, inhibition of NFκB activation by interfering with the function of the CBM complex prevented the increased activation of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells in response to CXCL8/IL8. Together, these findings support the emerging role of the CXCL8/IL8-CXCR2-initiated signaling axis controlling NFκB activation in stimulating the expression of VEGF, thereby promoting the autocrine activation of VEGFR2. VEGF and CXCL8/IL8 play a key function in acute and chronic inflammation, which is characterized by enhanced vascular permeability and angiogenesis (18Nagy J.A. Vasile E. Feng D. Sundberg C. Brown L.F. Detmar M.J. Lawitts J.A. Benjamin L. Tan X. Manseau E.J. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The activated endothelium secretes CXCL8/IL8 in areas of injury (19Utgaard J.O. Jahnsen F.L. Bakka A. Brandtzaeg P. Haraldsen G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), thus inducing the rapid recruitment neutrophils and macrophages that provide the first line of defense against bacterial and viral infection. These leukocytes in turn secrete prestored VEGF and CXCL8/IL8 to facilitate their extravasation to the adjacent tissue through a hypoxia-independent mechanism (20Koehne P. Willam C. Strauss E. Schindler R. Eckardt K.U. Buhrer C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H817-H824PubMed Google Scholar). Our results may provide a mechanism by which CXCL8/IL8 and likely other inflammatory mediators may in turn promote the expression of VEGF in endothelial cells under non-hypoxic conditions. Although hypoxia can still occur during inflammation, this is often the result of ischemic conditions or due to secondary edema in severe cases (21Weibel E.R. The Pathway for Oxygen: Structure and Function in the Mammalian Respiratory System. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1984Google Scholar). During the first stages of the inflammatory process, however, there is normal blood flow, and tissue oxygenation is presumably normal, in particular for endothelial cells. The NFκB-mediated VEGF accumulation may also explain why HIF1α-conditional endothelial knockout animals only display severe phenotype under hypoxic conditions (22Tang N. Wang L. Esko J. Giordano F.J.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 485-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and how HIF1α-depleted cancer cells can maintain their angiogenic phenotype (7Mizukami Y. Jo W.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3877-3883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), no consensus NFκB sites have been described in the human VEGFA promoter. Instead, cryptic NFκB binding sites or the existence of activating interactions between NFκB and other well characterized transcription factors acting on the VEGFA promoter, such as AP1 or Sp1, could explain why stimuli typically activating NFκB can increase VEGFA transcription (24Huang S. Robinson J.B. Deguzman A. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5334-5339PubMed Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of NFκB signaling results in down-regulation of VEGF levels (25Shibata A. Nagaya T. Imai T. Funahashi H. Nakao A. Seo H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 73: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), an area that warrants further investigation. On the other hand, endothelial cells not only respond to, but also express, VEGF (2Lee S. Chen T.T. Barber C.L. Jordan M.C. Murdock J. Desai S. Ferrara N. Nagy A. Roos K.P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). This endogenous pool of VEGF may be strictly required for endothelial cell survival, thereby preserving the vascular integrity (2Lee S. Chen T.T. Barber C.L. Jordan M.C. Murdock J. Desai S. Ferrara N. Nagy A. Roos K.P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings suggest that in addition to the VEGF released by leukocytes at the site of inflammation, a myriad of chemokines and cytokines, including TNFα and IL1-β, that accumulate in the inflammatory microenvironment may also enhance the autocrine or intracrine activation of VEGF receptors in endothelial cells by stimulating VEGF expression through NFκB. This may in turn enable endothelial cells to survive the harsh conditions found in the inflammatory milieu, an interesting possibility that warrants further investigation. Overall, our present results suggest that the activation of NFκB in endothelial cells by locally produced CXCL8/IL8 and other inflammatory mediators may initiate an autocrine/intracrine mechanism, resulting in the activation of VEGFR2, which may in turn contribute to the angiogenic response that characterizes the inflammatory process."
https://openalex.org/W2089147021,"Economists and cognitive psychologists have long known that prior rewards bias decision making in favor of options with high expected value. Accordingly, value modulates the activity of sensorimotor neurons involved in initiating movements toward one of two competing decision alternatives. However, little is known about how value influences the acquisition and representation of incoming sensory information or about the neural mechanisms that track the relative value of each available stimulus to guide behavior. Here, fMRI revealed value-related modulations throughout spatially selective areas of the human visual system in the absence of overt saccadic responses (including in V1). These modulations were primarily associated with the reward history of each stimulus and not to self-reported estimates of stimulus value. Finally, subregions of frontal and parietal cortex represent the differential value of competing alternatives and may provide signals to bias spatially selective visual areas in favor of more valuable stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2073488873,"Viral genomes are packaged into “procapsids” by powerful molecular motors. We report the crystal structure of the DNA packaging motor protein, gene product 17 (gp17), in bacteriophage T4. The structure consists of an N-terminal ATPase domain, which provides energy for compacting DNA, and a C-terminal nuclease domain, which terminates packaging. We show that another function of the C-terminal domain is to translocate the genome into the procapsid. The two domains are in close contact in the crystal structure, representing a “tensed state.” A cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the T4 procapsid complexed with gp17 shows that the packaging motor is a pentamer and that the domains within each monomer are spatially separated, representing a “relaxed state.” These structures suggest a mechanism, supported by mutational and other data, in which electrostatic forces drive the DNA packaging by alternating between tensed and relaxed states.

Similar mechanisms may occur in other molecular motors. Most bacteriophages and many eukaryotic viruses assemble empty procapsids into which the genome is subsequently packaged, thereby compressing a large amount of negatively charged DNA into a limited space (Black, 1989Black L.W. DNA packaging in dsDNA bacteriophages.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, Rao and Feiss, 2008Rao V.B. Feiss M. The bacteriophage DNA packaging motor.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 647-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The process of translocating DNA into the viral capsid is powered by ATP hydrolysis and is driven by a packaging motor that is located at a unique 5-fold vertex of the icosahedral capsid (Figures 1A and 1B). Hydrolysis of one ATP molecule can translocate, on average, two base pairs into the procapsid of the tailed phages ϕ29 (Guo et al., 1987Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D.L.

DNA packaging ATPase of bacteriophage T3.Virology. 1993; 193: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because the proteins of the DNA packaging motor in tailed phages have sequence and structural similarities, it is probable that they will also have similar mechanisms and, thus, presumably consume one ATP to translocate two base pairs. Viral genome packaging motors can generate forces of about 60 picoNewtons, which is about 20 times the force generated by myosin motors, placing them among the most powerful molecular machines (Chemla et al., 2005Chemla Y.R.

The bacteriophage ϕ29 portal motor can package DNA against a large internal force.Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Upon completion of packaging, the DNA packaging motor is released and the separately assembled tail is attached to produce the mature infectious viral particle. In tailed DNA bacteriophage T4, the packaging motor consists of the dodecameric 61 kDa portal protein, gene product 20 (gp20), and a “terminase” complex consisting of the 70 kDa large terminase protein, gp17, and the 18 kDa small terminase protein, gp16 (Rao and Black, 2005Rao V.B. Black L.W. DNA packaging in bacteriophage T4.in: Catalano C.E. Viral Genome Packaging Machines: Genetics, Structure, and Mechanism. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 40-58Crossref Google Scholar). The stoichiometries of both gp17 and gp16 are unknown. The N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–360) of gp17 has ATPase activity and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 361–610) has nuclease activity (Kanamaru et al., 2004Kanamaru S. Kondabagil K. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. The functional domains of bacteriophage T4 terminase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40795-40801Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These two functional domains need to be physically linked in order for DNA packaging to occur (Kondabagil et al., 2006Kondabagil K.R. Zhang Z. Rao V.B. The DNA translocating ATPase of bacteriophage T4 packaging motor.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of gp17 or the N-terminal domain of gp17 on its own is low. However, addition of gp16 stimulates gp17's ATPase activity (“gp16-stimulated ATPase activity”) by about 50-fold (Leffers and Rao, 2000Leffers G. Rao V.B. Biochemical characterization of an ATPase activity associated with the large packaging subunit gp17 from bacteriophage T4.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ATPase activity can also be stimulated by DNA translocation when gp17 is associated with the procapsid (“packaging ATPase activity”) (Kondabagil et al., 2006Kondabagil K.R. Zhang Z. Rao V.B. The DNA translocating ATPase of bacteriophage T4 packaging motor.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). T4 replicates its genome as a head-to-tail concatemer and packages 1.02 genomes per capsid, with different ends for each mature viral particle (Streisinger et al., 1967Streisinger G. Emrich J. Stahl M.M. Chromosome structure in phage T4, III. terminal tedundancy and length determination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1967; 57: 292-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the nuclease activity is to cut the concatemer at the beginning of DNA packaging and again at the end after the viral genome is packaged. When the head is full, a “headful” signal is presumably transmitted to gp17, causing gp17 to cleave the DNA and to disassociate from the filled head. The only known crystal structures of portal assemblies are for phages ϕ29 and SPP1 (Simpson et al., 2000Simpson A.A. Tao Y. Leiman P.G. Badasso M.O. He Y. Jardine P.J. Olson N.H. Morais M.C.

Models for the mechanism of DNA translocation have been proposed on the basis of the symmetry mismatch of the capsid (5-fold), the portal (12-fold), and the 101 B-form structure of DNA (Hendrix, 1978Hendrix R.W. Symmetry mismatch and DNA packaging in large bacteriophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In these models, the portal is assumed to rotate while DNA is being translocated and ATP hydrolysis provides energy. However, it has been shown for both the T4 and ϕ29 phages that portal rotation is unlikely (Baumann et al., 2006Baumann R.G. Mullaney J. Black L.W.

Crystallization of the T4 phage full-length large terminase protein gp17, the key component of the viral DNA packaging motor, has been difficult. Initially, we crystallized and then determined the structure of a mutant form of the T4 gp17 ATPase domain (D255E/E256D, “N360-ED”) (Sun et al., 2007Sun S. Kondabagil K. Gentz P.M. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. The structure of the ATPase that powers DNA packaging into bacteriophage T4 procapsids.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we were able to crystallize the gp17 C-terminal domain fragment (amino acids 361–577) of bacteriophage RB49, a close relative of T4 (72% sequence identity), in which the final ten residues were disordered, suggesting that gp17 might be crystallizable if it were terminated at residue 567. Indeed, the shortened form of T4 gp17 (amino acids 1–567) could be crystallized when the ATPase active center had the D255E/E256D mutation. Here, we present these crystal structures and cryo-EM reconstructions of the T4 procapsid complexed with the gp17 motor and propose a mechanism for DNA packaging consistent with mutational as well as other biochemical and structural data. The crystal structure of the RB49 gp17 C-terminal domain (Table 1) measured about 31 × 36 × 37 Å and consisted of a mixed, mostly antiparallel, β sheet sandwiched between α helices (Figure 1C). The Gly527-Gly535 loop (L2) was missing in the electron density. A spatially adjacent Glu401-Gln405 loop (L1) had weak density and was observed probably only because it made a crystal lattice contact.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsRB49 gp17 C-Terminal DomainT4 gp17NativeHg DerivativeNativeNativeNativeData CollectionX-ray sourcehomehome23-ID-B23-ID-B23-ID-BWavelength (Å)1.54181.54181.03321.03321.0332Resolution (Å)1.62.31.162.22.8Space groupP21212P21212P21212C2P6222Unit cell (Å)a = 52.6, b = 125.1, c = 37.2a = 52.8, b = 124.8, c = 37.6a = 52.6, b = 125.2, c = 37.2a = 96.4, b = 126.7, c = 52.4, β = 106.0°a = b = 119.6, c = 226.3Unique reflections32,56411,37885,57329,05623,617Average redundancy4.66.65.83.12.6I/σaValues in parentheses throughout the table correspond to the last shell.48.1 (7.8)35.6 (6.6)41.2 (3.9)34.8 (8.7)23.3 (3.3)Completeness (%)97.6 (90.9)97.5 (99.3)99.4 (96.6)95.0 (86.9)96.8 (97.9)Rmerge (%)bRmerge=Σ|I−<I>|/ΣI, where I is measured intensity for reflections with indices hkl.3.3 (21.8)10.9 (41.4)4.1 (38.4)4.1 (13.9)7.0 (34.9)Phasing powercPhasing power =[ |Fh(calc)|/ phase-integrated lack of closure ].1.821 (iso), 1.395 (ano)RefinementResolution (Å)1.162.82.8Rworking (%)dRworking=Σ||Fobs| −|Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs|.13.6 (24.4)24.2 (33.2)25.3 (33.6)Rfree (%)eRfree has the same formula as Rworking, except that calculation was made with the structure factors from the test set.17.1 (26.5)29.0 (38.7)29.2 (41.0)Average B factor (Å2)21.953.668.0rmsd bonds (Å)0.0180.0080.006rmsd angles (°)2.31.31.1Ramachandran disallowed000a Values in parentheses throughout the table correspond to the last shell.b Rmerge=Σ|I−<I>|/ΣI, where I is measured intensity for reflections with indices hkl.c Phasing power =[ |Fh(calc)|/ phase-integrated lack of closure ].d Rworking=Σ||Fobs| −|Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs|.e Rfree has the same formula as Rworking, except that calculation was made with the structure factors from the test set. Open table in a new tab Despite no detectable sequence identity, the RB49 gp17 C-terminal domain superimposed well onto the structures of the RNase H/resolvase/integrase superfamily, with the greatest similarity to RuvC resolvase (Table S1 available online). Three conserved acidic residues constitute the active center in the RNase H family of nucleases and are Asp, Asp, Asp in RNase H; Asp, Asp, Glu in transposases and retroviral integrases; and Asp, Glu, Asp in resolvase (Nowotny et al., 2005Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Crystal structures of RNase H bound to an RNA/DNA hybrid: substrate specificity and metal-dependent catalysis.Cell. 2005; 121: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) (Figure S1). Two metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+), coordinated by the conserved acidic residues, were found in the structure of RNase H complexed with an RNA/DNA hybrid. A two-metal-ion mechanism was proposed for the catalytic function of this family of nucleases (Beese and Steitz, 1991Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. Structural basis for the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I: a two metal ion mechanism.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), where one metal ion activates the hydroxyl nucleophile and the other stabilizes the pentacovalent phosphorane transition state. Asp398 and Glu455 of RB49 gp17 are structurally equivalent to the first and second conserved acidic residues in the RNase H family, respectively. The third conserved acidic residue is spatially variable within the family. Its location appears to be determined by the substrate and corresponds to Asp539 in RB49 gp17. A metal ion, as indicated by a strong density (over 7σ high), was coordinated by both Asp398 and Asp539. X-ray fluorescence in conjunction with the observed coordination geometry confirmed the metal ion to be Mg2+. However, in the absence of bound substrate, there was no evidence for a second metal ion in the electron density. The three acidic metal ion ligands, Asp398, Glu455, and Asp539 in RB49 gp17, are strictly conserved in the phage terminases (Figure S2). Mutating any of the nuclease catalytic residues (D401N, E458A, and D542A) in full-length T4 gp17 results in a complete loss of nuclease activity, without affecting ATPase or DNA packaging activities (Alam et al., 2008Alam T.I. Draper B. Kondabagil K. Rentas F.J. Ghosh-Kumar M. Sun S. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. The headful packaging nuclease of bacteriophage T4.Mol.

Biol. 2003; 334: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the nuclease activity site is distinct from the DNA translocation site. The nuclease active center in the RB49 gp17 C-terminal domain is in a groove about 20 Å in diameter, with its edges lined by positively charged amino acids, Arg403, Lys465, Lys487, Lys490, Arg491, Lys493, and Lys526. The shape and charge distribution of the groove are complimentary to the structure of B-form dsDNA, which suggests that this groove is where DNA binds and is cleaved when the head is full (Figure S3). The T4 gp17 structure (amino acids 1–567 with the D255E/E256D mutation) was determined with the use of the T4 N-terminal and RB49 C-terminal domain structures as molecular replacement search models (Figure 1D, Table 1). The N- and C-terminal domain structures of the complete gp17 do not significantly differ to the structures of each domain alone and are connected by a conserved flexible linker region of amino acid sequence GTSGT (amino acids 358–362) (Figure S4). No ADP was observed in the electron density, although it had been included in the crystallization condition. This could be caused by a crystal lattice contact that displaces the Cys125-Arg140 loop that interacts with the adenine ring in the ATP or ADP bound structure of the N-terminal domain (Sun et al., 2007Sun S. Kondabagil K. Gentz P.M. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. The structure of the ATPase that powers DNA packaging into bacteriophage T4 procapsids.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). No Mg2+ ion density was observed in the C-terminal nuclease active center. One inorganic phosphate coordinated by His385, His430, and His516 was seen in the C-terminal domain. In some other nucleases, such as RNase H (Nowotny et al., 2005Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Crystal structures of RNase H bound to an RNA/DNA hybrid: substrate specificity and metal-dependent catalysis.Cell. 2005; 121: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), a sulfate or phosphate ion is often bound to the apo structure at a site that coincides with the nucleic acid binding site. A B-form dsDNA was therefore modeled, guided by shape and charge complementarity, such that one of the phosphates on the DNA backbone superimposed on the observed phosphate ion site. The model building showed that residues Arg524, Lys389, and Arg445 could interact with phosphates of DNA bases (i, i + 1), (i + 10), and (i + 11) on the “up-strand,” and Arg517 and Arg406 could interact with (i + 5) and (i + 7) on the “down-strand.” In addition, a part of the extended loop (amino acids 369–383) could be inserted into the major groove of the DNA, and Asp381 could interact with the nitrogens on bases i + 9 and i + 10 (Figure 2A). This binding site covers a different area of the C-terminal domain surface from the cutting mode (Figure S5) as described in the previous section and could represent the binding site of dsDNA while it is in a translocation mode. Arg406 in T4 (Arg403 in RB49) might participate in binding DNA in both the nuclease and the DNA translocation modes. Mutagenesis showed that any amino acid substitution at this position resulted in a null phenotype, producing no plaques (Rentas and Rao, 2003Rentas F.J. Rao V.B. Defining the bacteriophage T4 DNA packaging machine: evidence for a C-terminal DNA cleavage domain in the large terminase/packaging protein gp17.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The R406A mutant retained both “gp16-stimulated ATPase activity” and nuclease activity, suggesting that the mutation did not affect folding. However, it lost ∼90% of DNA translocation activity and “packaging ATPase activity” (Figures 3B–3E). This showed that the DNA binding site is different for translocation and nuclease activity, consistent with the structural observations. The N-terminal ATPase domain consists of two spatially separated subdomains (Figure 1D) (Sun et al., 2007Sun S. Kondabagil K. Gentz P.M. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. The structure of the ATPase that powers DNA packaging into bacteriophage T4 procapsids.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The larger subdomain I (amino acids 105–313), the nucleotide binding domain, is connected to subdomain II (residues 1–58 and 314–360) by flexible extended polypeptides. Comparison of the N-terminal domain in its various ligand bound states and when associated with the C-terminal domain shows that the smaller subdomain II can rotate at least 6° relative to subdomain I (Figure S6A). This can introduce a displacement of 3 Å in the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains. The interface between subdomain I (the ATPase domain) and the C-terminal domain has a 706 Å2 contact area with four pairs of complimentary charge interactions (Figures 2B and 2C). Similarly, the interface between subdomain II and the C-terminal domain has a 392 Å2 contact area with two complimentary charge interactions (Figures 2B and 2C). Part of the latter interface involves loop L2 that was disordered in the structure of the C-terminal domain on its own but forms a β-hairpin in the gp17 structure. Trp533, in the L2 loop, is in a hydrophobic environment composed of Tyr295, Trp298, Val302, Ala354, Ala355, and Phe356 in the N-terminal domain, as well as Ala497 and Val531 in the C-terminal domain (Figure 2C). To analyze the importance of the interdomain interactions, we constructed two mutants, W533A and ΔS527G538. These mutants were predicted to weaken the interactions between the domains by reducing hydrophobic contacts. The W533A mutant has retained “gp16-stimulated ATPase activity” and nuclease activity (Figures 3B and 3D), suggesting that the mutation did not effect folding of either domain. The ΔS527G538 mutant has retained “gp16-stimulated ATPase activity,” but has only little nuclease activity, presumably because the deletion is close to Asp539, which is part of the Mg2+ binding site. However, both mutants showed almost total loss of DNA translocation activity and “packaging ATPase activity” (Figures 3C and 3E), indicative of the interactions between N- and C-terminal domains being essential for DNA packaging. T4 procapsids (Rao and Black, 1985Rao V.B. Black L.W. DNA packaging of bacteriophage T4 proheads in vitro evidence that prohead expansion is not coupled to DNA packaging.J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with bound gp17 are packaging competent in vitro in the absence of the “small terminase” gp16 (Kondabagil et al., 2006Kondabagil K.R. Zhang Z. Rao V.B. The DNA translocating ATPase of bacteriophage T4 packaging motor.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cryo-EM reconstructions of these procapsids were performed by imposing 5-fold symmetry along the axis of the particle. As expected, these reconstructions showed the characteristic features of the head with the protruding Hoc molecules at the center of the hexagonal capsomers (Fokine et al., 2004Fokine A. Chipman P.R. Leiman P.G. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Rao V.B. Rossmann M.G. Molecular architecture of the prolate head of bacteriophage T4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A and Experimental Procedures). Cryo-EM reconstructions of these procapsids were also performed assuming 6-fold symmetry. To eliminate the dominant 5-fold symmetry of the head, we modified the images by subtraction of the head densities. These modified images were used for both the 5-fold and 6-fold reconstructions. The 5-fold symmetry reconstruction showed well resolved gp17 molecules (see below), whereas the 6-fold averaged reconstruction produced merely smooth donut-shaped rings (Figures 5A and 5B). In addition, a 5-fold averaged cryo-EM reconstruction of procapsids in the act of DNA packaging (Experimental Procedures) showed similar features (Figure 5C). This established that there are five gp17 molecules surrounding the special vertex of the procapsid. Similarly, the DNA packaging machine of ϕ29, which contains a unique 175b RNA (pRNA), had been shown to have five pRNA molecules, each binding one ATPase in a ring around the special vertex (Morais et al., 2001Morais M.C.

The reconstruction shows DNA density in the channel formed by the five gp17 molecules and the portal assembly. Comparison of the 5-fold symmetry imposed reconstructions with and without bound gp17 showed the positions of the portal gp20 and terminase gp17. The T4 gp20 density was fitted with the crystal structure of the SPP1 portal, which is a closer homolog of the T4 portal than the ϕ29 portal is to T4. Two stacked rings below the portal density at the unique vertex presumably correspond to gp17. The ring closer to the head (ring A, Figure 4B) has an external diameter of 160 Å, larger than the 100 Å diameter of ring B farther from the head. At a 3σ contour level, each ring can be separated into five distinct densities, representing five copies of gp17 (Figure 4C). The two rings are connected by five short, narrow density regions (Figure 4B), and ring A is connected to the portal protein (Figure 4D). The symmetry mismatch between gp17 and the 12-fold portal is not likely to form an especially stable contact, as may be required to allow the phage to jettison the packaging machine after completion of DNA packaging, prior to the attachment of the tail. In addition, the interaction between gp17 and the portal is required to form a continuous channel to allow smooth passage of DNA. Mutational data for SPP1 suggests that modifications in the portal protein might alter the property of this channel (Oliveira et al., 2006Oliveira L. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Modulation of the viral ATPase activity by the portal protein correlates with DNA packaging efficiency.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21914-21923Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The volume and shape of rings A and B (Figure 4) in the cryo-EM reconstruction show that these represent pentamers of the N- and C-terminal gp17 domains, respectively. However, the structure of the recombinant gp17 consisting of both domains could not be fitted into the cryo-EM density because the N- and C-terminal domains are in close contact with each other in the crystal structure, whereas the cryo-EM density shows separation of the two domains into the A and B rings. Thus, it was concluded that the cryo-EM reconstruction of the procapsid-bound motor is in a “relaxed” pretranslocation state in which the N- and C-terminal domains are well"

The chromosomal region 17q23 containing the RPS6KB1 gene is frequently amplified in breast cancer cells, leading to S6K1 overexpression. The role of S6K1 in disease development and progression is supported by the observation that S6K1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. However, the identity of mammary cell-specific S6K1 targets is not well understood. In this study, we report that overexpression of S6K1 endows breast cancer cells with a proliferative advantage in low serum conditions and enhanced sensitivity to rapamycin. We investigate the molecular mechanism behind this observation to show that S6K1 regulates estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) by phosphorylating it on serine 167, leading to transcriptional activation of ERalpha. By contributing to the activation of ERalpha, S6K1 promotes ERalpha-mediated cell proliferation and may be a target of therapeutic intervention in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2164754533,"Eukaryotic protein synthesis begins with assembly of 48S initiation complexes at the initiation codon of mRNA, which requires at least seven initiation factors (eIFs). First, 43S preinitiation complexes comprising 40S ribosomal subunits, eIFs 3, 2, 1, and 1A, and tRNAMeti attach to the 5′-proximal region of mRNA and then scan along the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) to the initiation codon. Attachment of 43S complexes is mediated by three other eIFs, 4F, 4A, and 4B, which cooperatively unwind the cap-proximal region of mRNA and later also assist 43S complexes during scanning. We now report that these seven eIFs are not sufficient for efficient 48S complex formation on mRNAs with highly structured 5′UTRs, and that this process requires the DExH-box protein DHX29. DHX29 binds 40S subunits and hydrolyzes ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP. NTP hydrolysis by DHX29 is strongly stimulated by 43S complexes and is required for DHX29's activity in promoting 48S complex formation.

NTP hydrolysis by DHX29 is strongly stimulated by 43S complexes and is required for DHX29's activity in promoting 48S complex formation. Eukaryotic protein synthesis begins with assembly of 48S initiation complexes, in which initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAMeti) is base-paired with the initiation codon of mRNA in the P site of the 40S subunit. 48S complex formation on most cellular mRNAs occurs by the scanning mechanism and requires at least seven initiation factors (eIFs) (Pestova et al., 2007Pestova T.V. Lorsch J.R. Hellen C.U.T. The mechanism of translation initiation in eukaryotes.in: Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 87-128Google Scholar). First, 43S complexes comprising 40S subunits, eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAMeti ternary complexes (TCs), eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A attach to the 5′-proximal region of mRNA and then scan along the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) to the initiation codon where they stop, forming 48S complexes. Attachment of 43S complexes to mRNA is mediated by eIFs 4F, 4A, and 4B. eIF4F comprises eIF4E (cap-binding protein), eIF4A (a DEAD-box RNA helicase, whose activity is enhanced by eIF4G and eIF4B), and eIF4G (which binds eIF4E, eIF4A, and also eIF3). eIF4F/4A/4B cooperatively unwind the cap-proximal region of mRNA allowing 43S complexes to bind and likely promote binding via the eIF4G-eIF3 interaction. The molecular mechanism by which mRNA enters the mRNA-binding cleft of the 40S subunit (e.g., by threading through this entire channel starting from its entrance, or by direct placement of the cap-proximal mRNA segment into the mRNA-binding cleft) is unknown. Ribosomal scanning consists of two linked processes: unwinding of secondary structure in the 5′UTR and ribosomal movement along it. During scanning, 43S complexes must be able to reject potential mismatches between the Met-tRNAMeti and non- and near-cognate codons, but also to recognize the correct initiation triplet. The key role in ensuring accurate initiation codon selection belongs to eIF1, which enables 43S complexes to discriminate against 48S complex formation on non-AUG triplets and on AUG triplets in suboptimal context (Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002Pestova T.V.

Kolupaeva V.G. Marintchev A. Wagner G. Pestova T.V. Position of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF1 on the 40S ribosomal subunit determined by directed hydroxyl radical probing.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2786-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that it performs its monitoring function indirectly, by influencing the conformation of ribosomal complexes. Consistently, binding of eIF1 and eIF1A to yeast 40S subunits induces conformational changes that consist of opening of the entry channel “latch” formed between helix (h) 18 in the body and h34 and ribosomal protein (rp) S3 in the neck and establishment of a new head-body connection likely mediated by h16 and rpS3 (Passmore et al., 2007Passmore L.A. Schmeing T.M. Maag D. Applefield D.J. Acker M.G. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R. Ramakrishnan V. The eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF1 and eIF1A induce an open conformation of the 40S ribosome.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). But what is the role of different factors in ribosomal movement per se? 43S complexes containing TCs, eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A can bind to the 5′ end of an unstructured 5′UTR and scan to the initiation codon without ATP or factors associated with ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding, revealing the intrinsic ability of 43S complexes to move along mRNA (Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. The roles of individual eukaryotic translation initiation factors in ribosomal scanning and initiation codon selection.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Importantly, omission of eIF1A greatly reduces the ability of 43S complexes to form 48S complexes in the absence of eIF4A/4G/4B, and omission of eIF1 almost abrogates it. Although eIF3 is indispensable for 48S complex formation, it is difficult to separate its role in scanning from functions in recruitment of TCs to 40S subunits and initial attachment of 43S complexes. Scanning on 5′UTRs containing even weak internal secondary structure, on the other hand, requires ATP and eIF4A/4G/4B, and the requirement for ATP and eIF4A is proportional to the degree of secondary structure in the 5′UTR (Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002Pestova T.V.

Continued association of eIF4G with ribosomal complexes (Pöyry et al., 2004Pöyry T.A. Kaminski A. Jackson R.J. What determines whether mammalian ribosomes resume scanning after translation of a short upstream open reading frame?.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) ensures eIF4A's processivity and couples mRNA unwinding with ribosomal movement. It is unknown whether eIF4F/4A/4B bind at the 40S subunit's leading edge and unwind mRNA before it enters the mRNA-binding cleft, or at the trailing edge near the E site and assist scanning by helicase-mediated “pulling” of mRNA through the mRNA-binding channel and/or preventing backward movement. eIF4A/4G/4B also stimulate 48S complex formation on mRNAs with unstructured 5′UTRs and make this process less dependent on eIF1/1A (Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. The roles of individual eukaryotic translation initiation factors in ribosomal scanning and initiation codon selection.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that scanning requires ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA secondary structure by eIF4A/4G/4B and induction by eIF1/1A of the scanning-competent conformation of 43S complexes. The efficiency of translation of different mRNAs in vivo and in vitro depends on the degree of secondary structure in their 5′UTRs. Thus, stems of ΔG = −30 kcal/mol located distally in the 5′UTR inhibit but do not abolish initiation, whereas stems of ΔG = −60 kcal/mol abrogate translation by obstructing ribosomal movement to the initiation codon (Kozak, 1991Kozak M. Structural features in eukaryotic mRNAs that modulate the initiation of translation.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our in vitro reconstituted initiation system containing eIF2/3/1/1A/4A/4B/4F, 48S complexes did not form efficiently on mRNAs containing GC-rich stems of even moderate stability in their 5′UTRs, although they are translated well in cell-free extracts (Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. The roles of individual eukaryotic translation initiation factors in ribosomal scanning and initiation codon selection.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Moreover, during 48S complex formation on β-globin mRNA, additional toeprints appear +8–9 nt from the AUG codon, equal to as much as 30%–40% of the +15–17 nt toeprint of properly assembled 48S complexes, which most likely represent an initiation complex, in which the 3′ portion of mRNA was not properly fixed in the 40S subunit's mRNA-binding cleft (Battiste et al., 2000Battiste J.L. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Wagner G. The eIF1A solution structure reveals a large RNA-binding surface important for scanning function.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such aberrant toeprints do not appear when 48S complexes are assembled in cell-free translation extracts. Here we report that we have purified and identified the DExH-box protein DHX29 as a factor that is required for efficient 48S complex formation on mRNAs with highly structured 5′UTRs and that also suppresses the aberrant +8–9 nt toeprint. Although in an in vitro reconstituted system, eIF2/3/1/1A/4A/4B/4F promoted efficient 48S complex formation on model synthetic mRNAs comprising the β-glucuronidase (GUS) coding region and an unstructured 5′UTR consisting of 19 CAA repeats (CAA-GUS mRNA; Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. The roles of individual eukaryotic translation initiation factors in ribosomal scanning and initiation codon selection.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) or 5′UTRs containing GC-rich stems of relatively low stability flanked by CAA repeats (CAA-GUS Stem-1 and Stem-2 mRNAs), yielding intense toeprints +15–17 nt from the AUG codon (Figure 1C, lanes 4, 9, and 14), they did not support high-level 48S complex formation on CAA-GUS Stem-3 and Stem-4 mRNAs containing more stable stems with ΔG = −18.9 and −27.6 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 1C, lanes 18 and 24), even though they translated efficiently in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (data not shown). These eIFs also supported only very weak 48S complex assembly on neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2) mRNA containing a 168 nt long 5′UTR (55% GC; ΔG ∼ −54 kcal/mol) (Figure 1D, lane 3) and did not promote 48S complex formation at all on CDC25 mRNA containing a 271 nt long 5′UTR (44% GC; ΔG ∼ −120 kcal/mol) (Figure 1E, lane 2), even though both mRNAs were relatively efficiently translated in RRL (data not shown). We therefore undertook extensive purification from RRL of a missing factor(s) required for efficient 48S complex formation on mRNAs with structured 5′UTRs. Purification yielded an apparently homogeneous ∼150 kDa protein (Figure 1A) that was identified as DHX29 (see Table S1A available online), a putative DExH-box helicase (Figure 1B). DHX29 has a central helicase domain with consensus sequence motifs that are characteristic of DEAH helicases such as DHX9 and the splicing factor Prp2/DHX16 (de la Cruz et al., 1999de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Unwinding RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: DEAD-box proteins and related families.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar; Figure 1B) and C-terminally located helicase-associated HA2 and DUF1605 domains of unknown function. Inclusion of DHX29 in an in vitro reconstituted system strongly (∼5- to 20-fold) increased 48S complex formation on CAA-GUS Stem-3 and Stem-4 mRNAs (Figure 1C, lanes 19 and 25) and on NCF2 mRNA (Figure 1D, lane 4) and allowed 48S complex formation on CDC25 mRNA (Figure 1E, lane 1). DHX29 also slightly (∼20%–30%) stimulated the already efficient 48S complex formation on CAA-GUS Stem-1 and Stem-2 mRNAs (Figure 1C, lanes 10 and 15). Toeprints that appeared at intermediate positions on NCF2 and CDC25 5′UTRs in reaction mixtures containing 43S complexes and eIF4A/4B/4F with or without DHX29 (Figure 1D, lanes 3 and 4; Figure 1E, lane 1) likely corresponded to scanning ribosomal complexes arrested upstream of the initiation codon by stable secondary structures. Moderate stimulation of 48S complex formation on stem-containing CAA-GUS mRNAs by DHX29 occurred even in the absence of eIF4A/4B/4F (Figure 1C, lanes 3, 8, 13, 17, and 23), but it was lower than by eIF4A/4B/4F (Figure 1C, lanes 4, 9, 14, 18, and 24). In contrast to CAA-GUS mRNAs, DHX29 did not promote 48S complex formation on NCF2 or CDC25 mRNAs in the absence of eIF4A/4B/4F (Figure 1D, lane 5; Figure 1E, lane 3) and mediated only marginal 48S complex assembly on β-globin mRNA (Figure 2B, lane 6). We speculate that this difference was due to the presence of 43 unstructured 5′-terminal nt in CAA-GUS mRNAs that can promote eIF4A/4B/4F-independent attachment of 43S complexes (Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. The roles of individual eukaryotic translation initiation factors in ribosomal scanning and initiation codon selection.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). If this assumption is correct, then DHX29 likely assists scanning but does not function during attachment of 43S complexes. To verify that 48S complexes assembled with DHX29 were elongation competent, formation of ribosomal complexes was assayed on derivatives of CAA-GUS Stem-3 and Stem-4 mRNAs encoding an MVHC tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon. Addition of 60S subunits, eIF5/5B, elongation factors, and aminoacylated tRNAs to 48S complexes assembled on both mRNAs with DHX29 yielded prominent toeprints +16–17 nt from the UGC Cys codon that occupies the P site of elongating ribosomes arrested at the stop codon (Figure 1F, left panel). As with 48S complexes, substantially more elongation complexes formed on both mRNAs in the presence of DHX29, assayed by toeprinting and sucrose density gradient (SDG) centrifugation (Figure 1F). Taken together, these data indicate that eIF4A/4B/4F and DHX29 synergistically promote efficient 48S complex formation on mRNAs with structured 5′UTRs. Although eIF2/3/1/1A/4A/4B/4F ensured efficient 48S complex formation on native capped β-globin mRNA, we have noted additional toeprints +8–9 nt from the AUG codon at up to 30%–40% of the level of the +15–17 nt toeprints that correspond to properly assembled 48S complexes (Figure 2A, lane 2; Battiste et al., 2000Battiste J.L. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Wagner G. The eIF1A solution structure reveals a large RNA-binding surface important for scanning function.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The +8–9 toeprints were apparent on some other mRNAs, for example, on the first AUG codon of mRNA containing two AUG triplets flanked by CAA repeats (Figure 2C, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, 48S complexes assembled on β-globin or other mRNAs in RRL yielded toeprints exclusively at +15–17 positions (e.g., Figure 2A, lane 3). Appearance of the +8–9 nt toeprint required 40S subunits, Met-tRNAMeti, eIFs, and an AUG codon, suggesting that it corresponds to a 48S complex in which the 3′ portion of mRNA is not fixed in the 40S subunit's mRNA-binding cleft, thus allowing reverse transcriptase to penetrate further. Formation of the +8–9 nt toeprint was eIF1 dependent: almost no such toeprint was observed on the first AUG codon of mRNA with two AUG triplets in reaction mixtures lacking eIF1 (Figure 2C, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 6 and 8). The +8–9 nt toeprint was also exacerbated by some eIF1A mutants (Battiste et al., 2000Battiste J.L. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Wagner G. The eIF1A solution structure reveals a large RNA-binding surface important for scanning function.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although DHX29 did not influence the overall yield of 48S complex formation on β-globin mRNA, it suppressed this aberrant toeprint (Figure 2B, lane 3). Importantly, DHX29 had the same effect on the +8–9 toeprint upon its delayed addition to preformed 48S complexes (Figure 2B, lane 4). DHX29 also suppressed the aberrant +8–9 nt toeprint on other mRNAs, including the mRNA with two AUG triplets (Figure 2C, lanes 1 and 3). These data suggest that binding of DHX29 to ribosomal complexes induces conformational changes near the mRNA-binding cleft that influence accommodation of the 3′ portion of mRNA. DHX29 also increased leaky scanning, enhancing 48S complex formation on the second AUG codon of mRNA with two AUG triplets, irrespective of the presence of eIF1 or eIF1A (Figure 2C, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). This increase in leaky scanning is consistent with enhanced processivity of ribosomal complexes. In reaction mixtures lacking eIF4F/4A/4B, DHX29 promoted low-level 48S complex formation on CAA-GUS Stem-1 even without eIF1/1A (Figure 2D, lane 3). However eIF1, particularly with eIF1A, substantially increased initiation (Figure 2D, lanes 5 and 6). Experiments done to identify interactions between DHX29 and translational components revealed that it bound stably to 40S subunits, but not 60S subunits or 80S ribosomes, and remained associated with them during SDG centrifugation (Figure 3A, lanes 4, 5, and 7). Importantly, DHX29 associated only with 40S monomers, but not the dimers (Figure 3A, lanes 6 and 7) that always occur in mammalian 40S subunit preparations (Unbehaun et al., 2004Unbehaun A.

DHX29 also bound stably and stoichiometrically to 40S/eIF3 complexes formed with (CUUU)9 RNA (Kolupaeva et al., 2005Kolupaeva V.G. Unbehaun A. Lomakin I.B. Hellen C.U.T. Pestova T.V. Binding of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 to ribosomal 40S subunits and its role in ribosomal dissociation and anti-association.RNA. 2005; 11: 470-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), to 43S complexes (Figure 3A, lanes 8 and 9), and to yeast 40S subunits, indicating that it associated with a conserved region of 40S subunits (Figure 3B). DHX29's ribosomal binding was nucleotide independent (Figure 3C). Some DHX29 preparations contained an ∼90–95 kDa band (Figure 3D, left panel) that we identified as truncated DHX29 (Table S1B). One of its tryptic peptides corresponded to amino acids 98–106, indicating that ΔDHX29 cannot lack more than 96 N-terminal amino acids and must thus be significantly truncated at its C terminus. If the lower band on the western blot of 40S/DHX29 ribosomal complexes obtained with such preparations of DHX29 (Figure 3D, right panel) corresponds to C-terminally truncated ΔDHX29, the region of DHX29 responsible for ribosomal binding is likely located in the N-terminal two thirds of the protein. Consistently, DHX29 in RRL was bound to 40S-containing ribosomal complexes, but not to 60S subunits or 80S ribosomes (Figure 3E). About 10% of 40S-ribosomal complexes were associated with DHX29, and all of the DHX29 was involved in this interaction (Figure 3F). To obtain insights into the ribosomal position of DHX29, we compared chemical/enzymatic footprinting of 18S rRNA in 43S and 43S/DHX29 complexes. DHX29 strongly protected CUC527–529 and UUU530–532 in h16 from RNase V1 cleavage and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfate (CMCT) modification, respectively (Figure 4A, lanes 7 and 8; Figure 4B, lanes 3 and 4; Figure 4C) and weakly protected A526 from dimethyl sulfate (DMS) modification (Figure 4B, lanes 7 and 8), but did not protect G534 on the opposite strand of the stem from RNase T1 cleavage (Figure 4A, lanes 1 and 2). If the observed protections resulted from direct interaction between h16 and DHX29, rather than from induced conformational changes, then DHX29 likely binds to the 40S subunit near the mRNA entrance (Figure 4D). Like other DExH-box proteins (Lee et al., 1997Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. The NTPase/helicase activities of Drosophila maleless, an essential factor in dosage compensation.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Tanaka and Schwer, 2005Tanaka N. Schwer B. Characterization of the NTPase, RNA-binding, and RNA helicase activities of the DEAH-box splicing factor Prp22.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9795-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), DHX29 lacked nucleotide specificity and hydrolyzed ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP (Figure 5A). These proteins all lack the Q motif upstream of the helicase domain that has been implicated in determining the specificity of adenine recognition by the related DEAD-box helicases (Tanner et al., 2003Tanner N.K. Cordin O. Banroques J. Doère M. Linder P. The Q motif: a newly identified motif in DEAD box helicases may regulate ATP binding and hydrolysis.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). DHX29's NTPase activity was strongly stimulated by 43S complexes, whereas stimulation by single-stranded (CUUU)9 RNA was low (Figures 5A and 5B; we note that the concentration of DHX29 in experiments shown in Figure 5A was substantially higher than in Figure 5B). 18S rRNA had higher stimulatory activity than (CUUU)9 RNA but lower than 43S complexes (Figure 5B). If the ribosome binding site for DHX29 is formed by 18S rRNA, and is to some extent preserved in naked 18S rRNA, specific binding of DHX29 to 18S rRNA could account for its relatively high stimulatory activity. However, stimulation was greatest in the presence of 43S complexes and (CUUU)9 RNA, and it is tempting to speculate that this combination simulates mRNA-attached or scanning 43S complexes. To verify whether NTP hydrolysis by DHX29 is required for stimulation of 48S complex formation, we investigated eIF4A/4B/4F-independent 48S complex assembly on CAA-GUS Stem-1 mRNA in the presence of DHX29 and different NTPs (Figure 5C). 43S complexes formed with eIF2/3/1/1A were separated from unincorporated GTP by SDG centrifugation and incubated with DHX29 and mRNA in the presence/absence of GTP, ATP, CTP, UTP, GMPPNP, or AMPPNP. DHX29's stimulatory activity was higher with GTP or ATP than with CTP or UTP (Figure 5C, lanes 4–7). No stimulation occurred without nucleotides or with nonhydrolyzable GMPPNP or AMPPNP (Figure 5C, lanes 3, 8, and 9). NTP hydrolysis by DHX29 was therefore required for its activity in 48S complex formation. To investigate the potential helicase activity of DHX29, we used RNA duplexes comprising overhanging 25 nt long 5′ or 3′ ends and 13 nt or 10 nt long double-stranded regions (ΔG = −21 and −14.6 kcal/mol, respectively), corresponding blunt duplexes, as well as duplexes resembling stems 2, 3, and 4 of CAA-GUS Stem2-4 mRNAs. DHX29 could not unwind 13 nt long duplexes with overhanging 5′ or 3′ ends in the presence of any NTP, whereas unwinding by eIF4A/4F was efficient (Figure 6A, left panel; data not shown). Very weak unwinding by isolated 43S/DHX29 complexes (Figure 6A, right panel, lane 2) may in fact be attributable to ribosomal scanning after attachment of 43S complexes to the 5′ overhang. Unwinding by DHX29 of 10 nt long duplexes with overhanging ends was marginal (<5%), and blunt duplexes were not unwound (Figure 6B, lanes 2 and 3; data not shown). DHX29 could unwind Stem-2 duplex (Figure 6C, lane 3), although we note that this duplex was intrinsically unstable under experimental conditions, resulting in a noticeable background of RNA monomers (Figure 6C, lane 2). Unwinding of Stem-3 duplex by DHX29 was marginal (Figure 6C, lane 6), and Stem-4 duplex was not unwound (Figure 6C, lane 9), whereas eIFs 4A/4F unwound ∼5%–10% of Stem-4 duplex (Figure 6C, lane 10). Thus, like some other DExH-box proteins (Tanaka and Schwer, 2005Tanaka N. Schwer B. Characterization of the NTPase, RNA-binding, and RNA helicase activities of the DEAH-box splicing factor Prp22.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9795-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), DHX29 is not a processive RNA helicase. DHX29 stimulated 48S complex formation most strongly when it was present in substoichiometric amounts relative to 43S complexes. Thus, SDG-purified 43S/DHX29 complexes with a 43S:DHX29 ratio of 10:1 (Figure 6D, lane 3) were most active in 48S complex assembly on CAA-GUS Stem-1 mRNA (Figure 6E, lane 2), whereas complexes with 43S:DHX29 ratios of 2:1 and 1:1 (Figure 6D, lanes 4 and 5) were progressively less active (Figure 6E, lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, a mixture of DHX29-free and DHX29-saturated 43S complexes that individually had the lowest activities (Figure 6E, lanes 4 and 5) together promoted very efficient 48S complex formation (Figure 6E, lane 6). These results suggest that a proportion of DHX29 might be inactive, but that DHX29 from active 43S/DHX29 complexes could dissociate from ribosomal complexes and participate in new rounds of initiation. Alternatively, stimulation of 48S complex formation by DHX29 might require its dissociation from the 40S subunit at some point in the process before the 48S complex is formed, in which case the excess of free 43S complexes would ensure rebinding of dissociated DHX29 to a new 43S complex. To investigate this possibility, DHX29-saturated 43S complexes were mixed with purified 40S/eIF3/(CUUU)9 complexes, which themselves could not participate in 48S complex formation but could potentially provide a “trap” for dissociated DHX29, thereby stimulating 48S complex formation by 43S/DHX29 complexes. 40S/eIF3/(CUUU)9 complexes did not stimulate 48S complex formation by 43S/DHX29 complexes (Figure 6F, compare lanes 3 and 5). Although this could be because DHX29's affinity to 40S/eIF3/(CUUU)9 complexes is lower than to 43S complexes, the possibility that a proportion of DHX29 might be inactive cannot be excluded. The stage at which DHX29 dissociates from ribosomal complexes is not known, but we note that consistently less DHX29 was bound to 48S than to 43S complexes (Figure 6G). The genomes of several families of RNA viruses contain internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs), which mediate end-independent initiation, enabling viral mRNAs to bypass the canonical cap-dependent mechanism. IRESs are classified into structurally unrelated groups that mediate initiation by distinct mechanisms that require fewer eIFs than canonical initiation. Three mechanisms of IRES-mediated initiation have been identified, and they are all based on specific noncanonical interactions of IRESs with canonical components of the translation apparatus. The first is exemplified by type 2 picornavirus IRESs (e.g., encephalomyocarditis virus; EMCV), which promote initiation at their 3′ border by a mechanism that relies on specific interaction of the IRESs' J-K domain upstream of the initiation codon with eIF4G and involves direct attachment of the 43S complex to the initiation codon, which is likely mediated by interaction of 43S-bound eIF3 with IRES-bound eIF4G (Pestova et al., 1996Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Shatsky I.N. Canonical eukaryotic initiation factors determine initiation of translation by internal ribosomal entry.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Initiation on the IRESs of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is determined by their ability to bind directly and independently to 40S subunits and eIF3 (Pestova et al., 1998bPestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U.

These interactions enable 43S complexes to attach directly to the initiation codon of HCV-like IRESs without scanning or local unwinding of mRNA.

Since the general prevalence of Helicobacter pylori has been decreasing, we hypothesized that H. pylori serostatus would be inversely related to the presence of asthma.Adults were recruited to participate in the New York University (NYU)/Bellevue Asthma Registry in New York City. Adult asthma cases (N = 318) and controls (N = 208) were identified and serum IgG antibodies to H. pylori whole cell antigens or the immunodominant CagA antigen were measured.As expected, the asthma cases and controls differed with respect to atopy and lung function. Seropositivity to H. pylori or CagA antigen was present in 47.1% of the total case and control study population. Asthma was inversely associated with CagA seropositivity (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.36-0.89). Median age of onset of asthma (doctor's diagnosis) was older (21 years) among individuals with CagA+ strains than among H. pylori- individuals (11 years) (p = 0.006).These data are consistent with the hypothesis that colonization with CagA+ H. pylori strains is inversely associated with asthma and is associated with an older age of asthma onset in an urban population. The data suggest H. pylori as a marker for protection."
https://openalex.org/W2080458188,"The adapter protein TRAF6 is critical for mediating signal transduction from members of the IL-1R/TLR and TNFR superfamilies. The TRAF6 RING finger domain functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase capable of generating non-degradative K63-linked ubiquitin chains. It is believed that these chains serve as docking sites for formation of signaling complexes, and that K63-linked autoubiquitination of TRAF6 is essential for formation and activation of a complex involving the kinase TAK1 and its adapters, TAB1 and TAB2. In order to assess independently the E3 ligase and ubiquitin substrate functions of TRAF6, we generated, respectively, RING domain and complete lysine-deficient TRAF6 mutants. We found that while the TRAF6 RING domain is required for activation of TAK1, it is dispensable for interaction between TRAF6 and the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. Likewise, lysine-deficient TRAF6 was found to interact with the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex, but surprisingly was also found to be fully competent to activate TAK1, as well as NFkappaB and AP-1 reporters. Furthermore, lysine-deficient TRAF6 rescued IL-1-mediated NFkappaB and MAPK activation, as well as IL-6 elaboration in retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient fibroblasts. Lysine-deficient TRAF6 also rescued RANKL-mediated NFkappaB and MAPK activation, and osteoclastogenesis in retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient bone marrow macrophages. While incapable of being ubiquitinated itself, we demonstrate that lysine-deficient TRAF6 remains competent to induce ubiquitination of IKKgamma/NEMO. Further, this NEMO modification contributes to TRAF6-mediated activation of NFkappaB. Collectively, our results suggest that while TRAF6 autoubiquitination may serve as a marker of activation, it is unlikely to underpin RING finger-dependent TRAF6 function."

A mechanism is proposed for flexible control of speed-accuracy tradeoff, based on a simple top-down signal to the decision circuit that may vary nonmonotonically with the number of choice alternatives. The ability to make a choice among multiple alternatives is a hallmark of goal-directed adaptive behavior and has been the subject of a large body of work in cognitive psychology. Human studies showed that, typically, increasing the number of alternatives results in longer response times and lower accuracy (the probability of correct choices) (Hick, 1952Hick W.E.

Oxford University Press, New York1986Google Scholar). Speed and accuracy, however, are not set in stone and are affected by practice, attention, motivation, and more. Furthermore, subjects can flexibly adapt their responses according to changing task demands, often via a speed-accuracy tradeoff: improving performance on the cost of slower response times (Hale, 1969Hale D.J.

In this task, the subject is required to report the perceived direction of motion in a dynamic random dot array (Figure 1A). At the behavioral level, increasing the number of choices from two to four resulted in longer response times and lower accuracy. At the neural level, the activity of single neurons in LIP was correlated with the animal's decisions, showing a ramping-up of activity when the selected target was in the neuron's response field. Decisions were made when the activity crossed a threshold activity level. Multiple-choice decisions have been commonly modeled as a race between discrete integrators (Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N.

While successful in accounting for a range of behavioral data, this approach is likely to be inadequate for understanding the physiological basis of multi-choice decisions, because the tuning of neurons is typically broad and consequently the neural representations of the choice alternatives may overlap to a varying extent that depends on the number of choice options and the similarity between them. Similarity between stimulus/choice items, widely studied in psychology, plays a fundamental role in classification, recognition, and other decision processes (Ashby and Perrin, 1988Ashby F.G.

In physiological studies, the issue of similarity has so far been largely avoided using two diametrically opposing alternatives (e.g., left versus right motion direction). However, similarity becomes important when the number of choice options is increased in a limited feature space (e.g., directional angles between 0° and 360°). The RDM direction discrimination task represents a suitable experimental paradigm for studying similarity effects on the choice behavior and the underlying neural circuit dynamics. In this work, we considered a continuous network approach to multiple-choice decisions, using a network capable of representing an analog sensory input (Ben-Yishai et al., 1995Ben-Yishai R.

This model is the continuous analog of a model with discrete neural pools, which is endowed with slow synaptic reverberation mediated by NMDA receptors (for time integration of information) and winner-take-all competition mediated by feedback inhibition (Wang, 2002Wang X.-J.

The continuous network model offers a biophysically based circuit mechanism for multiple-choice decision making, which operates independently of the number of choices and takes into account the similarity among them. We used the model to address the following important questions. (1) Can a line-attractor network account for behavioral and physiological data from the multiple-choice RDM direction discrimination task? (2) What are the effects of similarity among choice alternatives on the neural population firing pattern that ultimately determines performance and response time? (3) Can such a model shed light on the neural mechanisms that control subjects' response times and performance in multiple-choice tasks? Computer simulations show that the model accounts for a range of behavioral and physiological data from the recent monkey experiment (Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N. Decision-making with multiple alternatives.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the recurrent (attractor) network dynamics depend on the number (two, four, and eight) of choice options in a nonmonotonic fashion, which we explain in terms of similarity and its neuronal underpinning. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of similarity effects, optimal behavior (defined by maximal rewards) requires a flexible mechanism for controlling the speed-accuracy tradeoff, which, we propose, can be achieved by a simple top-down signal to the decision circuit. Taken together, our findings suggest a general computational framework for multiple-choice decision making. We used a recurrent circuit model of spiking neurons to simulate network dynamics underlying decision making in a multiple-choice motion discrimination task (Figure 1). For the sake of comparing with data from Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N. Decision-making with multiple alternatives.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, the model network can be viewed as representing a local microcircuit in area LIP. The pyramidal neurons in the model are directionally tuned, and their preferred directions cover uniformly all directions along a circle. The network is endowed with recurrent connections, in accordance with the physiology of cortical circuits (Douglas and Martin, 2007Douglas R.J. Martin K.A.C. Neuronal circuits of the neocortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 419-451Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Due to sufficiently strong recurrent excitation, a transient directional cue can trigger a bell-shaped persistent activity pattern (“bump attractor”) (Compte et al., 2000Compte A. Brunel N.

Division of labor among distinct subtypes of inhibitory neurons in a cortical microcircuit of working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that LIP neurons show direction-selective sustained activity during a delay period in working memory tasks (e.g., Gnadt and Andersen, 1988Gnadt J.W.

Neural basis of a perceptual decision in the parietal cortex (area LIP) of the rhesus monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 1916-1936PubMed Google Scholar). The transition from spontaneous activity to persistent firing in the model, however, is not necessarily fast or irreversible. Slow NMDA-mediated reverberation enables the network to integrate inputs over extended time periods (Wang, 2002Wang X.-J. Probabilistic decision making by slow reverberation in cortical circuits.Neuron. 2002; 36: 955-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, Wong and Wang, 2006Wong K.-F. Wang X.-J. A recurrent network mechanism of time integration in perceptual decisions.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1314-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Therefore, this attractor network does not simply operate in the steady states, but also performs computations by virtue of transient dynamics. In addition, feedback inhibition mediates winner-take-all competition and categorical decision formation. All the neurons in the network receive a large amount of background Poisson inputs that enable the neurons to fire irregularly and approximately asynchronously at a few hertz in the absence of additional external inputs. Furthermore, as shown below, the stochastic neuronal spike discharges play an important role in producing trial-to-trial variability of both the network activity pattern and the resulting decision outcome. We assume that the RDM stimulus is encoded in the middle-temporal area (MT), while the visual input about choice alternatives (the targets) is encoded in a separate sensory area, and the two signals converge in a putative decision circuit like LIP. In addition, to study how subjects can internally modulate their response in the task, we assume that the decision circuit receives a simple “top-down” control signal from higher brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex. In summary, the pyramidal neurons in the model receive three external inputs, representing the visual targets, the motion stimulus, and the control signal, respectively. Figure 2 shows the temporal and spatial structure of the target-input and the motion stimulus input. The control signal input is uniform in space and time independent. Figures 3A and 3B show a sample simulation trial with four choices. The motion coherence is 0% in this trial, and therefore the motion stimulus input is the same for all neurons. However, as the activity develops in response to the motion stimulus, the four neural pools close to the targets compete against each other through shared inhibition, and stochastic recurrent network dynamics eventually break the symmetry. Namely, the activity of one of the neural pools (the top one in this simulation) ramps up and wins the competition, yielding a categorical choice. Interestingly, the model network does not exhibit winner-take-all competition prior to the motion stimulus onset, as long as the target inputs are sufficiently strong. This feature was also observed in a discrete model for two-choice decision making; an explanation can be found in earlier papers from our lab (Wong and Wang, 2006Wong K.-F. Wang X.-J. A recurrent network mechanism of time integration in perceptual decisions.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1314-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, Wong et al., 2007Wong K.-F. Huk A.C. Shadlen M.N. Wang X.-J. Neural circuit dynamics underlying accumulation of time-varying evidence during perceptual decision making.Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience. 2007; 1: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decision process terminates when the activity of a neural group in the network crosses a predetermined threshold level. Based on experimental findings (Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N. Decision-making with multiple alternatives.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, Roitman and Shadlen, 2002Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Response of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area during a combined visual discrimination reaction time task.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9475-9489PubMed Google Scholar), we assume that the threshold depends neither on coherence level nor on the number of choices. As shown by the four sample trials in Figures 3C–3F, both the winner (hence the choice) and the response time fluctuate from trial to trial, due to stochastic network dynamics. The simulated neural dynamics shown in Figure 3 compare directly with decision-correlated neurophysiological data from area LIP. In the four-choice experiments, for example (Figure 4 in Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N. Decision-making with multiple alternatives.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), the activity of neurons located close to the selected target in each trial ramped up, while the activity of neurons at orthogonal and opposite directions either decreased or ramped up at a much more moderate rate. In comparing the model and the neurophysiology, it is worth noting that in the monkey experiment typically a single-unit is recorded at a time and its selectivity and dynamics are assessed across trials. By contrast, in our model all neurons can be monitored and shown in a spatiotemporal pattern for a single trial (Figures 3A and 3B). At the neural population level, the experimentally observed ramping activity of single units is interpreted in our model in terms of a gradual development of “bump” or “hill” of network activity around the direction of the selected target (Figures 3A and 3B). Our model proposes a circuit mechanism for the formation of such activity patterns and therefore captures a key stage in the decision making process. When a “bump” activity profile is developed near one of the choice targets, it determines a well defined choice response, which can be readout by a downstream system (e.g., the superior colliculus, a command center for saccadic eye movements; cf. Lo and Wang, 2006Lo C.-C. Wang X.-J. Cortico-basal ganglia circuit mechanism for a decision threshold in reaction time tasks.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, in this work we did not explicitly include a downstream motor command circuit, but used a population vector measure to readout the choice of response. Specifically, in our simulations, we calculated the activity population vector at the time a neural pool crosses a firing threshold level (which presumably triggers a motor response downstream) and selected the nearest target as the behavioral choice (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We also examined an alternative readout algorithm, in which a target is selected only if its angular distance from the population vector is smaller than a certain tolerance window (Figure S1). With the latter algorithm, performance is slightly lower, because in a fraction of trials the population vector falls outside the tolerance window. However, the results are basically similar using these two different methods. In this way, a single response (among two, four, or eight options) is selected by the model, enabling us to directly compare our model with the monkey experiment in terms of both behavioral performance and single-unit neurophysiology. The model (Figures 3C–3F) captures several physiological observations from the LIP neurons in the monkey experiment. At the onset of the visual target input, pyramidal neurons located close to one of the targets respond by an initial transient followed by a tonic response (Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N. Decision-making with multiple alternatives.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, Huk and Shadlen, 2005Huk A.C. Shadlen M.N.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10420-10436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, Roitman and Shadlen, 2002Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Response of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area during a combined visual discrimination reaction time task.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9475-9489PubMed Google Scholar). Shortly after the onset of the motion stimulus, the model neurons show a dip in the neural response. To model the dip in response, we assume that 80 ms after the motion stimulus onset, there is a drop in the efficacy of the target-input due to either a shift in covert attention from the targets to the random dots motion stimulus, or cross inhibition between upstream neurons signaling the targets and the motion stimulus (cf. Wong et al., 2007Wong K.-F. Huk A.C. Shadlen M.N. Wang X.-J. Neural circuit dynamics underlying accumulation of time-varying evidence during perceptual decision making.Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience. 2007; 1: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact neural mechanism that causes the dip is not critical for our purpose. The important point is that it serves as a starting point for activity buildup during the decision process. The input signal representing the motion stimulus is assumed to reach the circuit after a 200 ms latency following the motion stimulus onset. The decision process proceeds then in two steps: gradual ramping activity that integrates sensory input over time, followed by a categorical choice through competition between neural pools selective for the choice alternatives. Importantly, as in the monkey experiment (Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N. Decision-making with multiple alternatives.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), the input signal representing the visual targets is constantly present during the decision process, to guide the network on the categorical choice options. Note that, during presentation of the targets, activity of the inhibitory neurons is elevated relative to the spontaneous firing (Figure 3A), partly because the activity of pyramidal neurons located around the targets causes an increase in the recurrent excitatory input to the inhibitory neurons. Moreover, as part of the simulation protocol, the inhibitory neurons receive an external excitatory input signal (feed-forward inhibition). We found that such a signal contributes to stabilizing the response of the network to the targets over time (data not shown). Figure 4 shows sample simulations with two, four, and eight choices. When the number of choices was changed, the motion stimulus input, the decision threshold and all the network parameters remained the same. The target-input, on the other hand, depends on the number of targets and their location. In addition, we assumed that the magnitude of the control sign"

These data raise the crucial question of the effects of aging on the scientific creativity and productivity of researchers. Those who worry about the aging of scientists usually believe that the younger they are the more creative and productive they will be. Using a large population of 13,680 university professors in Quebec, we show that, while scientific productivity rises sharply between 28 and 40, it increases at a slower pace between 41 and 50 and stabilizes afterward until retirement for the most active researchers. The average scientific impact per paper decreases linearly until 50-55 years old, but the average number of papers in highly cited journals and among highly cited papers rises continuously until retirement. Our results clearly show for the first time the natural history of the scientific productivity of scientists over their entire career and bring to light the fact that researchers over 55 still contribute significantly to the scientific community by producing high impact papers."

We present evidence for an ankyrin-based mechanism for sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin and β-DG. Dystrophin binds ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G, while β-DG binds ankyrin-G. Dystrophin and β-DG require ankyrin-G for retention at costameres but not delivery to the sarcolemma. Dystrophin and β-DG remain intracellular in ankyrin-B-depleted muscle, where β-DG accumulates in a juxta-TGN compartment. The neuromuscular junction requires ankyrin-B for localization of dystrophin/utrophin and β-DG and for maintenance of its postnatal morphology. A Becker muscular dystrophy mutation reduces ankyrin binding and impairs sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin-Dp71. Ankyrin-B also binds to dynactin-4, a dynactin subunit. Dynactin-4 and a subset of microtubules disappear from sarcolemmal sites in ankyrin-B-depleted muscle. Ankyrin-B thus is an adaptor required for sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin, as well as dynactin-4. β-dystroglycan (DG) and the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) are localized at costameres and neuromuscular junctions in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle.

The absence of dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy is accompanied by failure in accumulation of dystroglycan and other components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) at the sarcolemma (Cohn and Campbell, 2000Cohn R.D.

Dystrophin and its homolog utrophin form similar complexes that localize to the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). β-dystroglycan (β-DG) is the core membrane-spanning component of the DGC, which connects the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle (Lapidos et al., 2004Lapidos K.A.

The cellular mechanisms underlying the role of dystrophin in localization of the DGC in skeletal muscle remain to be resolved. Dystrophin associates with members of the syntrophin family, which recruit NOS and aquaporin 4 but are not required for association of dystrophin with the sarcolemma (Adams et al., 2001Adams M.E. Mueller H.A. Froehner S.C. In vivo requirement of the {alpha}-syntrophin PDZ domain for the sarcolemmal localization of nNOS and aquaporin-4.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Several considerations suggest that the ankyrin family of adaptors may play a role in organization of the DGC. Ankyrin-B (ankB) and ankyrin-G (ankG) are localized at costameres (Hopitzan et al., 2005Hopitzan A.A. Baines A.J. Ludosky M.A. Recouvreur M. Kordeli E.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while ankG is a component of the neuromuscular junction (Kordeli et al., 1998Kordeli E. Ludosky M.A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. AnkyrinG is associated with the postsynaptic membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the skeletal muscle fiber.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover ankB and ankG function in organization of diverse bilayer-spanning proteins in specialized membrane domains (Bennett and Healy, 2008Bennett V. Healy J. Organizing the fluid membrane bilayer: diseases linked to spectrin and ankyrin.Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 28-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We report here that ankB and ankG both bind to dystrophin and have distinct roles in organization of dystrophin and β-DG in the sarcolemma. AnkG binds β-DG as well as dystrophin and is required to restrict β-DG and dystrophin at costameres. We demonstrate that ankyrin-dependent organization of sarcolemmal dystrophin and β-DG is required for sarcolemmal integrity during physical exercise. Both dystrophin and β-DG remain intracellular in ankB-depleted muscle. We also demonstrate that ankB binds to dynactin-4 (also known as the p62 subunit of the dynactin complex), which has been proposed to function in connecting the dynactin complex to membrane sites (Eckley et al., 1999Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. Analysis of dynactin subcomplexes reveals a novel actin-related protein associated with the Arp1 minifilament pointed end.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and show that ankB is required for sarcolemmal localization of dynactin-4 as well as a specialized class of microtubules. AnkB thus is an adaptor for dystrophin, as well as dynactin-4. AnkB−/− mice have elevated serum creatine kinase, suggesting a congenital myopathy (Tuvia et al., 1999Tuvia S. Buhusi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. Ankyrin-B is required for intracellular sorting of structurally diverse Ca2+ homeostasis proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We initially attributed this skeletal muscle myopathy to abnormalities in calcium homeostasis since ankB−/− neonatal cardiomyocytes exhibited abnormal calcium dynamics (Tuvia et al., 1999Tuvia S. Buhusi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. Ankyrin-B is required for intracellular sorting of structurally diverse Ca2+ homeostasis proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have revealed that elevated calcium transients in ankB-deficient cardiomyocytes result from loss of a complex of ankB with the Na/Ca exchanger, Na/K ATPase, and IP3R (Mohler et al., 2003Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. et al.Ankyrin-B mutation causes type 4 long-QT cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death.Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, Mohler et al., 2005Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. Ankyrin-B coordinates the Na/K ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, and InsP3 receptor in a cardiac T-tubule/SR microdomain.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030423Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, this ankB-based complex is a specific adaptation of cardiomyocytes and is not present in skeletal muscle (Mohler et al., 2005Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. Ankyrin-B coordinates the Na/K ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, and InsP3 receptor in a cardiac T-tubule/SR microdomain.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e423https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030423Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether absence of ankB in neonatal mice affected localization of DGC proteins in skeletal muscle. Cross-sections of quadriceps muscles of newborn ankB null mice were immunolabeled for dystrophin and β-DG. Strikingly, labeling for these proteins is markedly reduced in the plasma membrane of ankB−/− muscle fibers (Figure 1A). Note that costameres (only 2 microns apart) appear as a solid line when viewed in these 20-micron-thick tissue sections. Ankyrin-G (ankG) and the Z line protein α-actinin are normally localized in ankB−/− muscle. Protein levels of the above DGC proteins in ankB null muscle are identical to wild-type levels in immunoblots (Figure 1B). Together, these findings suggest a specific defect in either delivery to or maintenance of dystrophin and β-DG in the sarcolemma in ankB−/− muscle. AnkB is expressed in most tissues, including the nervous system, and ankB null mice die soon after birth. These considerations suggested the possibility of an indirect effect of ankB deficiency on neonatal skeletal muscle. In order to study the role of ankB specifically in adult muscle of otherwise healthy animals, we knocked down ankB in skeletal muscle of adult mice using siRNA. We transfected tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of adult mice by electroporation with a bicistronic plasmid encoding a mouse-specific ankB-siRNA and Venus as a fluorescent marker for transfected fibers (Experimental Procedures). Muscle fibers were subsequently isolated and costamere proteins visualized in grazing sections by confocal microscopy. Figure 1C demonstrates sarcolemma-associated ankB in costameres, precisely colocalizing with γ-actin as a marker. Figure 1D shows the effective knockdown of ankB expression following siRNA expression, while γ-actin and ankG remain intact. Control fibers transfected with the Venus vector showed normal expression and distribution of β-DG, dystrophin, ankyrins-B and −G, as well as spectrin and vinculin (data not shown). Strikingly, ankB-depleted fibers exhibited marked reduction of both dystrophin and β-DG in the sarcolemma (Figure 1E). In contrast, γ-actin and ankG (Figure 1D) as well as spectrin and vinculin (data not shown) exhibited an unaltered labeling pattern. AnkB-depleted costameres thus are structurally intact but are selectively missing β-DG and dystrophin. Loss of β-DG and dystrophin was prevented by cotransfection with cDNA encoding human ankB that was resistant to mouse siRNA (Figure 1E). In rescue experiments, mice were transfected in one leg with an ankB siRNA-expressing plasmid and in the other with ankB siRNA plus cDNA encoding GFP-tagged human ankB. Human ankB-GFP staining, overlaying the diffuse Venus staining (marking siRNA-expressing fibers), is distributed in a costamere pattern indistinguishable from endogenous ankB. Dystrophin and β-DG are clearly present and properly enriched in costameres of rescued fibers. These experiments establish that ankB is required for the presence of β-DG and dystrophin at the sarcolemma of adult muscle. We next tested whether ankB knockdown results in sarcolemmal fragility. TA muscles were transfected with ankB-siRNA in the bicistronic Venus vector with and without cotransfection with a plasmid encoding human ankB-GFP for rescue as described above. As a control we injected muscles with the Venus vector alone. Mice were exercised on a treadmill and injected IP with Evans Blue Dye (EBD), which penetrates damaged fibers (Straub et al., 1997Straub V. Rafael J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. Animal models for muscular dystrophy show different patterns of sarcolemmal disruption.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To insure that muscle samples evaluated for EBD uptake were representative, we cross-sectioned throughout the entire muscle length at 200 μm intervals (approximately 30 sections per muscle). Fibers expressing only the Venus control plasmid exhibited no EBD uptake (Figure 1F). However, fibers expressing ankB siRNA (about 80% based on coexpression of Venus) exhibit EBD penetration. Cotransfection with plasmids encoding mouse ankB-siRNA and human ankB-GFP prevented EBD uptake. Images in Figure 1F are representative of sections taken from 12 muscles (6 mice) each of control, knockdown, and rescued animals in two different exercise/transfection experiments. In contrast to the MDX mouse and other animal models where EBD dye uptake is variable (Straub et al., 1997Straub V. Rafael J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. Animal models for muscular dystrophy show different patterns of sarcolemmal disruption.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), all of the fibers transfected with ankB siRNA also exhibited EBD uptake. A likely difference between acute siRNA-mediated depletion and genetic mouse models is that in the former, upregulation of utrophin and other compensatory mechanisms do not occur. AnkB thus is required for sarcolemmal localization of β-DG and dystrophin in adult skeletal muscle and to maintain structural integrity of muscle challenged by exercise. We demonstrate below that ankB depletion also has substantial effects on the postnatal NMJ. To determine if the phenotype observed in siRNA knockdown fibers is a result of loss of neuronal input, we evaluated effects of blocking neurotransmission by local injection with fluorescently labeled α-bungarotoxin (αBgt), which irreversibly inactivates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Individual TA muscles were injected daily with αBgt (0.11 μg/g, half the LD50 for the whole mouse; Windholz, 1983Windholz M. Merck Index. 10th edition. Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ1983: 206Google Scholar) for 3 consecutive days (Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). We observed no difference between control and αBgt-treated fibers in terms of β-DG localization in costameres, as well as in the general morphology of the NMJ (Figure S1). We next sought to determine the fate of β-DG and dystrophin in ankB-depleted adult muscle. Immunoblots revealed no reduction of β-DG and dystrophin polypeptides, even though ankB was markedly reduced in these siRNA-treated muscles (data not shown). These results recapitulated the preservation of these proteins in ankB null neonatal muscle (Figure 1B) and suggested that β-DG and/or dystrophin may accumulate in an intracellular compartment. We could not detect dystrophin in ankB-depleted muscle by immunofluorescence under a variety of fixation conditions. However, intracellular β-DG could be visualized in discrete micron-sized loci in both wild-type and ankB-depleted fibers permeabilized with saponin. β-DG-labeled puncta did not colabel with the endosomal marker Rab11 in either wild-type or ankB-depleted fibers. However, β-DG staining in control muscle colocalized with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker golgin 97 (Figure 1G). Voxel measurements derived from Z stacks reveal 89% (±6%, n = 50 golgi sites) overlap of β-DG labeling with golgin 97, while the remaining 11% β-DG staining was closely associated with the TGN (Figure 1G′). In contrast, only 50% ± 7% of β-DG staining in ankB-depleted fibers overlaps with the TGN (Figure 1F′), while the remaining 50% of β-DG staining is close to, but distinct from, the TGN. The difference in extra-TGN staining of β-DG of 50% in ankB-depleted fibers compared to 11% in controls was highly significant, with p = 0 in one-way ANOVA. Interestingly, the percent overlap between intracellular β-DG and golgin 97 is the same at high magnification and at lower magnification covering multiple sarcomeres for both wild-type and ankB-depleted fibers. Thus intracellular β-DG is primarily associated with or near the TGN, at least under these experimental conditions of fixation and permeabilization. In summary, dystrophin and β-DG are not degraded in ankB-depleted fibers, and β-DG accumulates in a juxta-TGN compartment distinct from rab11-labeled endosomes. Ankyrins-B and -G are closely related in their membrane-binding and spectrin-binding domains and are coexpressed in cardiomyocytes as well as other cells. However, these ankyrins are highly divergent in their C-terminal domains, which function in intramolecular regulation, and have distinct cellular roles (Abdi et al., 2006Abdi K.M. Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. Isoform specificity of ankyrin-B: a site in the divergent C-terminal domain is required for intramolecular association.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5741-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). AnkG is localized in costameres and colocalizes with γ-actin (Figure 2A) (Hopitzan et al., 2005Hopitzan A.A. Baines A.J. Ludosky M.A. Recouvreur M. Kordeli E. Ankyrin-G in skeletal muscle: tissue-specific alternative splicing contributes to the complexity of the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton.Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 309: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2001Williams M.W. Resneck W.G. Kaysser T. Ursitti J.A. Birkenmeier C.S. Barker J.E. Bloch R.J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used the same siRNA knockdown strategy as for ankB to test whether ankG has a role in localization of β-DG and dystrophin. Figure 2B demonstrates effective ankG knockdown while ankB and γ-actin remain intact. Localization of ankB and ankG in costameres thus is independent of each other's expression. As shown in Figure 2C, in the absence of ankG, β-DG and dystrophin are present in the sarcolemma. However, their costamere pattern is lost, and they are diffusely distributed throughout the sarcolemma. An optical section along the longitudinal axis through the sarcolemma shows that instead of the punctate costamere pattern in normal fibers, the staining patterns of β-DG and dystrophin in ankG-depleted fibers are continuous (Figures 2C′ and 2C″, respectively). A costamere pattern of dystrophin and β-DG is preserved by introducing GFP-tagged rat ankyrin-G that is resistant to the mouse-specific ankG siRNA (Figure 2C). We repeated the exercise experiment with mice transfected with ankG siRNA, both with and without rescue with rat ankG-GFP (same experimental procedure as described above for ankB-siRNA). AnkG-depleted muscle fibers exhibit uptake of EBD when subjected to physical exercise and can be rescued by introducing rat ankG-GFP (Figure 2D). Thus muscle fiber integrity not only depends on the presence of β-DG and dystrophin in the sarcolemma but may also require that these proteins are specifically retained at costameres by ankG. We next asked whether localization of ankyrins-B and-G at costameres is dependent on dystrophin and β-DG. We evaluated wild-type and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice that were 4 to 6 weeks old. Mdx mice at this age have previously been reported to express only residual levels of utrophin and β-DG in skeletal muscle (Roma et al., 2004Roma J. Munell F. Fargas A. Roig M. Evolution of pathological changes in the gastrocnemius of the mdx mice correlate with utrophin and beta-dystroglycan expression.Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2004; 108: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In Figure 3A we show in cross-sections that dystrophin/utrophin (the dystrophin antibody used crossreacts with utrophin) are absent and β-DG is missing from the mdx sarcolemma. However, ankyrins-B and -G show sarcolemmal labeling in cross-sections that is indistinguishable from wild-type muscles. Figure 3B further demonstrates that ankyrins-B and -G properly localize at costameres in isolated fibers from mdx muscle and colocalize with γ-actin. AnkB and ankG therefore localize at costameres independently from dystrophin and dystroglycan. The neonatal neuromuscular junction develops extensive branches and in-foldings during the first few weeks after birth (Sanes and Lichtman, 1999Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Development of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). β-DG, dystrophin, and utrophin are enriched in the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ (Grady et al., 2000Grady R.M. Zhou H. Cunningham J.M. Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Sanes J.R.

Chimaeric mice deficient in dystroglycans develop muscular dystrophy and have disrupted myoneural synapses.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Grady et al., 2000Grady R.M. Zhou H. Cunningham J.M. Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Sanes J.R.

In Figure 4A we show that ankB localizes at adult NMJs, where it forms a “foot print” layer underneath the NMJ boundaries marked by fluorescently labeled α-bungarotoxin (αBgt). We therefore evaluated the role of ankB in localization of β-DG, dystrophin, and utrophin at neonatal and adult NMJs. In ankB−/− neonatal NMJs, β-DG is still present at the NMJ despite the absence of staining for β-DG in the rest of the sarcolemma (Figure S2A) and lack of NMJ staining for dystrophin/utrophin (Figure S2B). Evidently, accumulation of β-DG at the neonatal NMJ does not require either ankB or dystrophin/utrophin. At this neonatal stage, the general morphology of the neonatal NMJ, as revealed by αBgt, is identical in wild-type and ankB−/− mice (determined by 3D reconstruction of Z series of NMJs taken on isolated fibers, not shown). We next assessed localization of β-DG and dystrophin/utrophin at the NMJ in muscles of adult mice treated with ankB siRNA, as described above. The NMJ of ankB-siRNA-treated muscles exhibit dramatic loss of both β-DG (Figure 4B) and dystrophin/utrophin (Figure 4C). Moreover, the typical pattern of nAChRs marked by αBgt is replaced by an amorphous blur (Figures 4B and 4C) resembling the diminished NMJs observed in dystroglycan-deficient mice (Cote et al., 1999Cote P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Chimaeric mice deficient in dystroglycans develop muscular dystrophy and have disrupted myoneural synapses.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional images show the dramatic deformation and neonatal appearance of the adult NMJ morphology following ankB depletion (Figure 4D). We were unable to deplete ankG from the NMJ using the same protocol that was effective in knocking down ankG at costameres. AnkG apparently is too stable at the NMJ for this type of siRNA-based knockdown. In summary, in the absence of ankB, dystrophin, utrophin, and β-DG are missing from the postsynaptic NMJ membrane, and the whole structure reverts to a neonatal morphology. Next we addressed potential protein interactions of ankyrins-B and -G underlying localization of dystrophin and β-DG. Neither ankyrin was effectively solubilized following published protocols for DGC isolation (data not shown), which explains why no ankyrin was noted as stoichiometric components of the DGC isolated from skeletal muscle (Campbell and Kahl, 1989Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D. Association of dystrophin and an integral membrane glycoprotein.Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Identification of ankyrin partners by coimmunoprecipitation therefore was not feasible. We adopted a candidate gene approach and performed in vitro binding assays evaluating interactions of ankB and ankG with either dystrophin-Dp71 or the cytoplasmic tail of β-DG, both fused to GST and immobilized on glutathione-sepharose beads. Dystrophin-Dp71 is a naturally occurring dystrophin variant lacking the first 62 exons encoding the actin-binding and rod domain but retaining the cysteine-rich/C-terminal domain as well as activity in targeting the DGC to costameres (Cox et al., 1994Cox G.A. Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Chamberlain J.S. Dp71 can restore the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex in muscle but fails to prevent dystrophy.Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both ankB and ankG bind directly to GST-dystrophin-Dp71 (Figure 5A). Moreover, ankG also associates with the GST-tagged cytoplasmic tail of β-DG, although ankB does not (Figure 5A). Controls included no binding to GST alone and no binding of Dp71 and the cytoplasmic tail of β-DG to ankyrins denatured by diethyl pyrocarbonate (data not shown). To identify the ankyrin-binding region in dystrophin-Dp71, we tested the N′ and the C′ termini halves of Dp71 for ankyrin binding in vitro. The junction between amino acids Q359/L360 of Dp71 was chosen based on a prediction of a transition point between a structured N-terminal region and an unstructured C-terminal region (http://iupred.enzim.hu/Theory.html; see Experimental Procedures). In Figure 5B we show that ankB binds only the N-terminal portion of Dp71, corresponding to exons 63–72 of the full-length dystrophin gene (Dp427) and containing the cysteine-rich domain. The same result was obtained for ankG (data not shown). We next mapped the ankG-binding site of β-DG. We tested a series of deletion mutants in the cytoplasmic domain of β-DG (DGcyto), described in Figure 5C, for binding to ankG in vitro. As described in Figure 5D, a 33 amino acid membrane-proximal region, DGcytoΔ810-895, bound ankG to the same extent as the whole cytoplasmic domain. A deletion mutant, DGcytoΔ776-809, lacking the membrane-proximal residues, did not bind ankG. Point mutations in the proximal region of the full-length cytoplasmic domain further defined the binding site. Two mutations, IIF798AAA and DE802AA, show loss of binding to ankG down to almost background levels, while a third mutant, DD805AA, shows a major reduction. Other mutants exhibited normal binding. The ankG-binding site of β-DG thus is localized to 10 amino acids located adjacent to the membrane-bilayer-spanning region. The ankG-binding site is distinct from the reported binding site for dystrophin located at the C terminus of β-DG (Jung et al., 1995Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. Identification and characterization of the dystrophin anchoring site on beta-dystroglycan.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 273"
https://openalex.org/W1964463656,"Studies of the innervation of limb muscles by spinal motor neurons have helped to define mechanisms by which axons establish trajectories to their targets. Related motor axons select dorsal or ventral pathways at the base of the limb, raising the question of how these alternate trajectories are specified. EphA signaling has been proposed to control the dorsal trajectory of motor axons in conjunction with other signaling systems, although the respective contributions of each system to motor axon guidance are unclear. We show that the expression of EphB receptors by motor axons, and ephrin-B ligands by limb mesenchymal cells, directs the ventral trajectory of motor axons. Our findings reveal symmetry in the molecular strategies that establish this aspect of nerve-muscle connectivity. The involvement of ephrin:Eph signaling in guiding both sets of motor axons raises the possibility that other signaling systems function primarily to refine or modulate a core Eph signaling program."
https://openalex.org/W2007526989,"Alternative splicing makes a major contribution to proteomic diversity in higher eukaryotes with approximately 70% of genes encoding two or more isoforms. In most cases, the molecular mechanisms responsible for splice site choice remain poorly understood. Here, we used a randomization-selection approach in vitro to identify sequence elements that could silence a proximal strong 5' splice site located downstream of a weakened 5' splice site. We recovered two exonic and four intronic motifs that effectively silenced the proximal 5' splice site both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, silencing was only observed in the presence of the competing upstream 5' splice site. Biochemical evidence strongly suggests that the silencing motifs function by altering the U1 snRNP/5' splice site complex in a manner that impairs commitment to specific splice site pairing. The data indicate that perturbations of non-rate-limiting step(s) in splicing can lead to dramatic shifts in splice site choice."

Here, we show that the presenilin-binding protein ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN) plays a role in TDP-43 aggregation.

Chad D.A. Pioro E.P. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Davis, Philadelphia, PA1998Google Scholar). The cumulative lifetime risk for ALS is ∼1 in 1000, which is comparable with the occurrence rate of multiple sclerosis (1Mitsumoto H. Chad D.A. Pioro E.P. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Davis, Philadelphia, PA1998Google Scholar). However, only about 3,000 cases of ALS are observed at any given time in the United States, because of the low five-year median survival rate (20%) for this disease. There are currently no effective treatments to halt the course of ALS. Approximately 10% of ALS cases, termed familial ALS (fALS), have a clear genetic link. Dominant mutations in the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are responsible for ∼20% of fALS (2Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. et al.Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5568) Google Scholar). Well over 100 different disease-associated mutations in SOD1 have been identified in humans (3Andersen P.M. Sims K.B. Xin W.W. Kiely R. O'Neill G. Ravits J. Pioro E. Harati Y. Brower R.D. Levine J.S.

Remarkably, mouse models of SOD1-induced ALS have shown that it is not a neuron-autonomous disease; expression of toxic SOD1 mutants in non-neuronal glial cells is sufficient to induce neuron pathology, whereas expression of toxic SOD1 mutants in motor neurons is insufficient for full expression of the disease phenotype (11Clement A.M.

Sporadic ALS (sALS), representing 90-95% of all ALS cases, occurs in the absence of a family history of disease, but follows a clinical course that is similar to SOD1 ALS.

Misteli T. Baralle F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3785-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although it is unclear how TDP-43 accumulates in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons in ALS and ubiquitin-positive fronto-temporal lobular dementia, Winton et al. (22Winton M.J. Igaz L.M. Wong M.M. Kwong L.K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13302-13309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) found that mutation of candidate nuclear localization sequences resulted in accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in mammalian cells. TDP-43 also forms toxic aggregates when heterologously overexpressed in yeast (23Johnson B.S. McCaffery J.M. Lindquist S. Gitler A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The significance of TDP-43 aggregates has been validated by several recent studies demonstrating that mutations in the TARDBP gene locus encoding TDP-43 cause a subset of fALS and sALS cases (24Kabashi E. Valdmanis P.N. Dion P. Spiegelman D. McConkey B.J. Vande Velde C. Bouchard J.P. Lacomblez L. Pochigaeva K. Salachas F. Pradat P.F. Camu W. Meininger V. Dupre N. Rouleau G.A. Nat.

Baralle F. de Belleroche J. Mitchell J.D. Leigh P.N. Al-Chalabi A. Miller C.C. Nicholson G. Shaw C.E. Science. 2008; 319: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Many of the identified disease-associated mutations are clustered in the carboxyl terminus of TDP-43 and may affect its stability and/or folding. Considered together, the current findings suggest that the molecular neuropathogenesis of sALS with TDP-43 aggregates may be conceptually similar to other neurodegenerative proteinopathies, including Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease (26Forman M.S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, accumulation of TDP-43 within Ub-positive insoluble aggregates implies that the Ub-proteasome pathway plays an important role in TDP-43-associated pathology. In this report, we provide evidence that ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN), a proteasome targeting factor implicated in the etiology of AD, is potentially linked to sALS through an association with TDP-43. The association of UBQLN with topologically distinct protein aggregates in sALS and AD suggests a common mechanistic link between these neurodegenerative conditions. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and DNA Construction-We screened a human fetal brain cDNA library (Matchmaker™GAL4 Two-Hybrid System3, Clontech) using a full-length TDP-43 cDNA cloned into XmaI and BamHI sites of the bait vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). Approximately 7.5 × 106 cDNA clones, which represents over 2-fold coverage of the library, were screened using standard procedures recommended by the Clontech user manual and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 as a cotransformation host. Primary positives were selected for growth on SD (minimal synthetic dropout medium)/-Leu/-Trp plates containing the chromogenic substrate for α-galactosidase, X-α-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside, from Labscientific). Individual positive colonies were re-streaked onto SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-Gal plates and the surviving secondary clones were chosen for further study. Individual clones were grown in liquid culture and yeast plasmid DNA isolated using Zymoprep I™ Yeast Plasmid Minipreparation Kit from Zymo Research. Purified yeast shuttle plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli and re-isolated prior to DNA sequence analysis. cDNA clones for human full-length TDP-43 and UBQLN were obtained from Open Biosystems. The open reading frame of TDP-43 (amino acids 1-414) was PCR amplified using expand Hi-Fi DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). For the mammalian expression system, TDP-43 cDNA was cut from pGBKT7 vector and subcloned into pCMV-HA vector (Clontech) through SfiI and SalI restriction sites. PCR-generated TDP-43 deletion mutants in this vector were constructed. The open reading frame of human UBQLN (amino acids 1-589) was PCR amplified as mentioned above and subcloned into pCMV-Myc vector for expression in the mammalian tissue culture system. Myc-UBQLNΔUBA (amino acids 1-512) was made through the introduction of a termination codon upstream of the UBA domain of full-length Myc-UBQLN by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Similarly, human UBQLN and its truncation mutants were PCR amplified and subcloned into pGEX-5X-2 for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expression. Full-length UBQLN and UBQLNΔUBL (amino acids 131-589) were subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-2, whereas the GST-UBQLNΔUBA mutant was made by introducing a translation termination mutation after codon 512. A fragment encoding only the UBL domain (amino acids 1-130) was subcloned into BamHI and SmaI sites and the UBA domain cDNA fragment (encoding amino acids 540-589) was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI of pGEX-5X-2. Amino- and carboxyl-terminal fusions of TDP-43 to GFP were generated by subcloning full-length TDP-43 PCR products into the HindIII-BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (GFP-TDP-43) or pEGFP-N1 (TDP-43-GFP), respectively. GFP-LC3 was obtained from Dr. Gary Chiang (Burnham Institute) and has been described (27Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Antibodies-Antibody suppliers included: Santa Cruz (α-Myc, α-CREB1), Sigma (horseradish peroxidase conjugated α-GST), Roche Applied Science (α-HA), Upstate (α-ATF1) ProteinTech Group (α-TDP-43), Zymed Laboratories Inc. (α-UBQLN, clone 3D5E2), Abcam (α-UBQLN, rabbit polyclonal), and BioMol International (mono- and polyubiquitylated conjugates, clone FK2). The secondary antibody suppliers included: Jackson (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG), GE Healthcare (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep α-mouse IgG), and Caltag Laboratories (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG, Cy3-conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat α-mouse IgG, and Cy3-conjugated goat α-mouse IgG). Cell Culture and Transfections-HeLa cells and HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. PC-12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. HeLa cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence experiments, HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips and a total of 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA was introduced into each well of a 12-well plate. HEK 293T cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate method and a total of 2 or 3 μg of plasmid DNA was introduced into each 6-well plate or 60-mm cell culture dish. Concanamycin A (Sigma) was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at a final concentration of 50 μm. Protein Analysis-HEK 293T or HeLa cell pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.50, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EDTA) containing a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 20 nm microcystin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. Cell extracts were then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble fraction was transferred to a new tube. An insoluble fraction was prepared by washing the pellet once in lysis buffer followed by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For TDP-43 ubiquitylation assays, transfected HeLa cells were treated with 10 μm MG-132 for 4 h. The cells were lysed in a solution containing 0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 5% SDS, and 30% glycerol, and incubated at 95 °C for 15 min. The lysate was diluted 1:20 in lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and N-ethylmaleimide. Two micrograms of α-TDP-43 was added to the lysate, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle inversion mixing, after which protein A-Sepharose was added. After incubation for 16 h, the beads were collected and washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using α-HA antibodies. GST Pull-down Assays-GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21 (Invitrogen) transformed with the appropriate plasmids. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in chilled PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture and N-ethylmaleimide. The mixture was immediately sonicated on ice for a total time of 1 min using a 20-s pulse length and 20% amplitude setting using a Branson Digital Sonifier. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. After clarification, the samples were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. Binding, washing, and elution of the GST fusion proteins was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. For GST pull-down experiments, HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding wild-type or mutant HA-TDP-43 expression plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell pellets were extracted with lysis buffer and 500 μg of each clarified extract was incubated with GST or GST-UBQLN fusion proteins (20 μg) that had been prebound to GSH-agarose beads. After inversion mixing for 4 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted using α-HA antibodies to detect affinity purified HA-TDP-43. Fusion protein levels were determined by immunoblotting with α-GST antibodies. Immunofluorescence Microscopy-Immunostaining and immunofluorescence microscopy were carried out as previously described (28Sakasai R. Tibbetts R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13549-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips and following transfections and fixation with paraformaldehyde, processed for immunostaining with the indicated antibodies. Unless otherwise stated, all primary antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 2 μg/ml from 500 μg/ml stock solutions. Confocal images were generated using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 MP Rainbow scanning laser microscope at the W.M. Keck Laboratory for Biological Imaging at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI. For TDP-43 particle size analysis, HeLa cells were cotransfected with UBQLN and wild-type, D169G, or G37V TDP-43, and immunofluorescence performed as described. For each condition, ∼25-30 ×40 images were combined into a master file, which contained a total of 125-150-transfected cells. Adobe Photoshop was used to isolate cytoplasmic staining by deletion of areas of overlap with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The Particle Analysis function of ImageJ was used to count aggregates, defined as a particle of at least 10 square pixels and displaying at least 80% circularity. Significance between groups was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. UBQLN Is a TDP-43-interacting Protein-We initiated a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify candidate TDP-43-interacting proteins. A screen of ∼7.5 × 106 clones from a human fetal brain cDNA library using full-length human TDP-43 cDNA as bait identified a nearly full-length cDNA clone of Ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN) as a candidate TDP-43 interacting protein (Fig. 1A). UBQLN belongs to a family of proteins defined by the presence of amino-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) and carboxyl-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains (Fig. 1B). UBL-UBA domain proteins, such as RAD23 and S. cerevisiae DSK2, participate in the shuttling of ubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome (29Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E.

UBQLN2 and UBQLN3 display 76 and 46% identity, respectively, to UBQLN1 (31Conklin D. Holderman S. Whitmore T.E. Maurer M. Feldhaus A.L.

Mutations in mitofusin 2 (MFN2), a dynamin-like GTPase required for mitochondrial fusion, cause the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A. In a recent report in Nature, de Brito and Scorrano, 2008de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar demonstrate a new function of MFN2—tethering the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to control the efficiency of mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ ions. Close contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are physiologically important for metabolite exchange and modulation of Ca2+ signaling (Pizzo and Pozzan, 2007Pizzo P. Pozzan T. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 511-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Ca2+ ions are mainly stored in the ER but can be taken up by mitochondria after their release from the ER during cell signaling. It has been proposed that the efficiency of this process depends on zones of close proximity between the ER and the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the structural basis of these contacts has remained enigmatic. In a recent paper in Nature, de Brito and Scorrano, 2008de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar report that the mitofusin MFN2 tethers ER membranes to mitochondria, thereby discovering an unexpected link between mitochondrial morphology and ER-mitochondria interactions. Mitochondria form a tubular, reticulated network whose shape is controlled by opposing fusion and fission events. The mitofusins MFN1 and MFN2 are conserved, dynamin-like GTPases in the mitochondrial outer membrane that mediate mitochondrial fusion in concert with another GTPase, OPA1, in the inner membrane (Figure 1). Mutations in MFN2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 2A, a peripheral neuropathy characterized by axonal degeneration (Züchner and Vance, 2006Züchner S. Vance J.M. Nat. Clin. Pract. Neurol. 2006; 2: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mitofusin complexes on adjacent mitochondrial membranes act as membrane tethers prior to fusion and form dimeric, antiparallel coiled-coil structures in trans. The activity of mitofusins in membrane fusion is overlapping, and both homo- and heterooligomeric mitofusin complexes are active (Detmer and Chan, 2007Detmer S.A. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Accordingly, fragmented mitochondria accumulate in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in either MFN1 or MFN2, and overexpression of either one of the mitofusins restores mitochondrial tubules (Detmer and Chan, 2007Detmer S.A. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These findings led to the general view that the relative expression of MFN1 and MFN2 protein determines whether the loss of one mitofusin gene impairs mitochondrial membrane fusion. This could explain why murine Purkinje cells expressing MFN1 at low levels are particularly sensitive for the loss of MFN2 leading to neurodegeneration in the cerebellum (Chen et al., 2007Chen H.

Similarly, cell-type-specific differences in the relative expression of MFN1 and MFN2 may cause embryonic lethality of mice lacking MFN1, whereas MFN2-deficient embryos develop normally but die of placental defects. However, purified rat MFN1 and MFN2 exert different GTPase activities, and OPA1 in the inner membrane requires MFN1 but not MFN2 to mediate fusion. It is therefore conceivable that distinct functions of mitofusins rather than differences in expression levels must be considered in order to explain cell-type-specific axonal degeneration in CMT2A. This view is supported by the new report of de Brito and Scorrano demonstrating striking defects in ER morphology in cells lacking MFN2 but not in cells lacking MFN1 (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). The enrichment of MFN2 in the mitochondria-associated membrane and a ∼40% reduction in the ER-mitochondria interface in MFN2-deficient cells suggested a role of MFN2 for organellar tethering. How does a mitochondrial outer membrane protein affect ER shape and positioning? To address this question, de Brito and Scorrano generated MFN2 variants that exclusively target to the ER or the mitochondrial outer membrane and examined in an elegant series of experiments their ability to complement ER and mitochondrial defects in cells lacking MFN2. Strikingly, expression of ER-targeted MFN2 restored the interconnected ER network but not mitochondrial morphology in MFN2-deficient cells, whereas MFN2 targeted to the mitochondria complemented only the mitochondrial defect. Evidence that endogenous MFN2 is required in the ER was obtained by monitoring ER-mitochondria tethering in a reconstituted assay system in vitro. The activity of ER-targeted MFN2 depended on the presence of MFN1 or MFN2 at the mitochondrial surface, suggesting the formation of hetero- or homotypic MFN2 complexes in trans between ER and the mitochondrial outer membrane (Figure 1). These unexpected findings raise questions about the sorting mechanism ensuring a dual localization of MFN2 and point to additional regulatory steps preventing fusion of ER and mitochondrial membranes after tethering, which will certainly stimulate future studies. Regardless, a tethering function of MFN2 is in perfect agreement with electron tomographic studies visualizing proteinaceous bridges between the two organelles (Csordás et al., 2006Csordás G. Renken C. Várnai P. Walter L. Weaver D. Buttle K.F. Balla T. Mannella C.A. Hajnóczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Interestingly the observed length of these bridges, ∼10 nm, fits the dimensions of mitofusin coiled-coils. It should be noted, however, that other proteins contribute to tethering as about half of ER-mitochondria contact zones are still formed in mitofusin-deficient cells. The multifunctional sorting protein PACS-2 (Simmen et al., 2005Simmen T. Asian J.E. Balgoveshchenskaya A.D. Thomas L. Wan L. Xiang Y. Feliciangeli S.F. Hung C.H. Crump C.M. Thomas G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) or a previously described complex containing the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor are likely candidates (Szabadkai et al., 2006Szabadkai G. Bianchi K. Várnai P. De Stefani D. Wieckowski M.R. Cavagna D. Nagy A.I. Balla T. Rizutto R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The identification of MFN2 as membrane tether enabled de Brito and Scorrano to examine directly the role of the ER-mitochondria juxtaposition for communication between the two organelles during Ca2+ signaling. They observed that Ca2+ concentration is increased ∼2-fold in the ER of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking MFN2, a phenotype that by itself warrants future studies. After IP3-triggered Ca2+ release from the ER, the uptake of Ca2+ into MFN2-deficient mitochondria was reduced markedly. These findings reveal a striking correlation between the number of ER-mitochondria contact zones and Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and therefore provide direct evidence that a close apposition of both organelles is crucial during Ca2+ signaling. This may have important implications for mitochondrial movement, which varies in response to energy demand and other regulatory cues. Ca2+-binding proteins at the mitochondrial surface that mediate the attachment of motor proteins to mitochondria have been proposed to sense local Ca2+ oscillations (Pizzo and Pozzan, 2007Pizzo P. Pozzan T. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 511-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this way, impaired ER tethering due to mutations in MFN2 may result in mitochondrial transport deficiencies. The dual activity of MFN2 unraveled by de Brito and Scorrano could therefore be of direct relevance to our understanding of the pathogenesis of CMT2A, which is characterized by altered axonal transport of mitochondria (Baloh et al., 2007Baloh R.H. Schmidt R.E. Pestronk A. Milbrandt J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A number of pathogenic MFN2 mutations, especially those affecting residues not conserved between MFN1 and MFN2, did not abolish the fusion activity of MFN2 but cause mitochondrial aggregation when overexpressed (Detmer and Chan, 2007Detmer S.A. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The corresponding region in MFN2 including a Ras-binding domain is now demonstrated to be required to maintain a normal ER morphology in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). However, the presence of ER membranes in axons is controversial, and it appears likely that they are restricted to dendrites (Ye et al., 2007Ye B. Zhang Y. Song W. Younger S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2007; 130: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Juxtaposition between ER and mitochondria may therefore be of critical importance for the transport of mitochondria into dendrites, explaining the accumulation of fragmented mitochondria at zones of dendritic outgrowth in MFN2-deficient Purkinje cells (Chen et al., 2007Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Cell. 2007; 130: 548-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). How then can deficiencies in axonal transport be explained? Perhaps some MFN2 mutations are gain-of-function mutations sequestering mitochondria to ER membranes. Clearly, further studies are required to resolve the pathogenesis of CMT2A caused by MFN2 mutations. The dual activity of MFN2 in mitochondrial fusion and ER tethering may point the way.

As a consequence, the frequency of sensory neurons expressing endogenous receptor genes is reduced 20-fold. We observe that these mice can smell, but odor discrimination and performance in associative olfactory learning tasks are impaired. However, these mice cannot detect the M71 ligand acetophenone despite the observation that virtually all sensory neurons and glomeruli are activated by this odor. The M71 transgenic mice readily detect other odors in the presence of acetophenone. These observations have implications for how receptor activation in the periphery is represented in the brain and how these representations encode odors."

Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are associated with substantially higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to infections caused by antimicrobial-susceptible bacteria. The emergence and spread of these bacteria is complex and requires incorporating numerous interrelated factors which clinical studies cannot adequately address.A model is created which incorporates several key factors contributing to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria including the effects of the immune system, acquisition of resistance genes and antimicrobial exposure. The model identifies key strategies which would limit the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains. Specifically, the simulations show that early initiation of antimicrobial therapy and combination therapy with two antibiotics prevents the emergence of resistant bacteria, whereas shorter courses of therapy and sequential administration of antibiotics promote the emergence of resistant strains.The principal findings suggest that (i) shorter lengths of antibiotic therapy and early interruption of antibiotic therapy provide an advantage for the resistant strains, (ii) combination therapy with two antibiotics prevents the emergence of resistance strains in contrast to sequential antibiotic therapy, and (iii) early initiation of antibiotics is among the most important factors preventing the emergence of resistant strains. These findings provide new insights into strategies aimed at optimizing the administration of antimicrobials for the treatment of infections and the prevention of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance."

Long-lasting modifications in the function of synapses in the brain, termed synaptic plasticity, underlie learning and memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. A synaptic model of memory: Long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9254) Google Scholar). Induction of long-term synaptic plasticity requires activation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (Collingridge et al., 1983Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.J. McLennan H.

Two major forms of LTD have been identified, which are distinguished on the basis of whether they are triggered via the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) (Mulkey and Malenka, 1992Mulkey R.M.

Both forms of LTD can coexist at the same set of synapses and utilize different signaling and expression mechanisms (Oliet et al., 1997Oliet S.H.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A.

This raises the important issue of how the Ca2+ signals associated with the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTD (NMDAR-LTD) and mGluR-dependent LTD (mGluR-LTD) are distinguished. In the case of NMDAR-LTD, several Ca2+-sensitive enzymes have been implicated in the process, including calmodulin, which activates calcineurin (Mulkey et al., 1993Mulkey R.M. Herron C.E.

Neuronal calcium sensor proteins: Generating diversity in neuronal Ca2+ signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition, protein interacting with C kinase (PICK1) is Ca2+ sensitive, mediates NMDAR-dependent endocytosis of AMPARs (Hanley and Henley, 2005Hanley J.G. Henley J.M. PICK1 is a calcium-sensor for NMDA-induced AMPA receptor trafficking.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3266-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and is involved in both hippocampal LTP and LTD (Terashima et al., 2008Terashima A.

In contrast, much less is known about the Ca2+ sensors involved in mGluR-LTD, although PICK1 has been implicated in mGluR-LTD in the cerebellum and ventral tegmental area (Xia et al., 2000Xia J.

The perirhinal cortex is a transitional cortex interposed between the neocortex and the hippocampal formation and is essential for paired associative learning and recognition memory (Mandler, 1980Mandler G. Recognizing: The judgment of previous occurrence.Psychol. Rev. 1980; 87: 252-271Crossref Scopus (2028) Google Scholar, Brown and Aggleton, 2000Brown M.W. Aggleton J.P. Recognition memory: What are the roles of the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 2: 51-61Crossref Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Loss of recognition memory is a major symptom of the amnesic syndrome and early stages of Alzheimer's disease (Blaizot et al., 2002Blaizot X. Meguro K. Millien I. Baron J.C. Chavoix C.

Evolution of visual recognition memory in MCI patient.Neurology. 2004; 62: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been shown that recognition memory involves the decrement of responses to repeated stimuli and that this long-term change in neuronal responsiveness shares many properties with LTD. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of LTD in the perirhinal cortex is of fundamental importance for understanding this form of learning. Both NMDARs and mGluRs are involved in perirhinal-based, visual object recognition memory (Barker et al., 2006aBarker G.R. Warburton E.C. Koder T. Dolman N.P. More J.C. Aggleton J.P. Bashir Z.I. Auberson Y.P. Jane D.E. Brown M.W. The different effects on recognition memory of perirhinal kainate and NMDA glutamate receptor antagonism: Implications for underlying plasticity mechanisms.J.

A temporally distinct role for group I and group II metabotropic glutamate receptors in object recognition memory.Learn. Mem. 2006; 13: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By understanding the molecular differences between these two forms of LTD in this brain region, it should be possible to establish their relative functions in learning and memory in this brain structure. In the present study, we have directly compared NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD at synapses in the perirhinal cortex. Our results demonstrate the existence of two distinct signaling pathways that possess differing Ca2+ sensitivities. Whereas NMDAR-LTD requires the calcium sensor calmodulin, mGluR-LTD depends specifically on NCS-1, the prototypic member of the NCS family. We find that NCS-1 binds directly to the BAR domain of PICK1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that the association between these two proteins is enhanced following stimulation of mGluRs. RNAi knockdown of NCS-1 or interfering with PICK1 BAR domain interactions blocks specifically mGluR-LTD. Our results, therefore, provide additional insights into mechanisms involved in the induction of one of the major forms of LTD in the brain. We performed experiments at synapses of perirhinal cortex where both NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD can be readily induced in the same neurons by altering the frequency of afferent stimulation without the need for manipulating the bathing solutions. We have shown previously that 1 Hz stimulation induces NMDAR-LTD, whereas 5 Hz stimulation induces mGluR-LTD (Jo et al., 2006Jo J. Ball S.M. Seok H. Oh S.B. Massey P.V. Molnar E. Bashir Z.I. Cho K. Experience-dependent modification of mechanisms of long-term depression.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2006Park Y. Jo J. Isaac J.T. Cho K. Long-term depression of kainate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.Neuron. 2006; 49: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used slices obtained from 7- to 13-day-old rats. We confirmed that, at this age, 1 Hz stimulation selectively induced NMDAR-LTD since it was blocked by D-AP5 (99% ± 8% of baseline, n = 6) (Figure 1A) and was unaffected by the coapplication of an mGlu1 antagonist, LY367385, and an mGlu5 antagonist, MPEP (65% ± 7%, n = 5) (Figure 1B). In contrast, 5 Hz stimulation selectively induced NMDAR-independent LTD (56% ± 4%, n = 6) (Figure 1C) that was blocked by MPEP (96% ± 8%, n = 5) (Figure 1D), showing that it was induced via the activation of mGlu5 receptors. We next examined whether the induction of NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD converged at the level of expression or were two fully independent processes by performing cross-saturation experiments using field potential recording. Stimulation at 5 Hz (900 shocks) induced LTD in the presence of D-AP5 that, although somewhat smaller in magnitude than that induced using whole-cell recording, was saturated after a single episode of stimulation. Under these conditions, LTD could still be readily induced by 1 Hz stimulation (900 shocks) delivered in the presence of both mGlu1 and mGlu5 antagonists (first 5 Hz stimulation, 78% ± 2%; second 5 Hz stimulation, 74% ± 4% of initial baseline [p > 0.05]; 1 Hz stimulation, 52% ± 2% of initial baseline, n = 5 [p < 0.01]) (Figure 1E). Similarly, 1 Hz stimulation induced LTD that was also somewhat smaller than obtained with whole-cell recording but again saturated after a single episode of stimulation, since a second episode of 1 Hz stimulation failed to induce additional LTD. However, 5 Hz stimulation in the presence of D-AP5 induced further LTD (first 1 Hz stimulation, 75% ± 3%; second 1 Hz stimulation, 74% ± 3% [p > 0.05]; 5 Hz stimulation, 60% ± 2%, n = 4 [p < 0.01]) (Figure 1F). These experiments show that NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD are fully independent forms of synaptic plasticity at the levels of both induction and expression. Chelating Ca2+ in the postsynaptic neuron prevents the induction of NMDAR-LTD (Mulkey and Malenka, 1992Mulkey R.M. Malenka R.C. Mechanisms underlying induction of homosynaptic long-term depression in area CA1 of the hippocampus.Neuron. 1992; 9: 967-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) and mGluR-LTD (Cho et al., 2000Cho K. Kemp N. Noel J. Aggleton J. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. A new form of long-term depression in the perirhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the present study, we compared the effects of chelating Ca2+, using different concentrations of BAPTA, on the two forms of LTD. In agreement with our previous work (Cho et al., 2000Cho K. Kemp N. Noel J. Aggleton J. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. A new form of long-term depression in the perirhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Cho et al., 2001Cho K. Aggleton J.P. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. An experimental test of the role of postsynaptic calcium levels in determining the synaptic strength using perirhinal cortex of rat.J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we found that BAPTA (10 mM) prevented the induction of NMDAR-LTD (99% ± 6%, n = 4) (Figure 2A). This concentration of BAPTA also blocked the induction of mGluR-LTD (94% ± 9%, n = 4) (Figure 2B). Surprisingly, however, a lower concentration of BAPTA (0.2 mM) had a differential effect on the two forms of LTD, blocking mGluR-LTD (95% ± 5%, n = 10) (Figure 2C), but not affecting NMDAR-LTD (55% ± 3%, n = 10) (Figure 2D). This differential sensitivity to BAPTA was also observed if 5 Hz and 1 Hz stimulation was delivered in turn to the same neurons (5 Hz, 95% ± 10%; 1 Hz, 51% ± 7%, n = 5 [p < 0.001]) (Figure 2E). These results show differences in the postsynaptic Ca2+ requirements of mGluR-LTD and NMDAR-LTD. This might be due to different signaling mechanisms, in particular the Ca2+ sensors that transduce the Ca2+ rise into an alteration in synaptic efficiency. The induction of NMDAR-LTD requires the activation of Ca2+-/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatases, calcineurin, in the CA1 of the hippocampus (Mulkey et al., 1993Mulkey R.M. Herron C.E.

To determine whether calmodulin has a role in NMDAR-LTD and/or mGluR-LTD in the perirhinal cortex, we used two approaches. Postsynaptic infusion of a calmodulin inhibitor peptide (R-R-K-W-Q-K-T-G-H-A-V-R-A-I-G-R-L-NH2) based on the calmodulin-binding domain of myosin light-chain kinase (10 μM MLCK; see Torok et al., 1998Torok K. Cowley D.J. Bransmeier B.D. Howell S. Aitken A. Trentham D.R. Inhibition of calmodulin-activated smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase by calmodulin-binding peptides and fluorescent (phosphodiesterase-activating) calmodulin derivatives.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6188-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), blocked NMDAR-LTD but had no effect on mGluR-LTD in the same neurons (1 Hz, 96% ± 8%; 5 Hz, 58% ± 7%, n = 4) (Figure 3A). A similar finding was made when either 1 Hz stimulation or 5 Hz stimulation was delivered alone. In these experiments, two neurons in the same slice were recorded from simultaneously, one with an electrode containing MLCK and the other containing a control peptide (10 μM MLCK control; Trp and Leu replaced to Glu; R-R-K-E-Q-K-T-G-H-A-V-R-A-I-G-R-E-NH2). Thus, MLCK, but not MLCK-control peptide, blocked the induction of LTD induced by 1 Hz stimulation (MLCK, 98% ± 4%; MLCK-control peptide, 58% ± 4%, n = 6) (Figure 3B), while neither peptide affected the induction of LTD induced by 5 Hz stimulation (MLCK, 58% ± 6%; MLCK-control peptide, 59% ± 6%, n = 6) (Figure 3C). We also tested the effects of a different calmodulin inhibitor, W7, on the two forms of LTD (Figures 3D and 3E). Inclusion of W7 (1 mM; see Morishita et al., 2005Morishita W. Marie H. Malenka R.C. Distinct triggering and expression mechanisms underlie LTD of AMPA and NMDA synaptic responses.Nat.

These data confirm that calmodulin is important for NMDAR-LTD, but not required for the induction of mGluR-LTD. The requirement for a high concentration of BAPTA to block NMDAR-LTD is consistent with the idea that calmodulin is localized with NMDARs (Ehlers et al., 1996Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhadt J.P. Huganir R.L. Inactivation of NMDA receptors by direct interaction of calmodulin with the NR1 subunit.Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), where it is well placed to detect the Ca2+-permeating activated receptors. The greater sensitivity of mGluR-LTD to BAPTA plus its independence of calmodulin implies that a different Ca2+-signaling pathway is involved in this form of synaptic plasticity. Since mGlu5 receptors couple to phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), a prime candidate is the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Consistent with this mechanism, treatment with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; 10 μM), which depletes intracellular stores of their Ca2+, prevented LTD induced by 5 Hz stimulation (Figure 4A). Two neurons in the same slice were recorded from simultaneously, one with an electrode containing CPA and the other containing the control pipette solution. CPA consistently blocked the induction of LTD induced by 5 Hz stimulation (CPA, 102% ± 8%; control, 63% ± 4%, n = 5) (Figure 4A). Surprisingly, however, CPA also blocked LTD induced by 1 Hz stimulation (CPA, 96% ± 4% of baseline; control, 65% ± 7% of baseline, n = 5) (Figure 4B). To exclude a possible off-target effect of CPA, we also tested ryanodine, which depletes Ca2+ from intracellular stores by inducing a low-conductance state of the receptor. Ryanodine similarly blocked both forms of LTD (5 Hz ryanodine, 99% ± 4%; 5 Hz control, 64% ± 8%, n = 6) (Figure 4C) (1 Hz ryanodine, 99% ± 5%; 1 Hz control, 61% ± 7%, n = 6) (Figure 4D). The release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores can be triggered by Ca2+ and/or by IP3. To determine whether IP3 is involved in either form of LTD, we used 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) in dual-patch experiments. We found that 2-APB selectively blocked mGluR-LTD (5 Hz 2-APB, 96% ± 3%; 5 Hz control, 68% ± 5% of baseline, n = 5) (Figure 4E) (1 Hz 2-APB, 66% ± 3%; control, 65% ± 3%, n = 5) (Figure 4F). Therefore, both NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD, in the perirhinal cortex, require the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores for their induction, but mGluR-LTD has a specific requirement for IP3. The sensitivity of both NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD to CPA and ryanodine suggests that Ca2+ is released from intracellular stores in response to the synaptic activation of both NMDARs and mGluRs. Therefore, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores cannot be a specific induction signal for mGluR-LTD. This raises the question as to whether there are signaling mechanisms that are specific for mGluR-LTD. Since PLC-coupled receptors also can activate PKC, we next compared the role of PKC in both forms of LTD. Consistent with our previous study (Jo et al., 2006Jo J. Ball S.M. Seok H. Oh S.B. Massey P.V. Molnar E. Bashir Z.I. Cho K. Experience-dependent modification of mechanisms of long-term depression.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the PKC inhibitory peptide PKC19-31 (10 μM) blocked the induction of mGluR-LTD. Here, we show that, in the same neurons, NMDAR-LTD was readily induced (5 Hz, 97% ± 4%; 1 Hz, 58% ± 8%, n = 5) (Figure 5A). Furthermore, using simultaneous dual-patch-clamp recording from neurons within the same slice, mGluR-LTD was blocked in cells loaded with the PKC19-31 (10 μM) but was readily induced in cells loaded with normal filling solution (PKC19-31, 95% ± 8%; control, 60% ± 6%, n = 4) (Figure 5B). Similar results were obtained using a different PKC inhibitor, {(S)-3-[8-(dimethylaminomethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyridol[1,2-a]indol-10-yl]-4-(1-methyl-3-indolyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione hydrochloride} (Ro 32-0432). Thus, Ro 32-0432 blocked mGluR-LTD, but not NMDAR-LTD, tested in the same neurons (5 Hz, 101% ± 2%; 1 Hz, 61% ± 8%, n = 6) (Figure 5C), and it also blocked mGluR-LTD tested in dual-patch experiments (Ro 32-0432, 99% ± 6%; control, 61% ± 8%, n = 6) (Figure 5D). These data show that PKC is involved in mGluR-LTD, but not NMDAR-LTD, in the perirhinal cortex. PICK1 interacts directly with the GluR2 subunit of AMPARs (Dev et al., 1999Dev K.K. Nishimune A.

Using simultaneous dual-patch-clamp recording from neurons within the same slice, mGluR-LTD was blocked in cells loaded with pep2-EVKI (100 μM) but was readily induced in cells loaded with pep2-SVKE (100 μM) (pep2-EVKI, 97% ± 6%; pep2-SVKE, 62% ± 7%, n = 5) (Figure 5E). In contrast, pep2-EVKI and pep2-SVKE had no effect on NMDAR-LTD (pep2-EVKI, 58% ± 4%; pep2-SVKE, 56% ± 6%, n = 5) (Figure 5F). Thus, mGluR-LTD can also be distinguished from NMDAR-LTD on the basis of its dependence on AMPAR C-terminal PDZ interactions that are likely mediated by PICK1. Recently, Palmer et al. demonstrated that hippocalcin is involved in NMDAR-LTD in the hippocampus (Palmer et al., 2005Palmer C.L. Lim W. Hastie P.G. Toward M. Korolchuk V.I. Burbidge S.A. Banting G.

However, since hippocalcin is highly expressed in the hippocampus but has a limited expression in other cortical regions (Saitoh et al., 1993Saitoh S. Takamatsu K. Kobayashi M. Noguichi T. Distribution of hippocalcin mRNA and immunoreactivity in rat brain.Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 157: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Paterlini et al., 2000Paterlini M. Revilla V. Grant A.L. Wisden W. Expression of the neuronal calcium sensor protein family in the rat brain.Neuroscience. 2000; 99: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we tested for the involvement of the related neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1). Like hippocalcin, NCS-1 also has a high affinity for Ca2+ but has a much more widespread distribution. First, we confirmed that NCS-1 is present in brain lysates from perirhinal cortical tissue (Figure 6A). Next, we examined the role of NCS-1 in LTD induced by both 1 Hz and 5 Hz stimulation using a dominant-negative mutant of NCS-1 (DN-NCS-1; E120Q), which has a point mutation in one of the high-affinity Ca2+-binding EF3-hand regions (Weiss et al., 2000Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. NCS-1 functions in a pathway regulating Ca2+ channels in adrenal chromaffin cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Inclusion of recombinant myristoylated DN-NCS-1 (40 nM) in the pipette solution had no effect on the basal amplitude of EPSCs. In the presence of DN-NCS-1, mGluR-LTD was blocked, but subsequent NMDAR-LTD was readily induced in the same neurons (5 Hz, 108% ± 8%; 1 Hz, 77% ± 9%, n = 6 [p < 0.001]) (Figure 6B). It is unlikely that inhibiting NCS-1 simply raised the threshold for inducing mGluR-LTD since 5 Hz stimulation still failed to induce LTD in the presence of DN-NCS-1 when the number of stimuli were doubled (99% ± 4%, n = 3; data not shown). In contrast to the dominant-negative, postsynaptic infusion of recombinant myristoylated wild-type NCS-1 (WT-NCS-1; 40 nM) had no effect on baseline synaptic transmission or on either form of LTD (5 Hz, 59% ± 10%, n = 6 [p < 0.001]; 1 Hz, 69% ± 7%"

Since the divergence of human and chimpanzee lineages, these elements have vigorously created chromosomal rearrangements causing genomic difference between humans and chimpanzees by either increasing or decreasing the size of genome. Here, we report an exotic mechanism, retrotransposon recombination-mediated inversion (RRMI), that usually does not alter the amount of genomic material present. Through the comparison of the human and chimpanzee draft genome sequences, we identified 252 inversions whose respective inversion junctions can clearly be characterized. Our results suggest that L1 and Alu elements cause chromosomal inversions by either forming a secondary structure or providing a fragile site for double-strand breaks. The detailed analysis of the inversion breakpoints showed that L1 and Alu elements are responsible for at least 44% of the 252 inversion loci between human and chimpanzee lineages, including 49 RRMI loci. Among them, three RRMI loci inverted exonic regions in known genes, which implicates this mechanism in generating the genomic and phenotypic differences between human and chimpanzee lineages. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of mobile element bases inversion breakpoints between human and chimpanzee lineages, and highlights their role in primate genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2163074265,"We show that multiple suboptimal splice sites underlie the thermal-sensitive splicing of the period (per) 3'-terminal intron (dmpi8) from D. melanogaster, enabling this species to prolong its midday ""siesta,"" a mechanism that likely diminishes the deleterious effects of heat during the longer summer days in temperate climates. In D. yakuba and D. santomea, which have a more ancestral distribution indigenous to Afro-equatorial regions wherein day length and temperature exhibit little fluctuation throughout the year, the splicing efficiencies of their per 3'-terminal introns do not exhibit thermal calibration, consistent with the little effect of temperature on the daily distribution of activity in these species. We propose that the weak splice sites on dmpi8 underlie a mechanism that facilitated the acclimation of the widely colonized D. melanogaster (and possibly D. simulans) to temperate climates and that natural selection operating at the level of splicing signals plays an important role in the thermal adaptation of life forms."
https://openalex.org/W1981085577,"Presynaptic autoreceptors modulate transmitter release at many synapses. At the mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell (mf-CA3) synapse, two types of glutamatergic autoreceptors have been identified: transmitter release is reportedly suppressed by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and augmented by kainate receptors (KARs). However, the net effect of these autoreceptors when activated by endogenous glutamate is unknown. Here, we show that during low-frequency mossy fiber stimulation, glutamate acting through presynaptic mGluRs substantially suppresses transmitter release. However, using similar recording conditions, we find that presynaptic KARs are insufficient to facilitate transmitter release over a wide range of mossy fiber stimulus frequencies, indicating that the uniquely robust mf-CA3 short-term plasticity is KAR independent. Furthermore, we report that actions generally attributed to presynaptic KARs are likely due to activation of recurrent CA3 network activity. Thus, negative feedback via presynaptic mGluRs is the dominant mode of glutamatergic autoregulation at the mf-CA3 synapse."

The way in which the somatosensory cortex responds to these complex multivibrissal stimuli has not been explored. It is unclear yet whether contextual information from across the entire whisker pad influences cortical responses. Here, we delivered tactile stimuli to the rat vibrissae using a new 24 whisker stimulator. We tested sequences of rostrocaudal whisker deflections that generate multivibrissal motion patterns in different directions across the mystacial pad, allowing to disambiguate local from global sensory integration. Unitary electrophysiological recordings from different layers of the barrel cortex showed that a majority of neurons has direction selectivity for the multivibrissal stimulus. The selectivity resulted from nonlinear integration of responses across the mystacial pad. Our results indicate that the system extracts collective properties of a tactile scene."
https://openalex.org/W2045281865,"At hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-st. lucidum interneuron (SLIN) synapses, mGluR7 serves as a metaplastic switch controlling bidirectional plasticity. mGluR7 activation during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) triggers presynaptic LTD due to persistent P/Q-type Ca2+ channel inhibition. However, following mGluR7 internalization HFS produces presynaptic LTP. Surprisingly, LTP is not a simple molecular reversal of Ca2+ channel depression. Rather, mGluR7 activation/internalization controls plasticity polarity by gating cAMP sensitivity of release. While naive surface mGluR7 expressing MF-SLIN synapses are insensitive to cAMP elevation, synapses that have internalized mGluR7 robustly potentiate following cAMP increases. Moreover, MF-SLIN LTP requires adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) activities. We also discovered an association between mGluR7 and RIM1α, an active zone molecule required for AC/PKA-dependent presynaptic LTP. Importantly, the mGluR7-RIM1α interaction is regulated by mGluR7 activation, and mice lacking RIM1α are deficient in MF-SLIN LTP. We conclude that state-dependent cAMP sensitivity controlled by mGluR7-RIM1α interactions underlies MF-SLIN metaplasticity."

Using the calyx of Held, we demonstrate here a large presynaptic persistent Na+ current with unusually hyperpolarized activation voltage. This feature allowed the current to determine both the resting potential and resting conductance of the nerve terminal. Calyces express presynaptic glycine receptors whose activation depolarizes the synapse. We found that activation of the persistent Na+ current was an essential component in the response to glycine. This Na+ current originated at or very close to the terminal and was sustained even after trains of large spike-like depolarizations. Because Na+ channels also underlie the presynaptic action potential, we conclude that their action both triggers and modulates exocytosis through control of presynaptic membrane voltage."

Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and -1c are produced from the same gene by use of different promoters and alternative splicing. SREBP-1c activates predominantly genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthesis, whereas SREBP-2 activates primarily genes required for cholesterol synthesis. SREBPs are present as transcriptionally inactive precursor proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by their interaction with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which functions as a sterol sensor. In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi, where the SREBPs are processed proteolytically to generate their nuclear forms that activate SREBP target genes (6Horton J.D.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the lack of mature bile acids plays a role in the altered cholesterol homeostasis in peroxisome-deficient mice, control and PEX2-/- mice were fed a mixture of cholic and ursodeoxycholic acid daily by means of an orogastric tube feeding (13Keane M.H. Overmars H. Wikander T.M. Ferdinandusse S. Duran M. Wanders R.J.A. Faust P.L. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 982-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The effects on cholesterol levels and its biosynthesis and transcriptional regulatory controls were evaluated. Our studies demonstrate that BA feeding normalized cholesterol levels in liver and plasma of early postnatal PEX2-/- mice, but the activities, expression and protein levels of SREBP-2 pathway genes were still significantly up-regulated, indicating a persistently abnormal cholesterol homeostasis. In untreated and BA-fed PEX2-/- mice at postnatal day 36 (P36), liver cholesterol levels were normal, but SREBP-2 target genes remained induced. Therefore, cholesterol biosynthesis pathway abnormalities persist in peroxisome-deficient mice even when cholesterol balance is maintained. We propose a mechanism whereby activation of the hepatic ER unfolded protein response (UPR) in peroxisome deficiency leads to dysregulation of the endogenous sterol response mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals-Homozygous PEX2-/- mice were obtained by breeding PEX2 heterozygotes (Swiss Webster (SW)×129SvEv mouse genetic background) (14Faust P.L.

Mice had access to food and water ad libitum and were exposed to a 12-h light-dark cycle. For the purposes of this study, control mice consisted of either PEX2+/+ or PEX2+/- genotypes, as biochemical measures did not differ (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J.

Starting on P1, mice were fed a solution containing cholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid (Sigma), each at 3 mg/ml, in sterile 1.5% sodium carbonate. A 15 mg/kg daily dose of each bile acid was administered by orogastric gavage as described (13Keane M.H. Overmars H. Wikander T.M. Ferdinandusse S. Duran M. Wanders R.J.A. Faust P.L.

Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce).Western Blot Analysis-Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblot analysis was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the following antibodies: anti-HMGCR, anti-mevalonate kinase, anti-IDI1, anti-squalene synthase (BD Biosciences), and anti-SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat LS film (Rochester, NY), scanned on a densitometer (GE Healthcare) and analyzed with ImageQuant® software (Amersham Biosciences).Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR-Total RNA was prepared from frozen mouse tissues with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (DNA-free; Ambion, Austin, TX). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with random hexamer primers using Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (Amersham Biosciences). The real-time RT-PCR reaction was set up in a final volume of 20 μl using 2× LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Mastermix (Roche Diagnostics). PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using a Roche LightCycler 480.

The liver was post-fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline and either processed for paraffin embedding or cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for frozen section preparation. 2-4 μm of paraffin or 10 μm of frozen liver sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. For antigen retrieval of paraffin-embedded tissue, deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were digested with 0.01% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C followed by microwaving in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, three times for 5 min at 800 watts. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h, and sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-Grp78 (SC-1051; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG was applied for 2 h (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Negative control sections were incubated in parallel by omitting the primary antibody. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope.Statistical Analyses-Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated either by an unpaired Student’s t test or by ANOVA followed by Fisher’s least-squares difference post hoc test to compare four sample group means at each time.RESULTSPlasma Lipid Analysis of Bile Acid-fed Control and PEX2-/- Mice-We first investigated whether BA feeding changed the plasma lipid alterations seen in P10 untreated PEX2-/- mice, where total plasma cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were 0.57- and 0.27-fold the corresponding values of untreated controls, respectively (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). BA feeding normalized total plasma cholesterol level in PEX2-/- mice but did not alter the level in controls (Table 1). Plasma HDL cholesterol levels decreased with BA feeding in both control (65%) and PEX2-/- (55%) mice, resulting in a similar reduction of HDL cholesterol in mutants versus controls for both untreated (0.39-fold) and bile acid-fed (0.34-fold) PEX2-/- mice. BA feeding increased plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations 1.25- and 2.3-fold in control and PEX2-/- mice, respectively, as compared with untreated mice. Plasma triglyceride levels were similar in controls versus PEX2 mutants in either treatment group, although BA feeding increased triglyceride levels around 2.5-fold versus that in untreated mice for both genotypes (Table 1). Plasma phospholipids levels were reduced by 34% in untreated mutants and did not significantly change with BA feeding, whereas BAs reduced plasma phospholipids by 25% in control mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Plasma analysis of untreated and BA-fed control and PEX2 knock-out miceConcentrationAge/ParameterUntreated miceBile acid-fed miceControlPEX2−/−ControlPEX2−/−mg/dlP9-P10Total plasma cholesterol172.8 ± 31.9 (28)98.3 ± 30.0 (9)*#161.8 ± 34.3 (15)†168.7 ± 58.5 (12)†Plasma HDL cholesterol80.5 ± 28.8 (22)31.6 ± 18.8 (11)*33.8 ± 14.3 (14)*11.6 ± 6.7 (12)*#‡Plasma triglycerides88.8 ± 45.1 (40)83.5 ± 26.4 (13)#179.5 ± 81.4 (14)*†201.7 ± 61.7 (9)*†Plasma phospholipids412.1 ± 52.1 (31)273.9 ± 93.7 (11)*311.6 ± 30.8 (11)*321.9 ± 95.5 (8)*Plasma LDL cholesterol74.55092.1116.8P36Total plasma cholesterol121.4 ± 22.4 (10)222.0 ± 20.4 (2)*147.0 ± 23.1 (8)178.1 ± 47.1 (4) Open table in a new tab BA feeding enabled a subset of PEX2 mutants (∼10%) to survive past the early postnatal period (13Keane M.H. Overmars H. Wikander T.M. Ferdinandusse S. Duran M. Wanders R.J.A. Faust P.L. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 982-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the total plasma cholesterol level from two rare P36 untreated PEX2-/- mice was elevated 1.8-fold compared with that in controls (Table 1; p < 0.001), which contrasts markedly with the decreased level in early postnatal untreated mutants. BA feeding mildly increased total plasma cholesterol level in P36 control mice (p = 0.065 versus untreated controls) and again normalized it in P36 PEX2-/- mice.Hepatic Cholesterol Biosynthetic Enzyme Activities and Protein Levels Remain Increased after BA Feeding-We next examined the effect of BA feeding on the activities of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, including HMGCR, IDI1, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and squalene synthase, in the liver and kidney of P9 control and PEX2-/- mice. Although the activities of these enzymes were increased ∼10-18-fold in the liver of untreated PEX2-/- mice compared with control mice (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), BA feeding significantly attenuated, but did not completely normalize, these enzyme activities in PEX2-/- mice (Fig. 1). In the PEX2 mutants the fold increase in activity of HMGCR and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase changed from 10- to 1.6-fold, of IDI1 from 18- to 2.2-fold, and of squalene synthase from 10- to 3-fold. BA feeding did not alter the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme activities in control mice.We previously demonstrated a different regulatory pattern of cholesterol enzyme activities in PEX2-/- kidneys, with a 2-fold increase for farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and squalene synthase and a 42% decrease for HMGCR (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). BA feeding did not affect the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme activities in control and PEX2-/- kidneys (supplemental Table S1), leading to a similarly abnormal enzyme profile in BA-fed PEX2-/- mice.Western blot analysis of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes was performed to determine whether the measured activities were a reflection of the protein levels. HMGCR protein was still elevated 5.8-fold in livers of P9 BA-fed PEX2-/- mice (Fig. 2A; p < 0.001), which is greater than the 1.6-fold increase in HMGCR activity (Fig. 1B). Mevalonate kinase, IDI1, and squalene synthase protein levels also remained increased in BA-fed PEX2-/- mice (Fig. 2, A and B; p < 0.005).FIGURE 2A-C, immunoblot of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes in extract of livers of individual control and PEX2-/- mice at the indicated ages and treatment using 200 μg of total liver protein (A and C) or 50 μg liver microsomal fraction (B).

As in early postnatal mutants, HMCGR protein level was still increased about 5-fold in P36 BA-fed PEX2-/- mice. A significant increase in mevalonate kinase and IDI1 proteins was also observed in the livers of P36 untreated and BA-fed PEX2-/- mice (Fig. 2C). These data show a persistent elevation of cholesterol synthesis enzymes in P36 untreated PEX2-/- mice and attenuation with BA feeding similar to that seen in early postnatal mutants.Altered Catalytic Efficiency of Cholesterol Biosynthetic Enzymes in PEX2-/- Mice-Because enzyme activity measurements and immunoblots were done on the same liver samples, we normalized the specific activities to the enzyme protein content to obtain an estimate of “catalytic efficiency.” We demonstrated previously that the catalytic efficiency of HMGCR was decreased by 55% in P10 PEX2-/- mice (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In P9 BA-fed PEX2-/- mice, the catalytic efficiency of HMGCR was reduced by about 70% (p < 0.001) (Table 2) and thus was more severely affected in BA-fed PEX2-/- mice compared with untreated mutants (p < 0.05). The catalytic efficiency of IDI1 in P9 BA-fed PEX2-/- mice was decreased by ∼60%, similar to the 70% decrease seen in untreated PEX2 mutants (data not shown). These data illustrate that peroxisome deficiency consistently alters the catalytic efficiency of hepatic cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes in PEX2-/- mice, a decrement that may be exacerbated by BA feeding.TABLE 2Specific activity of HMGCR normalized to HMGCR protein content in the livers of P9 BA-fed control and PEX2−/− miceGenotypeSp. act.Vol. densitySp. act./vol. densityNormalized average sp. act./vol. densitypmol/min/mgper mg of proteinfmol/min+/+47.8217,437220+/+76.231,6048241+/+52.515,9508329+/+70.314,55114831.0 ± 0.4+/+98.726,3780374+/+41.022,7160180+/+47.729,6570161+/+43.626,8290163−/−105.588,1295120−/−99.791,6150109−/−118.4161,722273−/−80.2155,4749520.3 ± 0.1*−/−86.1112,203277−/−116.0137,488084−/−70.5103,421068−/−59.0126,089047 Open table in a new tab In Vivo Synthesis Rates of Sterols and Tissue Cholesterol Levels in BA-fed PEX2 Mice-To test the effect of BA feeding on cholesterol synthesis in vivo, we measured the rate of incorporation of subcutaneously injected [3H]acetate into nonsaponifiable lipids in various tissues of P9 control and PEX2-/- mice. Although the specific activity of cholesterol in livers of P7-P9 untreated PEX2-/- mice was 13-fold higher than in control mice (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), BA feeding reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis in PEX2-/- mice to control levels (Fig. 3A). Cholesterol specific activity in the spleen, heart, and lungs of BA-fed PEX2-/- mice was attenuated compared with that in untreated PEX2-/- mice (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) but was still significantly increased 1.8-fold (p < 0.05; p = 0.06 for spleen) compared with BA-fed control mice. In kidney, BA feeding did not affect the cholesterol synthesis rate in controls, and there was a similar 2-fold decreased rate in both the untreated and BA-fed PEX2-/- mice. Surprisingly, whereas cholesterol specific activity in the brain was 2.4-fold lower in untreated PEX2-/- versus control mice (12Kovacs W.J. Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), specific activity was normalized in PEX2-/- mice by BA feeding. These findings further emphasize that peroxisome deficiency and BA treatment differentially affect cholesterol synthesis in different organs.FIGURE 3Rate of cholesterol synthesis and concentration of cholesterol in various tissues of control and PEX2-/- mice.

In addition to normalizing total plasma cholesterol in early postnatal PEX2-/- mice (Table 1), BA feeding also corrected the 40% decrease in hepatic total cholesterol (Fig. 3, B and C) (12Kovacs W.J.

Shackelford J.E. Tape K.N. Richards M.J. Faust P.L. Fliesler S.J. Krisans S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fecal cholesterol content increased 1.7-fold in P9 BA-fed control mice (Fig. 3D), which may reflect feeding with unconjugated bile acids that are less efficient for cholesterol absorption. BA feeding of PEX2 mutants increased fecal cholesterol by 3.3-fold, leading to a level similar to that seen in BA-fed controls. In sum, these findings demonstrate that BA replenishment dramatically improved cholesterol homeostasis in early postnatal PEX2-/- mice.Unexpectedly, the hepatic cholesterol level was similar in P36 untreated PEX2-/- and control mice, which may have been enabled by these older mutants obtaining small amounts of BAs through coprophagy. Despite the normal hepatic cholesterol content in the P36 untreated PEX2 mutant, bile cholesterol level was decreased 0.5-fold (Fig. 3E). Thus, the increased total plasma cholesterol level in P36 untreated mutants (Table 1) reflects this defect in hepatic cholesterol excretion into bile. In all of the P36 BA-fed mice, the hepatic and biliary cholesterol level was significantly increased compared with that in untreated mice (Fig. 3, C and E) and was similar between controls and PEX2 mutants. Interestingly, although P36 BA-fed PEX2 mutants can increase bile cholesterol content to control levels, biliary BA concentration is still markedly deficient (13Keane M.H. Overmars H. Wikander T.M.

https://openalex.org/W2011248166,"Vinculin is a highly conserved and abundant cytoskeletal protein involved in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane at sites of cellular adhesion. At these sites of adhesion, vinculin plays a role in physiological processes such as cell motility, migration, development, and wound healing. Loss of normal vinculin function has been associated with cancer phenotypes, cardiovascular disease, and lethal errors in embryogenesis. The tail domain of vinculin (Vt) binds to acidic phospholipids and has been proposed to play a role in vinculin activation and focal adhesion turnover. To better characterize Vt-lipid specificity, we conducted a series of lipid co-sedimentation experiments and find that Vt shows specific association with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), compared with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), or phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the context of mixed lipid vesicles. The C terminus of Vt has been proposed to be important for PIP2 association, as various mutations and deletions within the C-terminal reduce PIP2 association. Lipid co-sedimentation and NMR analyses indicate that removal of the hydrophobic hairpin does not alter Vt structure or PIP2 association. However, more extensive deletions within the C-terminal introduce Vt structural perturbations and reduce PIP2 binding. Intriguingly, a significant increase in PIP2 binding was observed for multiple Vt variants that perturb interactions between the N-terminal strap and helix bundle, suggesting that a rearrangement of this N-terminal strap may be required for PIP2 binding."
https://openalex.org/W2031836217,"Fatty acid transport protein (FATP) is an evolutionarily conserved membrane-bound protein that facilitates the uptake of extracellular long chain fatty acids. In humans and mice, six FATP isoforms have been identified and their tissue-specific distributions suggest that each plays a discrete role in lipid metabolism in association with fatty acid uptake. While the presence of FATP homologs in insects has been demonstrated, their functional role remains to be characterized. Pheromonogenesis is defined as the dynamic period in which all machinery required for sex pheromone biosynthesis is generated and organized within the pheromone gland (PG) cells. By exploiting this unique system in the PG of the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, we found that BmFATP is predominantly expressed in the PG and undergoes up-regulation 1 day prior to eclosion. Before eclosion, B. mori PG cells accumulate cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs), which play a role in storing the pheromone (bombykol) precursor fatty acid in the form of triacylglycerol. RNAi-mediated gene silencing of BmFATP in vivo significantly suppressed LD accumulation by preventing the synthesis of triacylglycerols and resulted in a significant reduction in bombykol production. These results, in conjunction with the findings that BmFATP stimulates the uptake of extracellular long-chain fatty acids and BmFATP knockdown reduces cellular long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity, suggest that BmFATP plays an essential role in bombykol biosynthesis by stimulating both LD accumulation and triacylglycerol synthesis via a process called vectorial acylation that couples the uptake of extracellular fatty acids with activation to CoA thioesters during pheromonogenesis.

Insect Pheromone Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Academic Press, Oxford, UK2003: 53-80Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Rafaeli A. Int. Rev.

Biol. 1999; 29: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying sex pheromone production in moth PG cells have remained poorly understood. The PG of the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, originates from the intersegmental membrane between the eighth and ninth abdominal segments and can be characterized as a pair of eversible, ventrolateral sacs (sacculi laterales) consisting of about 10,000 single-layered epidermal cells that are in direct contact with the overlying cuticular surface (4Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Okano K. Tatsuki S. Maeda S. Matsumoto S. J. Insect. Physiol. 2000; 46: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These cells produce and release the principle sex pheromone component bombykol, (E,Z)-10,12-hexadecadien-1-ol, which is synthesized de novo via acetyl-CoA derived palmitate (16:Acyl) by the sequential actions of a bifunctional Δ10,12-desaturase and a fatty-acyl reductase, both of which have been recently characterized as Bmpgdesat1 and PG-specific fatty acyl reductase (pgFAR), respectively (5Ando T.

Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9156-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As with most lepidopteran sex pheromone biosyntheses (2Rafaeli A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 49-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Rafaeli A. Jurenka R.A. Insect Pheromone Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Academic Press, Oxford, UK2003: 107-136Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), bombykol biosynthesis is triggered by a molecular interaction between the neurohormone, pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN), and its cognate PG cell-surface receptor, the PBAN receptor (PBANR), which has also recently been characterized as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that belongs to the neuromedin U receptor family (9Choi M.Y.

Peptides. 2008; 29: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Pheromonogenesis can be defined as the dynamic period in which all machinery required for sex pheromone biosynthesis is generated and organized within the PG cells of the female moth before and after eclosion (12Matumoto S. Hull J.J. Ohnishi A. Moto K. Fónagy A. J. Insect. Physiol. 2007; 53: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Before eclosion, bombykol-producing cells can be characterized by the abundance of lipid droplets (LDs) within the cytoplasm; these LDs begin to form one or 2 days prior to eclosion and they rapidly accumulate on the day of eclosion. In contrast, the density of the LDs decreases in response to PBAN stimulation after eclosion (4Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Okano K. Tatsuki S. Maeda S. Matsumoto S. J. Insect. Physiol. 2000; 46: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Matsumoto S. Arthropod. Struct. Dev. 2001; 30: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the chemical composition of the LDs and confirmed that they are composed of various triacylglycerols (TGs) with the bombykol precursor, Δ10, 12-hexadecadienoate, predominantly sequestered as a major component at the sn-1 and/or sn-3 position of the glycerides, indicating that the LDs play an essential role in storing the bombykol precursor in the form of TGs and releasing it for bombykol production in response to PBAN stimulation (14Matsumoto S. Fónagy A. Yamamoto M. Wang F. Yokoyama N. Esumi Y. Suzuki Y. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently established a method for targeted disruption of B. mori PG-specific genes in vivo by the use of RNA interference (RNAi) and have successfully demonstrated that loss of function of the PG-specific acyl-CoA-binding protein (pgACBP) prevents LD accumulation, and consequently, limits the availability of the bombykol precursors (15Ohnishi A. Hull J.J. Matsumoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4398-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms underlying LD accumulation in the PG cells prior to eclosion have yet to be characterized. Fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs) belong to an evolutionarily conserved family of membrane-bound proteins that facilitate the uptake of extracellular long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and/or very LCFAs and catalyze the ATP-dependent esterification of these fatty acids to their corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives (16Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In humans and rodents, six related members of FATPs (FATP1 to FATP6) have been identified and their tissue expression patterns have been analyzed (18Stahl A. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although FATP homologs are also present in several insect species (17Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Doege H. Stahl A. Physiology. 2006; 21: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), their functional role has yet to be characterized. To identify and characterize functional proteins involved in the pheromonogenesis of the silkmoth, B. mori, we have generated a PG expressed-sequence tag (EST) data base by constructing a normalized PG cDNA library prepared from newly emerged female moths of the inbred B. mori strain (p50) (20Yoshiga T. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Matsumoto S. Gene. 2000; 246: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the course of expression analyses of these EST clones using various tissues as well as PGs isolated during different developmental stages, we found that a gene encoding a FATP homolog in B. mori (BmFATP) is predominantly expressed in the PG. In this study, we sought to examine the functional role of BmFATP in B. mori pheromonogenesis. Insects—Larvae of the inbred p50 strain of B. mori, kindly provided by T. Shimada of the University of Tokyo, were reared on mulberry leaves and maintained under a 16L:8D photoperiod at 25 °C. Pupal age was distinguished based on morphological characteristics as described (14Matsumoto S. Fónagy A. Yamamoto M. Wang F. Yokoyama N. Esumi Y. Suzuki Y. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rapid Amplifying cDNA Ends (RACE)—Messenger RNA was isolated from about 100 μg of PG total RNA by using a Micro-Fast Track kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RACE was performed using a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Computer-assisted sequence analyses were performed using GENETYX-MAC Ver.12.0 (Software Development Co., Tokyo, Japan). RT-PCR Analysis—PGs and other tissues were dissected into insect Ringer's solution (35 mm NaCl, 36 mm KCl, 12 mm CaCl2, 16 mm MgCl2, 274 mm glucose, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and mechanically trimmed as described (21Ozawa R. Matsumoto S. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from the trimmed PGs by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using an RNA PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 500 ng of total RNA. Fragments of BmFATP were amplified from oligonucleotide primer pairs designed from published sequences (NRPG1860-F1 [sense primer]: 5′-TATACACGTCAGGGACTACTG-3′ and NRPG1860-R1 [antisense primer]: 5′-TTCAACTCCTAAGGGCACGT-3′). PCR was performed under the conditions of 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s. After PCR, 5 μl of the PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel in TAE buffer. Synthesis and Injection of dsRNA—The templates for synthesis of dsRNAs corresponding to BmFATP were prepared using gene-specific primers containing T7 polymerase sites (NRPG1860T7-F1 [sense primer]: 5′-CCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGGTATACACGTCAGGGA-3′ and NRPG1860T7-R1 [antisense primer]: 5′-CCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGGTTCAACTCCTAAGGG-3′; nucleotide sequences corresponding to the T7 promoter region are underlined). PCR was performed under the conditions of 6 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56.5 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 90 s followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 90 s using KOD-Plus-(Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with the resulting products purified (Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up kit, Promega, Madison, WI) and used as templates to generate dsRNAs using the AmpliScribe™ T7 High Yield Transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After synthesis, the dsRNAs were diluted with diethyl pyrocarbonate-(DEPC-)treated H2O, the RNA concentrations measured (A260), and the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to confirm annealing. Samples were diluted to the desired concentration (final volume 2 μl) and injected near the abdominal tip of 1-day-old pupae (i.e. pupae 1 day removed from the larval-pupal molt) using a 10-μl microsyringe (Hamilton). Control pupae were injected with 2 μl of DEPC-treated H2O alone. After injection, pupae were maintained under normal conditions until adult emergence. In Vivo Bombykol Analysis—Adult females were decapitated within 3 h of emergence and maintained at 25 °C for 24 h. They were then injected with either 5 pmol (2 μl) B. mori PBAN in PBS or PBS alone. Abdominal tips were dissected 90 min after injection and bombykol production was measured by HPLC as described (23Matsumoto S. Kitamura A. Nagasawa H. Kataoka H. Orikasa C. Mitsui T. Suzuki A. J. Insect. Physiol. 1990; 36: 427-432Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) using a Senshu-Pac NO2 column (Senshu Scientific Co., Tokyo, Japan). Microscopic Examination of Cytoplasmic Lipid Droplets—Abdominal tips were dissected and mechanically trimmed from normal, decapitated, or RNAi-treated females. The excised glands were fixed with a 4% formalin/PBS solution and stained with Nile Red (a fluorescent probe for intracellular neutral lipids; Molecular Probes Inc. Eugene, OR) as described (13Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Matsumoto S. Arthropod. Struct. Dev. 2001; 30: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an OLYMPUS BX-60 system equipped with a PM-30 exposure unit and a BH20-RFL-T3 light source (400× magnification). Nile Red imaging was performed with a 330–385-nm band pass excitation filter, a 400-nm dichroic mirror, and a 420-nm long pass barrier filter (OLYMPUS cube WU). Images were processed and merged using Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Analysis of Lipid Droplet Components—Five trimmed PGs were prepared from the desired stages of female moths and dipped in 100 μl of acetone for 10 min at room temperature. The dried acetone extracts were dissolved in n-hexane and loaded on either a Senshu-Pak PEGASIL-Silica 120–5 column (Senshu Sci. Co.; 4.6 mm i.d. × 250 mm, pore size: 120 Å) equilibrated with n-hexane/acetic acid (99/1) or a SSC-C22 docosil column (Senshu Sci. Co.; 4.6 mm i.d. × 250 mm, pore size: 120 Å) equilibrated with acetonitrile/ethanol (6/4). TG components were separated as described previously (14Matsumoto S. Fónagy A. Yamamoto M. Wang F. Yokoyama N. Esumi Y. Suzuki Y. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and detected using an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD; SEDEX model 75, Sedere, France). Fatty acyl groups in the TGs were identified with Fast Atom Bombardment mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS (MS-MS) analyses using a JEOL (Tokyo, Japan) JMS HX/HX-110A tandem mass spectrometer as described (14Matsumoto S. Fónagy A. Yamamoto M. Wang F. Yokoyama N. Esumi Y. Suzuki Y. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analysis of Cellular Fatty Acid Uptake using the Fluorescent Fatty Acid BODIPY 500/510 C1,C12—Trimmed PGs were prepared from normal or RNAi-treated females 12 h after eclosion and maintained at room temperature for 2 h in insect Ringer's solution. The PGs were then incubated with 5 μm BODIPY 500/510 C1,C12 (4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-sindacene-3-dodecanoic acid, Molecular Probes, D3823) in 50 μl of insect Ringer's solution for 10 min in the dark. After incubation, the PGs were washed twice with PBS containing 15 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and then with PBS alone (24Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at room temperature. Incorporation of BODIPY 500/510 C1,C12 was visualized on an OLYMPUS BX-60 system equipped with a PM-30 exposure unit and a BH20-RFL-T3 light source (400× magnification). Fluorescent imaging was performed with a 330–385-nm band pass excitation filter, a 400-nm dichroic mirror, and a 420-nm long pass barrier filter. Images were processed and merged using Photoshop CS. Measurement of Radiolabeled Fatty Acid Uptake—Rates of fatty acid transport were determined essentially as described by DiRusso et al. (25DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (47.7 Ci/mmol) and [9,10-3H]oleic acid (45.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Each trimmed PG, prepared from either a normal or RNAi-treated female moth 12 h after eclosion, was preincubated for 2 h at room temperature in 250 μl of insect Ringer's solution containing 15 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and the assay was initiated by the addition of 80 nm [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]oleic acid. After incubation, each PG was washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Brji 58, lysed with 200 μl 0.3 n NaOH, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Measurement of Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACS) Activity—Fatty ACS activity was assayed based on the conversion of [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]oleic acid to their CoA derivatives using a modified method from Hall et al. (16Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Each PG prepared from normal or RNAi-treated females 12 h after eclosion was homogenized in 25 μl of 30 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The homogenate was then incubated at 30 °C for 5 min with 250 μl of 30 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 nm 3H-labeled fatty acid, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm CoA, and 200 μm dithiothreitol. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 1.25 ml of isopropanol:heptane: H2SO4 (40:10:1, v/v/v), 0.5 ml H2O, and 0.75 ml of heptane to facilitate organic phase separation. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with 0.75 ml of heptane to remove unreacted fatty acids, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid phase scintillation counting. Cloning of the Bombyx mori FATP Gene (BmFATP) Expressed in the PG—We found a cDNA clone expressed in the PG that encodes the FATP homolog in B. mori, which we have designated as BmFATP. This clone (NRPG1860) is present in the B. mori PG EST data base, which was constructed from our normalized p50 PG cDNA library (20Yoshiga T. Okano K. Mita K. Shimada T. Matsumoto S. Gene. 2000; 246: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and then integrated into the public B. mori EST data base (SilkBase). Subsequent RT-PCR amplification and both 3′- and 5′-RACE of NRPG1860 indicated that BmFATP is comprised of a 2,094-nt open reading frame encoding a 698 amino acid protein flanked by a 233-nt 5′-UTR and a 851-nt 3′-UTR. Comparison of the BmFATP sequence with sequences from other organisms revealed high similarities with the Apis mellifera FATP, Anopheles gambiae FATP, Drosophila melanogaster FATP, Mus musculus FATP4, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fat1p (55, 54, 53, 42, and 29% similarity, respectively) (Fig. 1). These FATPs, including BmFATP, can be characterized by two highly conserved sequences, the ATP/AMP signature motif common to the adenylate-forming enzymes and the FATP/VLACS signature motif (24Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Two studies have described the topology of the FATPs, one for murine FATP1 (26Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the second for yeast Fat1p (27Obermeyer T. Fraisl P. DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2354-2364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis of BmFATP with the membrane protein structure prediction program SOSUI revealed that BmFATP contains two possible N-terminal transmembrane domains (amino acid residues 42–64 and 68–90) (data not shown), suggesting that the BmFATP more closely resembles that found in yeast. The yeast Fat1p has two transmembrane-spanning domains, and experimental data have suggested that both N- and C-terminal regions are positioned on the inner face of the plasma membrane, with the ATP/AMP and FATP/VLACS domains of Fat1p facing the cytoplasm (27Obermeyer T. Fraisl P. DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2354-2364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A search for FATP gene homologs in the public B. mori genome data base (Silkworm Genome Database) suggested that the BmFATP is a single-copy gene. Expression Analyses of BmFATP using RT-PCR—To examine the tissue distribution of the BmFATP transcript, we performed RT-PCR analyses using various tissues prepared from p50 female adults and larvae (Fig. 2). In adult tissues prepared 3 h after eclosion, we found that the BmFATP transcript was predominantly expressed in the PG with a less intense signal detectable in other tissues including midgut and fat body (Fig. 2A). Stage-specific expression of BmFATP within the PG indicated that it undergoes significant up-regulation 1 day prior to adult emergence (Fig. 2B). This up-regulation in the PG is reminiscent of PG-specific proteins crucial to B. mori pheromonogenesis, i.e. pgFAR, Bmpgdesat1, pgACBP, mgACBP, and PBANR (6Moto K. Suzuki M.G. Hull J.J. Kurata R.

Accordingly, these results suggest the functional involvement of BmFATP in B. mori pheromonogenesis as well. Apart from expression in the PG, we also found the BmFATP transcript prominently expressed in the larval midgut and fat body (Fig. 2C). In addition, a weak but steady signal was detected in the larval brain and silk gland (Fig. 2C). RNAi-mediated Knockdown of BmFATP Transcripts in Vivo: Effect on Bombykol Production—We have recently established a method for RNAi-mediated knockdown of B. mori PG-specific genes in vivo (15Ohnishi A. Hull J.J. Matsumoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4398-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To elucidate the in vivo function of the BmFATP in the PG during pheromonogenesis, we synthesized double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to the open reading frame of BmFATP and examined its inhibitory effect on bombykol production in vivo by using our RNAi protocol (15Ohnishi A. Hull J.J. Matsumoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4398-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When we injected 10 μg of dsRNA for BmFATP into 1-day-old p50 female pupae (i.e. pupae 1 day removed from the larval-pupal molt), BmFATP mRNA levels in the PG after eclosion were prominently reduced compared with the control pupae injected with DEPC-treated H2O (Fig. 3A). In addition, because injection of the BmFATP dsRNA had no effect on pupal development or on adult emergence, we next injected varying concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μg) of the same dsRNA into 1-day-old female pupae. To assess the effects of BmFATP knockdown on bombykol production, the newly emerged female moths were decapitated, injected with 5 pmol of synthetic PBAN, and the amount of bombykol in the PGs measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3B, a significant dose-dependent reduction in bombykol production was achieved; injections of 1, 5, and 10 μg dsRNA corresponding to BmFATP elicited 11%, 28%, and 44% reduction, respectively. Because no decrease in bombykol production was observed in the control pupae injected with dsRNA corresponding to enhanced GFP (data not shown), these results indicate that disruption of bombykol production was specific to the dsRNA sequence. RNAi-mediated Knockdown of BmFATP Transcripts in Vivo: Effect on Cytoplasmic LD Dynamics—The most obvious characteristic feature of bombykol-producing cells is the abundance of LDs within the cytoplasm (4Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Okano K. Tatsuki S. Maeda S. Matsumoto S. J. Insect. Physiol. 2000; 46: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Matsumoto S. Arthropod. Struct. Dev. 2001; 30: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The role of the LDs in bombykol biosynthesis is to store the bombykol precursor fatty acid in the form of TGs and release it in response to the external signal of PBAN (14Matsumoto S. Fónagy A. Yamamoto M. Wang F. Yokoyama N. Esumi Y. Suzuki Y. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To monitor the LD dynamics during pheromonogenesis, we have previously stained the LDs with the fluorescent lipid marker, Nile Red, and found that they appear 1 to 2 days before eclosion, rapidly accumulate on the day of eclosion, and decrease in size and number after eclosion in response to PBAN (13Fónagy A. Yokoyama N. Matsumoto S. Arthropod. Struct. Dev. 2001; 30: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we further examined the effects of BmFATP RNAi on the LD dynamics during pheromonogenesis (Fig. 4). As expected in the non-RNAi-treated control, Nile Red staining revealed that female moths decapitated immediately after eclosion accumulated numerous LDs in the PG, subsequent PBAN injection caused a striking reduction of the size and number in the LDs (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, PGs of female moths treated with BmFATP dsRNA accumulated noticeably smaller LDs (Fig. 4C). This result was further confirmed by measuring the total amounts of TGs in the PGs using normal-phase HPLC on a PEGASIL-Silica column (Fig. 5). In the BmFATP knockdown PG, the overall TG content after decapitation was reduced ∼35% compared with the normal PG (Fig. 5, A and C). Taken together, these results indicate that BmFATP plays an essential role in LD accumulatio"
https://openalex.org/W2080684797,"The orphan nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI) plays key roles in development and homeostasis. A tandem affinity purification procedure revealed that COUP-TFI associated with a number of transcriptional regulatory proteins in HeLa S3 cells, including the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), TIF1beta/KAP-1, HDAC1, and the SWI/SNF family member Brahma. The proapoptotic protein DBC1 was also identified in COUP-TFI complexes. In vitro experiments revealed that COUP-TFI interacted directly with NCoR but in a manner different from that of other nuclear receptors. DBC1 stabilized the interaction between COUP-TFI and NCoR by interacting directly with both proteins. The gene encoding the anti-apoptotic protein TNFAIP8 (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced protein 8) was identified as being repressed by COUP-TFI in a manner that required several of the component proteins of the COUP-TFI complex. Finally, our studies highlight a central role for COUP-TFI in the induction of the TNFAIP8 promoter by TNFalpha. Together, these studies identify a novel COUP-TFI complex that functions as a repressor of transcription and may play a role in the TNFalpha signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2092951247,"Hensin is a rabbit ortholog of DMBT1, a multifunctional, multidomain protein implicated in the regulation of epithelial differentiation, innate immunity, and tumorigenesis. Hensin in the extracellular matrix (ECM) induced morphological changes characteristic of terminal differentiation in a clonal cell line (clone C) of rabbit kidney intercalated cells. Although hensin is secreted in monomeric and various oligomeric forms, only the polymerized ECM form is able to induce these phenotypic changes. Here we report that hensin secretion and matrix assembly were inhibited by the peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and a derivative of cyclosporin A with modifications in the d-Ser side chain (Cs9) but not by the calcineurin pathway inhibitor FK506. PPIase inhibition led to failure of hensin polymerization in the medium and ECM, plus the loss of apical cytoskeleton, apical microvilli, and the columnar epithelial shape of clone C cells. Cyclophilin A was produced and secreted into the media to a much greater extent than cyclophilins B and C. Our results also identified the direct CsA-sensitive interaction of cyclophilin A with hensin, suggesting that cyclophilin A is the PPIase that mediates the polymerization and matrix assembly of hensin. These results are significant because this is the first time a direct role of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity has been implicated in the process of epithelial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2081220359,"Genome integrity is maintained during DNA replication by coordination of various replisome-regulated processes. Although it is known that Timeless (Tim) is a replisome component that participates in replication checkpoint responses to genotoxic stress, its importance for genome maintenance during normal DNA synthesis has not been reported. Here we demonstrate that Tim reduction leads to genomic instability during unperturbed DNA replication, culminating in increased chromatid breaks and translocations (triradials, quadriradials, and fusions). Tim deficiency led to increased H2AX phosphorylation and Rad51 and Rad52 foci formation selectively during DNA synthesis and caused a 3-4-fold increase in sister chromatid exchange. The sister chromatid exchange events stimulated by Tim reduction were largely mediated via a Brca2/Rad51-dependent mechanism and were additively increased by deletion of the Blm helicase. Therefore, Tim deficiency leads to an increased reliance on homologous recombination for proper continuation of DNA synthesis. Together, these results indicate a pivotal role for Tim in maintaining genome stability throughout normal DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2052992525,"Previous studies from our group have shown that the expression levels of Orc6 were highly elevated in colorectal cancer patient specimens and the induction of Orc6 was associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. The goal of this study was to investigate the molecular and cellular impact of Orc6 in colon cancer. In this study, we use HCT116 (wt-p53) and HCT116 (null-p53) colon cancer cell lines as a model system to investigate the impact of Orc6 on cell proliferation, chemosensitivity and pathways involved with Orc6. We demonstrated that the down regulation of Orc6 sensitizes colon cancer cells to both 5-FU and cisplatin (cis-pt) treatment. Decreased Orc6 expression in HCT-116 (wt-p53) cells by RNA interference triggered cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Prolonged inhibition of Orc6 expression resulted in multinucleated cells in HCT-116 (wt-p53) cell line. Western immunoblot analysis showed that down regulation of Orc6 induced p21 expression in HCT-116 (wt-p53) cells. The induction of p21 was mediated by increased level of phosphorylated p53 at ser-15. By contrast, there is no elevated expression of p21 in HCT-116 (null-p53) cells. Orc6 down regulation also increased the expression of DNA damaging repair protein GADD45β and reduced the expression level of JNK1. Orc6 may be a potential novel target for future anti cancer therapeutic development in colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1972860810,"The one or more underlying mechanisms of the tumor suppressing activity of the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) are not well defined. In this study we found that HINT1 regulates cellular levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 through multiple mechanisms. Increased expression of HINT1 increases cellular levels of p27KIP1, and HINT1 knockdown with small hairpin RNA leads to decreased cellular levels of p27KIP1. HINT1 does not affect the transcription of p27KIP1, but it does inhibit proteasomal degradation of the p27KIP1 protein. HINT1 directly interacts with the SCFSKP2 ubiquitin ligase complex and inhibits the ubiquitylation of p27KIP1. Src has been shown to phosphorylate p27KIP1 and thus decrease its stability. We found that HINT1 is a negative regulator of Src transcription apparently by forming a complex with the transcription factor Sp1 on the promoter of Src. Taken together, our findings indicate that HINT1 up-regulates cellular levels of p27KIP1 by two mechanisms: 1) it inhibits its ubiquitylation by targeting the SCFSKP2 ubiquitin ligase complex, and 2) it inhibits the phosphorylation of p27KIP1 by Src via inhibiting Src expression.

HINT1 belongs to the Hint branch of the HIT (histidine triad) protein family, which is a superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases that contain an HXHXHXX motif in which X is a hydrophobic amino acid (1Brenner C.

Briefly, we found that Hint1-deleted mice have a marked increase in susceptibility to chemical carcinogen-induced gastric tumors (5Su T. Suzui M. Wang L. Lin C.S. Xing W.Q. Weinstein I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7824-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), mammary tumors (4Li H. Zhang Y. Su T. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, with aging, Hint1-deleted mice displayed an increase in the occurrence of a variety of spontaneous tumors (4Li H. Zhang Y. Su T. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We and other groups have made intensive efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this tumor suppressor activity. Deletion of the Hint1 gene enhances the growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (5Su T. Suzui M. Wang L. Lin C.S. Xing W.Q. Weinstein I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7824-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of HINT1 inhibits the growth of SW480 colon cancer cells (6Wang L. Zhang Y. Li H. Xu Z. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4700-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HINT1 also triggers apoptosis in SW480 and MCF7 breast cancer cells by inducing expression of p53 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bax and concomitant down-regulation of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2 (7Weiske J. Huber O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27356-27366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HINT1 has also emerged as an important regulator of gene transcription. Thus, HINT1 is present in a protein complex containing the basal transcription factor TFIIH (8Korsisaari N. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34837-34840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In mast cells, HINT1 binds to the microphthalmia transcription factor and the transcription factor USF2 and inhibits their transcriptional activities (9Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3117-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that HINT1 interacts directly with Pontin and Reptin, which are direct binding partners of β-catenin and thus inhibits T-cell factor-β-catenin-mediated transcription such as transcription of cyclin D1. Studies from our laboratory indicate that HINT1 inhibits activator protein-1 transcriptional activity by binding to POSH (plenty of SH3) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) (6Wang L. Zhang Y. Li H. Xu Z. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4700-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HINT1 may play a role in other cellular events such as cellular responses to ionizing radiation via interaction with the product of ATDC gene to repress fos transcription (12Brzoska P.M. Chen H. Zhu Y. Levin N.A. Disatnik M.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Murnane J.P. Christman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cell cycle is tightly controlled by the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; KPC, Kip1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; ERK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3.2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; KPC, Kip1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; ERK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3. In addition, the activity of CDKs is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including the binding of cyclins, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, cellular localization, transcriptional regulation, protein degradation, and interactions with CDK inhibitors (reviewed in Ref. 15Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). CDK inhibitors consist of two subfamilies. One contains p21CIP1, p27KIP1 (hereafter referred to as p27), and p57KIP2 (16Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J.

Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar); the other contains p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C, and p19INK4D (20Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The CDK inhibitors in the first subfamily share similarities at their N terminus and have a broad specificity for CDKs (reviewed in Ref. 21Besson A. Dowdy S.F. Roberts J.M. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of p27 are increased in quiescent cells, decrease upon cell cycle entry, and are largely, but not exclusively, controlled by the rate of degradation of the p27 protein (22Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar, 23Clurman B.E. Porter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science (New York). 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Degradation of p27 is maximal in S phase following cell cycle entry and is controlled by both mitogenic and antimitogenic signals (for a review see Ref. 23Clurman B.E. Porter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15158-15160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). p27 is decreased in some human tumors, and low expression is an adverse prognostic factor (25Lloyd R.V. Erickson L.A.

Kapusta L. Slingerland J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying p27 degradation are important in tumor biology. It is of interest that p27 is ubiquitylated and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. In the nucleus, CDK2 phosphorylates p27 at threonine 187. The modified protein is then recognized by the SCFSKP2 ubiquitin ligase and degraded by the proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 29Bloom J. Pagano M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, another ubiquitin ligase KPC (Kip1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex) recognizes unphosphorylated p27 during G1, and this also leads to the proteasome-mediated degradation (30Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Recently, several groups discovered that p27 can also be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the oncogenic protein Src, as well as its family member Lyn, and also by another non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl, and that this results in decreased stability of the p27 protein (31Chu I. Sun J. Arnaout A. Kahn H. Hanna W. Narod S. Sun P. Tan C.K. Hengst L. Slingerland J. Cell. 2007; 128: 281-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 32Grimmler M. Wang Y.

The phosphorylation of p27 by Src impairs its CDK2 inhibitory action and reduces its steady-state binding to cyclinE-CDK2, thus facilitating CyclinE-CDK2-dependent p27 degradation (31Chu I. Sun J. Arnaout A. Kahn H. Hanna W. Narod S. Sun P. Tan C.K. Hengst L. Slingerland J. Cell. 2007; 128: 281-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 32Grimmler M. Wang Y.

Cell. 2007; 128: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).The present study describes the discovery that HINT1 can increase cellular levels of p27 at the post-transcriptional level by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation. This appears to occur via two mechanisms: 1) inhibition of ubiquitylation of p27 by the SCFSKP2 ubiquitin ligase, and 2) inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of p27 by Src through inhibiting Src expression. These effects on p27 could further contribute to the tumor suppressor activity of HINT1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The FLAG-tagged HINT1 expression construct p3×FLAG-Hint1 was constructed by PCR-based subcloning from pcDNA3-Hint1 (3Klein M.G. Yao Y. Slosberg E.D. Lima C.D. Doki Y. Weinstein I.B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 244: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A 3×FLAG-Hint1 construct with altered nucleotide sequence but without alterations in amino acid coding sequence was made using PCR technology to avoid an RNA interference effect when re-introducing HINT1 expression to HINT1 shRNA SW480 cells and named 3×FLAG-Hint1-X. HA-tagged HINT1 expression construct pHANE-HA-Hint1 was previously described (6Wang L. Zhang Y. Li H. Xu Z. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4700-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HA-tagged p27 expression constructs were subcloned from pcDNA3-p27 (33Zhou P. Yao Y. Soh J.W. Weinstein I.B. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 4935-4945PubMed Google Scholar) into the pHACE vector. The FLAG-tagged KPC1 and KPC2 were constructed by subcloning KPC1 and KPC2 cDNA from the pMX-puro-His6-FLAG-hKPC1 and the pMX-puro-hKPC2-HA (kindly provided by Dr. Keiichi Nakayama), respectively, into the p3×FLAG-7.1 vector. Several expression constructs were kind gifts from other investigators, as follows: The Sp1 expression construct pPacSp1 from Dr. Robert Tjian, the Sp3 expression construct pCMV-Sp3/flu from Dr. Jonathan Horowitz, the His6-tagged ubiquitin expression constructs from Dr. Dirk Bohmann, GST fusion protein expression constructs and HINT1 RNA interference (shRNA) constructs from Dr. Otmar Huber, luciferase reporter pGL3-Src from Dr. Carlo Catapano, HA-Ubc3 construct from Dr. P. Renee Yew, and the Myc-Roc1 construct from Dr. Yue Xiong. His6-Ubc3 was constructed by subcloning Ubc3 cDNA from HA-Ubc3 into empty vector pET-15b (Novagen). Cycloheximide and MG132 were purchased from Sigma. PP1 was from Biomol.Immunoblot and Antibodies—Lysates of total cellular proteins or immunoprecipitates were analyzed by protein immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE using the specified antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). As primary antibodies, we used p27KIP1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), β-actin (Sigma), HINT1 (3Klein M.G. Yao Y. Slosberg E.D. Lima C.D. Doki Y. Weinstein I.B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 244: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), HINT1 (ProteinTech Group, for chromatin immunoprecipitation assay), HA (Sigma), FLAG (Sigma), Rbx1/Roc1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FAK (Cell Signaling), Cbl (Cell Signaling), Csk (Cell Signaling), Src (Cell Signaling), Src[pY418] (BIOSOURCE), ERK2 (Upstate), phospho-ERK2 (Upstate), Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CDK2 (Upstate), and Ubc3/CDC34 (Invitrogen).Co-immunoprecipitation Assay and GST Pulldown Assay—For immunoprecipitation, cells from 6-cm plates were rinsed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 400 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA). The lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C followed by a 10-s sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was done using EZview Red Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel (Sigma) or EZview Red Anti-HA Affinity gel (Sigma) or EZview Red Protein G Affinity gel (Sigma). The beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and the proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. The association of HINT1 with Roc1 or Ubc3 or Sp1 was also analyzed using agarose-immobilized GST fusion proteins. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid encoding GST-HINT1, GST-HINT1ΔN, GST-HINT1ΔC, or GST were cultured at 37 °C with shaking. GST fusion proteins were induced by incubating the cells with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. Bacteria expressing the GST fusions were precipitated and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA (buffer A). Bacteria cell lysates were mixed with GSH-agarose beads. GST fusion proteins were immobilized on GSH-agarose by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min and washed three times with buffer A. His6-Ubc3 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified using an His-Bind purification kit (Calbiochem). For the binding reaction, GSH-agarose carrying the immobilized GST fusion proteins (or GST as control) was mixed with cell lysates from control 293T cells or 293T cells containing overexpressed HA-Ubc3 or Myc-Roc1 or 3×FLAG-KPC1 or 3×FLAG-KPC2, or purified His6-Ubc3 in buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) overnight at 4 °C. The protein-bound agarose was washed three times with buffer B. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer.Reporter Gene Assays—SW480 cells (3 × 105 cells per well) were seeded into 12-well plates and transfected the second day using the Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen), with different expression plasmids (1 μg each) together with 10 ng of pRL-Luc (Renilla luciferase) and 0.1 μg of the reporter plasmid pGL3-Src. After incubation for 40 h, the cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activities present in cellular lysates were assayed with the Lumat LB 9507 luminometer as specified by the manufacturer (EG&G Berthold) and normalized to the Renilla luciferase activities to compensate for variability in transfection efficiencies.Ubiquitylation Assays—The in vivo ubiquitylation assay was conducted as described previously (34Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The lysis buffer contains 10 mm N-methylmaleimide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS. HEK293T cells in 60 mm plates were transfected with His6-ubiquitin, HA-p27 expression plasmids, 3×FLAG-Hint1 using the calcium phosphate reagents. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were then treated with 10 μm MG132 for an additional 6 h. The cells from each plate were harvested and split into two aliquots, one for use in Western blot and the other for detection of ubiquitylated proteins using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) followed by Western blot with anti-p27 antibody. The in vitro ubiquitylation reaction mixture contained, in a volume of 15 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 mm ATP, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml methylated ubiquitin, 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 1 pmol of E1, 50 pmol of Ubc3/Cdc34, 1 μl of Skp2 lysate (containing Skp2, Skp1, Rbx1, and Cul1), 2 nm Cdk2-cyclin E, 50 nm Cks1, and 1 μl of [35S]p27. Following incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager scanning.Real-time PCR and Reverse-transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted with an illustra RNAspin Mini RNA Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare). cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA for each sample using the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was diluted from 20 μl to 60 μl with ddH2O. Real-time PCR was performed with primers chosen to extend products at ∼100 bp. All primer sequences were from published literature. The primers selected are as follows: Hint1, forward, 5′-GAAGATCATCCGCAAGGAAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCAGAAAATGTGTTGGTGCTT-3′; p27KIP1, forward, 5′-CTGCAACCGACGATTCTTCTACT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGCGTCTGCTCCACAGA-3′; and Src, forward, 5′-ACCACCTTTGTGGCCCTCTATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCACCAGTCTCCCTCTGTGTT-3′. Real-time PCR was then performed on 0.2 μl of cDNA along with 0.3 mm of each primer final concentration, combined with Power SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Each 20-μl reaction was amplified in thin-wall PCR tubes under the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 59 °C for 1 min. Melt-curve analysis was performed following amplification. The presence of a single PCR product was verified by the presence of a single melting temperature peak and by electrophoresis on agarose gels. The relative abundance of each gene's mRNA was normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in each sample (forward primer, 5′-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′; reverse, 3′-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTC-5′) using 7500 system SDS software (version 1.4.0.25). In the figures, error bars indicate the standard error of at least three independent experiments. Control experiments run in the absence of reverse transcriptase and/or RNA demonstrated no product amplification.For reverse-transcription PCR, total RNA was isolated from SW480 cells using TRIzol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified from 1 μg (10 ng for β-actin) of total RNA using a Superscript OneStep reverse transcription-PCR with the platinum TaqDNA polymerase system (Invitrogen). Primer sets used were: p27forward, 5′-TGCAACCGACGATTCTTCTACTCAA-3′; p27reverse, 5′-CAAGCAGTGATGTATCTGATAAACAAGGA-3′; Hint1forward, 5′-CGAGATGGCAGATGAGATTG-3′; and Hint1reverse, 5′-CCTTATTCAGGCCCAGATCA-3′. As an internal control, we used β-actin, forward, 5′-GACCTGACTGACTACCTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GACAGCGAGGCCAGGATG-3′. The annealing temperature was 72 °C. After 30 cycles, PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.ChIP Assays—ChIP was performed using the ChIP-IT™ Express Kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacture's instructions with minor modifications. In brief, HEK293T cells were fixed with 2 mm disuccinimidylglutarate for 45 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before fixation with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde. Nuclei were disrupted by sonication with eight 20-s pulses at 30% output in a Sonifier Cell Disruptor (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, NY), yielding genomic DNA fragments with a bulk size of 200-1000 bp. For each ChIP 15 μg of DNA was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-HINT1 antibody, anti-Sp1 antibody, or rabbit normal IgG. For subsequent PCR analysis, 5 μl of the extracted DNA (100 μl) was used as a template for 40 cycles of amplification. The following primers were used to detect the Src promoter: GC1-forward, 5′-CCTGAGCAGCTTAGCATG-3′; GC1-reverse, 5′-GAGGAGGAAGGAGGAAGC-3′; GA2-forward, 5′-CGCTTCCTCCTTCCTCCTC-3′; GA2-reverse, 5′-GACTCTAGAGGATCCCCG-3′. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.Statistical Analysis—All assays were repeated at least three times. The results of quantitative studies are reported as mean ± S.D. Differences were analyzed by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was regarded as significant, and such differences are indicated in the figures by an asterisk.RESULTSHigh Cellular Levels of HINT1 Are Associated with High Cellular Levels of p27—Several tumor suppressor proteins, including Rb, p27, and p53, play important roles in regulating the cell cycle. Therefore, we examined if HINT1, as a tumor suppressor, also plays a role in cell cycle regulation. Indeed, we found that expression of FLAG-tagged HINT1 in SW480 cells markedly increased cellular levels of the p27 protein but not that of CDK2, a binding partner of p27, when compared with SW480 cells transfected with only the vector (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained when HA-tagged HINT1 was expressed in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Expression of HINT1 shRNA in SW480 cells led to decreased expression of p27 but again no change was observed in CDK2 expression levels (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). Image quantitation confirmed that these changes are statistically significant (Fig. 1A). We also found that two normal colon cell lines, CCD-112CoN and CCD-841CoN, which expressed high levels of HINT1, also expressed high levels of p27, whereas HT29 and SW480 colon cancer cells, which expressed low levels of HINT1, expressed relatively low levels of p27 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, further decreasing the level of HINT1 in SW480 cells with HINT1 shRNA caused a further decrease in p27 (Fig. 1B, last lane). Similar results were obtained on repeated Western blots. A representative experiment is shown.HINT1 Does Not Alter the Transcription of p27—To determine the level at which HINT1 regulates p27 expression, we performed reverse transcription-PCR assays. SW480 cells were transiently transfected with an empty vector or a FLAG-HINT1 construct (Fig. 2A, left panel) or stably transfected with a control shRNA construct or a HINT1 shRNA construct (Fig. 2A, right panel). Neither overexpression nor knockdown of HINT1 resulted in significant changes in the levels of p27 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Data from real-time PCR, which is a more quantitative method to detect mRNA abundance, also showed no significant difference in the abundance of p27 mRNA before and after HINT1 overexpression or knockdown (Fig. 2B). To assess possible effects of HINT1 on the transcriptional activity of the p27 promoter, we performed luciferase reporter assays. The full-length p27 promoter was linked to a luciferase reporter. This reporter (p27PF) was co-transfected into SW480 cells with increasing amounts of HINT1 or Sp1 expression plasmids. We did not observe any effect of HINT1 on the activity of the p27 promoter (Fig. 2C). Sp1, which is known to act as a cis-transcription factor on the p27 promoter (35Inoue T. Kamiyama J. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32309-32317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), served as a positive control in these studies. Taken together, these findings indicate that the up-regulation of p27 by HINT1 occurs at a post-transcriptional level.FIGURE 2HINT1 does not alter the transcription of p27. A and B, HINT1 does not affect p27 mRNA expression. A, reverse-transcription PCR assays were performed to detect p27, HINT1, and β-actin mRNA expression in SW480 cells with overexpressed HINT1 (left panel) or reduced HINT1 (right panel) when compared with the corresponding controls. 1 μg of the total RNA was used for the p27 and HINT1 reactions, and 10 ng of total RNA was used for β-actin control reaction. The primers and additional details are described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, real-time PCR assay was performed to detect p27 and HINT1 mRNA expression in SW480 cells transiently transfected with a FLAG-tagged HINT1 expression construct (upper panel) or SW480 cells stably transfected with HINT1 shRNA construct (lower panel). Forty cycles of reaction were run for all reactions. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used for normalization. *, significant differences with respect to HINT1 (p < 0.05). C, HINT1 does not activate the p27 promoter. Transient transfection assays were performed in SW480 cells using a full-length p27 promoter linked to luciferase (p27PF). Increasing amounts of HINT1 and Sp1 expression constructs were co-transfected with p27PF, as indicated. Duplicates of each sample were included in each experiment.

Thus, we found that treatment of SW480 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased cellular levels of p27 (Fig. 3A). HINT1 overexpression increased the basal level of p27, and this was augmented when the cells were also treated with MG132 (Fig. 3A, left panel). When HINT1 expression was inhibited with a shRNA this partially impaired the ability of MG132 to increase the levels of p27 compared with the control shRNA (Fig. 3A, right panel). Similar results were obtained in three independent studies. Image quantitation confirmed that these changes of p27 levels"
https://openalex.org/W2109336521,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) represent genetic control points of gene expression, and can be categorized as cis- and trans-acting, reflecting local and distant regulation of gene expression respectively. Although there is evidence of co-regulation within clusters of trans-eQTLs, the extent of co-expression patterns and their relationship with the genotypes at eQTLs are not fully understood. We have mapped thousands of cis- and trans-eQTLs in four tissues (fat, kidney, adrenal and left ventricle) in a large panel of rat recombinant inbred (RI) strains. Here we investigate the genome-wide correlation structure in expression levels of eQTL transcripts and underlying genotypes to elucidate the nature of co-regulation within cis- and trans-eQTL datasets. Across the four tissues, we consistently found statistically significant correlations of cis-regulated gene expression to be rare (<0.9% of all pairs tested). Most (>80%) of the observed significant correlations of cis-regulated gene expression are explained by correlation of the underlying genotypes. In comparison, co-expression of trans-regulated gene expression is more common, with significant correlation ranging from 2.9%–14.9% of all pairs of trans-eQTL transcripts. We observed a total of 81 trans-eQTL clusters (hot-spots), defined as consisting of ≥10 eQTLs linked to a common region, with very high levels of correlation between trans-regulated transcripts (77.2–90.2%). Moreover, functional analysis of large trans-eQTL clusters (≥30 eQTLs) revealed significant functional enrichment among genes comprising 80% of the large clusters. The results of this genome-wide co-expression study show the effects of the eQTL genotypes on the observed patterns of correlation, and suggest that functional relatedness between genes underlying trans-eQTLs is reflected in the degree of co-expression observed in trans-eQTL clusters. Our results demonstrate the power of an integrative, systematic approach to the analysis of a large gene expression dataset to uncover underlying structure, and inform future eQTL studies."
https://openalex.org/W2104736530,"Background Cyanosis and myocardial hypertrophy frequently occur in combination. Hypoxia or cyanosis can be potent inducers of angiogenesis, regulating the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), and VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and 2); in contrast, pressure overload hypertrophy is often associated with impaired pro-angiogenic signaling and decreased myocardial capillary density. We hypothesized that the physiological pro-angiogenic response to cyanosis in the hypertrophied myocardium is blunted through differential HIF and VEGF-associated signaling. Methods and Results Newborn rabbits underwent aortic banding and, together with sham-operated littermates, were transferred into a hypoxic chamber (FiO2 = 0.12) at 3 weeks of age. Control banded or sham-operated rabbits were housed in normoxia. Systemic cyanosis was confirmed (hematocrit, arterial oxygen saturation, and serum erythropoietin). Myocardial tissue was assayed for low oxygen concentrations using a pimonidazole adduct. At 4 weeks of age, HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels, HIF-1α DNA-binding activity, and expression of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGF were determined in hypoxic and normoxic rabbits. At 6 weeks of age, left-ventricular capillary density was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Under normoxia, capillary density was decreased in the banded rabbits compared to non-banded littermates. As expected, non-hypertrophied hearts responded to hypoxia with increased capillary density; however, banded hypoxic rabbits demonstrated no increase in angiogenesis. This blunted pro-angiogenic response to hypoxia in the hypertrophied myocardium was associated with lower HIF-2α and VEGFR-2 levels and increased HIF-1α activity and VEGFR-1 expression. In contrast, non-hypertrophied hearts responded to hypoxia with increased HIF-2α and VEGFR-2 expression with lower VEGFR-1 expression. Conclusion The participation of HIF-2α and VEGFR-2 appear to be required for hypoxia-stimulated myocardial angiogenesis. In infant rabbit hearts with pressure overload hypertrophy, this pro-angiogenic response to hypoxia is effectively uncoupled, apparently in part due to altered HIF-mediated signaling and VEGFR subtype expression."
https://openalex.org/W2027573655,"C. elegans Dicer requires an accessory double-stranded RNA binding protein, RDE-4, to enact the first step of RNA interference, the cleavage of dsRNA to produce siRNA. While RDE-4 is typically essential for RNAi, we report that in the presence of high concentrations of trigger dsRNA, rde-4 deficient animals are capable of silencing a transgene. By multiple criteria the silencing occurs by the canonical RNAi pathway. For example, silencing is RDE-1 dependent and exhibits a decrease in the targeted mRNA in response to an increase in siRNA. We also find that high concentrations of dsRNA trigger lead to increased accumulation of primary siRNAs, consistent with the existence of a rate-limiting step during the conversion of primary to secondary siRNAs. Our studies also revealed that transgene silencing occurs at low levels in the soma, even in the presence of ADARs, and that at least some siRNAs accumulate in a temperature-dependent manner. We conclude that an RNAi response varies with different conditions, and this may allow an organism to tailor a response to specific environmental signals."

https://openalex.org/W2024917972,"Motion stimuli in one visual hemifield activate human primary visual areas of the contralateral side, but suppress activity of the corresponding ipsilateral regions. While hemifield motion is rare in everyday life, motion in both hemifields occurs regularly whenever we move. Consequently, during motion primary visual regions should simultaneously receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs. A comparison of primary and higher visual cortex activations induced by bilateral and unilateral motion stimuli is missing up to now. Many motion studies focused on the MT+ complex in the parieto-occipito-temporal cortex. In single human subjects MT+ has been subdivided in area MT, which was activated by motion stimuli in the contralateral visual field, and area MST, which responded to motion in both the contra- and ipsilateral field. In this study we investigated the cortical activation when excitatory and inhibitory inputs interfere with each other in primary visual regions and we present for the first time group results of the MT+ subregions, allowing for comparisons with the group results of other motion processing studies. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated whole brain activations in a large group of healthy humans by applying optic flow stimuli in and near the visual field centre and performed a second level analysis. Primary visual areas were activated exclusively by motion in the contralateral field but to our surprise not by central flow fields. Inhibitory inputs to primary visual regions appear to cancel simultaneously occurring excitatory inputs during central flow field stimulation. Within MT+ we identified two subregions. Putative area MST (pMST) was activated by ipsi- and contralateral stimulation and located in the anterior part of MT+. The second subregion was located in the more posterior part of MT+ (putative area MT, pMT)."

The protein synthesis inhibitor acetoxycycloheximide (Ac-CHX) has been previously shown to induce rapid apoptosis mediated by the release of cytochrome c in human leukemia Jurkat cells. In this study, the novel molecular mechanism that links caspase-8 to the mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic proteins has been identified. Jurkat cells deficient in caspase-8 were more resistant to Ac-CHX than wild-type Jurkat cells and manifested decreased apoptosis induction and caspase activation as well as inefficient release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into the cytosol. In contrast to Fas ligand stimulation, the general caspase inhibitor barely prevented the mitochondrial release of these pro-apoptotic proteins in Ac-CHX-treated cells, suggesting that caspase-8 activity is dispensable for triggering the mitochondrial pathway in Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this notion, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells reconstituted with catalytically inactive caspase-8 became sensitive to Ac-CHX and exhibited apoptosis, caspase activation, the liberation of pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol, and Bak conformational change as efficiently as wild-type Jurkat cells. Unlike caspase-3, -6, -7, and -9, a small but significant portion of caspase-8 was found to localize in mitochondria before and after exposure to Ac-CHX.

Moreover, Ac-CHX has been shown to induce strong activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and to trigger the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (42Kadohara K. Tsukumo Y. Sugimoto H. Igarashi M. Nagai K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism by which Ac-CHX induces rapid apoptosis. Our results surprisingly provide evidence for the novel molecular mechanism that links caspase-8 to the mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic proteins.

Assay for Apoptosis—Cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, and then stained with 300 μm Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem). Nuclear morphology was observed under a fluorescence light microscope (Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Apoptotic cells (%) were calculated as (condensed nuclei/total nuclei) × 100. Western Blotting—Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the protease inhibitor mixture Complete™ (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Post-nuclear lysates were collected as supernatants by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min). Protein samples (30 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The transferred membranes were stained with Ponceau S and checked for equal loading of proteins before antibody reaction. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), followed by analysis using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with digitonin lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 100 μm digitonin, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and the protease inhibitor mixture Complete™) on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min), cell lysates containing cytosol were recovered as supernatants. Pellets were washed once with digitonin lysis buffer and treated with Triton X-100 lysis buffer on ice for 15 min.

Cells were diluted 1 day before transfection, and then suspended with GenePulser electroporation buffer (Bio-Rad). The cells were transfected with 200 nm Stealth™ RNAi duplexes using the GenePulser Xcell electroporation system (Bio-Rad) and incubated for 48 h prior to analysis. Cell Transfection—Cells were diluted 1 day before transfection and washed three times with fetal calf serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were transfected with pEF pGK puro expression vectors (47Huang D.C.S. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) encoding mouse wild-type caspase-8 or mouse proteolytically inactive caspase-8 mutant (C362G) (48Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Mol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) using the GenePulser Xcell electroporation system. The cells were cultured for 48 h without selection and then cultured in microtiter plates in the presence of puromycin (5 μg/ml, Sigma) or hygromycin (1 mg/ml, Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Puromycin- and hygromycin-resistant clones expressing mouse caspase-8 and human Bcl-2 were selected by Western blotting using anti-mouse caspase-8 antibody 3B10 and anti-FLAG antibody M2, respectively. Assay for Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Cells were incubated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 40 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide for 15 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum and 0.02% sodium azide, and analyzed with a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Detection of Bak Conformational Change—Bak conformational change was detected basically as described previously (49Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C.

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1% CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, Complete™) on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min), cell lysates were precleared with isotype-specific control antibody (Invitrogen) and then immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-Bak antibody (Ab-1) and protein G Plus-agarose (Calbiochem). The resultant immunoprecipitates containing conformationally changed Bak were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-Bak antibody (NT). Caspase-8 Is Responsible for Apoptosis Induced by Ac-CHX—Ac-CHX induced apoptosis in human leukemia Jurkat cells at concentrations >0.1 μm (Fig. 1A). Upon treatment with Ac-CHX, Jurkat cells started to die within 2 h and steadily underwent apoptosis thereafter (Fig. 1B). The kinetics of Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis is very rapid and seems similar to that of Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis. Caspase-8 plays an essential role in FasL-induced apoptosis (4Nagata S. Ann. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 5Siegel R.M. Chan F.K.M. Chun H.J. Lenardo M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 6Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 7Krammer P.H. Arnold R. Lavrik I.N. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To determine if caspase-8 is responsible for Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis, Jurkat cells deficient in caspase-8 were compared with wild-type cells for the induction of apoptosis following exposure to Ac-CHX. Caspase-8-deficient cells were more resistant to Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A) and manifested slower induction of apoptosis upon treatment with Ac-CHX (Fig. 1B), although they were completely resistant to FasL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Approximately 50% of caspase-8-deficient cells underwent apoptosis when they were treated with Ac-CHX (1 μm) for 5 h. These results indicate that Ac-CHX is able to induce apoptosis in a manner independent of caspase-8. Nevertheless, especially at early time points upon exposure to Ac-CHX, it seems most likely that caspase-8 is required for accelerated induction of apoptosis. Caspase-8 Is Responsible for Caspase Activation Induced by Ac-CHX—In wild-type Jurkat cells, Ac-CHX induced processing of caspase-3 and caspase-9 into their active forms at concentrations >0.1 μm (Fig. 2A) and within 2 h (Fig. 2B). In caspase-8-deficient cells exposed to Ac-CHX, processing of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was greatly decreased (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with these results, in caspase-8-deficient cells, Ac-CHX induced little processing of caspase-6 and caspase-7 into their active forms (Fig. 2C). Thus, these results indicate that caspase-8 is responsible for caspase activation induced by Ac-CHX. Caspase-8 Is Responsible for Mitochondrial Release of Pro-apoptotic Proteins in Ac-CHX-induced Apoptosis—Mitochondria play a central role in the induction of apoptosis via the release of pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol (16Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 18Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 19Garrido C. Galluzzi L. Brunet M. Puig P.E. Didelot C. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with Ac-CHX, cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO were released into the cytosol within 2 h, accompanied by their profound reduction in mitochondria (Fig. 3). AIF was also released into the cytosol in Ac-CHX-treated cells, although a large part of AIF was still retained in mitochondria (Fig. 3). In caspase-8-deficient cells, these apoptotic factors were only weakly released into the cytosol upon exposure to Ac-CHX (Fig. 3). These data indicate that caspase-8 is responsible for the mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic proteins in Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis. However, because the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevented apoptosis induced by Ac-CHX (42Kadohara K. Tsukumo Y. Sugimoto H. Igarashi M. Nagai K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it seems that the release of Smac/DIABLO and AIF is not essential for induction of apoptosis by Ac-CHX. However, these changes are considered to be useful markers for the mitochondrial activation during Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis. Caspase Activity Is Dispensable for Mitochondrial Release of Pro-apoptotic Proteins in Ac-CHX-induced Apoptosis—Caspase-8 is known to cleave Bid into its truncated form that translocates to mitochondria and induces the release of pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol in FasL-induced apoptosis (13Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 14Li H. Zhu H. Xu C. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). In contrast to FasL stimulation, z-VAD-fmk barely prevented the release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into the cytosol in Ac-CHX-treated cells (Fig. 4A). The possibility that z-VAD-fmk is insufficient to block caspase activity is excluded by the observations that z-VAD-fmk at the same concentration totally prevented the release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into the cytosol in FasL-treated cells (Fig. 4A) and that z-VAD-fmk suppressed caspase activity induced by Ac-CHX to background levels as measured using fluorescent caspase substrates (42Kadohara K. Tsukumo Y. Sugimoto H. Igarashi M. Nagai K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Full-length Bid (p24) was cleaved into its truncated form (p15) in wild-type Jurkat cells but not caspase-8-deficient cells when treated with FasL (Fig. 4B). However, Bid processing was still observed in caspase-8-deficient cells during Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Because Ac-CHX-induced Bid processing in caspase-8-deficient cells was prevented by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 4C), it seems that Bid is cleaved not by caspase-8 but by other caspases in Ac-CHX-treated cells. To exclude the possibility that Bid is required for Ac-CHX-induced mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic proteins, wild-type Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with the Stealth™ RNAi duplexes targeting Bid (Fig. 4D). Knockdown of Bid failed to affect the release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into the cytosol upon 2-h treatment with Ac-CHX (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data suggest that caspase activity is dispensable for the mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic proteins in Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis. Caspase-8 Is Able to Induce Apoptosis Without Its Enzymatic Activity in Ac-CHX-treated Cells—To determine if the enzymatic activity of caspase-8 is necessary for Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells were reconstituted with wild-type caspase-8 or catalytically inactive caspase-8 mutant (C362G). Three independent transfectants expressing wild-type caspase-8 (JC8WT1, JC8WT2, and JC8WT3) and inactive caspase-8 (JC8IN1, JC8IN2, and JC8IN3) at endogenous levels comparable to those in B lymphoma A20 cells were established (Fig. 5A). These transfectants expressed FADD and c-FLIPL at similar levels to wild-type and caspase-8-deficient cells, whereas caspase-8-deficient cells and their transfectants expressed slightly decreased levels of Fas compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 5A). Caspase-8 was processed into its active form containing a large subunit (p20) only when wild-type caspase-8 transfectants (JC8WT1, JC8WT2, and JC8WT3), but not inactive caspase-8 transfectants (JC8IN1, JC8IN2, and JC8IN3), were exposed to FasL (Fig. 5B). Consistent with these results, FasL was able to induce apoptosis in wild-type caspase-8 transfectants (JC8WT1, JC8WT2, and JC8WT3) but not inactive caspase-8 transfectants (JC8IN1, JC8IN2, and JC8IN3) (Fig. 5D). Therefore, these data clearly indicate that the enzymatic activity of caspase-8 is essential for FasL-induced apoptosis. By contrast, caspase-8 was processed into the p43 intermediate form but not the p20 large subunit when both wild-type caspase-8 transfectants (JC8WT1, JC8WT2, and JC8WT3) and inactive caspase-8 transfectants (JC8IN1, JC8IN2, and JC8IN3) were treated with Ac-CHX (Fig. 5C). Therefore, it seems that caspase-8 is cleaved not by self-processing but by other downstream caspases in Ac-CHX-treated cells. This notion was further supported by the observation that caspase-8 processing did not occur in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells during Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis, whereas FasL stimulation induced processing of caspase-8 into the active form containing the large subunit (supplemental Fig. S1 and Ref. 42Kadohara K. Tsukumo Y. Sugimoto H. Igarashi M. Nagai K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 1 and 5E, compared with wild-type cells, Ac-CHX did not efficiently induce apoptosis in caspase-8-deficient cells. In contrast to Fa"

Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun leads to skin cancer. Yet, insufficient exposure leads to vitamin D deficiency. Humans have evolved two adaptations for dealing with the yin/yang of sun exposure: skin pigmentation and nucleotide excision repair. Increased melanin pigmentation in dark skin protects populations dwelling at equatorial latitudes from skin cancer, whereas decreased pigmentation in fair skin maximizes vitamin D activation in populations at polar latitudes. However, fair skin would be an untenable phenotype were it not for nucleotide excision repair, which removes UV-induced DNA lesions. For example, the loss of nucleotide excision repair in the autosomal recessive disease xeroderma pigmentosum leads to sun hypersensitivity and skin cancer. In this issue, Scrima et al., 2008Scrima A. Konickova R. Czyzewski B.K. Kawasaki Y. Jeffrey P.D. Groisman R. Naakatani Y. Iwai S. Pavletich N.P. Thoma N.H. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar show how a complex of DNA Damage-Binding Protein 1 (DDB1) and DDB2 recognizes photolesions in DNA to marshal the nucleotide excision repair machinery. Nucleotide excision repair recognizes and removes UV-induced lesions in a background of billions of normal base pairs and accomplishes this daunting task by two different mechanisms: transcription-coupled repair and global genomic repair. Transcription-coupled repair recognizes lesions on transcribed DNA by the stalling of RNA polymerase II at the site of damage (Figure 1A). Global genomic repair targets damage throughout the genome by the coordinated action of two heterodimeric proteins, DDB1-DDB2 and XPC-HR23. Mutations in DDB2 and XPC are implicated in xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups E and C, respectively. Initially, the DDB1-DDB2 complex binds to the lesion and then recruits XPC-HR23. DDB1 and CULLIN 4 then form an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, which ubiquitinates DDB2, XPC, and histone proteins (Sugasawa et al., 2005Sugasawa K. Okuda Y. Saijo M. Nishi R. Matsuda N. Chu G. Mori T. Iwai S. Tanaka K. Tanaka K. Hanaoka F. Cell. 2005; 121: 387-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of DDB2 and XPC may mediate the hand-off of the lesion site from DDB1-DDB2 to XPC-HR23. Histone ubiquitination may allow the nucleotide excision repair proteins to access nucleosomal DNA. A longstanding question has been how DDB1-DDB2 recognizes the broad range of lesions targeted by nucleotide excision repair (Tang and Chu, 2002Tang J. Chu G. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In vitro, DDB1-DDB2 binds with high affinity to 6-4 photoproducts, which generate marked distortion of the DNA double helix, and it binds with lower affinity to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), which produce only moderate helical distortion. In addition, DDB1-DDB2 binds to DNA with crosslinked bases (due to cisplatin, nitrogen mustard, or psoralen treatment) but also binds to DNA with abasic sites, the antithesis of crosslinked bases. Scrima et al. now report the crystal structures of the DDB1-DDB2 complex bound to two different DNA lesions, a bulky 6-4 photoproduct and an abasic analog. In both cases, the DNA is unwound and bent, and two nucleotides (the 6-4 photoproduct or the abasic site with its 3′ neighbor) are flipped out of the double helix (Figure 1B). While DDB1 stabilizes DDB2 but does not contact DNA, DDB2 interacts extensively with the distorted DNA backbone and the widened minor groove adjacent to the lesion. DDB2 contains a shallow binding pocket for the flipped out nucleotides, but the interactions are limited, leaving the damaged nucleotides largely exposed to solvent. Structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics studies suggest a general mechanism in which DNA repair proteins recognize lesions by detecting increased flexibility in the DNA due to destabilized base stacking (Yang, 2008Yang W. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protein binding would then mold the damaged DNA into a defined structure that complements the recognition protein. For example, when complexed with T4 endonuclease V, photolyase, or Rad4, the CPD-containing DNAs are kinked and unwound, and either the crosslinked nucleotides or their base-pairing partners are flipped out (Mees et al., 2004Mees A.

Nature. 2007; 449: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, Vassylyev et al., 1995Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, lesion recognition could be based on a reduction in DNA rigidity induced by a lesion rather than a specific interaction with the damaged bases (Yang, 2008Yang W. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The same mechanism now appears to occur for DDB1-DDB2 bound to either a 6-4 photoproduct or an abasic site. Recognition based on distortion explains how DDB1-DDB2 can target a broad range of lesions for nucleotide excision repair. Nucleosomes may enhance damage-induced distortion by bending the DNA around the histone core. Scrima et al. suggest that DDB1-DDB2 may recognize DNA lesions in nucleosomes and recruit XPC to the lesion (Scrima et al., 2008Scrima A. Konickova R. Czyzewski B.K. Kawasaki Y. Jeffrey P.D. Groisman R. Naakatani Y. Iwai S. Pavletich N.P. Thoma N.H. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Rad4, the yeast homolog of XPC, does not bind to the lesion but to the undamaged DNA strand (Min and Pavletich, 2007Min J.H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2007; 449: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Strand separation occurs due to the lesions and may be enhanced in the presence of DDB1-DDB2. After initial lesion recognition by DDB1-DDB2 and recruitment of XPC-HR23, the specificity of nucleotide excision repair may be enhanced in the subsequent excision steps. Neither DDB1-DDB2 (Scrima et al., 2008Scrima A. Konickova R. Czyzewski B.K. Kawasaki Y. Jeffrey P.D. Groisman R. Naakatani Y. Iwai S. Pavletich N.P. Thoma N.H. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar) nor the yeast XPC homolog Rad4 (Min and Pavletich, 2007Min J.H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2007; 449: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) differentiate between substrates for nucleotide excision repair (such as UV-induced photoproducts) from abasic lesions, mismatched base pairs, or undamaged single-stranded DNA, which are not substrates for nucleotide excision repair. Other factors recruited by XPC-HR23 and ubiquitination may play a role in discriminating against DNA structures that are not subject to nucleotide excision repair. The DDB1-DDB2 structure also provides a new mode of protein-DNA binding. It represents the first structure of a β propeller protein bound to DNA at a specific site. DNA-binding proteins predicted to have similar β propeller structures, such as the V(D)J recombination activating protein RAG2, can be modeled onto DNA based on the structure of the DDB1-DDB2 complex bound to DNA. Despite their tight association, the DDB1 and DDB2 subunits have evolved independently. DDB1 homologs exist in mammals, fruit flies, nematodes, fission yeast, and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Zaidi et al., 2008Zaidi I.W. Rabut G. Poveda A. Scheel H. Malmstrom J. Ulrich H. Hofmann K. Pasero P. Peter M. Luke B. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, DDB1 often associates with proteins other than DDB2. For example, DDB1 also forms an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex with CSA (Cockayne Syndrome complementation group A), which is required for transcription-coupled repair and is mutated in patients with Cockayne Syndrome (Fousteri et al., 2006Fousteri M.

By contrast, DDB2 homologs exist only in mammals (Tang and Chu, 2002Tang J. Chu G. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, DDB2 represents a recent evolutionary adaptation. The structure of the DDB1-DDB2 complex demonstrates that DDB2 plays the role of UV damage recognition for global genomic repair. Interestingly, in humans but not in mice, p53 activates transcription of DDB2, enhancing damage recognition after cells are exposed to UV (Tan and Chu, 2002Tan T. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3247-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Perhaps the evolution of DDB2 has played a role in human history by increasing the viability of fair skin, which may have helped humans colonize polar latitudes. Structural Basis of UV DNA-Damage Recognition by the DDB1–DDB2 ComplexScrima et al.CellDecember 26, 2008In BriefUltraviolet (UV) light-induced pyrimidine photodimers are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Photolesions have biophysical parameters closely resembling undamaged DNA, impeding discovery through damage surveillance proteins. The DDB1–DDB2 complex serves in the initial detection of UV lesions in vivo. Here we present the structures of the DDB1–DDB2 complex alone and bound to DNA containing either a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photodimer (6-4PP) lesion or an abasic site. The structure shows that the lesion is held exclusively by the WD40 domain of DDB2. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
https://openalex.org/W2022617873,"DgkB is a soluble diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase that is essential for membrane lipid homeostasis in many Gram-positive pathogens. Anionic phospholipids, like phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro), were required for DgkB to recognize diacylglycerol embedded in a phospholipid bilayer. An activity-independent vesicle binding assay was used to determine the role of specific residues in DgkB-PtdGro interactions. Lys15 and Lys165 were required for DgkB to dock with PtdGro vesicles and flank the entrance to the DgkB active site. Mg2+ was required for vesicle binding. The compromised vesicle binding by mutants in the key asparate residues forming the structural Mg2+-aspartate-water network within the substrate binding domain revealed that interfacial binding of DgkB required a Mg2+-dependent conformational change. DgkB interaction with phospholipid vesicles was not influenced by the presence of ATP, but anionic vesicles decreased the Km of the enzyme for ATP. Arg100 and Lys15 are two surface residues in the ATP binding domain that were necessary for high affinity ATP binding. The key residues responsible for the structural Mg2+ binding site, the conformational changes that increase ATP affinity, and interfacial recognition of anionic phospholipids were identical in DgkB and the mammalian diacylglycerol kinase catalytic cores. This sequence conservation suggests that the mammalian enzymes also require a structural divalent cation and surface positively charged residues to bind phospholipid bilayers and trigger conformational changes that accelerate catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2000761629,"Gene expression is widely perceived as exclusively controlled by the information contained in cis-regulatory regions. These are built in a modular way, each module being a cluster of binding sites for the transcription factors that control the level, the location and the time at which gene transcription takes place. On the other hand, results from our laboratory have shown that gene expression is affected by the compositional properties (GC levels) of the isochores in which genes are embedded, i.e. the genome context. To clarify how compositional genomic properties affect the way cis-regulatory information is utilized, we have changed the genome context of a GFP-reporter gene containing the complete cis-regulatory region of the gene spdeadringer (spdri), expressed during sea urchin embryogenesis. We have observed that GC levels higher or lower than those found in the natural genome context can alter the reporter expression pattern. We explain this as the result of an interference with the functionality of specific modules in the gene's cis-regulatory region. From these observations we derive the notion that the compositional properties of the genome context can affect cis-regulatory control of gene expression. Therefore although the way a gene works depends on the information contained in its cis-regulatory region, availability of such information depends on the compositional properties of the genomic context."
