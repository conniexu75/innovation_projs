https://openalex.org/W2081023593,"Intracellularly labeled rat neostriatal projection neurons were analyzed with both light and electron microscopy. The axons of medium spiny neurons were traced into the globus pallidus and were found to make synaptic contacts with pallidal dendrites. Despite the common somato-dendritic morphology of the neostriatal projection neurons, two different distribution patterns of efferent axons were observed, indicating the presence of functionally different medium spiny neurons in the neostriatum."

https://openalex.org/W2054339986,"The synthesis of whole brain acetylcholine is reduced in two strains (C57BL and BALB/c) of senescent mice. The incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into acetylcholine decreased in both strains by 40 ± 4 percent in 10-month-old mice and by 58 ± 9 percent in 30-month-old mice compared with mice 3 months old. The incorporation of [2H4]choline into acetylcholine declined 60 and 73 percent in 10- and 30-month-old mice, respectively. Deficits in the cholinergic system may contribute to brain dysfunctions that complicate senescence."

However, DNA strand breakage was detectable up to 70 angstroms from the site of iodine-125 decay."

https://openalex.org/W2001455457,"After a weak, steady electric current of approximately 10 microamperes was imposed across the completely severed spinal cord of the larval lamprey Petromyzon marinus, enhanced regeneration was observed in the severed giant reticulospinal neurons. The current was applied with implanted wick electrodes for 5 to 6 days after transection (cathode distal to lesion). The spinal cords were examined 44 to 63 days after the operation by means of intracellular fluorescent dye injections and electrophysiology. Extracellular stimulation of whole cords showed that action potentials in most of the electrically treated preparations were conducted in both directions across the lesion, but they were not conducted in either direction in most of the sham-treated controls. In most of the electrically treated animals, processes from giant axons with swollen irregular tips, indicating active growth, were seen in or across the lesion. Only a few of the sham-treated controls showed these features. It is possible that these facilitated regenerative responses were mediated by the effects of the artificially applied electric fields on the natural steady current of injury entering the spinal lesion."

https://openalex.org/W2086373106,"Bimodal neurons in the rattlesnake tectum, which receive sensory input from the retina and from the infrared-sensing pit organ, exhibit novel, highly nonlinear cross-modality interactions. Some units respond only to simultaneous bimodal stimulation. Others respond to only one of the two modalities, but show greatly enhanced or depressed responses when stimulated simultaneously in the second modality. These cross-modality interactions may play an important role in recognizing and orienting toward biologically important objects."
https://openalex.org/W2081514018,"Hypoxia was produced in isolated, hemoglobin-free, perfused rat liver by reducing the flow rate of oxygen-carrying fluid entering the organ. The procedure caused anoxia in centrilobular regions. In these anoxic areas, structural derangements developed rapidly, characterized by bleb-like protrusions of hepatocyte plasma membrane through fenestrations in the sinusoidal endothelium. Periportal tissue remained normoxic and was completely spared. Cellular injury resulting from localized anoxia may play an important role in the pathogenesis of centrilobular liver disease."

https://openalex.org/W2009397336,"In a study of human atherosclerotic plaques, the relative abundance of alpha chains in pepsin-solubilized collagens from 28 human aortas was estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ratio of alpha B, a component of the alpha chain in type V collagen, to alpha 1(I) was markedly increased in the atherosclerotic plaques compared to the nonsclerotic intact media and adventitia. It is suggested that proliferating smooth muscle cells in the sclerotic lesion were transformed to synthesize a larger amount of collagen alpha B chain during the process of human atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2045928685,"The eye can be visualized ultrasonically in more than 90 percent of fetuses 16 through 42 weeks of gestational age. Slow eye movements are present by 16 weeks. Rapid eye movements begin at 23 weeks and become more frequent between 24 and 35 weeks. Eye inactivity becomes more common after 36 weeks and is associated with sustained diaphragmatic excursions implying a ""quiet sleep"" state. Pathologic eye movements were seen in four fetuses with dysmorphic brain structure."
https://openalex.org/W2022911715,Circadian rhythms of ionized calcium and phosphate concentrations have been demonstrated in human blood. A computer-derived model curve representing the 24-hour fluctuations in ionized calcium cannot be correlated consistently with curves for total calcium or phosphate. Knowledge of these circadian rhythms provides a physiological basis for further understanding the interactions between blood minerals and calcium-regulating hormones.
https://openalex.org/W2088210473,"Evidence is presented that the liver effects an essentially complete degradation of plasma uridine in a single pass and replaces it largely from hepatic pools of acid-soluble uridine nucleotides. The concentration of uridine in the hepatic vein of the rat was essentially the same as that in the arterial circulation and portal vein. However, the isolated perfused rat liver degraded more than 90 percent of infused [5-3H]uridine in a single passage. Similar results were found in vivo when tracer amounts of [3H]uridine and [14C]uridine were infused into the portal vein of an intact rat. Furthermore, less than 2 percent of the infused uridine entered the acid-soluble nucleotide pools of the liver after 30 minutes of infusion. Intraperitoneal injection of [3H]orotate allowed selective labeling of liver (and kidney) pyrimidines. After 3 hours, the specific activity of uridine in the hepatic vein was more than three times that in the arterial circulation. This unusual exchange, which is not saturated even at uridine concentrations as high as 50 microM, contributes to the rapid turnover of plasma uridine and explains its inefficient utilization in peripheral tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2033015255,"Parsnip root contains three photoactive, mutagenic, and photocarcinogenic psoralens in a total concentration of about 40 parts per million. These chemicals are not destroyed by normal cooking procedures (boiling or microwave); thus humans are exposed to appreciable levels of psoralens through the consumption of parsnip and possibly other psoralen-containing foodstuffs. The toxicologic consequences to man of such exposure may be speculated on the basis of medicinal and laboratory studies, but epidemiologic data are not available."
https://openalex.org/W2088905006,Subjects observing differently scaled environments undergo systematic shifts in the experience of time. The experience of temporal duration is compressed relative to the clock in the same proportion as scale-model environments being observed are compressed relative to the full-sized environment. This research suggests that spatial scale may be a principal mediator in the experience of time.

https://openalex.org/W1963890785,"Removal of the posterior pituitary from anesthetized male rats results in a prompt and significant increase in circulating prolactin that is reversed by the injection of dopamine. Posterior pituitary extracts, which contain high concentrations of endogenous dopamine, inhibit prolactin secretion from isolated anterior pituitary cells. This inhibition is prevented by incubation of the cells with the dopamine receptor antagonist (+)-butaclamol. The data show that posterior pituitary dopamine reaches the anterior pituitary via the short hypophysial portal vessels and participates in the regulation of prolactin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2153386266,"The aorta of the octopus, Octopus dofleini, is a highly distensible, elastic tube. The circumferential elastic modulus increases with inflation in the physiological range from abut 10(4) to 10(5) newtons per square meter. Rubber-like fibers have been isolated, apparently for the first time, from the aorta of an invertebrate. These fibers have an elastic modulus, like elastin, of about 4 x 10(5) newtons per square meter and are present in sufficient quantity to account for the elastic properties of the intact vessel under physiological conditions. Thus the circulatory system of an invertebrate animal provides an ""elastic reservoir"" (much like that of the vertebrate system), which increases the efficiency of the circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2022295359,"Intracellular recordings were made from locally thermosensitive preoptic neurons in the green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. Stable resting potentials, action potentials, and spontaneous synaptic activity were observed over approximately 4 degrees to 5 degrees C changes in local brain temperature. A small percentage of the warm-sensitive neurons showed exponential firing-rate responses to temperature. These cells discharged rhythmically, lacked visible synaptic input, and showed slowly depolarizing potentials leading to action potentials. Other linear and nonlinear warm-sensitive and cold-sensitive neurons showed spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials giving rise to action potentials. Cells that appear to be endogenously active may be true thermodetectors, and other thermosensitive neuronal activity may be synaptically mediated."
https://openalex.org/W2038049093,"Ventriculocisternal administration of dl- and d-propranolol produced dose-dependent increases in cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine and reductions in blood pressure. A highly significant correlation was found between the increase in norepinephrine and the hypotensive effect. The propranolol-induced hypotension was prevented by intracisternal phentolamine. These data indicate that the hypotensive effect of centrally administered propranolol results from a drug-induced release of norepinephrine, which stimulates central alpha receptors to lower arterial pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2066214322,"The nocturnal activity patterns of rats changed significantly within 3 days after they were given unrestricted access to isocaloric diets in which the ratio of carbohydrate to protein was systematically varied. As the ratio increased, the rats were more continuously active. The subjects showed similar responses to variations in this ratio whether the diet contained 15 or 45 percent fat. No correlation was found between the number of calories an animal ate and its activity pattern."

https://openalex.org/W2010404198,"A dramatic change occurs in the vibrational properties of the iron-histidine bond, trans to the oxygen binding site, on freezing deoxyhemoglobin. The large, quaternary structure-dependent differences in the shape and frequency of the iron-histidine mode observed in resonance Raman scattering measurements above freezing ae significantly diminished by the freezing event and the scattering intensity increases substantially. On further reduction in temperature to 10 K this broad line becomes narrow and shifts to a higher frequency. These data implicate dynamical processes and protein interaction with water as contributors to the quaternary structure dependence of the iron-histidine bond and thus reflect on the role of that bond in the energetics of cooperative ligand binding."

https://openalex.org/W1495292123,"The collagenous domain of rabbit renal tubular basement membrane was solubilized by controlled pepsin digestion. Complete solubilization occurred within 24 h at 4 degrees C, and the sodium chloride precipitable polypeptides remained resistant to further degradation for at least 72 h. These products, which represent 35 to 40% of the basement membrane, possess a composition similar to that od the collagenous domain of bovine glomerular basement membrane. Agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate resolved 11 components, several of which comprise the majority of the protein in the system. Components I (Mr approximately 1,500,000) and II (Mr approximately 1,200,000), together with a minor component, III, comprise 45% of the Coomassie blue-staining material. An additional 25% is represented by component IV (Mr approximately 375,000) plus a minor component, V. The remaining components (VI through XI) span a molecular weight range from 34,000 to 200,000. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to establish which of these components contain disulfide cross-linked polypeptides and the number and molecular weight of such polypeptides. Components I, II, and IV each contained intensely staining polypeptides of Mr = 160,000, 140,000, and 80,000 plus lightly staining polypeptides of Mr = 43,000 and 34,000. Lightly staining polypeptides of Mr = 390,000, 180,000, and 125,000 were also detected among the reduction products of components I and II. In addition, evidence for the presence of aldehyde-derived cross-linked polypeptides within the structures of components I and II was observed in the form of reduction products whose molecular weight occurs in multiples of the smaller monomeric polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2084750100,An intrinsic birefringence signal with two components occurring before sarcomere shortening was measured in mammalian cardiac muscle. The second component was sensitive to the inotropic state of the muscle as affected by external calcium concentration and epinephrine but not by changes of resting length. The second component was absent in frog heart. These results suggest that the second component of the birefringence signal reflects the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum related to excitation-contraction coupling processes occurring prior to onset of contraction in mammalian cardiac muscle.
https://openalex.org/W1997245970,"A variety of positively charged solutes induce pinocytosis in Amoeba proteus, ranging from metabolically useful material to solutes that may prove harmful, such as Alcian blue. Alcian blue is taken up by pinocytosis and then a fraction of the accumulated dye is expelled in bulk form through ""extrusion channels."" This response is not elicited by other solutes taken up by pinocytosis in the amoeba, implying that if any selectivity is associated with this process, it is by specific solute extrusion mechanisms in the cytoplasm."
