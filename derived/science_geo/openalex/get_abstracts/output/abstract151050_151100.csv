https://openalex.org/W1998394615,"This study investigates the apoptotic activity of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib in prostate carcinoma cells. COX-2 is constitutively expressed in androgen-responsive LNCaP and androgen-nonresponsive PC-3 cells. Exposure of these cells to celecoxib induces characteristic features of apoptosis, including morphological changes, DNA laddering, and caspase-3 activation, whereas piroxicam, a COX-1-specific inhibitor, displays no appreciable effect on either cancer cell line even after prolonged exposure. Moreover, the potency of celecoxib in apoptosis induction is significantly higher than that of other COX-2 inhibitors examined despite the observation that these inhibitors exhibit similar IC50 in COX-2 inhibition. It is noteworthy that normal human prostate epithelial cells, expressing a marginally detectable level of COX-2, are insensitive to the induction of apoptosis by celecoxib. These data suggest a correlation between COX-2 expression and sensitivity to the apoptotic effect of the COX-2 inhibitor. In an effort to delineate the underlying mechanism, we examined the effect of celecoxib on the expression of Bcl-2 as well as the activation of the key anti-apoptotic kinase Akt. In contrast to an earlier report that attributed the apoptotic activity of NS398 in LNCaP cells to Bcl-2 down-regulation, we provide evidence that the induction of apoptosis by celecoxib in LNCaP and PC-3 cells is independent of Bcl-2. First, treatment with celecoxib does not alter the cellular Bcl-2 level in both cell lines. Second, enforced Bcl-2 expression in PC-3 cells does not confer protection against the induction of apoptosis by celecoxib. Our data show that celecoxib treatment blocks the phosphorylation of Akt. This correlation is supported by studies showing that overexpression of constitutively active Akt protects PC-3 cells from celecoxib-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, how celecoxib down-regulates Akt is not clear because the drug does not adversely affect phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in vivo and okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor, cannot rescue the inhibition. In summary, our data demonstrate that inhibition of Akt activation may play a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis by celecoxib.

The fact that all NSAIDs in clinical use are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors provides a putative link between the inhibition of COX activity and the chemopreventive effect of NSAIDs (1.Taketo M.M. J.

COX-1, constitutively expressed in almost all tissues, is important for the maintenance of homeostatic function, whereas COX-2, an inducible isozyme, is dramatically up-regulated during pathological conditions such as inflammation and cancers (10.Smith W.L. garavito R.M.

The COX-2 gene, an immediate-early response gene, is rapidly induced in response to tumor promoters, cytokines, and growth factors (10.Smith W.L. garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, COX-2 expression is regulated by oncogenes andp53, in a positive and negative manner, respectively (12.Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. DeVito B. Weksler B.B.

The premise that COX-2 is involved in the pathologic processes of cancer growth and progression is further supported by animal studies showing that tumorigenesis is inhibited in COX-2 knockout mice (20.Oshima M.

Selective inhibitors of COX-2 have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, including those of colon (23.Hara A. Yoshimi N. Niwa M. Ino N. Mori H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1997; 88: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24.Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N.

These observations are consistent with the COX-2 inhibitor being a chemopreventive agent that increases the susceptibility of cancer cells to apoptosis. The biochemical mechanism underlying COX-2 inhibitor-induced apoptosis, however, remains elusive. At least three distinct mechanisms have been proposed. First, a recent study shows that NSAID treatment of colon tumor cells resulted in an increase in arachidonic acid that, in turn, stimulated the production of ceramide, a known death signal, by activating neutral sphingomyelinase (28.Chan T.A. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Second, the COX-2 inhibitors SC-58125 and NS398 have been reported to sensitize colon and prostate cancer cells, respectively, to apoptosis by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (24.Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 363-366Google Scholar, 27.Liu X.H. Yao S. Kirschenbaum A. Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar). Third, studies using sulindac sulfone, a sulindac metabolite that lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2, suggest the involvement of a COX-2-independent pathway during the apoptosis signaling (29.Piazza G.A. Rahm A.L. Krutzsch M. Sperl G. Paranka N.S. Gross P.H. Brendel K. Burt R.W. Alberts D.S. Pamukcu R. et al.Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3110-3116PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Hanif R. Pittas A. Feng Y.

Paranka N.S. Pamukcu R. Ahnen D.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 267-271PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we propose a unique mechanism for the apoptotic effect of celecoxib in human prostate carcinoma cells. Our data suggest that celecoxib induces apoptosis, in part, by blocking the activation of the anti-apoptotic kinase Akt (also called protein kinase B). This mechanism is noteworthy because celecoxib displays a significantly higher potency in apoptosis induction than other COX-2 inhibitors examined. Moreover, in contrast to the previous reports that correlated the apoptotic effect of COX-2 inhibitors with Bcl-2 down-regulation (24.Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 363-366Google Scholar, 27.Liu X.H. Yao S. Kirschenbaum A. Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar), we raise evidence that the induction of apoptosis by celecoxib is independent of Bcl-2.MATERIALS AND METHODSCelecoxib and rofecoxib were prepared from commercial Celebrex® and Vioxx®, capsules, respectively, by solvent extraction followed by recrystallization. The identity and purity of both molecules were verified by NMR and mass spectrometry. DuP697, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and rabbit anti-COX-2 antibodies were a kind gift from Professor Hsin-Hsiung Tai (University of Kentucky), and piroxicam was purchased from Sigma. NS398 was obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt and P-473Ser Akt were purchased from New England Biolabs. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Bcl-2 and Tyr(P) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, mAb against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase α was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-actin mAb was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or ICN. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Anti-mouse IgG-biotin conjugates and avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were products from Pierce.Cell CultureNormal human prostate epithelial cells were purchased from Clonetics. To assess the potential impact of androgen sensitivity on celecoxib-induced cell death, both androgen-responsive LNCaP (p53+/+) and androgen-nonresponsive PC-3 (p53–/–) human prostate cancer cell lines were tested. Whereas LNCaP cells exhibit androgen sensitivity, PC-3 cells do not have androgen receptors and are hormone-insensitive (32.Bosland M.C. Bertino J.R. Encyclopedia of Cancer. II. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 1283-1296Google Scholar). The PC-3 transfectant PC-3/Bcl-2 that overexpressed human Bcl-2 from a constitutive splenic focus-forming virus (SFFV)-promoter was prepared as described previously (33.Qiu G. Ahmed M. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Weinstein M.H. Rangnekar V.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Vector SFFV-Neo and human Bcl-2 expression construct pSFFV-Neo/Bcl-2-Flag were gifts from Gabriel Nunez (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The transfectants PC-3/Bcl-2 cells were highly resistant to apoptosis caused by TNF-α and Par-4 overexpression, 2V. M. Rangnekar, unpublished data. indicating that the overexpressed Bcl-2 protein was functional (33.Qiu G. Ahmed M. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Weinstein M.H. Rangnekar V.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Prostate cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. Cells were replenished daily with a new medium and were passaged 1:4 with fresh medium every 3 days.Transient TransfectionThe expression construct pCMV6.Myr.Akt.HA containing a myristoylation sequence from p60src (34.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar) was a gift from Professor Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School). For transfection, PC-3 cells were seeded into 60-mm tissue culture dishes with 25% confluence and grown for 24 h to 50–60% confluence. Each dish was washed with 4 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies), and 2 ml of the same medium was added. Aliquots containing 0.2 μg of the pCMV6.Myr.Akt.HA expression vector or a control pCMV/Blue plasmid in 100 μl of serum-free OPTI-MEM were preincubated with 8 μl of the Plus reagent from the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent kit at 25 °C for 15 min, and 8 μl of the LipofectAMINE reagent in 100 μl of Opti-MEM was added to the mixture. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and added to each dish with gentle mixing. After 5 h at 37 °C, the transfection media were replaced with 2 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. The transfected cells were collected at different time intervals for Western blot analysis of myristoylated Akt (MyrAkt) expression.Cell Viability and DNA Fragmentation AnalysisProstate cancer cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h and were exposed to various concentrations of celecoxib or DuP697 dissolved in Me2SO (final concentration, 0.1%) in serum-free RPMI medium for different time intervals. Controls received Me2SO vehicle at a concentration equal to that in celecoxib-treated cells. During the treatment, the percentage of cells floating in the medium increased over time. Adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization, and floating cells were recovered by centrifugation at 3,200 ×g for 5 min. Cell morphology was observed with a light microscope at x200. Both adherent and floating cells were combined for the assessment of cell viability. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. DNA was extracted by the Easy DNA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, size-fractionated in a 2% agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.ImmunoblottingThe general procedure for the Western blot analysis of COX-2, Bcl-2, Akt, phospho-Akt, and actin was as follows. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in SDS gel-loading buffer, sonicated by an ultrasonic sonicator for 5 s, and boiled for 5 min. After a brief centrifugation, equivalent protein concentrations from the soluble fractions were resolved in 10% (COX-2, Akt, P-473S Akt, and actin) or 12% (Bcl-2) SDS-polyacrylamide gels on a Minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The transblotted membrane was washed twice with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). After blocking with TBS containing 3% low fat milk for 30–60 min, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody at the appropriate dilution (rabbit anti-Akt and anti-P-473Ser Akt antibodies, 1:1000; anti-COX-2 antibodies, 1:5000; anti-Bcl-2 mAb, 1:500; anti-actin mAb, 1:1000) in TBS-1% low fat milk at 4 °C for 12 h and washed twice with TBST. For Akt, phospho-Akt, and COX-2 transblots, the membrane was probed with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with TBST. With regard to Bcl-2, and actin analyses, the membranes were first incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-biotin conjugates for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with TBST, incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (1:500) for 30 min at room temperature, and washed twice with TBST. The immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.In Vitro PI 3-Kinase AssayIn vitrophosphorylation of phosphatidylinositols was carried out with anti-Tyr(P) or anti-p85-immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase. Prostate cancer cells, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor treatment, were treated with 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer), and soluble cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. Anti-p85 or anti-Tyr(P) mAb (5 μg) was added to 500 μl of the cell lysate, the protein concentration of which was adjusted to 0.8–1 μg/μl with phosphate-buffered saline. The mixture was incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 12 h, 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed, in tandem, three times with the aforementioned lysis buffer, twice with 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m LiCl, and 10 μm sodium vanadate, and twice with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm EDTA. Adequate amounts of the washed antibody conjugates, in 10 μl, were added to 80 μl of 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 125 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 6.25 mm MgCl2, and the reaction was initiated by adding 20 μg of bovine brain extract (Type I; Sigma) suspended in 10 μl of 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 1 m EDTA and 25 μl of 5 m HCl followed by 160 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1; v/v). Samples were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 5 min, and the lower organic phase was removed, applied to 1% oxalic acid-treated TLC plates, and then developed withn-propanol:2 m acetic acid (65:35) overnight. After drying, spots were located by autoradiography and compared with standards. The autoradiograms were scanned by a Photodyne image system and quantified using the NIH Image program (version 1.59).DISCUSSIONThe therapeutic application of NSAIDs in cancer chemoprevention has been the focus of many recent investigations. Although the signaling mechanism responsible for the apoptotic activity of NSAIDs remains unclear, this unique pathway appears to be a COX-2 inhibitor-specific event. Despite the observation that LNCaP and PC-3 cells express COX-2 at different levels, their susceptibility to the apoptotic effect of celecoxib is similar to each other. Considering the molecular basis for COX-2 inhibitor-induced apoptosis, it has been proposed that it might due to the stimulation of ceramide production (28.Chan T.A. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) or the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression (24.Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 363-366Google Scholar, 27.Liu X.H. Yao S. Kirschenbaum A. Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar). The present data provide a novel mechanism for celecoxib: it selectively blocks the activation of Akt, thereby attenuating the activity of a major anti-apoptotic pathway. Consequently, overexpression of constitutively active Akt protects prostate cancer cells from celecoxib-exerted apoptosis. Studies on whether this unique mechanism applies to other COX-2 inhibitors are under way because celecoxib displays an apoptotic activity at least an order of magnitude higher than that of other COX-2 inhibitors examined. Moreover, it remains unclear how celecoxib affects Akt phosphorylation because it does not adversely affect PI 3-kinase activity in vivo. The finding that okadaic acid, a potent protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor, could not reverse the effect of celecoxib on Akt suggests that the reduced phospho-Akt level might arise from decreased phosphorylation rather than enhanced dephosphorylation. Taken together, the action of celecoxib may entail intermediate regulators of Akt downstream of PI 3-kinase or involve pathways independent of PI 3 kinase. This premise is reminiscent of a recent report that the inhibitory effect of C2-ceramide on Akt activation is independent of PI 3-kinase activity (41.Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (317) Google Scholar).The finding that apoptosis induction by celecoxib is not abrogated by enforced Bcl-2 expression in PC-3 cells connotes significant therapeutic implications. Bcl-2 overexpression has been correlated with the progression of prostate carcinoma (44.McDonnell T.J. Troncoso P. Brisbay S.M. Logothetis C. Chung L., W. Hsieh J.T. Tu S.M. Campbell M.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6940-6944PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Colombel M. Symmans F. Gil S. O'Toole K.M. Chopin D. Benson M. Olsson C.A. Korsmeyer S. Buttyan R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 390-400PubMed Google Scholar, 46.McDonnell T.J. Navone N.M. Troncoso P. Pisters L.L. Conti C. von Eschenbach A.C. Brisbay S. Logothetis C.J. J. Urol. 1997; 157: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of this anti-apoptotic protein raises the apoptotic threshold, which increases apoptosis resistance in the face of cellular abnormalities. For example, a recent report indicates that ectopic expression of Bcl-2 can impair apoptosis signaling by most of the cell stresses that activate the ceramide/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway (47.Herrmann J.L. Menter D.G. Beham A. von Eschenbach A. McDonnell T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 234: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, the independence of Bcl-2 function suggests the potential use of celecoxib and/or other COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.In summary, the present study proposes a new mechanism to account for the apoptotic activity of COX-2 inhibitors. However, it remains in dispute whether the apoptotic effect of COX-2 inhibitors is related to the prostanoid-mediated function of COX-2. Our data indicate that normal prostate epithelial cells do not express significant levels of COX-2 and that they are not susceptible to the induction of apoptosis by celecoxib. This correlation argues for the dependence of the apoptotic activity on COX-2 inhibition. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that the ability of COX-2 inhibitors to promote apoptosis may be dissociated from the enzyme activity of COX-2. First, there exists a discrepancy by nearly three orders of magnitude between the concentration of celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors needed to inhibit COX-2 activity and that required to induce apoptosis. This discrepancy raises a possibility that celecoxib mediates apoptosis through a target other than COX-2. Second, our data indicate that different COX-2 inhibitors with similar IC50 values in COX-2 inhibition display different degree of efficacy in the induction of apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of different apoptotic mechanisms among these molecules. Moreover, addition of exogenous prostaglandin E2 does not provide appreciable protection against celecoxib-induced apoptosis in either prostate cancer cell line (data not shown). Thus, the sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis by COX-2 inhibitors may be independent of cellular levels of prostaglandins. Third, although constitutive expression of COX-2 enhances the metastatic potential of intestinal epithelial cells, ectopic expression of COX-2 in ECV endothelial cells results in growth disadvantage and increased apoptotic death (48.Narko K. Ristimaki A. MacPhee M. Smith E. Haudenschild C.C. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21455-21460Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is plausible that COX-2 inhibitor-mediated apoptosis mediates through both COX-2 activity-dependent and -independent pathways. Thus, the mechanisms by which COX-2 inhibitors exert apoptotic effect in cancer cells warrant further investigation. An expanding body of information has suggested the potential application of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)1 in cancer chemoprevention (1.Taketo M.M. J. Natl.

The fact that all NSAIDs in clinical use are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors provides a putative link between the inhibition of COX activity and the chemopreventive effect of NSAIDs (1.Taketo M.M. J.

Ole e 1 and Ara h 1 carried high mannose and complex N-glycans, whereas Lol p 11 carried only the complex. The complex structures all had a β(1,2)-xylose linked to the core mannose. Substitution of the proximalN-acetylglucosamine with an α(1,3)-fucose was observed on Lol p 11 and a minor fraction of Ole e 1 but not on Ara h 1. To elucidate the structural basis for IgE recognition of plantN-glycans, radioallergosorbent test analysis with protease digests of the three allergens and a panel of glycoproteins with knownN-glycan structures was performed. It was demonstrated that both α(1,3)-fucose and β(1,2)-xylose are involved in IgE binding. Surprisingly, xylose-specific IgE antibodies that bound to Lol p 11 and bromelain did not recognize closely related xylose-containing structures on horseradish peroxidase, phytohemeagglutinin, Ole e 1, and Ara h 1. On Lol p 11 and bromelain, the core β-mannose is substituted with just an α(1,6)-mannose. On the other xylose-containingN-glycans, an additional α(1,3)-mannose is present. These observations indicate that IgE binding to xylose is sterically hampered by the presence of an α(1,3)-antenna.

The carbohydrate nature of these epitopes was supported by several characteristic properties, such as their periodate sensitivity and their resistance to heating and protease digestion. IgE antibodies directed to these carbohydrate structures were shown to be extremely cross-reactive not only between different plant-derived glycoproteins but also to glycoproteins from invertebrate animals (e.g. seafood and insect venoms) (2.Aalberse R.C.

Cabanes-Macheteau M. Rayon C. Fitchette-Lainé A.-C. Gomord V. Faye L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 31-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This structure can subsequently be modified by glycosidases and glycosyltransferases during transport of the glycoprotein through the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the vacuole. Depending on the accessibility of the glycan side chain, these enzymes can convert the precursor to high mannose-type N-glycans ranging from Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 and then to complex-typeN-glycans having an α(1,3)-fucose attached to the proximal glucosamine residue and/or a β(1,2)-xylose residue attached to the β-mannose. These linkages of fucose and xylose are typical for complex N-glycans from plants and invertebrate animals and are not found in mammals. More recently, it was demonstrated that complex N-glycans of plants can also carry Lewis a antennae (24.Fitchette-Lainé A.-C. Gomord V. Michalski J.-C. Saint Macary M. Foucher B. Cavelier B. Hawes C. Lerouge P. Faye L. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25.Melo N.S. Nimtz M. Conradt H.S. Fevereiro P.S. Costa J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When N-glycans are attached to a vacuolar glycoprotein, complex oligosaccharides can be further modified by the elimination of terminal residues (26.Vitale A. Chrispeels M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This last modification results in the formation of truncated oligosaccharide structures, called paucimannosidic-type N-glycans, having only α(1,3)-fucose and/or a β(1,2)-xylose residue linked to the core Man3GlcNAc2 or Man2GlcNAc2 (23.Lerouge P. Cabanes-Macheteau M. Rayon C. Fitchette-Lainé A.-C. Gomord V. Faye L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 31-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both these α(1,3)-fucose and β(1,2)-xylose are (at least partly) responsible for the immunogenicity of plant-glycoproteins in mammals (8.Faye L. Chrispeels M.J. Glycoconj.

McKeating J. Secher D.S. Osborne D.J. Ashford D.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Planta. 1988; 175: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against HRP was shown to contain both anti-fucose and anti-xylose activity. Both activities could be separated into distinct antibody populations by affinity-chromatography with honeybee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (32.Faye L. Gomord V. Fitchette-Lainé A.-C. Chrispeels M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PLA2 carries anN-glycan with α(1,3)-fucose but without β(1,2)-xylose (33.Staudacher E. Altmann F. März L. Hard K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An earlier study by Kurosaka et al. (28.Kurosaka A. Yano A. Itoh N. Kuroda Y. Nakagawa H. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4168-4172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supports these observations by showing decreased binding of a goat antiserum against HRP after defucosylation or dexylosylation of theN-glycan of HRP. Tretter et al. (34.Tretter V. Altmann F. Kubelka V. März L. Becker W.-M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 102: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) used defucosylation of PLA2 to show the involvement of the α(1,3)-fucose in IgE binding. For β(1,2)-xylose, a role in IgE binding has also been suggested mainly on the basis of studies with zucchini-ascorbate oxidase (35.Garcia-Casado G. Sanchez-Monge R. Chrispeels M.J. Armentia A. Salcedo G. Gomez L. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This glycoprotein was originally reported to be nonfucosylated (36.d'Andrea G. Bouwstra J.B. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoconjugate J. 1988; 5: 151-157Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but recent studies have demonstrated that a significant fraction of its N-glycans carries both β(1,2)-xylose and α(1,3)-fucose (37.Altmann F. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Recently, Wilson and Altmann (38.Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 1055-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) analyzed the distribution of various complex and high mannose N-glycans in extracts of different mono- and dicotyledonous pollen. Grass pollens were found to contain predominantly β(1,2)-xylosylated/α(1,3)-fucosylatedN-glycans but no high mannose structures. In contrast, tree pollen also contained high mannose N-glycans. The aim of this study was to determine the structures of three glycoallergenN-glycans and to investigate which structural elements are involved in IgE binding and consequently IgE cross-reactivity. To this end, we determined the primary structure of N-linked glycans from two purified major pollen allergens, Ole e 1 (olive tree) and Lol p 11 (rye grass) and of a purified major food allergen, Ara h 1 (peanut). IgE reactivity to these N-glycans was studied and compared with IgE reactivity to a number of glycoproteins with known primary structures.DISCUSSIONIgE cross-reactivity between pollen and vegetable foods has been explained largely by the presence of homologous proteins in both allergen sources (60.Valenta R. Kraft D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 893-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The best known examples are a pathogenesis-related protein from birch pollen (Bet v 1) and its homologues in fruits and nuts (46.Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Bito A. Valenta R. Kraft D. Rumpold H. Scheiner O. Breitenbach M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1935-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 61.Ebner C. Birkner T. Valenta R. Rumpold H. Breitenbach M. Scheiner O. Kraft D. J. Allergy Clin.

IgE cross-reactivity based on conserved plant N-glycans has attracted far less attention. Only for two major inhalant allergens primary structures of N-glycans were reported: Cry j 1 from Japanese cedar pollen (63.Ogawa H. Hijikata A. Amano M. Kojima K. Fukushima H. Ishizuka I. Kurihara Y. Matsumoto I. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and BG60 from pollen of the subtropical grass Cynodon dactylon (17.Ohsuga H. Su S.-N. Takahashi N. Yang S.-Y. Nakagawa H. Shimada I. Arata Y. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26653-26658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In these studies very little or no attention was given to IgE binding characteristics. To our knowledge, so far no structural data were reported forN-glycans on major food allergens. Our study has for the first time produced structural data on N-glycans from a major allergen of a temperate grass species, a nonconiferous tree and a food, in combination with their IgE binding characteristics.From both affino- and immunodetection on blots with glycan-specific probes and structural analysis by chromatography, NMR, and mass spectrometry, the different major N-linked oligosaccharides were identified. Ole e1 was found to have one major complexN-glycan, GlcNAcMan3XylGlcNAc2, and one major high mannose N-glycan, Man7GlcNAc2. A minor complexN-glycan having an α(1,3)-fucose residue attached to the proximal glucosamine residue was detected on blot but not structurally identified. These structures were also recently reported for a crude olive pollen extract (38.Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 1055-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the extract, however, the most abundant complex N-glycan had two terminalN-acetylglucosamines instead of one. Compared with the structures that were determined on the major tree pollen allergen, Cry j 1, Ole e 1 was poor in fucose (63.Ogawa H. Hijikata A. Amano M. Kojima K. Fukushima H. Ishizuka I. Kurihara Y. Matsumoto I. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both high mannose (Man5GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2) and nonfucosylated complexN-glycans (Man4XylGlcNAc2 and Man3XylGlcNAc2) were identified in Ara h 1. In contrast, Lol p 11 is N-glycosylated exclusively by fucose/xylose-containing complex N-glycans (Man2XylFucGlcNAc2 and Man3XylFucGlcNAc2). The lack of high mannose structures is in agreement with the study by Wilson and Altmann (38.Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 1055-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with pollen extracts. Compared with the structures reported for the Bermuda grass allergen BG60, there is a marked difference. This subtropical allergen carried predominantly nonxylosylated complexN-glycans (17.Ohsuga H. Su S.-N. Takahashi N. Yang S.-Y. Nakagawa H. Shimada I. Arata Y. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26653-26658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).IgE reactivity to protease-resistant structures is a very common feature in pollen-allergic patients (5.van Ree R. Aalberse R.C. J. Clin. Immunoassay. 1993; 16: 124-130Google Scholar). In at least 50% of all sera tested, IgE antibodies against proteinase K-digested pollen extracts were detected. Although involvement of protease-resistant proteins can not be ruled out completely (64.Heiss S. Fischer S. Muller W.D. Hirschwehr R. Spitzauer S. Kraft D. Valenta R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 938-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis revealed no IgE-binding proteins at all. Unexpectedly, IgE responses against digests of grass, tree, and weed pollen demonstrated only low or no significant correlation. In other words, this study has demonstrated that carbohydrate-mediated IgE reactivity can not simply be explained by the presence of highly conserved N-glycan structures with fucose, xylose, or a combination of both. If this simple scheme was valid, a better correlation would have been found between IgE reactivity to e.g. grass pollen digest and birch pollen digest, both with >60% of their N-glycans being xylosylated and fucosylated (38.Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 1055-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, other factors have to be involved besides the mere presence of both monosaccharides.A significant group of sera had IgE antibodies that selectively reacted with only one of the pollen digests. The majority of these sera did not, however, show IgE reactivity to any of the digests of the purified allergens and glycoproteins. It is, therefore, unlikely that these sera recognize similar types of complex N-glycans as present on these glycoproteins. Alternatively, high mannose structures could be involved in IgE binding. This is unlikely from an immunologic perspective because these structures are not unique to plants but are ubiquitous in mammals as well. High mannose N-glycans were reported to be absent in grass pollen extracts in contrast to birch pollen extract (38.Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 1055-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sera with IgE antibodies to birch but not to grass pollen digest were, however, almost without exception negative to the high mannose carrying glycoproteins Ara h 1, Ole e 1, and PHA. Moreover, IgE reactivity was virtually absent to digest of thecgl mutant of Arabidopsis that can only produce high mannose N-glycans. All together, involvement of high mannose structures in IgE binding is unlikely. The observed lack of IgE reactivity with BSA-Lea/Lex excludes Lea antennae, recently reported in plants (24.Fitchette-Lainé A.-C. Gomord V. Michalski J.-C. Saint Macary M. Foucher B. Cavelier B. Hawes C. Lerouge P. Faye L. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25.Melo N.S. Nimtz M. Conradt H.S. Fevereiro P.S. Costa J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as a possible explanation for the observed discrepancies. An alternative explanation could be IgE reactivity to O-linked glycans. This has been described for allergens from invertebrate animals (65.Ohta M. Shigeta S. Ono K. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Oka S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) but so far not for plants. Currently, IgE reactivity toO-linked glycans on plant glycoproteins is under investigation.Characterization of IgE responses against N-glycans using purified glycoproteins turned out to be more problematic than we originally thought. This is most likely caused by the variability of glycosylation observed in plant glycoproteins. A singleN-glycosylation site usually carries a large variety of structurally different but closely related carbohydrate structures (microheterogeneity). With time the number of identifiedN-glycans/site increases. This is clearly illustrated by reports on HRP (31.McManus M.T. McKeating J. Secher D.S. Osborne D.J. Ashford D.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W.

Nevertheless, a minor form could have relevance for IgE binding. Both Ara h 1 and Ole e 1 carry nonfucosylated complex N-glycans, but their IgE reactivity is completely different. Part of the explanation for this discrepancy could be the presence of a minor fucosylated glycan on Ole e 1, that is absent on Ara h 1.Another problem that was encountered is that the presence of a xylose was not always a “guarantee” for IgE recognition. Recognition of the xylose appears to be dependent on the degree of substitution of the core mannose influencing the conformation of the epitope. In bromelain, only an α(1,6)-linked mannose is present next to the β(1,2)-xylose (58.van Kuik J.A. Hoffmann R.A. Mutsaers J.H.G.M. van Halbeek H. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoconjugate J. 1986; 3: 27-34Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In Lol p 11, this type of complex N-glycan is of major importance as well. This simple form has not been reported for any of the other glycoproteins tested (31.McManus M.T. McKeating J. Secher D.S. Osborne D.J. Ashford D.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W.

Despite the presence of a xylose in HRP, its IgE reactivity correlates better with the nonxylosylated PLA2 (33.Staudacher E. Altmann F. März L. Hard K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 68.Kubelka V. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Tretter V. März L. Hard K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) than with bromelain or Lol p 11. The most likely explanation of this phenomenon is that additional substitutions to the core mannose sterically hamper IgE binding to the xylose-containing epitope. To exclude that fucose reactivity played a role in the observed differences, bromelain glycopeptide was defucosylated. This allowed comparison between two xylosylated glycans only differing in their degree of substitution of the core mannose, BRO-fuc and PHA-fuc. RAST analysis demonstrated that BRO-fuc was still recognized by IgE from sera that were unreactive with PHA-fuc, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the α(1,3)-mannose in PHA-fuc prevented IgE recognition. Finally, another potentially complexing factor is the interaction between the monosaccharide residues of the N-glycan and the peptide backbone. Differences in adjacent peptide sequences can have different effects on the structure and mobility of the N-glycan. For bromelain it was reported that mobility of its N-glycan is increased in a small glycopeptide compared with the native glycoprotein (69.Lommerse J.P.M. Kroon-Batenburg L.M.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8196-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because HRP and PHA were found to be very resistant to proteinase K digestion, this could have negatively influenced the mobility of their glycan structures and thereby their IgE binding capacity, compared with those glycoproteins that were readily digested.Despite all these complexing factors, this study has established the postulated role (35.Garcia-Casado G. Sanchez-Monge R. Chrispeels M.J. Armentia A. Salcedo G. Gomez L. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) for β(1,2)-xylose in IgE binding and confirmed the involvement of α(1,3)-fucose (34.Tretter V. Altmann F. Kubelka V. März L. Becker W.-M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 102: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These conclusions are largely based upon the comparison of the IgE binding characteristics of PHAversus PHA-fuc and of Lol p 11 and bromelainversus PLA2. The primary structures that were elucidated of the N-glycans on two major inhalant allergens and a major food allergen are an important prerequisite for further studies into IgE binding carbohydrate epitopes and their role in pollen-vegetable food cross-reactivity. In the early 1980s, it was reported for the first time that IgE antibodies in sera of pollen allergic patients can be directed to carbohydrate determinants on glycoproteins (1.Aalberse R.C. Koshte V. Clemens J.G.J. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1981; 66 Suppl. 1: 259-260Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Aalberse R.C. Koshte V. Clemens J.G.J. J. Allergy Clin.

Recent Developments in RAST and Other Solid-phase Immunoassay Systems. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1983Google Scholar). The carbohydrate nature of these epitopes was supported by several characteristic properties, such as their periodate sensitivity and their resistance to heating and protease digestion. IgE antibodies directed to these carbohydrate structures were shown to be extremely cross-reactive not only between different plant-derived glycoproteins but also to glycoproteins from invertebrate animals (e.g. seafood and insect venoms) (2.Aalberse R.C.

This high degree of cross-reactivity was explained by the conserved structure of N-glycans from plants and invertebrate animals, sharing several features that are not found in mammalian N-glycans (8.Faye L.

The auxiliary β subunits do not form the ion conducting pore, yet play important roles in channel modulation and plasma membrane expression. β1 and β2 are transmembrane proteins with one extracellular V-set immunoglobulin (Ig) protein domain. It has been shown recently that β1 and β2 interact with the extracellular matrix proteins tenascin-C and tenascin-R. In the present study we show that rat brain β1 and β2, but not αIIA, subunits interact in a trans-homophilic fashion, resulting in recruitment of the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin to sites of cell-cell contact in transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Whereas αIIA subunits expressed alone do not cause cellular aggregation, β subunits co-expressed with αIIA retain the ability to adhere and recruit ankyrin. Truncated β subunits lacking cytoplasmic domains interact homophilically to produce cell aggregation but do not recruit ankyrin. Thus, the cytoplasmic domains of β1 and β2 are required for cytoskeletal interactions.

However, it is not known to which sodium channel subunit ankyrin binds. Because β1 and β2 are structurally and functionally homologous to CAMs of the Ig superfamily, we predicted that they would also interact with ankyrin.The ankyrins are a family of spectrin-binding proteins associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane in many cell types (23.Bennett V.

The membrane binding domain of ankyrin contains four subdomains that are each composed of six ankyrin repeats (24.Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggest that ankyrin is a multivalent molecule and can form lateral homophilic and heterophilic complexes between integral membrane proteins (25.Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Neurofascin and NrCAM, members of the L1 family of CAMs, have been shown to be colocalized with ankyrinG and sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier in peripheral nerve and axon initial segments of cerebellar Purkinje cells (26.Davis J.Q. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that clustering of neurofascin and NrCAM precedes the redistribution of ankyrinG, suggesting that these CAMs may determine the initial site for subsequent assembly of ankyrinG and sodium channels to form the node of Ranvier (26.Davis J.Q. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).The present study defines sodium channel β1 and β2 subunits as CAMs using the well characterized Drosophila Schneider's line 2 (S2) cell transfection system (27.Bieber A.J. Goldstein L. Fryberg E. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 683-696Google Scholar). We demonstrate that rat brain β1 or β2 subunit-transfected S2 cells (β subunits alone or β subunits co-expressed with αIIA subunits) exhibit strong homophilic cell adhesion leading to ankyrin recruitment at sites of cell-cell contact. αIIA subunits expressed alone in S2 cells do not cause cellular aggregation. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domains of β1 or β2 resulted in proteins that induced S2 cell adhesion, yet were not able to recruit ankyrin, demonstrating that these domains play essential roles in interaction with Drosophila ankyrin. These data suggest that sodium channel β subunits and ankyrinG may interact at nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments. Thus, it appears that sodium channel β subunits play dual roles: channel modulation and cell adhesion. We hypothesize that β subunits create a critical communication link between extracellular signaling molecules and the cytoskeleton.RESULTSIt has been shown previously that many CAMs interact homophilically in a trans-mechanism to produce cellular aggregation. Following homophilic binding, CAMs of the L1 family transduce signals resulting in the recruitment of ankyrin and spectrin to points of cell-cell contact (13.Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G. Dissanayake S.

Drosophila S2 cells are a classic model system in which potential CAMs have been tested for these properties (14.Hortsch M. Bieber A.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 283-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27.Bieber A.J. Goldstein L. Fryberg E. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 683-696Google Scholar). Untransfected S2 cells show no tendency to adhere to each other or to tissue culture plastic and thus grow as a suspension culture (27.Bieber A.J. Goldstein L. Fryberg E. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 683-696Google Scholar). Untransfected S2 cells do not express detectable sodium channel β1 or β2 subunits (Fig.1 A). In addition, [3H]STX binding analysis showed no detectable tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channel α subunits present (TableI). Because Drosophila para sodium channels are tetrodotoxin-sensitive, actually 10-fold more sensitive to tetrodotoxin than mammalian brain type IIA sodium channels (33.Warmke J.W. Reenan R.A. Wang P.

S2 cells that have been transfected with CAM cDNAs aggregate following the induction of protein expression with CuSO4. Using the S2 cell model system we investigated whether sodium channel α, β1, and β2 subunits behave in a similar manner. S2 cells were cotransfected with αIIA (in ZemRVSP6–2580, driven by the mouse metallothionein promoter) and/or β1 or β2 (in pRmHa3) cDNAs and a plasmid conferring α-amanitin resistance to produce the following cell lines: α alone, β1 alone, β2 alone, α + β1, and α + β2. α-Amanitin-resistant cells were then cloned using the soft agar method (27.Bieber A.J. Goldstein L. Fryberg E. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 683-696Google Scholar), tested by Western blot for αIIA or β subunit expression (Fig. 1, B andC), and expanded for experimentation. As shown in Fig.2, S2 cells transfected with β1, β2, α + β1, or α + β2 form aggregates following induction with CuSO4 and mechanical shaking. In contrast, untransfected (data not shown), mock transfected (data not shown), or αIIA-transfected cells (lowest panel) treated similarly did not aggregate, demonstrating that the observed aggregation was dependent on β subunit expression.Table I[ 3 H]Saxitoxin binding analysis of untransfected S2 cells versus rat brain membranesSamplepmol of [3H]STX bound/mg of protein (SEM), n = 3Untransfected S2 cells0Rat brain membranes2.16 (0.050)[3H]STX binding was performed on whole S2 cells and on rat brain cortex membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specific binding data were normalized to protein concentration.

In contrast, the distribution of ankyrin in untransfected or αIIA-transfected S2 cells was diffuse (data not shown). These results suggest that sodium channel β subunits function similarly to L1-type CAMs; they bind homophilically in a trans-mechanism, recruit ankyrin to points of cell-cell contact, and interact with extracellular matrix molecules, as shown previously (10.Srinivasan J.

Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained withDrosophila anti-ankyrin antibody (1:200 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100 dilution) and viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope attached to a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Two different views of each cell line are presented for comparison.Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that the observed β subunit-induced aggregation was truly homophilic and not the result of heterophilic interactions involving an unidentified molecule endogenous to S2 cells, we performed mixing experiments with transfected and untransfected cells in which the untransfected cells were prelabeled with DiI. As shown in Fig.4, aggregation of mixed populations of labeled untransfected cells and β1-transfected (A andB) or β2-transfected (C and D) cells resulted in unlabeled aggregates only. No significant inclusion of labeled S2 cells into cell clusters was observed. We show in Fig. 4,E–H that DiI labeling of transfected S2 cells does not interfere with cell aggregation; DiI-labeled, unmixed β1- or β2-transfected cells were able to form large, fluorescent aggregates. Thus, we conclude that β1 and β2 interact homophilically to induce cell aggregation and ankyrin recruitment.Figure 4β subunit-induced aggregation does not involve heterophilic interactions with other, endogenous S2 cell proteins.

The scale of magnification is the same as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next tested whether the intracellular domains of β1 and β2 are critical for ankyrin recruitment. β1STOP and β2STOP truncation mutants lacking 34 or 27 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of β1 or β2, respectively, (Fig.5 A) were subcloned into pRmHa3, transfected into S2 cells, and tested by Western blot (Fig.1 B). No apparent shift in mobility was observed between β1 and β1STOP on mini gels, as the two proteins only differed in molecular weight by approximately 3.7 kDa. β subunits migrate anomalously high on SDS-PAGE because of their extensive glycosylation and this likely accounts for the equivalent mobilities of β1 and β1STOP on mini gels. Because we do not presently have an antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain of β2, we were only able to test the β1STOP cells for protein expression. However, because β2STOP and β1STOP cells aggregated and untransfected cells did not, we could be reasonably confident that the β2STOP protein was expressed. Although both cell lines aggregated in response to CuSO4, ankyrin staining was diffuse and not localized to points of cell-cell contact (Fig. 5 B, lower panels) in contrast to cells expressing full-length β subunits (Fig. 3). Quantitative analysis of ankyrin recruitment to cell contact sites in S2 cells expressing full-length versus truncated β subunits is presented in Table II. We found that 81% of cell contact sites viewed in β1-expressing S2 cells and 79% of cell contact sites viewed in β2-expressing S2 cells clearly displayed ankyrin recruitment. In contrast, 0% of 100 cell-cell contacts viewed in β1STOP- or β2STOP-expressing S2 cells displayed ankyrin recruitment. These data suggest that the intracellular COOH-terminal domains of β1 and β2 are necessary for ankyrin recruitment yet are not necessary for cell aggregation.Figure 5β subunit-mediated ankyrin recruitment requires β subunit cytoplasmic domains.

We and others have shown previously that mammalian β subunits participate in modulation of the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation, channel gating mode, as well as channel expression levels at the plasma membrane (4.Isom L.L.

Data from our research group have recently demonstrated that β subunits expressed in the absence of α subunits interact with the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-R, resulting in cell migration (11.Xiao Z.-C. Ragsdale D.S. Malhotra J.D. Mattei L.N. Braun P.E. Schachner M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26511-26517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that β subunits play roles intrans-homophilic cell adhesion and recruitment of ankyrin to the plasma membrane both in the presence and the absence of α subunits. Thus, β subunits appear to have dual functionalities: as channel modulators and as cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, β subunits may have some functions that are independent of α subunits.The ankyrin binding domains of a number of proteins have been reported. Comparison of the intracellular domains of β1 and β2 with three of these reported sequences: 1) the ankyrin binding domain consensus sequence for L1 CAM family members (QFNEDGSFIGQY) (15.Hortsch M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); 2) the CD44 ankyrin binding domain (NSGNGAVEDRKPSGL) (35.Zhu D. Bourguigon L.Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); and 3) the α-Na, K-ATPase ankyrin binding domain (SYYQEAKSSKIMESFKNMVPQQALV) (36.Zhang Z. Devarajan P. Dorfman A.L. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18681-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) revealed no similarities. Phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine residue in the ankyrin binding domain of neurofascin regulates ankyrin interactions (34.Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of β1 does contain a tyrosine residue, similar to L1 CAM family members. The potential importance of this tyrosine in ankyrin recruitment will be interesting to investigate in the future. Alternatively, it is possible that β1 and β2 require an intermediary protein for ankyrin recruitment and thus do not contain ankyrin binding domains.What do these results mean in terms of neuronal development? Bennett and colleagues (20.Kordeli E. Davis J. Trapp B. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26.Davis J.Q. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) have shown through a number of elegant studies that ankyrinG, the CAMs neurofascin, NrCAM, and voltage-gated sodium channels colocalize at the axonal membrane of the adult node of Ranvier in specialized membrane domains. Early clusters of neurofascin and NrCAM are joined later by ankyrinG and sodium channels during differentiation of myelinated axons. Formation of the node of Ranvier may thus result from the fusion of two cluster intermediates. These investigators have proposed that an ankyrinG-mediated link between neurofascin and NrCAM and ion channels would allow these CAMs to localize sodium channels in the axonal membrane. Furthermore, they proposed that sodium channel β2 subunits, because of their homology to F3/contactin, may interact in a lateral or cis fashion with NrCAM and thus contribute to sodium channel localization. The present study expands this model to include a direct link between sodium channels and ankyrinGthrough the auxiliary β subunits (Fig.6). The multivalent membrane binding domain of ankyrin (24.Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may allow interaction with multiple CAMs, including neurofascin, NrCAM, as well as sodium channel β subunits. It will be interesting in the future to determine whether β1 and β2 subunits participate in the initial CAM clustering and then recruit ankyrinG and the sodium channel α subunit to that microdomain, such that sodium channel subunit association occurs at the level of the plasma membrane, or whether α, β1, and β2 subunits are recruited to the plasma membrane as a complex by the initial neurofascin/NrCAM cluster.Figure 6Model of β subunit-ankyrin interactions. Two possible mechanisms for sodium channel β subunit-ankyrin interactions are presented. As previously proposed (26.Davis J.Q. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), β subunits may interact via acis-heterophilic mechanism with NrCAM or neurofascin. NrCAM and neurofascin bind ankyrin following trans-homophilic interactions with the same molecule on an adjacent neuron. Thus, interaction of β subunits with ankyrin by this mechanism is indirect. Alternatively, as suggested by the present study, β subunits may bind ankyrin directly following trans-homophilic interactions with β subunits on adjacent neurons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)β1 subunit mRNA expression has been described in sciatic nerve Schwann cells (37.Oh Y.

https://openalex.org/W2075731394,"Although many effects of leptin are mediated through the central nervous system, leptin can regulate metabolism through a direct action on peripheral tissues, such as fat and liver. We show here that leptin, at physiological concentrations, acts through an intracellular signaling pathway similar to that activated by insulin in isolated primary rat hepatocytes. This pathway involves stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) binding to insulin receptor substrate-1 and insulin receptor substrate-2, activation of PI3K and protein kinase B (AKT), and PI3K-dependent activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B, a cAMP-degrading enzyme. One important function of this signaling pathway is to reduce levels of cAMP, because leptin-mediated activation of both protein kinase B and phosphodiesterase 3B is most marked following elevation of cAMP by glucagon, and because leptin suppresses glucagon-induced cAMP elevation in a PI3K-dependent manner. There is little or no expression of the long form leptin receptor in primary rat hepatocytes, and these signaling events are probably mediated through the short forms of the leptin receptor. Thus, leptin, like insulin, induces an intracellular signaling pathway in hepatocytes that culminates in cAMP degradation and an antagonism of the actions of glucagon.

The different leptin receptors arise from alternative splicing, and although the extracellular domains of these splice variants are identical, differences are apparent in the intracellular signaling domain. The splice variants containing transmembrane domains can be divided into two groups: one group that has short 32–97 amino acid residue intracellular domains (OB-Ra, -Rc, -Rd, -Rf, and a unique form expressed in hematopoietic cells, termed Rg here) and another group (OB-Rb) that has a long 302-residue intracellular domain (10.White D.W.

Accordingly, leptin increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissuein vivo (11.Kamohara S. Burcelin R. Halaas J.L. Friedman J.M. Charron M.J.

Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Peripheral leptin injections have been found to lower hepatic glucose production by decreasing both glycogenolysis in fasted mice and ob/ob mice that lack endogenous leptin (26.Turner S.M. Linfoot P.A. Neese R.A. Hellerstein M.K. Diabetes. 1998; 47 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): 1081Google Scholar). Leptin also markedly enhances the inhibitory effects of insulin on glycogenolysis and hepatic glucose production in liver in vivo (27.Rossetti L. Massillon D. Barzilai N. Vuguin P. Chen W. Hawkins M. Wu J. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27758-27763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and in hepatocytes in vitro (28.Nemecz M. Preininger K. Englisch R. Furnsinn C. Schneider B. Waldhausl W. Roden M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Overexpression of leptin in rats reduces hepatic glycogen loss during fasting, most likely by reducing glycogenolysis (29.O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P.R. Zhao A.Z. Bornfeldt K.E. Newgard C.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E544-E550PubMed Google Scholar), and leptin increases glycogen synthesis in perfused mouse liver (30.Cohen S.M. Werrmann J.G. Tota M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7385-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some of the effects of leptin described above appear to be mediated by the central nervous system (11.Kamohara S. Burcelin R.

However, two recent studies on perfused rat liver and isolated rat primary hepatocytes demonstrate a direct suppressive effect of high concentrations of leptin on phosphorylase and glycogenolysis (28.Nemecz M.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because liver is one of the major regulators of blood glucose, and as such, a target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, we decided to investigate direct effects of physiological concentrations of leptin on isolated primary hepatocytes. We focused our studies on signaling pathways likely to result in suppression of hepatic glucose production and glycogenolysis, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB) (33.Cross D.A.

Here we show that physiological levels (1–5 nm) of leptin indeed have direct effects on primary rat hepatocytes, leading to activation of PI3K and PDE3B and subsequent antagonism of glucagon-mediated cAMP elevation. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that leptin, like insulin, is capable of activating PKB under conditions where cAMP is elevated. Recombinant mouse leptin was obtained from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ), recombinant human insulin, and glucagon were obtained from Sigma. Protein kinase inhibitor peptide, a peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD), and Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG) were synthesized at the peptide synthesis facility, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Seattle, WA or purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The IRS-1 C-terminal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-IRS-2 antibody, the PKB antibody, and PKB assay kit were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against leptin receptors was generated against a hybrid protein containing a stretch of the extracellular domain of the mouse leptin receptor (amino acids 634–784) fused to the coding sequences of glutathioneS-transferase. The glutathione S-transferase-OB-R fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity before injection into rabbits for immunization. The resultant polyclonal antibody recognizes all known splice variants of leptin receptors. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were used for isolation of primary hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were prepared using the two step collagenase perfusion method, as described previously (38.Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar, 39.Sidhu J.S. Farin F.M. Omiecinski C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After isolation, the cells were washed three times in William's E medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma), 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), 6.25 μg/ml transferrin, 6.25 μg/ml selenious acid, 1 μm insulin (Beckton-Dickinson, Bedford, MA), and 5.35 μg/ml linoleic acid (Sigma). The cells were centrifuged at 50 ×g for 2 min between washes. Cell viability, as estimated by trypan blue exclusion, was routinely above 80% following this procedure. The cells were plated on collagen type I-coated plates in the above medium at 8–10 million cells/100-mm dish or at 0.5 million cells/well in 12-well plates for cAMP measurements. The cells were allowed to adhere onto the culture dishes for 1.5 h (80–90% of the viable cells attach during this time). The cells were washed two times with serum-free William's E medium and then incubated in serum-free William's E medium with 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 25 nm dexamethasone without selenious acid, transferrin, and insulin. The cells were stimulated and harvested 18–24 h after the medium change, as described below. Cells in 100-mm dishes were stimulated with leptin and insulin in the presence and absence of glucagon and then lysed in 1 ml of PDE3B lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaSO4, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 μm Na3VO4, 100 nm calyculin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μmbenzamidine, and 0.5% Lubrol. The cell lysates were scraped and briefly sonicated for 10 s using a Braun-Sonic 2000 sonicator at 50% output. The samples were then centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 × g in a microfuge. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were quantitated using the BCA® protein assay (Pierce). For each assay, 4 μg of an anti-pleckstrin homology domain PKB peptide sheep antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was preincubated with protein G-Sepharose in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing the protein G-Sepharose complex, 1 mg of protein extract was added to the complex, and the incubation was continued for 90 min. The samples were then assayed for PKB activities using a PKB assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The assays were initiated by the addition of assay mix containing [γ-32P]ATP. The final concentrations in the assay were 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.4), 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1.33 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 15 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 10 μmprotein kinase inhibitor, and 0.1 mm Crosstide. After an incubation for 10 min at 30 °C with shaking, the addition of 40 μl of trichloroacetic acid terminated the reactions, and 40 μl of the reaction mix was then spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, Hillsboro, OR). The P-81 papers were washed three times in 150 mm phosphoric acid and once in methanol. The radioactivity associated with the papers was then measured in 2 ml of Ecolume scintillation fluid (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA). To investigate if PKB is phosphorylated following insulin or leptin stimulation, we utilized an antibody that specifically detects PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) in Western blot analysis. The same protein samples were also run on parallel gels and probed for total PKB expression using a rabbit anti-PKB antibody generated against the pleckstrin homology domain (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Expression of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 in primary rat hepatocytes was detected using Western blot analyses. Immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 was carried out by incubating 1 mg of protein of hepatocyte cell lysate with IRS-1 or IRS-2 antibodies overnight. Following precipitation of the immunocomplexes with protein A-Sepharose, the beads were washed three times in the PDE3B lysis buffer as described above. PI3K activity was immunoprecipitated using antibodies directed against tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (PY20, Transduction Laboratories), IRS-1 or IRS-2. The PI3K assay and subsequent thin-layer chromatography were carried out according to a standard protocol with phosphatidylinositol (Avanti, Pelham, AL) as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (12.Zhao A.Z. Bornfeldt K.E. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Immediately after hormonal treatments, the hepatocytes were lysed and incubated in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid overnight. Five μl of the lysates were neutralized in 20 μl of 0.1 m Tris to a final pH of 7. The cAMP assay was then carried out using a radioimmunoassay kit from NEN Life Science Products. Primary hepatocytes were treated with leptin or insulin in the presence or absence of glucagon for the indicated periods of time. Immunoprecipitation of PDE3B as well as the assay of PDE3B activity was carried out according to a protocol published previously, using 1 μm cAMP as a substrate (40.Yan C. Zhao A.Z. Bentley J.K. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9677-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PDE3B activity was normalized to the quantity of immunoprecipitated PDE3B as shown on Western blots and was expressed as pmol hydrolyzed cAMP/min/density unit of the PDE3B band. To study the direct effects of leptin and insulin on hepatocytes, we chose a culture system that allows investigation of differentiated primary hepatocytes with preserved physiologically relevant signaling pathways. For example, insulin does not activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) in these cells (data not shown) or fetal primary hepatocytes (41.Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G1078-G1086PubMed Google Scholar), whereas many hepatoma cell lines show a marked activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases following insulin treatment (42.Barroso I. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17997-18004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Initial studies were carried out to identify the major leptin receptor in these primary rat hepatocytes. We generated an anti-OB-R antibody that recognizes all known variants of leptin receptors. Western blot analysis using this antibody revealed both the long form (OB-Rb) and short forms of the leptin receptor in samples prepared from hypothalamus (Fig. 1). However, we detected specific immunoreactive bands only near 100 kDa, representing the short forms of leptin receptors, in isolated hepatocytes (Fig. 1). Notably, we did not see OB-Rb in the rat primary hepatocytes even with extensive exposures. Although we cannot completely rule out the existence of very low levels of OB-Rb, the molecular signaling events discussed below are most likely mediated through the short forms of the leptin receptor. Our previous studies, as well as studies by others, have shown that leptin activates PI3K in cell types such as C2C12 myotubes and pancreatic β-cells (12.Zhao A.Z. Bornfeldt K.E. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25.Berti L. Kellerer M. Capp E. Häring H.U.

Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To measure activation of PI3K in the primary hepatocytes, proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues were immunoprecipitated, and PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitates was measured. Both leptin and insulin activated PI3K more than 3-fold in hepatocytes, as shown in Fig. 2. Glucagon, a hormone that stimulates hepatic glucose production and glycogenolysis, also activated PI-3 kinase but did not affect the activation of PI3K by leptin or insulin (Fig. 2). To gain further understanding of the mechanism of action of leptin to activate PI3K, we examined the association of the p85 subunit of PI3K with IRS-1 and IRS-2 and the PI3K activity associated with IRS-1 and -2. The primary rat hepatocytes expressed significant amounts of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, as judged by Western blot analysis (data not shown). We immunoprecipitated either IRS-1 or IRS-2 and analyzed the PI3K activity as well as the level of p85 in the immunoprecipitates. Both insulin and leptin were found to stimulate the association of p85 with IRS-1 as well as IRS-2 and to increase PI3K activities in both immunoprecipitates (Fig.3). Glucagon did not affect the binding of p85 to IRS-1 or IRS-2 in the presence of insulin or leptin (data not shown).Figure 3Leptin induces association of PI3K activity with IRS-1 and -2. Rat primary hepatocytes were stimulated with 10 nm insulin or 2 nm leptin (Lept) and then lysed. IRS-1 and -2 were immunoprecipitated by using anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitation pellets were divided in two parts for PI3K activity assay (upper panel) and Western blot assays (lower panels). Like insulin, leptin induced the association of p85 and PI3K activity with both IRS-1 and IRS-2.

To investigate if leptin activates PKB in primary hepatocytes, PKB was immunoprecipitated, and its activity measured using in vitro kinase assays. In the absence of glucagon, insulin had an ∼2.5-fold stimulatory effect, whereas leptin had no obvious effect on PKB activity (Fig.4 A). However, in the presence of glucagon, leptin (2 and 5 nm) significantly stimulated PKB activity, and insulin also displayed greater stimulatory effect on PKB in the presence of glucagon (Fig. 4 A). We next utilized an antibody that detects PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473, one of the two phosphorylation sites required for the full activation of PKB. Stimulation of the hepatocytes with either insulin or leptin resulted in a weak or undetectable phosphorylation of PKB on Ser-473 (Fig.4 B). However, phosphorylation of PKB on Ser-473 by both insulin and leptin was greatly enhanced in the presence of glucagon (Fig. 4 B). We also took advantage of the fact that phosphorylated active PKB migrates slower than nonphosphorylated inactive PKB on SDS gels. As shown by Fig. 4 B, both insulin and leptin caused a band-shift of PKB in the presence of glucagon, whereas no band-shift was observed in the absence of glucagon. The abilities of insulin and leptin to stimulate phosphorylation of Ser-473 and to cause a band-shift of PKB following exposure of the cells to glucagon are consistent with the activity profile of PKB (Fig.4 A). Activation of PDE3B is a PI3K-dependent process (12.Zhao A.Z. Bornfeldt K.E. Beavo J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 36.Manganiello V.C. Degerman E. Taira M. Kono T. Belfrage P. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate if PDE3B is activated by leptin in primary hepatocytes, PDE3B activity from hepatocytes stimulated with leptin or insulin in the presence or absence of 10 nm glucagon was measured. As shown in Fig.5 A, both leptin and insulin mildly activate PDE3B in the absence of glucagon (the stimulatory effect ranging from 50 to 80%). Glucagon (10 nm) by itself also had a stimulatory effect (∼ 80%) on PDE3B activity (Fig.5 A). In the presence of glucagon, insulin (10 nm) further stimulated PDE3B activity ∼50% relative to that in glucagon-treated cells, whereas physiological concentrations of leptin (2 or 5 nm) activated the PDE3B more than 2-fold (Fig. 5 A). This activation was maintained for at least 1 h following hormone treatment (data not shown). We also tested the effects of PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (20 nm) and LY294002 (2 μm), on the activation of PDE3B in the primary hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 5 B, both inhibitors eliminated the stimulatory effect of insulin and leptin on PDE3B activity. These results indicate that activation of PDE3B by either insulin or leptin is dependent on PI3K. Because PDE3B is a cAMP-hydrolyzing PDE, an activation of PDE3B would be expected to lead to the reduction of cAMP levels. To investigate if this is indeed the case, cells were incubated with or without 10 nm glucagon for 10 min and then stimulated with insulin or leptin for 15 min. Glucagon increased cAMP levels approximately 10-fold (compare Fig. 6, A andB). Insulin and leptin did not affect basal cAMP levels (Fig. 6 A) but significantly reduced glucagon-stimulated cAMP levels by ∼50% (Fig. 6 B). A specific inhibitor of PDE3, milrinone, at 10 μm (IC50 = 0.3 μm) blocked the reduction of cAMP levels induced by leptin and insulin (Fig. 6 B). The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (20 nm) also completely reversed the inhibitory effect of insulin or leptin on cAMP (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the ability of insulin and leptin to reduce glucagon-stimulated cAMP accumulation is because of a PI3K-dependent activation of PDE3B. We show here that physiological concentrations of leptin (1–5 nm) induce intracellular signaling events through a direct action in isolated differentiated rat hepatocytes. Further, the signaling pathway induced is a well known insulin-stimulated pathway that includes IRS-1 and IRS-2, PI3K, PKB, and PDE3B. The present study thus supports the concept that important physiologic actions of leptin are mediated through endocrine actions directly on target tissues and that not all effects of leptin are mediated through the central nervous system. This concept is further supported by the presence of short forms of leptin receptors capable of inducing signaling events in hepatocytes and a myotube cell line (43.Kellerer M. Koch M. Metzinger E. Mushack J. Capp E. Häring H.U. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 46.Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Science. 1996; 274: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). By designing a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all known splice variants of the leptin receptor we show expression of both the long form, OB-Rb, and short forms in the hypothalamus, whereas expression in isolated hepatocytes is limited to the short forms of the leptin receptor. The lack of OB-Rb in hepatocytes is consistent with previous reports using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection assays of whole liver (19.Wang M.Y. Zhou Y.T. Newgard C.B."
https://openalex.org/W1985491147,"β-Arrestins can act as adapter molecules, coupling G-protein-coupled receptors to proteins involved in mitogenic as well as endocytic pathways. We have previously identified c-SRC as a molecule that is rapidly recruited to the β2-adrenergic receptor in a β-arrestin1-dependent manner. Recruitment of c-SRC to the receptor appears to be involved in pathways leading to receptor internalization and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. This recruitment of c-SRC to the receptor involves an interaction between the amino-terminal proline-rich region of β-arrestin1 and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of c-SRC, but deletion of the proline-rich domain does not totally ablate the interaction. We have found that a major interaction also exists between β-arrestin1 and the catalytic or kinase domain (SH1) of c-SRC. We therefore hypothesized that a catalytically inactive mutant of the isolated catalytic subunit, SH1(kinase dead) (SH1(KD)), would specifically block those cellular actions of c-SRC that are mediated by β-arrestin1 recruitment to the G-protein-coupled receptor. In contrast, the majority of cellular phosphorylations catalyzed by c-SRC, which do not involve interaction with the SH1 domain, would be predicted to be unaffected. The SH1(KD) mutant did indeed block β2-adrenergic receptor internalization and receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, actions previously shown to be c-SRC-dependent. In contrast, SAM-68 and whole cell tyrosine phosphorylation by c-SRC was unaffected, indicating that the SH1(KD) mutant did not inhibit c-SRC tyrosine kinase activity in general. These results not only clarify the nature of the β-arrestin1/c-SRC interaction but also implicate β-arrestin1 as an important mediator of receptor internalization by recruiting tyrosine kinase activity to the cell surface to phosphorylate key endocytic intermediates, such as dynamin. β-Arrestins can act as adapter molecules, coupling G-protein-coupled receptors to proteins involved in mitogenic as well as endocytic pathways.

G-protein-coupled receptor β2-adrenergic receptor kinase dead Src homology Src-associated mitosis 68 kDa epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type hemagglutinin Agonist stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 leads to the activation of a wide variety of signaling pathways including modulation of adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, ion channels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (1.Lefkowitz R.J.

Following agonist occupancy, receptors such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) undergo a conformational change, which in turn allows binding to and activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Many of these signaling pathways are activated as a direct result of G-protein dissociation catalyzed by the ligand-bound receptor. The processes by which GPCR signaling are terminated are complex and involve mechanisms related to modulation of receptor numbers, as well as mechanisms related to interaction of the activated receptor with additional proteins, termed arrestins, that “uncouple” the GPCR from its cognate G-protein (5.Hausdorff W.P.

Cell. 1987; 48: 913-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptor kinases are recruited to the activated receptor, followed by Ser/Thr phosphorylation and finally recruitment of the arrestins to the phosphorylated receptor (9.Lin F.T.

Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also indicates that following recruitment to the activated receptor, β-arrestin1 undergoes dephosphorylation at serine residue 412 that is crucial for the endocytic function of β-arrestin1 (9.Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recruitment of arrestins to the agonist-occupied receptor serves to physically prevent the bound G-proteins from further interaction with the receptor (11.Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated arrestin-bound receptors are then internalized and subsequently either dephosphorylated and recycled to the plasma membrane or targeted for degradation. Although binding of the arrestins to the GPCR can terminate G-protein signaling by sterically inhibiting interaction of the G-protein with the receptor, recent evidence indicates that the arrestins may have additional roles in both termination of receptor signaling and signaling to downstream effectors (1.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 12.Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The additional roles for the arrestins are related to its now recognized ability to serve as an adapter molecule to recruit additional proteins to the signaling complex. The first recognized of these proteins was the clathrin heavy chain (13.Goodman O.J. Krupnick J. Santini F. Gurevich V. Penn R. Gagnon A. Keen J. Benovic J.

The β-arrestins also interact with several additional molecules potentially involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including the clathrin adapter protein AP2 and the intracellular transport ATPase NSF (18.McDonald P.H.

It is likely that interaction of the β-arrestins with various parts of the clathrin assembly machinery serves to modulate receptor endocytosis. We have recently shown that β-arrestin1 can interact with the tyrosine kinase c-SRC (17.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). c-SRC is a modular protein consisting of amino-terminal SH3 and SH2 domains in addition to the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. Analysis of c-SRC binding using β-arrestin1 mutants indicates that the amino-terminal 185 amino acids of β-arrestin1 contain the essential region required for c-SRC binding (17.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). A β-arrestin1 molecule from which the first 185 amino acids have been deleted fails to bind c-SRC. Mutation of the proline residues in the amino terminus of β-arrestin1 decreases, but does not ablate, binding to c-SRC. This suggests that although the SH3 domain of c-SRC is involved in β-arrestin1 binding, other determinants may also exist. Members of the c-SRC family play key roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Phosphorylation of c-SRC at tyrosine 530 induces a conformational change in the molecule that reduces its kinase activity (20.Shalloway D. Taylor S. Trends Cell Biology. 1997; 7: 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 opens the conformation of c-SRC, thereby activating the tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of proteins with the SH3 domain of c-SRC also can lead to its activation (21.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T.

Upon stimulation of the β2-AR, Tyr-530 dephosphorylated c-SRC rapidly associates with the receptor in a β-arrestin1-dependent manner (17.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S.

This recruitment of active c-SRC to the β2-AR results in tyrosine phosphorylation of molecules such as Shc and Gab1, ultimately leading to activation of the Ras pathway (24.Luttrell L.M.

Whereas β-arrestin1-mediated recruitment of c-SRC to an activated GPCR may lead to stimulation of proliferative pathways such as the Ras pathway, recent evidence suggests that c-SRC recruitment may also play a role in activation of the endocytosis pathway (32.Wilde A.

Dynamin, which is known to mediate fission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane, becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in a c-SRC-dependent manner following stimulation of the β2-AR with agonist (33.Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Mutating the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in dynamin and blocking dynamin phosphorylation with a c-SRC-specific inhibitor both inhibit endocytosis of the β2-AR. These observations implicate tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin in the endocytic process. It has also been recently shown that stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in stimulation of c-SRC kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of clathrin (32.Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Inhibition of c-SRC activity prevents redistribution of clathrin to the cell periphery and delays EGFR endocytosis. Similar to the data with the β2-AR and dynamin, these results again implicate c-SRC tyrosine kinase activity in the endocytic process. Although it is clear from previous studies that the amino-terminal half of β-arrestin1 contains the binding sites essential for interaction with c-SRC, it is not entirely clear which regions of c-SRC mediate the interaction with β-arrestin1. We have utilized other members of the arrestin family and a series of c-SRC mutants to delineate the nature of the β-arrestin1/c-SRC interaction. Moreover, we have utilized novel reagents resulting from this analysis to validate the role of β-arrestin-mediated c-SRC recruitment and tyrosine kinase activity in endocytosis of the β2-AR. All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. HEK-293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Penn/Strep (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were routinely subcultured 1:5 two times weekly. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as above. Cells were routinely subcultured 1:10 three times weekly. HEK-293 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 5 μg of total plasmid DNA using a modified calcium phosphate method (34.Ferguson S.S.G.

COS-7 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 5 μg of total plasmid DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were routinely harvested 48 h posttransfection. Expression vectors for β-arrestin1(FLAG), β-arrestin2(FLAG), dynamin I, c-SRC (WT), c-SRC(K298M), and β2-adrenergic receptor(FLAG) have been described previously (17.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.

The expression vector for arrestin1 (mouse) was constructed by polymerase chain reaction and contains a minimal Kozak sequence and a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag. The polymerase chain reaction product was blunt end cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). SAM-68(FLAG) is mouse-derived SAM-68 cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. c-SRC(HA, WT) is human c-SRC containing a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. All c-SRC mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction using c-SRC (WT and K298M) as templates, and polymerase chain reaction products containing a minimal Kozak sequence were cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. c-SRC(HA, 1–397) contains amino acids 1–397 followed by a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. c-SRC(HA, 1–249) contains amino acids 1–249 followed by a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. c-SRC(91–536) contains amino acids 91–536 and is untagged. c-SRC(151–536) contains amino acids 151–536 and is untagged. c-SRC(250–536) contains amino acids 250–536 and is untagged. c-SRC-SH1 contains amino acids 250–536 followed by a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. c-SRC-SH1(KD) contains amino acids 250–536 and the kinase inactivating Lys to Met mutation at amino acid 298 followed by a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. All sequences were confirmed using an automated ABI DNA sequencer (Howard Hughes Nucleic Acid Facility, Duke University). Whole cell extracts were prepared 48 h posttransfection by lysing cells in 1 ml of lysis buffer (LB) (20 mm HEPES, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and was stored at −80 °C until use. Approximately 25 μl of clarified supernatant was diluted in 2× sample buffer and saved as whole cell extract. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunopurified from the remaining supernatant with 20 μl of Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for >3 h with constant rocking at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed three or four times in lysis buffer and diluted in 50 μl of 2× sample buffer. Immunocomplexes (20 μl) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblot as described below. Bound FLAG and associated proteins were detected by immunoblot as described below. Anti-dynamin I antibody (Hudy I, Upstate Biotechnology) was used to immunoprecipitate dynamin from extracts for use in the tyrosine phosphorylation experiments as described previously (33.Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For in vitro kinase assays, c-SRC proteins were isolated from COS-7 cells using either anti-HA affinity beads (Covance, Inc.) or v-SRC Ab-1 and protein AG beads (Calbiochem, Inc.). Immunoprecipitations were washed three times with LB and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions were carried out in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 15 μm cold ATP, 0.5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-SAM-68 (Santa Cruz, Inc.) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped with 2× sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Bands were cut out of the gels and quantitated by scintillation counting. Whole cell extracts or immunocomplexes were boiled for 10 min, separated on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex), and transferred to supported nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Millipore semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus. Filters were stained with Ponceau S stain to visualize equal loading of protein in all lanes. Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and either 5% nonfat dried milk (Blotto) or 4% bovine serum albumin. Rabbit antiserum directed against FLAG(D-8), HA(Y-11), SRC(SRC2), and SAM-68(C-20) were used at a 1:1000 dilution according to the manufacturer's specifications (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Mouse monoclonal antibody directed against phosphotyrosine (PY20H) was used at 1:2000 according to the manufacturer's specifications (Transduction Laboratories). Mouse monoclonal antibody against dynamin I was used at 1:1000 according to the manufacturer's specifications (Upstate Biotechnology). Appropriate secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at a dilution of 1:2000 in Blotto to detect bound primary antibody. Reactive proteins were detected by incubation of washed filters (TBST) in the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by exposure to autoradiographic film. Immunoblots were quantified using laser scanning densitometry (Biomed Instruments). Agonist-induced receptor internalization was performed essentially as described (36.Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h following transfection, cells containing FLAG-tagged β2-ARs were subjected to stimulation with 10 μmisoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C. Stimulated cells were then incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG primary antibody on ice, incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody on ice, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The presence of cell-surface receptors was determined by flow cytometry (Duke University Flow Cytometry Facility). We have previously shown that β-arrestin1 forms a complex with the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-SRC (17.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of β-arrestin1 indicated that mutations at prolines 91 and 121 (P91G/P121E) reduced its ability to interact with c-SRC, but this mutant still retained about 40% of c-SRC binding compared with wild-type β-arrestin1. Furthermore, the β-arrestin1 PXXP motifs do not appear to be strong consensus SH3 binding sites, suggesting that PXXP/SH3 domain interaction does not solely explain β-arrestin interaction with c-SRC (37.Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 38.Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that a second site of interaction existed between β-arrestin1 and c-SRC. To further explore this possibility, we included both β-arrestin2 and visual arrestin in our studies. Fig.1 A depicts the structures of the arrestin molecules used in this study and indicates the location of the c-SRC interaction domain in β-arrestin1. β-Arrestin2 contains four PXXP motifs in the amino terminus, similar to β-arrestin1, and might be predicted to interact with the SH3 domain of c-SRC; however, visual arrestin does not have any classical PXXP motifs and is unlikely to bind the SH3 domain of c-SRC (39.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to compare the ability of the arrestins to bind to c-SRC with that of a known c-SRC SH3 binder, we also analyzed the ability of SAM-68 to bind c-SRC (40.Taylor S.J. Anafi M. Pawson T. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10120-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 41.Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The arrestins and SAM-68 were expressed as FLAG-tagged fusion proteins with c-SRC and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG affinity gel. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for c-SRC by Western blot (Fig. 1 B, top panel). β-Arrrestin1 interacted strongly with c-SRC, and both visual arrestin and β-arrestin2 also interacted with c-SRC, albeit to a slightly lesser extent. Whole cell extracts indicated that c-SRC is expressed equally in all cells, and Coomassie staining of immunoprecipitates indicated that the FLAG-tagged proteins were also equally expressed (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel,and data not shown). Interestingly, all three arrestin family members interacted more strongly with c-SRC than did SAM-68. Taken together, these data indicate that this association is not limited to interaction between the proline motifs of the arrestins and the SH3 domain of c-SRC and suggest that another domain in c-SRC is also important for this interaction. c-SRC is a modular protein divided into four domains. Amino acids 1–90 contain the myristoylation site and unique domain, amino acids 91–150 contain the SH3 protein interaction domain, amino acids 151–249 contain the SH2 protein interaction domain, and amino acids 250–536 contain the SH1 (catalytic) domain (Fig.2). To identify the additional domain(s) in c-SRC that mediate interaction with β-arrestin1, several deletion mutants of c-SRC were constructed, and a HA tag was added to the carboxyl terminus to facilitate recognition of the mutant c-SRC proteins (Fig. 2). In addition to HA-tagged full-length c-SRC (amino acids 1–536), we also constructed two carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants. c-SRC (1–397) contains the amino terminus and the first 147 amino acids of the kinase domain, and c-SRC (1–249) contains only the amino terminus and is devoid of the catalytic domain. Analysis of the kinase activity of these proteins indicated that the HA-tagged wild-type retained similar activity to its untagged counterpart (data not shown). To determine whether each of these proteins bound to β-arrestin1, the HA-tagged c-SRC mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells along with FLAG-tagged β-arrestin1. Flag-tagged SAM-68 serves as a useful control for these experiments in comparison to β-arrestin1. β-Arrrestin1 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG beads, and bound c-SRC was analyzed by Western blot (Fig.3, left panel). Expression of the c-SRC mutants in whole cell extracts is also shown for reference (Fig. 3, right panel). As expected, the HA-tagged full-length c-SRC bound strongly to β-arrestin1. The c-SRC (1–397) mutant bound to β-arrestin1 in a manner similar to full-length c-SRC. The amount of immunoprecipitated c-SRC (1–397) appears to be somewhat less than full-length c-SRC; however, immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts indicate that this mutant is expressed poorly, and therefore not as much c-SRC (1–397) is available to interact with β-arrestin1 (Fig. 3, right panel). The c-SRC (1–249) mutant bound to β-arrestin1 weakly, indicating that a major binding site for β-arrestin1 is located between amino acids 249 and 397 of c-SRC. SAM-68, which binds to the SH3 domain of c-SRC (40.Taylor S.J. Anafi M. Pawson T. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10120-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 41.Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), bound full-length c-SRC less robustly than did β-arrestin1. Unlike β-arrestin1, SAM-68 interacted with an equivalent fraction of the overexpressed full-length c-SRC and each of the carboxyl-terminal c-SRC mutants, consistent with an interaction not involving the catalytic domain of c-SRC. These results indicate that although β-arrestin1 can bind to the SH3 domain of c-SRC, a significant loss of the binding can be attributed to deletion of the first 150 amino acids o"

Estrogen inhibits obesity triggered by ovariectomy in rodents. We studied the mechanism underlying this estrogen-dependent inhibition of obesity. Estrogen markedly decreased the amounts of fat accumulation and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA as well as triglyceride accumulation in genetically manipulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing the estrogen receptor (ER). A pLPL(1980)-CAT construct, along with an ER expression vector, was introduced into differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, and CAT activities were determined. ER, mostly ligand-dependently, inhibited the basal LPL promoter activity by 7-fold. We searched the LPL promoter for an estrogen-responsive suppressive element by employing a set of 5′-deletion mutants of the pLPL-CAT reporter. Although there was no classical estrogen response element, it was demonstrated that an AP-1-like TGAATTC sequence located at (−1856/−1850) was responsible for the suppression of the LPL gene transcription by estrogen. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay probed with the TGAATTC sequence demonstrated formation of a specific DNA-nuclear protein complex. Interestingly, this complex was not affected by the addition of any antibodies against ER, c-Jun, c-Fos, JunB, or JunD. Because this TGAATTC element responded to phorbol ester and overexpression of CREB-binding protein abrogated the suppressive effect of estrogen on the LPL promoter, we conclude that a unique protein that is related to the AP-1 transcription factor families may be involved in the complex that binds to the TGAATTC element.

One of the findings demonstrating the action of estrogen on adipose tissue is that female rodents who undergo ovariectomy become obese (7.Pedersen S.B. Borglum J.D. Eriksen E.F. Richelsen B. Biochim.

In fact, this hypothesis was confirmed by the fact that replacement of estrogen in these ovariectomy animals abrogated the obesity. Administration of estrogen reduces food intake (9.Wade G.N. J.

A line of evidence has been reported that strongly suggests the involvement of estrogen in lipid metabolism in the adipose tissue.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both regulators inhibit LPL translation through the production of an RNA-binding protein that binds to a region on the proximal 3′-untranslated region of the LPL mRNA (21.Ranganathan G. Vu D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22.Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We nevertheless were interested in transcriptional regulation because several hormones such as growth hormone activate the LPL gene at the transcriptional level. Clinical observations have demonstrated that serum triglyceride levels increase in postmenopausal women and that the level of LPL activity is reduced by estrogen treatment (14.Iverius P.H. Brunzell J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1106-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, it remains poorly understood how estrogen suppresses fat accumulation. To investigate the cellular signaling pathway mediating the inhibitory effect of estrogen on adipogenesis, we have generated genetically manipulated 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes by permanently introducing the estrogen receptor. This variant, termed 3T3-L1-ER, was subjected to analyses of the phenotype as well as of the LPL mRNA profile in the presence or absence of estrogen. Next, we conducted chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-promoter analyses to investigate how LPL gene transcription is regulated by estrogen aiming at identification of a responsive element for the suppressive action of estrogen. Finally, we employed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to characterize an estrogen responsive nuclear factor that plays a role in regulating the LPL gene expression. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and [14C]chloramphenicol (200 mCi/ml, CAT assay grade) from NEN Life Science Products. The restriction endonucleases, modifying enzymes, and DNA polymerases were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Sawady Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) unless otherwise stated. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A plasmid containing the 3804 bp of the murine LPL promoter region (−1980/+1824) including the first exon and the first intron was kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Gimble (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK) (23.Hua X. Enerback S. Hudson J. Youkhana K. Gimble J.M. Gene (Amst .). 1991; 107: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). pLPL(−1980/+1824)-CAT was constructed as follows. Because the LPL gene fragment was flanked by SstI restriction sites on both ends, a SacI 8-mer linker (Takara) was inserted into theHindIII site of pCAT enhancer vector (Promega), becauseSstI and SacI generate compatible ends. TheSstI-SstI (−1980/+1824) fragment from the LPL gene was fused to the SacI site of the pCAT enhancer. pLPL(−1980/+1824)-CAT includes the first exon (+198/+285) and the first intron (+286/+1824). Therefore, the construct was digested byPstI at +328 on the LPL fragment and the multicloning site of the pCAT gene and religated. The resultant pLPL(−1980/+328)-CAT construct was used in the following studies. Other deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction. The upstream primers for the −1980/−1573, −1898/−1573, and −1731/−1573 LPL gene fragments (see Fig. 4 A) were 5′-GAGCTCATGTGAGCGTCTGC-3′, 5′-GAGCTCTACCTGCCCACCACTTGTCC-3′, and 5′-GAGCTCATTTATCTCTCTGGACTCTTGA-3′, respectively. The common downstream primer for these three fragments was 5′-AAGCTTACTCCAAACCGACCTGCACT-3′. Polymerase chain reaction products were linked to the minimal LPL promoter (−182/+328)-CAT. The internal deletion construct, pLPL(1898/1573)ΔAP-1-like)-CAT lacking four nucleotides (AATT at −1854/−1851) was generated by EcoRI digestion and mung bean nuclease treatment to make blunt ends and self-ligation of pLPL(1898/1573)-CAT (see Fig. 4 A). All the constructs were sequenced using an ABI PRIZM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction System (Perkin-Elmer). The human estrogen receptor (ER) expression vector, HEGO was a kind gift from Dr. P. Chambon (Institut de Chimie Biologique, Strasbourg, France) (24.Green S. Chambon P. J. Steroid. Biochem. 1986; 24: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The chimeric pERE-CAT reporter plasmid containing two estrogen response elements linked to the CAT reporter gene was a generous gift from Dr. Y. Miyashita (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan) (25.Miyashita Y. Hirose T. Kouhara H. Kishimoto S. Matsumoto K. Sato B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 35: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The CREB-binding protein expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. S. Ishii (Riken, Tsukuba, Japan) (26.Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou DX Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). pSV-β-galactosidase control vector and pCAT enhancer plasmids were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Ibaraki, Japan). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and induced to differentiate into adipocytes by switching culture medium to DMEM containing 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml insulin for 48 h (27.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M., D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this protocol, >95% of the cells begin to acquire the adipocyte phenotype 3–4 days after initiating differentiation. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were switched to fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed 96 h after the addition of differentiation medium, employing LipofectAMINE Plus Transfection System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 0.7 μg of LPL promoter CAT plasmid was co-transfected with 0.7 μg of HEGO plasmid and 0.7 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector into the cells in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. All other procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3 h after transfection, the medium containing DNA was replaced with growth medium containing 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal calf serum with different concentrations of estradiol. The cells were harvested for CAT assay 36 h after transfection. For stable transfections, 50% confluent 3T3-L1 cells in 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with 1.8 μg of HEGO plasmid DNA and 0.2 μg of pSV2Neo plasmid. Stable transfectants were selected by adding G418 (250 μg/ml) to the medium. Cellular RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells and the variants using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of murine LPL mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) was separated by electrophoresis in horizontal 1.2% agarose gels containing 6.5% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight and covalently bonded to the membrane by exposure to ultraviolet light (UV Stratalinker 1800; Stratagene). Blots were prehybridized for 16 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 1% SDS. Hybridization was carried out for at least 16 h at 42 °C in an identical solution containing 4 × 106 dpm/ml of labeled mouse LPL cDNA probe (29.Spiegelman B.M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8811-8818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, hybridized blots were washed three times in a solution containing 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C with Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an intensifying screen for 48 h. Results were also quantified using a FUJIX BAS 2000 imaging system (Tokyo, Japan). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Dignam et al. (30.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in the presence or absence of estrogen, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the plates with a rubber policeman, and transferred to 15-ml conical Falcon tubes. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 2 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 2 μg of pepstatin/ml. Nuclear pellets were resuspended with 300 μl of nuclear extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 420 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 2 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 2 μg of pepstatin/ml and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After centrifugation at 8.8 × 104 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant fractions were recovered, and the protein content was determined by the Bradford assay. Equivalent amounts of nuclear lysates (5 μg of protein) or human recombinant c-Jun protein (Promega E3061) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. A double-stranded radiolabeled (1 × 105 cpm) DNA probe was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To demonstrate DNA specificity, identical reactions were performed with the addition of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to AP-1-binding site (31.Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 19: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) or consensus C/EBP DNA-binding site (32.Akira S. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1401-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), as unlabeled competitors. To show AP-1 isoform-specific binding to the consensus AP-1 DNA-binding site, nuclear lysates were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-c-Jun (SC-822X), anti-JunB (SC-46X), anti-JunD (SC-74X), anti-c-Fos (SC-52X), or anti-ER (SC-544X) antibodies prior to the addition of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) and radiolabeled probe DNA. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% neutral polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× TAE (10 mmTris acetate, 250 μm EDTA) and visualized by autoradiography. For CAT assays, cells were harvested by being washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and lysed by 4 cycles of freeze-thawing (alternating between an ethanol dry ice bath and/or 37 °C water bath, 5 min/cycle). Cell lysates were heated at 68 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 1.2 × 104 g for 10 min, and the supernatant fractions were recovered. CAT activity in the cell extracts containing 20–50 μg of lysate protein was measured by thin layer chromatography. The enzyme assay was carried out with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol, 0.8 mm acetyl coenzyme A for the chromatographic assay. Reaction mixtures were applied to silica gels, and chloramphenicol species were separated by chromatography with 5% methanol, 95% chloroform. Chloramphenicol conversion to monoacetylated and diacetylated species was visualized and quantified using a FUJIX BAS-2000 imaging system. For each assay procedure, reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Mock-transfected cells were used to establish the basal level of activity. Each CAT activity was normalized by the β-galactosidase activity. The β-galactosidase activity was determined by measuring the optical density at 420 nm usingo-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate (33.Norton P, A. Coffin J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 2: 281-290Crossref Google Scholar). The intracellular triglyceride levels were measured using a Determiner TG-S 555 kit (Kyowa Medicus, Tokyo, Japan). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stained with Oil Red-O (Sigma) by a method described previously (34.Ramirez-Zacarias J.L. Casto-Munozledo F. Kuri-Harcuch W. Histochemistry. 1992; 97: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Although estrogen has been shown to inhibit fat accumulation in association with suppression of the LPL gene, it is still unclear whether estrogen causes similar effects in adipocytes in vitro. Because we believed that the lack of responsiveness to estrogen in vitro was due to a lack of ER in adipocyte cell lines (35.Somjen D. Tordjman K. Waisman A. Mor G. Amir-Zaltsman Y. Kohen F. Kaye A.M. J. Steroid Biocem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we generated a minimal deviation of 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes, termed 3T3-L1-ER, by stably introducing an ER-expression vector along with a drug selection plasmid. The blank vector control counterpart, 3T3-L1-VC, was also prepared, and these cell lines were subjected to the following phenotype analyses. First, the cells were induced to differentiate by standard methods using glucocorticoids, methylisobutylxanthine, and insulin, and we then observed whether estrogen suppressed fat accumulation in an estrogen-dependent manner. Lipid droplets were visualized by Oil-Red-O staining. Fig. 1 Ashows that estrogen, in 3T3-L1-ER cells but not in 3T3-L1-VC cells, markedly suppressed fat accumulation as indicated by the number and the size of lipid droplets. In addition, quantification of intracellular triglycerides indicated a decrease of intracellular triglyceride as well (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that estrogen ER-dependently acts as an inhibitor of fat accumulation in adipose tissue. Because we observed a suppressive action of estrogen on lipid synthesis in 3T3-L1-ER cells, we next examined whether these changes were brought about by a decrease in LPL gene transcription. To address this question, we performed Northern blot analysis using the RNA samples obtained from the cells under each condition described in the previous section. Northern blots of total RNA as well as for poly(A)+ RNA were probed with mouse LPL cDNA. The amounts of LPL transcripts was reduced in response to estrogen treatment in 3T3-L1-ER cells but not in 3T3-L1-VC cells (Fig.2, A and B). This result is consistent with the observation in the previous section that estrogen suppressed fat accumulation in 3T3-L1-ER but not in 3T3-L1-VC cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, 3T3-L1-ER cells not treated with estrogen showed a partial reduction of LPL transcripts to a level approximately 50% of that of untreated 3T3-L1-VC cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that 1) estrogen reduces the level of LPL transcripts in an ER-dependent manner and 2) transcriptional suppression by the ER occurred even in the absence of estrogen. Combined with the phenotype analyses described above, these findings suggest that the reduction of LPL mRNA may contribute to the decrease in fat accumulation. Given the correlation of LPL mRNA and fat accumulation in vitro, we were prompted to ask if the functional LPL promoter, which contains up to 1980 bp upstream of the transcription start site, is regulated by estrogen in 3T3-L1 cells. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were transiently transfected with the CAT reporter plasmid, pLPL(1980)-CAT, along with an ER expression vector, HEGO, and then were treated with estrogen for 48 h. Fig. 3 A shows the results of one of a representative CAT assay. The pLPL(1980)-CAT activity was not affected by estrogen in the cells transfected with a blank vector, pSG5. In the absence of estrogen, the activity of pLPL(1980)-CAT was suppressed to 60% of the level of the blank vector counterpart when the cells were transfected with HEGO. In the HEGO-transfected cells, estrogen suppressed pLPL(1980)-CAT activity about 6-fold. To rule out the possibility that estrogen nonspecifically suppressed the cell viability, 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with pERE-CAT plasmid, which contains two estrogen response elements upstream of the CAT reporter, and then treated with or without estrogen. The pERE-CAT activity was increased nearly 3-fold in response to estrogen treatment, suggesting that the suppressive effect of estrogen on the LPL promoter is not the consequence of the toxicity of estrogen (Fig. 3 A, right panel). It was demonstrated that the suppressive effect of estrogen on the LPL promoter activity was ER dose-dependent as well as estrogen dose-dependent by using various amounts of each factor (data not shown). Because we found that estrogen negatively regulates the LPL promoter activity, we next examined whether there were any suppressive element(s) in the LPL promoter region. To address this question, we systematically deleted the 1980-bp 5′-flanking fragment of the LPL promoter to generate several deletion mutant-CAT constructs and conducted CAT analyses of this array of constructs. It is shown in Fig.3 B that deletion to −1573 weakened the suppressive effect of estrogen to about one-seventh of that observed with pLPL(1980)-CAT. No constructs that contained shortened 5′-flanking fragments showed as much suppression as pLPL(1980)-CAT, although pLPL(1573)-CAT and pLPL(565)-CAT less reduction of transcriptional activities. The reason why these two constructs showed partial suppression is not known, but it is probably because some other transcriptional regulator(s) may cooperate with the factor that binds between −1980 and −1573. We therefore concluded that a negative regulatory element is located in the region between −1980 and −1573. A data base search for transcription factor binding consensus sequences in this 407-bp region revealed that there was no ERE. Because some of the target genes of estrogen are regulated by AP-1 activity modulation by ER (36.Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we searched for an AP-1 binding consensus sequence throughout the 407-bp sequence and found an AP-1 sequence (TGACTAA) located at −1946/−1940 and an AP-1-like sequence (TGAATTC) at −1856/−1850. The former has been reported as an authentic AP-1 site (31.Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 19: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 37.Steffen F. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). To elucidate which of these sequences is responsible for the suppressive action of estrogen, we transferred the above 407-bp fragment in front of a minimal LPL promoter containing only the 5′ flanking sequence up to −182 (Fig.4 A). We deleted this 407-bp fragment so that each of the AP-1 sequences was sequentially deleted. To begin with, we tested whether these putative AP-1 sequences respond to TPA stimulation (Fig. 4 B). The CAT reporter construct that contains the whole 407-bp [pLPL(1980/1573)-CAT] responded to TPA even at 0.1 μm. When the first AP-1 element was deleted (pLPL(1878/1573)-CAT), the TPA responsiveness became weaker but was still observed at 1 or 10 μm. When both of these elements were deleted (pLPL(1731/1573)-CAT), no TPA responsiveness was observed. Having thereby demonstrated the AP-1 activity of each putative AP-1 element, we tested whether these elements could account for the suppressive action of estrogen. As shown in Fig. 4 A, deletion of the AP-1 sequence alone (TGACTCA, −1946/−1940) did not affect the suppression by estrogen. Deletion of both the AP-1 and AP-1-like sequences, however, resulted in a complete loss of suppression by estrogen. Because it seemed that the AP-1-like element was an estrogen-responsive negative regulatory element, we introduced a deletion into this AP-1-like sequence by removing four nucleotides (AATT). The CAT activity of this mutant construct was unaffected by estrogen, similarly to the construct in which the two putative AP-1 elements were missing (Fig. 4 A). Taken together, these findings show that the negative regulatory element responsive to estrogen is the AP-1-like TGAATTC sequence located at −1856/−1850 in the LPL promoter. Having identified the DNA sequence responsible for transcriptional suppression by estrogen, we next examined whether a nuclear factor(s) forms a complex with this negative regulatory element. For this purpose, we radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides harboring the putative transcription factor binding sequence and subjected the fragments to an EMSA. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 3T3-L1-ER cells grown in the presence or absence of estrogen. Fig. 5 A shows that a single DNA-protein complex was formed when the TGAATTC fragment was used as a probe. This experiment also indicated that this complex formation was completely impaired by the addition of a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide used as a probe, suggesting that the complex formation is specific (Fig. 5 A, left panel, fifth and tenth lanes). It is noteworthy that less complex was formed with the nuclear extract prepared from estrogen-treated cells than with that from untreated cells (Fig. 5 A, left panel, first andsixth lanes). Interestingly, unlabeled consensus AP-1 fragment (TGACTCA) partially impaired the complex formation, suggesting that the complex may contain"

However, although the p38MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 attenuated apoptosis, the process was not affected by the ERK-specific inhibitor PD98059. The attenuation of the cadmium-provoked apoptosis by SB203580 was a highly specific effect. In fact, the kinase inhibitor did not prevent the generation of apoptosis by heat shock and camptothecin, nor the generation of necrosis by cadmium treatment of glutathione-depleted cells, nor the cadmium-provoked activation of the stress response. The generation of apoptosis was preceded by intracellular H2O2 accumulation and was accompanied by the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, both of which were inhibited by SB203580. On the other hand, the antioxidant agent butylated hydroxyanisole-inhibited apoptosis but did not prevent p38MAPK phosphorylation. In a similar manner, p38MAPK phosphorylation was not affected by the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD and DEVD-CHO, which nevertheless prevented apoptosis.

Rossman T.G. Merian E. Metals and Their Compounds in the Environment. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1991: 617-640Google Scholar). Another property of heavy metals (and of other physical and chemical agents, such as heat and inhibitors of energy metabolism) is the capacity to induce the stress response, characterized by the synthesis and accumulation of heat-shock proteins (HSPs)1 (2.Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). The stimulation of HSP gene expression by stress inducers in higher eukaryotes seems to be specifically regulated by heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1). Thus, under stressful conditions, HSF1 undergoes trimerization, translocation to the nucleus, binding to the heat-shock consensus elements, and finally hyperphosphorylation to fully acquire the transactivation capacity (3.Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, stress inducers may provoke cell death, either apoptotic or necrotic, depending on the intensity of the treatments (4.Nosseri C. Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5.Vayssier M. Banzet N. Francois D. Bellman K. Polla B.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L771-L779PubMed Google Scholar). The morphological characteristics of apoptosis and necrosis are well known (6.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.T. Currie A.C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar, 7.Buja L.M. Eigenbrodt M.L. Eigenbrodt E.H. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1993; 117: 1208-1214PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Majno G. Joris I. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15Google Scholar). Thus, during apoptosis the cells undergo nuclear and cytoplasmic shrinkage, the chromatin is partitioned into multiple fragments, and the cells are broken into multiple membrane-surrounded bodies (“apoptotic bodies”), but the cell membrane retains its integrity during the process. By contrast, necrosis is characterized by cell swelling and a rapid loss of membrane integrity. However, the regulation of apoptosis and necrosis and the factors that decide the selection of one or the other mode of death are still poorly known. One of the most relevant aspects in the regulation of both the stress response and apoptosis is the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), a family of serine/threonine kinases that mediate intracellular signal transduction in response to different stimuli (9.Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 15: 1230-1254Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The MAPK family members are themselves activated by reversible dual phosphorylation on a Thr-Xaa-Tyr conserved motif, by specific mitogen-activated protein kinases kinases. To date, three major MAPKs have been identified, namely the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2, p44/p42), the stress-activated protein kinases (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, stress-activated protein kinase 1), and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK, stress-activated protein kinase 2). ERK1/2 are mainly (although not exclusively) activated by growth factors (10.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar, 11.Xia Z. Dickens M.

On the other hand, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases and p38MAPK are mainly activated by cytotoxic insults and are often associated with apoptosis (12.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J. Dickens M. Han J.

It was recently reported that cadmium chloride induced the stress response and caused a dose-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK (but not of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases) in association with mitogenesis and apoptosis, respectively, in rat brain tumor cells (19.Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J. Lai Y.-K. Chang M.D.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31924-31931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Whereas it was demonstrated that both kinases were involved in the regulation of the stress response, it is not clear whether they were also required to induce cell death. In the present work we investigated the capacity of cadmium chloride to induce p38MAPK and ERK1/2 activation and to cause cell death in U-937 human promonocytic cells. It was concluded that p38MAPK activation is an early and specific requirement for the cadmium-provoked apoptosis, which precedes and probably modulates the expression of other regulatory events. All components for cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), camptothecin, dl-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine (BSO), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), propidium iodide (PI), and Nonidet-P40 were obtained from Sigma; cadmium chloride was from Merck; 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole was from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); RNase A was from Roche Diagnostics S. L. (Barcelona, Spain); and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and 3,3′-dihexylocarbocyanine iodide were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059 and the caspase inhibitors Z-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-CH2F (Z-VAD) and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde (DEVD-CHO) were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. All antibodies against mitogen-activated protein kinases, namely rabbit anti-human p38MAPK pAb, rabbit anti-human phospho-p38MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) pAb, rabbit anti-human p44/42MAPK pAb, and rabbit anti-human phospho-p44/42MAPK(Thr202/Tyr204) pAb, were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA); mouse anti-human HSP70 monoclonal antibody (clone C92F34–5) and rabbit anti-human HSF1 pAb were fromStressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada; and mouse anti-chicken β-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). The Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate kit was purchased from Bender MedSystems (Vienna, Austria). U-937 promonocytic leukemia cells (20.Sundström C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar) were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, as described previously (21.Pérez C. Vilaboa N.E. Aller P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 6: 337-343Google Scholar). Sixteen hours prior to treatments, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium containing 1.5% fetal calf serum. Cadmium chloride and BSO were dissolved in distilled water at 0.1m before use. SB203580, PD98059, camptothecin, and Z-VAD were dissolved in Me2SO at the concentrations of 13.2, 20, 10, and 20 mm, respectively, and DEVD-CHO in distilled water at 10 mm. All these solutions were stored at −20 °C. For cadmium treatment, cells were incubated for 2 h with 200 μm cadmium chloride. In some experiments, the cells were washed after treatment with prewarmed (37 °C) RPMI medium and allowed to recover under standard culture conditions. For heat shock, cells were placed in a bath at the desired temperature for the required time period and then allowed to recover under standard culture conditions. As controls, cells were subjected to the same manipulations as treated cells, in the absence of cadmium. For GSH depletion, cells were incubated for 18–24 h with 1 mm BSO, as earlier reported (22.Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Maresca V. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Under these conditions BSO reduced the intracellular GSH level by more than 90% without affecting cell proliferation or viability. To analyze changes in chromatin structure, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in PBS, and mounted on glass slides. After fixation in 70% (v/v) ethanol, the cells were stained for 20 min at room temperature with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells with fragmented chromatin were considered as apoptotic. Nucleosome-sized DNA cleavage was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described previously (21.Pérez C. Vilaboa N.E. Aller P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 6: 337-343Google Scholar). To measure the loss of DNA, cells were collected by centrifugation and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml RNase A. After the addition of 50 μg/ml PI and permeabilization with 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells with sub-G1 PI incorporation were considered as apoptotic (23.Ormerod M.G. Collins M.K.L. Rodrı́guez-Tarduchi G. Robertson D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 153: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Within the experimental time periods used here necrotic cells did not exhibit sub-G1 PI incorporation. The criteria used to determine necrosis was the loss of membrane integrity, as measured by permeability to trypan blue or by massive influx of PI in nonpermeabilized cells. In the later case, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 500 μl of a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, containing 20 μg of PI and 3 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated human annexin V. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using appropriate color filters to determine the PI-derived reddish orange fluorescence (emission peak 590 nm) and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-derived greenish fluorescence (emission peak 530 nm). Apoptotic cells were characterized by annexin V binding but with null or low PI influx, whereas necrotic cells were characterized by annexin V binding and a great increase in red fluorescence because of the massive influx of PI (24.Martin S. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. Van Schie C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). The intracellular H2O2 content was determined by flow cytometry after loading the cells with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, as described earlier (25.Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.M. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar). To evaluate mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), cells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature with PBS containing 0.1 nm 3,3′-dihexylocarbocyanine iodide (3.Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). After washing twice with fetal calf serum, the cells were resuspended in PBS, and the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. Whole cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide minigels and transferred to ImmobilonTM-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp., Medford, MA). After blocking with 3% nonfat milk in TTBS buffer (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), the membranes were incubated overnight with the primary antibody, then extensively washed with TTBS, and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody. After extensive washing with TTBS, the immune complexes were detected by chemiluminiscence using the Western blotting kit from Pierce. Nuclear extracts from 107 cells were prepared as earlier described (26.Schreibert E. Mathias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C. For HSF1 binding assays, the partially complementary oligonucleotides 5′-GCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGACCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCAGGTCGGGAATATTCCAGGGGTTTCG-3′ were synthesized and used to prepare a heat-shock element-containing double strand oligoprobe, which was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at 4 °C in 20 μl of binding buffer (60 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 12% glycerol, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) containing 5 ng of the labeled probe, 8 μg of total nuclear proteins, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA. Fifty-fold excess heat-shock element, unrelated (AP-1-recognizing) unlabeled probes, or anti-HSF1 antibody were used to check the specificity of the binding reaction. The samples were electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide gels that were dried and later autoradiographed. We have previously shown that pulse treatment with high cadmium concentrations (100 μm and above) induced the stress response and caused death in U-937 promonocytic cells (28.Vilaboa N.E. Calle C. Pérez C. De Blas E. Garcı́a-Bermejo L. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2877-2883PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Vilaboa N.E. Garcı́a-Bermejo L Pérez C. De Blas E. Calle C. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 201-207PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the mode of death, the expression of apoptotic and necrotic markers was measured in cells pulse-treated for 2 h with 200 μm cadmium chloride followed by recovery. It was observed that the treatment caused chromatin fragmentation (Fig.1 A), accumulation of cells with sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 1 B), and nucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C), all of which are characteristics of apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were already detected at 1 h of recovery after treatment, reaching approximately 60% at 6 h. In contrast, no significant necrosis was detected during this period of recovery, as revealed by trypan blue staining (Fig.1 A) or free PI uptake (see Fig. 6 B). Necrosis was not detected even at a cadmium chloride concentration of 1 mm (result not shown). Nevertheless, after prolonged recovery periods (12 h and thereafter) some trypan blue-stained cells started to be detected (result not shown), which suggests secondary necrosis, derived from apoptosis. Hence, 6 h was the maximum recovery period adopted for further experiments.Figure 6Modulation by BSO of the cadmium-provoked cell death and MAPK phosphorylation. Cells were treated for 2 h with 200 μm cadmium chloride and allowed to recover. BSO (1 mm) was applied 18 h before cadmium and maintained during the cadmium treatment and recovery periods.A, the left panel shows the frequency of apoptotic (open symbols) and necrotic (closed symbols) cells at different times of recovery upon treatment with BSO plus cadmium, as determined by chromatin fragmentation and trypan blue permeability, respectively. The frequency of apoptotic and necrotic cells in cultures treated with BSO alone was below 5% (not shown). The right panel shows the frequency of necrotic cells at 6 h of recovery in cultures treated with BSO alone, BSO plus cadmium (BSO/Cd), or BSO plus cadmium in combination with either 10 μm SB203580 (BSO/Cd/SB) or 30 μm PD98059 (BSO/Cd/PD). B, annexin V binding and PI uptake in nonpermeabilized cells at 6 h of recovery, using the same treatments as in A. C,relative levels of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in untreated cells (Cont) and in cells treated with cadmium alone (Cd) or with BSO plus cadmium (BSO/Cd), measured at 1 h of treatment (1 h tr) or recovery (1 h rec). The values in A represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. The determinations inB and C were repeated twice and three times, respectively, with similar results. All other conditions were as in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier observations indicated that cadmium caused a dose-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, as measured by their increased phosphorylation, in rat brain tumor cells (19.Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J. Lai Y.-K. Chang M.D.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31924-31931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Hence, we decided to measure the phosphorylation/activation of those kinases in cadmium-treated U-937 cells. As shown in Fig.2, cadmium provoked a rapid increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation, which was already detected after 30 min of treatment, hence preceding the expression of apoptotic markers and followed during the whole treatment and recovery periods. In addition, cadmium provoked a late increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which started at 1–3 h of recovery, coincident with the expression of apoptotic markers. The rapid increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation and the delayed increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation might indicate that these kinase activities are involved in the triggering and the execution of apoptosis, respectively. To investigate this, we analyzed the effect of the p38MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 and the ERK-specific inhibitor PD98059 on the cadmium-provoked apoptosis. It has been shown that PD98059 prevents ERKs phosphorylation/activation by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase activity (30.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). SB203580 was first described as an inhibitor of p38MAPK activity by competing with ATP for binding (31.Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), but it was later demonstrated that the drug also prevents p38MAPK phosphorylation/activation (32.Frantz B. Klatt T. Pang M. Parsons J. Rolando A. Williams H. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13846-13853Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We observed that treatment of U-937 cells with 30 μm PD98059 totally abolished ERK phosphorylation, whereas treatment with 5–20 μm SB203580 (because higher concentrations were toxic) only partially inhibited p38MAPK phosphorylation (Fig.3 A). However, although PD98059 failed to alter (either inhibit or potentiate) the expression of apoptotic markers, SB203580 attenuated apoptosis by approximately 50% (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that p38MAPK activation is required, at least in part, for the cadmium-provoked apoptosis, whereas ERK activation is irrelevant for the process. To rule out the possibility of a general, nonspecific interference of SB203580 with the apoptotic machinery, new experiments were carried out using other apoptotic agents, namely the stress inducer heat shock (2 h at 42.5 °C followed by recovery) (28.Vilaboa N.E. Calle C. Pérez C. De Blas E. Garcı́a-Bermejo L. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2877-2883PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Vilaboa N.E. Garcı́a-Bermejo L Pérez C. De Blas E. Calle C. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 201-207PubMed Google Scholar) and the antitumor drug camptothecin (as a continuous treatment at 0.4 μm). Whereas heat shock did not significantly induce p38MAPKphosphorylation, this kinase was transiently phosphorylated by camptothecin (Fig. 4 A). Nevertheless, SB203580 failed to attenuate the generation of apoptosis by both agents, as demonstrated by chromatin fragmentation (Fig. 4 B) and the accumulation of cells with sub-G1 DNA content (result not shown). To exclude the possibility of a general, nonspecific cadmium inactivation by SB203580 (e.g. by direct drug-metal interaction) we analyzed the action of this kinase inhibitor on other effects of cadmium, namely the stress response and necrosis induction. The stress response was measured by HSF1 binding at 2 h of treatment and by HSP70 expression at different times of recovery. It was observed that SB203580 did not affect the cadmium-provoked accumulation of HSP70 (Fig. 5 A) nor the stimulation of HSF1 binding (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the p38MAPK is not relevant for the induction of the stress response by cadmium in these cells. Moreover, SB203580 also failed to inhibit the increase in HSP70 caused by heat shock, whereas as expected (33.Gorman A.M. Heavey B. Creag E. Cotter T.G. Samali A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the increase was abolished or greatly reduced by the antioxidant agents NAC and BHA (Fig. 5 C). This excludes the possibility that SB203580 may act as a radical oxygen scavenger in U-937 cells. It was reported that depletion of intracellular GSH may potentiate the lethality of cytotoxic drugs, occasionally switching the mode of death from apoptosis to necrosis (34.Fernandes R.S. Cotter T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 2A. Galán, M. L. Garcı́a-Bermejo, A. Troyano, N. E. Vilaboa, E. de Blas, M. G. Kazanietz, and P. Aller, unpublished results. We observed that a 18–24-h incubation with the GSH depletor BSO (1 mm) was innocuous (Fig. 6, A andB) and did not affect p38MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (results not shown). However, preincubation with BSO potentiated the cadmium toxicity, causing necrosis instead of apoptosis, as revealed by free uptake of trypan blue (Fig.6 A) and PI (Fig. 6 B). Under these conditions p38MAPK was phosphorylated with the same efficacy, and ERK1/2 with greater efficacy, than in cells treated with cadmium alone (Fig. 6 C). However, neither SB203580 nor PD98059 were able to prevent the necrotic response (Fig. 6, A andB). Taken together, the present results indicate that the inhibition by SB203580 of cadmium-provoked apoptosis is a highly specific effect. Finally, we wanted to investigate the possible relationship between p38MAPK activation and other events that regulate apoptosis. This included caspase activities, intracellular oxidation and changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm). It is known that apoptosis requires the action of ICE-like proteases (caspases) (for review see Ref. 35.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Moreover, caspase activities seem also to mediate p38MAPK activation by some inducers (14.Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To approach the problem, we analyzed the action of the caspase-3-specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO and the nonspecific caspase inhibitor Z-VAD on apoptosis and p38MAPK activation in cadmium-treated cells. As expected, both inhibitors attenuated apoptosis (Fig.7 A). However, they did not affect p38MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that p38MAPK plays its regulatory role on apoptosis upstream or independently of the caspase cascade. Earlier reports indicated that cytotoxic insults rapidly cause intracellular oxidation measured by H2O2accumulation, which at least in some apoptotic models is a trigger for cell death (25.Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.M. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar, 36.Slater A.F.G. Nobel C.S.I. Van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Orrenius S. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 149-153Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 37.McGowan A.J. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. Gorman A.M. López-Rivas A. Cotter T.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, apoptosis involves and is regulated by a disruption of Δψm (for reviews see Refs. 38.Gree D.R. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 39.Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Hence, we wanted to investigate the possible relationship between these phenomena and p38MAPKactivation. We found that cadmium caused a rapid increase in H2O2 accumulation, which was already detected after 30 min of treatment (Fig.8 A), at the same time as the increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation. The treatment also caused a late disruption of Δψm, which was first detected at 3 h of recovery (Fig.9), hence paralleling the expression of apoptotic markers. The administration of the antioxidant agent BHA reduced cell death (Fig. 8 B), proving the importance of intracellular oxidation for the cadmium-provoked apoptosis, but it did not inhibit p38MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 8 C). More potent antioxidants such as NAC and other thiol-containing agents could not be used because of the direct reactivity of –SH groups with Cd2+ ions. Interestingly, the administration of SB203580 greatly reduced H2O2 accumulation (Fig.8 A) as well as Δψm disruption (Fig. 9). Taken together, these results indicate that p38MAPK activation is an early regulatory event in cadmium-provoked apoptosis.Figure 9Modulation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm).The figure shows the degree of Δψmdisruption at different times of recovery from cadmium treatment (2 h at 200 μm), either in the absence (Cd) or in the presence (Cd/SB) of 10 μm SB203580, as revealed by the decrease in fluorescence upon 3,3′-dihexylocarbocyanine iodide loading. All other conditions were as in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although apoptotic stimuli usually activated p38MAPKand this activation was required for apoptosis in some models (40–43, among others), it seemed to be irrelevant in others. This was proved by the inability of the p38MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 to prevent apoptosis in Fas- and UV-treated Jurkatt T cells (14.Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), in UV-treated U-937 cells (16.Franklin C.C. Srikanth S. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3014-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), in H2O2-treated HeLa cells (17.Wang X. Martindale L. Liu Y Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), and in nitric oxide-treated RAW macrophages (18.Callsen D. Brüne B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), among other examples. Likewise, a p38MAPK dominant-negative mutant failed to prevent the induction of apoptosis in UV- and γ-radiation in 293T human embryonic kidney cells (13.Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (855) Google Scholar). It was reported that heavy metals also induce p38MAPK activation in different cell types (19.Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J. Lai Y.-K. Chang M.D.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31924-31931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44.Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Bonkowsky H.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the actual relevance of such activation for apoptosis was not known. Our present results indicate that treatment of U-937 promonocytic cells with apoptosis-inducing concentrations of cadmium chloride rapidly causes p38MAPKactivation, as judged by its increased phosphorylation, and proves that this activation is required for apoptosis, as revealed by the capacity of SB203580 to reduce both p38MAPK phosphorylation and apoptosis. Moreover, the regulation by p38MAPK of the cadmium-provoked apoptosis seemed to be a highly specific effect, which cannot be explained by a general interference of the kinase inhibitor with either the apoptotic machinery or the total cadmium activity. This conclusion is based on the following: (a) SB203580 did not prevent the generation of apoptosis by other agents, such heat-shock and camptothecin, although the later one also caused p38MAPK activation; (b) SB203580 did not prevent the generation of necrosis induced by the cadmium treatment of BSO-preincubated cells, although this treatment also increased p38MAPK phosphorylation; and (c) SB203580 did not prevent the cadmium-provoked activation of the stress response. This later result was somewhat surprising, because SB203580 was reported to prevent HSF1 activation and HSP70 induction in rat brain tumor cells treated with high apoptosis-inducing cadmium concentrations (19.Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J. Lai Y.-K. Chang M.D.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31924-31931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Such a discrepancy suggests the existence of marked differences in the regulation of the stress response in different cell types. The rapid phosphorylation of p38MAPK suggested that this kinase plays an early role in the regulation of the cadmium-provoked apoptosis. This conclusion was also proved by examining other regulatory events, such as caspase activity, Δψm disruption, and intracellular oxidation. It is known that apoptosis requires the activation of a cascade of ICE-like proteases, which, at least in myeloid cells, ends with the activation of the effector caspase-3 (46.Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7013-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 47.Watson R.W.G. Rotstein O.D. Parodo J. Bitar R. Hackam D. Marshall J.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, caspases may also regulate p38MAPK activation by some apoptotic inducers, as in Fas-treated Jurkatt T cells (14.Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, our experiments showing that the activation of p38MAPK by cadmium was insensitive to the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD or the caspase-3-specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO suggest that the regulation by p38MAPK of the cadmium-provoked apoptosis is either upstream or independent of the caspase cascade. The attenuation by SB203508 of the fall in Δψm suggests that the regulatory role of p38MAPK is also upstream of Δψm disruption, a phenomenon that in some cases is an early event while in others (as in cadmium-treated U-937 cells) occurs simultaneously with the execution cell death (48.Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.A. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 49.Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S. Fassy F. Reed J.C. Kroemer J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 50.Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Finally, the interaction between p38MAPK activation and intracellular oxidation was more intriguing, because both phenomena took place rapidly upon cadmium administration and could not be separated based on kinetic data. Earlier reports indicate that the toxicity of cadmium is the result at least in part of intracellular oxidation (51.Ochi T. Takahashi K. Ohsawa M. Mutat. Res. 1987; 180: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 52.Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in our experiments showing an increase in H2O2 production by cadmium and a reduction in apoptosis by the antioxidant agent BHA. Moreover, it was found that SB203580 attenuated H2O2accumulation, whereas BHA did not affect p38MAPKphosphorylation. The possibility that SB203580 acts as a radical oxygen scavenger may be excluded, because this agent did not prevent the heat-provoked induction of HSP70, as done by typical antioxidants (33 and Fig. 5 C). Hence, we conclude that p38MAPKactivity probably plays a role in the triggering of intracellular oxidation by cadmium. An attractive hypothesis is that p38MAPK is required for apoptosis only when apoptosis is regulated via intracellular oxidation, a subject that is at present under investigation in our laboratory. Interestingly, a recent report indicates that SB203580 inhibits NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils, suggesting that p38MAPK kinase regulates the oxidative burst in these cells (53.Lal A.S. Clifton A.D. Rouse J. Segal A.W. Cohen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to their inducibility by mitogenic stimuli, ERKs may also be activated by heavy metals and other cytotoxic insults (17.Wang X. Martindale L. Liu Y Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 18.Callsen D. Brüne B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19.Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J.

For instance, suppression of ERK1/2 activation by PD98059 enhanced apoptosis in H2O2-treated HeLa cells (17.Wang X. Martindale L. Liu Y Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and in nitric oxide-treated RAW macrophages (18.Callsen D. Brüne B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and conversely, the activation of the ERK pathway inhibited apoptosis in neuronal PC-12 cells (11.Xia Z. Dickens M. Reingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). However, in other models PD98059 inhibited apoptosis, e.g.in nerve growth factor-deprived pheochromocytoma cells (40.Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and in H2O2-treated CG4 oligodendrocytic cells (54.Bath N.R. Zhang P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), suggesting a pro-apoptotic role for ERK1/2 activity. Watabe et al. (55.Watabe M. Masuda Y. Nakajo S. Yoshida T. Kuroiwa Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showed that bufalin caused a late ERK activation in U-937 cells, which could explain the generation of apoptosis by this agent. In our experiments cadmium caused a similar late ERK1/2 activation, as indicated by their increased phosphorylation, which paralleled the execution of apoptosis. Moreover, preincubation with BSO followed by cadmium treatment caused necrosis instead of apoptosis and overincreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that the extent of kinase activation might also be important in determining the mode of death. However, PD98059 failed to prevent apoptosis in cadmium-treated cells and necrosis in BSO plus cadmium-treated cells, indicating that ERK activity is irrelevant for death induction (either apoptotic or necrotic) by cadmium. Studies using other apoptotic agents and different procedures to modulate ERK1/2 activity are in progress to better define the possible role of this kinase in death induction in promonocytic cells."

To define the molecular mechanisms of negative control of TGF-β signaling, we have isolated the human SMAD7 gene and characterized its promoter region. A −303 to +672 SMAD7 region contained a palindromic GTCTAGAC Smad binding element (SBE) between nucleotides −179 and −172 that was necessary for the induction of a Smad7 promoter luciferase reporter gene by TGF-β. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using oligonucleotide probes demonstrated that TGF-β rapidly induced the binding of an endogenous SBE-binding complex (SBC) containing Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. Transfection assays in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), with targeted deletions of either Smad2 or Smad3, and the Smad4-deficient cell line MD-MBA-468 revealed that both Smad3 and Smad4, but not Smad2, were absolutely required for induction of the Smad7 promoter reporter gene by TGF-β. Furthermore, the TGF-β-inducible SBE-binding complex was diminished in Smad2-deficient MEFs when compared with wild type MEFs and not detectable in Smad3-deficient MEFs and MD-MBA-468 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TGF-β induces transcription of the human SMAD7 gene through activation of Smad3 and Smad4 transcription factor binding to its proximal promoter.

TGF-β initiates signaling through the ligand-dependent activation of a complex of heteromeric transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, consisting of type I and type II receptors (1.Wrana J.L.

The TGF-β/Smad signaling system is notable for an autoinhibitory feedback loop which involves Smad7, a structurally and functionally divergent Smad protein of the subfamily of “inhibitory Smads” (10.Hayashi H.

Smad7 interacts stable with ligand-activated type 1 receptor and interferes with receptor binding and phosphorylation of substrate Smads (10.Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W.

Thus, Smad7 may have an essential role in the regulation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling system by controlling the accessibility of ligand-activated type 1 receptor for substrate Smad2 and/or Smad3. Several reports indicate that Smad7 expression is strongly and rapidly induced by TGF-β itself (12.Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E.

Together, these observations point to a broad role for Smad7 in trans-modulation of signaling pathways. Because of the potentially central roles of Smad7 as an effector in an autoregulatory feedback loop in TGF-β/Smad signaling and as a mediator of inhibitory signaling cross-talk between opposing pathways and the TGF-β/Smad pathway, we reasoned that knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of Smad7 would advance the understanding of the regulation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Here we report a molecular mechanism by which TGF-β induces transcription of the human Smad7 promoter. We have identified a palindromic Smad binding element that binds a protein complex containing Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 and shown that is necessary for the transcriptional activation of the Smad7 promoter by TGF-β. In cells that lack Smad3 or Smad4, TGF-β is unable to induce Smad7 promoter activity. A spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), and SV40-transformed mouse mesangial cells were obtained from Dr. Norbert Fusenig and Dr. Fuad Ziyadeh, respectively. NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts and the Smad4-deficient human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB 468 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Wild type and Smad2-deficient (Smad2 dex2/dex2) mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from d10.5 embryos as described (15.Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Lia M. Böttinger E. Edelmann W. Stewart C.L. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Wild type and Smad3-deficient MEFs were derived from day 12.5 embryos (16.Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Recombinant human TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 were purchased from R & D Systems, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was obtained from Genzyme. Recombinant murine TNF-α was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and human epidermal growth factor (EGF) was obtained from Promega. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma and used in concentrations recommended by the supplier. RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analysis, RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and transferred to a filter. Filters were then hybridized in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for murine Smad7 and analyzed by phosphor imagery. A down-to-the-well human genomic PAC library screening system (Genome Systems) was screened with a polymerase chain reaction probe generated by a primer pair (primers E5 (5′-GCCTCCGGGAGACTGG) and E6 (5′-GAGAAAAGTCGTTGGCCTG)) located in the 5′-untranslated region of human Smad7 cDNA to give clones 806N1 and 529P14. DNA prepared from both PAC clones was digested with restriction endonucleases (BamHI, EcoRI) and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel in 1× Tris/acetic acid/ethylenediaminetetraacetate (TAE). DNA fragments were transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with the 170-bp polymerase chain reaction probe. A 4.6-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment was identified, gel-purified, and ligated with pBluescript KS+/− vector DNA (Stratagene). This fragment contained mostly 5′-flanking sequence of the SMAD7 gene and was used for promoter analyses. 5′- and 3′- deletions were generated by endonuclease digestions from the isolated EcoRI fragment. Seven distinct fragments were ligated into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega) (see Fig. 2 A). For transcriptional reporter assays, cells (2.5–6 × 104/well) were seeded in 24-well or six-well dishes and transfected with the indicated luciferase reporter constructs and pRSV-Gal (Promega), using the Superfect Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were incubated in 0.2% fetal bovine serum starvation medium for 20 h and then either left untreated or treated with TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for 4 h. Luciferase and galactosidase activities in transfected cells were determined using assay kits from Promega. Luciferase activities was measured using an AutoLumat LB953 (EG & G Berthold) luminometer. Galactosidase activities were measured with a Labsystems Multiscan MCC/340 plate reader at 405 nm. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies, luciferase units were normalized for galactosidase activities in the same cell lysate. Corrected luciferase units were then expressed as ratio (-fold induction) compared with the luciferase readings mediated by the empty vector pGL3 basic in the same experiment. Experiments were performed in triplicate. An oligonucleotide (+98CACGCGGCTCGTCGTTCGCTCACAC+64) complementary to the human SMAD7 DNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), hybridized to human kidney mRNA (CLONTECH) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the avian myeloblastosis virus Reverse Transcriptase System (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing of genomic SMAD7 DNA contained in the pS7-5 plasmid was performed using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing primer was GTGCGCCGAGCAGCAAGCGAG. The radiolabeled cDNA primer extension products were analyzed in parallel with the sequencing reactions using an 8 m urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out in the pS7-5 construct using a QuickChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Thymidine at position −176 and adenine at position −175 in the center of the Smad7 Smad binding element were replaced with adenine and thymidine, respectively (lowercase italic type), using complementary oligonucleotides (mSBEfw,−185CAGGGTGTCatGACGGCCAC−166; mSBErv,−166GTGGCCGTCatGACACCCTG−185) to generate the mutant construct pS7-5mSBE. Sequence fidelity was confirmed by sequencing. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from subconfluent cell cultures on 100-mm dishes. Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6% Nonidet P-40 containing AEBSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, antipain, sodium vanadate, sodium fluoride, and okadaic acid at concentrations recommended by the manufacturers). The cells were allowed to swell for 15 min and then scraped, collected, and washed with hypotonic lysis buffer without detergent. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 s in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 20 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (lysis buffer with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, and 420 mm NaCl). Nuclear lysates were incubated for 20 min on a shaker and cleared of debris by centrifugation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (17.Böttinger E.P. Shelley C.S. Farokhzad O.C. Arnaout M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2604-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using nuclear extracts prepared from either untreated cells or cells treated with TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for 1 h. Complementary oligonucleotides “S7SBE” containing the Smad binding element (SBE) sequence were γ-32P-end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction and annealed. S7SBE probe (50,000 cpm) was incubated with 1 μg of nuclear extract in binding buffer (16% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 mm KCl, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.8 mmNaPi, pH 7.8, 4 mm spermidine, 4 mmMgCl2) with or without preincubation for 10 min with a 50- or 100-fold molar excess of cold annealed competitor at 4 °C for 30 min. For antibody interference studies (supershift analysis), nuclear extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of the following antibodies prior to or following the addition of radiolabeled probe as indicated: mouse monoclonal anti-Smad2 (S 66220; Transduction Laboratories) or goat polyclonal anti-Smad2 (sc-6200 X), anti-Smad3 (sc-6202 X), and anti-Smad4 (sc-1909 X) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). DNA-binding protein complexes were separated by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. Aliquots (100 μg) from wild type, Smad2-deficient (Smad2dex2/dex2), and Smad3-deficient (Smad3ex8/ex8) MEFs were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide). After transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were probed with antibodies against Smad2 (monoclonal anti-Smad2; Transduction Laboratories) and Smad3 (polyclonal anti-Smad3; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and GDP dissociation inhibitor (kind gift from Dr. Philipp Scherer) to control for protein loading, as indicated. Bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, respectively, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents purchased from Pierce. Smad7 is a member of the Smad protein family that has been shown to antagonize TGF-β receptor signaling. Several TGF-β family members including activin and BMP7 were found to increase Smad7 expression and induce its interaction with activated TGF-β type I receptor (10.Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that Smad7 mediates an autoregulatory negative feedback loop in TGF-β signaling (18.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). To determine whether the regulation of Smad7 by TGF-β is mediated at the level of gene transcription, we examined Smad7 mRNA levels in response to TGF-β in the absence or presence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription (Fig. 1). TGF-β-mediated up-regulation of Smad7 mRNA was completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with actinomycin D (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and4), indicating that TGF-β activates transcription of theSMAD7 gene. Pretreatment with cycloheximide had no effect on the transcriptional activation of SMAD7 by TGF-β, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis was not required for this activity (data not shown). We isolated the human SMAD7 gene by screening a human P1-artificial chromosome library with a 170-bp polymerase chain reaction probe corresponding to 5′-untranslated sequence of the human Smad7 cDNA. 3K. Susztak and E. P. Böttinger, unpublished observations. AnEcoRI–SphI genomic fragment spanning 4.6 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking sequence of SMAD7 was isolated and subcloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3basic. In order to define the basal and TGF-β-inducible Smad7 promoter elements in this region, we generated a total of seven 5′- and 3′ deletion constructs (pS7-1 to pS7-7) using convenient restriction sites (Fig. 2 A). Transfections of these constructs into NIH3T3 fibroblasts revealed that the constructs pS7-1 to pS7-5 mediated both TGF-β-inducible and basal promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). Further 5′ deletion of the Smad7 promoter (pS7-6) between a KpnI (−303) and aBssHII (−146) site resulted in a complete loss of TGF-β-inducibility of the Smad7 promoter without affecting basal promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the region between a HindIII and a SphI site (pS7-7) mediated luciferase activities that were not different from empty control vector, indicating that the basal Smad7 promoter region was located upstream of this fragment (Fig. 2 B). Smad7 mRNA expression is inducible by a number of cytokines and growth factors other than TGF-β1, including activin, BMP7, and EGF (13.Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) as well as IFN-γ (14.Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) and TNF-α.2 To determine whether the −303 to +672 Smad7 fragment was inducible by these extracellular signals, we transfected the reporter construct pS7-5 (−303 to +672) into NIH3T3 fibroblasts and stimulated the cells with cytokines as indicated (Fig. 2 C). TGF-β isoforms β1, β2, and β3 stimulated luciferase activity by 4.1-, 3.4-, and 3.1-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 C). Both activin and BMP-7 induced the pS7-5 promoter activity 1.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively, whereas no induction was observed with TNF-α, IFN-γ, and EGF (Fig.2 C). These data suggest that TGF-β family members may activate a common element in the Smad7 promoter, albeit with different levels of stimulation. In contrast, up-regulation of Smad7 gene expression by TNF-α, IFN-γ, and EGF is not mediated through activation of the −303 to +672 Smad7 promoter region. To examine whether the −303 to +672 SMAD7 fragment was TGF-β-inducible in different cell types, we transfected the pS7-5 plasmid into murine mesangial cells and HaCaT cells in addition to NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The pS7-5 plasmid gave rise to comparable basal and TGF-β-inducible luciferase activities in all three cell lines, indicating that the TGF-β-responsive element is activated in a cell type-independent manner (Fig. 2 D). These experiments identified a 975-bp fragment (KpnI toHindIII) of the SMAD7 gene that contained both the TGF-β-responsive and basal promoter elements. This DNA fragment was sequenced in its entirety. Sequence analysis using the MatInspector version 2.2 program (19.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) did reveal several putative binding sites for transcription factors (Fig.3 A). The absence of a TATA-box and the presence of multiple Sp1 sites in this region suggested that the SMAD7 gene has a TATA-less promoter (20.Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To identify putative transcription initiation sites in the Smad7 promoter, we performed a series of primer extension analyses with poly(A) RNA from human kidney (CLONTECH). A major extension product of 49 bp was obtained in multiple experiments and compared with sequence analysis of genomic SMAD7 DNA, using the same primer (Fig. 3 B). This major initiation site was designated as the +1-position (Fig. 3 A). Inspection of the sequence of the −303 to +672 DNA fragment revealed an 8-bp palindromic Smad3/Smad4 binding sequence (the SBE) at positions −179 to −172 (Fig. 3 A). This sequence has been shown to interact with recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 and was sufficient to confer transcriptional activation by TGF-β upon a heterologous promoter reporter construct (21.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SBE in the Smad7 promoter was necessary to confer TGF-β-inducibility, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change thymidine −176 to adenine and adenine −175 to thymidine in pS7-5, resulting in pS7-5mSBE (Fig.4 A). These point mutations were expected to abolish binding of Smad3 and/or Smad4 to the SBE completely (21.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). When transfected into NIH3T3 cells, wild type pS7-5 conferred 2.7-fold induction of luciferase activity by TGF-β (Fig.4 B). In contrast, pS7-5mSBE was able to mediate basal promoter activity but did not confer induction by TGF-β (Fig.4 B), demonstrating that the SBE at −179 to −172 was necessary for induction of the Smad7 promoter by TGF-β. Next, we used radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes spanning positions −185 to −166 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to examine whether the Smad7 SBE (S7SBE) was able to interact with nuclear protein complexes. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from untreated and TGF-β-treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts. DNA binding of a protein complex labeled the SBE-binding complex (SBC) was specific and strongly increased in nuclear extracts from TGF-β treated NIH3T3 when compared with untreated NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4 C,lanes 3 and 2, respectively). Time course experiments indicated that the induction of SBC was detectable as early as 10 min and strongest after 40 min of TGF-β treatment (data not shown). Preincubation of nuclear extracts from TGF-β-treated NIH3T3 cells with anti-SMAD2, anti-SMAD3, and anti-SMAD4 antibodies revealed significantly reduced SBC binding in the presence of anti-SMAD2 antibodies (Fig. 4 C, lane 6) or supershifted SBC complexes in the presence of anti-SMAD3 (lane 7) or anti-SMAD4 (lane 8), suggesting that SBC contained Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 antigens. We obtained similar results when nuclear extracts from untreated NIH3T3 were used, albeit the intensity of the SBC signal was much weaker throughout the experiment (Fig.4 C, lanes 9–14). These results indicated that a nuclear protein complexes containing Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 formed at the SBE in the Smad7 promoter at base line and that TGF-β treatment strongly increased the amount of bound Smad protein complexes, resulting in transcriptional activation of the Smad7 promoter. The SBE probe specifically interacted with a higher molecular weight complex in most experiments (labeled with anasterisk, Fig. 4 C). The binding characteristics of this complex were not significantly altered by TGF-β or anti-SMAD antibodies. Since it has been reported that the GTCTAGAC sequence does not interact with recombinant Smad2 (21.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), we further investigated whether Smad2 antigens participated in SBC on the Smad7 promoter. We used, in addition to the polyclonal anti-SMAD2 antibody, a monoclonal anti-SMAD2 antibody that specifically detected Smad2 but not Smad3 or Smad4 (see Fig. 5 A). This antibody supershifted the SBC irrespective of whether it was added to the binding reaction before or after the addition of the SBE probe (Fig.4 D), suggesting that Smad2 participates in the SBC. In order to provide conclusive evidence for a role of Smad proteins in the induction of the SMAD7 gene by TGF-β, we obtained MEFs with either targeted deletions of Smad2 (15.Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Lia M. Böttinger E. Edelmann W. Stewart C.L. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or Smad3 (16.Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the SMAD4-deficient breast cancer cell line MD-MBA468. Western blot analysis using anti-SMAD2 and anti-SMAD3 antibodies confirmed that both Smad2−/− MEFs and Smad3−/− MEFs lacked Smad2 or Smad3 protein, respectively (Fig. 5 A). EMSAs using nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and TGF-β-treated wild type control MEFs confirmed both the basal and inducible binding of SBC to the SBE probe (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and2). SBC formation was also observed in Smad2−/− nuclear protein extracts, albeit the signal intensity of basal and induced SBCs appeared weaker compared with wild type nuclear protein extracts (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the binding of TGF-β-inducible SBC was dramatically reduced in Smad3-deficient nuclear protein extracts (Fig. 5 B, lane 8), and neither basal nor TGF-β-inducible SBC were detectable in nuclear extracts derived from Smad4-deficient MD-MBA468 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10 and 11). The high molecular weight DNA-protein complex (*) was detectable irrespective of the presence or absence of Smad2 and Smad3 but was not observed in Smad4-deficient cells (Fig. 5 B). Our data suggest that Smad4 is absolutely required for the formation of basal and TGF-β-inducible SBC and that Smad3 is a major component of the TGF-β-inducible SBC. In contrast, Smad2 is not required for binding of SBC to the SBE probe. Next, we transfected the TGF-β-responsive Smad7 promoter reporter construct pS7-5 into wild type control MEFs, Smad2-deficient MEFs, Smad3-deficient MEFs, and Smad4-deficient MD-MBA468 cells to examine the functional roles of these Smad proteins in the transcriptional regulation of the SMAD7 gene. TGF-β treatment resulted in significant 2.4- and 2.1-fold increases of luciferase activities in transfected wild type and Smad2-deficient MEFs, respectively (Fig.6 A). In contrast, TGF-β had no significant effect on luciferase activities in pS7-5-transfected Smad3-deficient MEFs (1.2-fold induction) and Smad4-deficient MD-MBA468 cells (0.9-fold induction). To confirm the essential roles for both Smad3 and Smad4 in the induction of the Smad7 promoter by TGF-β, we reconstituted the deficient Smad proteins by cotransfection of cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer expression vectors for Smad2 (pFSmad2), Smad3 (pFSmad3), or Smad4 (pHASmad4), respectively, together with the pS7-5 reporter plasmid (see Fig. 6 B). Reconstitution of Smad2 in Smad2-deficient MEFs had no significant effect on either base-line or TGF-β-inducible pS7-5-mediated luciferase activities (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, reconstitution of Smad3 in Smad3-deficient MEFs resulted in a strong increase of both base-line and TGF-β-inducible luciferase activities. Reconstitution of Smad4 in MD-MBA468 cells rescued the inducibility of the Smad7 promoter luciferase activity by TGF-β and had no effect on basal promoter activity (Fig. 6 B). These results provide conclusive evidence that both Smad3 and Smad4 are essential for the induction of the Smad7 promoter by TGF-β. We report a molecular mechanism that may have a central role in negative autoregulation of TGF-β/Smad signaling. Our results demonstrate that ligand-dependent activation of TGF-β receptor complexes induces the interaction of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 transcription factor complexes with a palindromic consensus Smad binding element in the human Smad7 promoter. Mutations in thiscis-acting element or deletion of either Smad3 or Smad4, but not Smad2, ablate the ability of TGF-β to induce the humanSmad7 promoter. Thus, the transcriptional regulation of Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of the TGF-β type I receptor (10.Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N.

Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar), by TGF-β itself is mediated through a rapid and direct Smad3- and Smad4-dependent signaling mechanism. Detailed molecular studies of a number of TGF-β-responsive promoters suggest that the TGF-β/Smad pathway regulates transcription by at least two distinct mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the interaction of Smad proteins with other transcription factors at their specific binding sequences in TGF-β-responsive promoters. For example, the TGF-β or activin response of the Mix.2 promoter is mediated by a Fast-2-dependent transcriptional activator complex consisting of Fast-2 and Smad2-Smad4 complexes (9.Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In contrast, a number of examples support a distinct mechanism of regulation in which Smad3 and Smad4 activate transcription through direct interaction with specific DNA sequences (i.e. CAGA) or so-called Smad binding elements (22.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 23.Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our observations that the Smad7 promoter contains a palindromic GTCTAGAC sequence that mediates binding of and transcriptional activation by Smad3 and Smad4 now provide an additional important example for direct Smad3/Smad4-dependent transcriptional regulation by TGF-β. However, our observation that Smad2 is associated with Smad3 and Smad4 in the TGF-β-inducible SBE-binding complex that interacts with the GTCTAGAC element in the Smad7 promoter has not previously been reported and raises additional questions. First, we show that Smad2 is associated with the basal and TGF-β-inducible SBE-binding complex, but in contrast with Smad3 and Smad4, Smad2 is not required for induction of the Smad7 promoter by TGF-β. A functional role for Smad2 in the SBC therefore remains to be established. In addition, the GTCTAGAC sequence has been identified in a oligonucleotide-based screening by its binding to the major homology-1 domain of recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 (21.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The major homology-1 domain of Smad2 was unable to bind to this artificial binding sequence directly. However, the human Smad7 promoter represents the first naturally occurring gene that contains the GTCTAGAC sequence as a functional SBE. Since our binding studies were performed using whole nuclear protein extracts, instead of recombinant proteins, it is likely that Smad2 does not bind DNA directly but participates in a heterotrimeric Smad-binding complex containing at least Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (25.Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be needed to clarify this issue. Several reports indicate that the expression of Smad7 is induced by independent pathways including TGF-β, activin, BMP-7, IFN-γ, shear stress, and NF-κB pathways (11.Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K.R. Xu Y.Y. Deeds J.D. Feeley R. Gimeno C.J. Woolf E.A. Tayber O. Mays G.G. Sampson B.A. Schoen F.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Falb D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar).2 Our results provide evidence that signaling by the TGF-β superfamily members TGF-β, activin, and BMP-7 may converge on the SBE in the Smad7 promoter. Whereas both activin and BMP-7 stimulation resulted in a small but significant increase of the Smad7 promoter reporter gene activity, induction mediated by the three TGF-β isoforms β1, β2, and β3 was considerably stronger (see Fig. 2 C). These results are consistent with a previous report demonstrating strong induction of Smad7 mRNA expression by TGF-β1, compared with moderate induction by activin and BMP-7 (13.Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results indicate that TNF-α, IFN-γ, and EGF may regulate the Smad7 gene through cis- and trans-acting elements independent of the SBE and its binding complex. These data support a model in which the overall degree of Smad7 gene expression under physiological or pathophysiological conditions may be determined through combinatorial activation of distinct regulatory elements at the level of the Smad7 promoter. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of the major TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway that support an oscillating rather than a static mode of feedback regulation involving inhibitory Smad7. In such a model, activation of TGF-β receptor complexes by its ligands results in the activation of Smad3 and Smad4 and leads to the rapid and transient transcriptional activation and/or repression of a set of target genes that can be characterized as immediate early gene responses and include the SMAD7 gene. Smad7 may then directly inhibit further activity of the receptor complex by associating with it at the intracellular domain and blocking activation of receptor-regulated Smads. Thus, Smad7 may turn off its own Smad3/Smad4-dependent transcription. Depending on the rate of dissociation and turnover of TGF-β receptor and Smad7 complexes, cells would regain responsiveness to new TGF-β stimulation and reactivation of the cycle. Such a model is consistent with observations that Smad7 mRNA expression shows an early peak at 30–90 min and additional peaks between 4 and 24 h of exposure to TGF-β (13.Afrakhte M. Moren A.

For example, several negative regulators that are positively transcriptionally regulated by the pathway that they inhibit have been identified in epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in Drosophila (26.Schweitzer R.

Is it possible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a physical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial polarization state, is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same initial state and the other in some standard polarization state? If this could be done, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an unknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning or exactly, by probabilistic cloning. This could in principle be useful in quantum computation, where one could store new information in an already computed state by deleting the old information. Here we show, however, that the linearity of quantum theory does not allow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. Though in a classical computer information can be deleted (reversibly) against a copy, the analogous task cannot be accomplished, even irreversibly, with quantum information."

Similarly, proper targeting of proteins to either axons or dendrites plays an important role in neurotransmission. Many studies have been directed at the molecular basis that controls these targeting decisions. In Caenorhabditis elegans, three proteins (Lin-2, Lin-7, and Lin-10) are crucial for the correct localization of the worm epidermal growth factor receptor, Let-23, to the basolateral surface of the body wall epithelium (1.Simske J.S.

In addition to PTB and PDZ domains, X11α/Mint1 contains an extended amino terminus that can bind mLin-2/Cask and Munc-18 (9.Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 12.Borg J.P. Lopez-Figueroa M.O. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Turner R.S. Watson S.J. Margolis B. J.

Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like many Maguk proteins, mLin-2/Cask also contains a band 4.1 binding site that can potentially interact with members of the family of proteins including ezrin, radixin, and moesin (14.Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The calmodulin kinase-like domain of mLin-2/Cask binds X11α/Mint1, while a region between the calmodulin kinase domain and the PDZ domain of mLin-2/Cask binds to the amino terminus of mLin-7 (3.Kaech S.M.

There are several mLin-7 genes also known as vertebrate Lin-7 (Velis) or mammalian Lin-7 (Mals) (5.Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C.

In worms, the PDZ of Lin-7 domain binds to the carboxyl terminus of the Let-23 receptor (1.Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Cell. 1996; 85: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The X11α/Mint, mLin-2/Cask, and mLin-7 system has been studied in mammalian epithelial cells. In epithelia, the mLin-10 homologue is X11γ/Mint3 (6.Borg J.-P. Straight S.W. Kaech S.M. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Karnak D. Turner R.S. Kim S.K. Margolis B. J. Biol.

Borg J.-P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, both mLin-2/Cask and mLin-7 target to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells (14.Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15.Irie M. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Nishioka H. Takai Y.

Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A target for the PDZ domain in renal epithelia has been identified as BGT-1 (18.Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.-P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). BGT-1 localizes to the basolateral side of renal epithelia and permits the uptake of organic osmolytes in hypertonic stress (20.Yamauchi A. Kwon H.M. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F197-F202PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Kwon H.M. Preston A.S. Robey R.B. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 649-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the mLin-7 binding site on BGT-1 does not appear to affect its delivery to the basolateral surface but does affect its stability at the surface (19.Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our studies have examined the mechanism that targets mLin-2/Cask and mLin-7 to the basolateral surface of epithelia cells. We have found that the amino terminus of mLin-7 alone is sufficient for lateral targeting (18.Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.-P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither the amino-terminal nor carboxyl-terminal half of mLin-2/Cask targets properly in MDCK cells. The amino-terminal half of mLin-2/Cask not only mislocalizes in cells but also partially mislocalizes endogenous mLin-7. Recent work has suggested that the amino terminus of mLin-7 may have binding partners in addition to Lin-2 (5.Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In this study we performed Far Western blotting and bacterial expression cloning to identify additional mLin-7-binding proteins in the mouse. We call these mLin-7-binding proteins PALS (proteins associated with Lin-7) and present a characterization of two novel family members, Pals1 and Pals2. Recombinant mouse Lin-7 C (Veli-3) protein (6.Borg J.-P. Straight S.W. Kaech S.M. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Karnak D. Turner R.S. Kim S.K. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31633-31636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was cloned into pGSTag vector that encodes glutathione S-transferase (GST) and protein kinase A phosphorylation sequence located amino-terminally of the multiple cloning site (22.Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in DH-5-α Escherichia coli cells and approximately 20 μg bound to 100 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1 mm DTT, the beads were equilibrated and resuspended in DK buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, and 5 mm DTT). Phosphorylation of the protein was performed in DK buffer using 10 units of protein kinase A (Sigma) and 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) as described (22.Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). After washing the beads with 50 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, the phosphorylated protein was eluted with 500 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm each of EDTA, DTT, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.005% Nonidet P-40 detergent, and 20 mm reduced glutathione. The protein was resuspended in FWB buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.02% sodium azide, and 5% nonfat dry milk) and stored aliquoted at −70 °C. The specific radioactivity of the probe obtained by this method was in the range 4 × 107 to 9 × 107 cpm/μg protein. Proteins were separated on 10% or gradient 4–12% BisTris gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the NuPAGE electrophoresis system (Novex). After blocking in FWB buffer (see above) for 3 h, membranes were transferred to fresh FWB buffer containing 2–3 × 106 cpm/ml of radiolabeled probe and incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Membranes were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and TBS without detergent, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screen. Immunoprecipitations and pull-downs were performed as described before (8.Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Sixteen-day mouse embryo λExlox library (Novagen) was screened for expression of mLin-7 binding partners essentially as described by Margolis and Young (23.Margolis B. Young R.A. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning 2. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 1-14Google Scholar). Briefly, λExlox phage were plated with the recipient E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE strain at 5 × 105plaque-forming units/ml on LB soft agarose. After 8–12 h at 37 °C, plates containing plaques were overlaid with nitrocellulose filter discs (Schleicher & Schuell) that have been impregnated with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and air-dried. Filters were incubated with the plaques overnight at 37 °C, washed five times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked for 3 h in FWB buffer. Filters were then transferred to fresh FWB buffer containing 2 × 106 cpm/ml radiolabeled probe and incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. After three washes each of TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and TBS without detergent, filters were air-dried and exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screen. Phages were isolated from positive plaques into SM medium (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mmNaCl, 8 mm MgSO4, 0.1% gelatin), diluted 104 times with fresh SM and replated. Positive clones were subjected to successive cycles of replating and screening as described above until phage clones were purified to homogeneity. λExlox phage clones were converted to pEXLox plasmids by infecting E. coli BM25.8 cells that contain P1 Cre recombinase at 2 × 102 colony-forming units/ml. Plasmid DNA of positive colonies was transformed and maintained into DH-5-α E. coli cells. Cloned DNA inserts were subjected to automated sequencing using T7 gene 10 and T7 terminator primers at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core Facility. Pals1 cDNA derived by bacterial expression cloning was incomplete in 5′ direction, and the full-length clone was subsequently obtained from a 17-day mouse embryo library by PCR screening using the Rapid Screen Kit (OriGene). Constructs encoding full-length Pals1 or Pals1 (163–675) proteins with amino-terminal Myc tag were generated by amplifying the respective cDNA fragments by PCR and cloning into Myc-RK5 vector. NH2-terminal GST fusion constructs encoding different fragments of Pals1 were generated by PCR using appropriate primers and subcloned in frame into either pGSTag or pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His-tagged Pals1 (163–272) was prepared by direct subcloning from pGSTag into pET 28(b)+ vector (Novagen). Full-length Pals2α cDNA was prepared by PCR from the original pEXLox clone and subcloned into pCMV-tag3(A) vector (Stratagene) resulting in NH2-terminal Myc-tagged protein. NH2-terminal GST fusion construct encoding Pals2α (1–436) was generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length Pals1 and Pals2 cDNAs were generated by PCR and cloned into pEYFP-C1 or pEYFP-N1 vectors (CLONTECH) resulting in constructs bearing amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) tags, respectively. Point mutants in GST-Pals1 (163–272) were generated by a two-step overlap extension PCR using the original pEXLox clone as template while point mutants in full-length Myc-Pals1 were derived from the Myc-RK-5 construct by the Quick Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria or in mammalian cells as described below and analyzed for expression and size by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Living Color,CLONTECH), polyclonal anti-Pals1, polyclonal anti-Pals2α (see below), or monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz). Pals1 and Pals2 genes were mapped using the mouse T31 Radiation Hybrid (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Pairs of specific primers of the genes were used to amplify mouse-specific fragments. All reactions were performed at least in duplicate, and anomalous results were further checked with extended cycles. The patterns of mouse band positive cell lines were submitted to the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Radiation Hybrid Data Base for analysis against all previously mapped framework data for this T31 panel. Sequence alignments were done using the Lasergene (Megalign) software by the Clustal method. Human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with the smallHindIII fragment (base pairs 1568–2835) of Pals1 cDNA following the protocol of the manufacturer. Actin probe (CLONTECH) was used as a normalization control. The probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using Rediprime II labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as directed by the manufacturer. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with a 370-base pair Pals2 cDNA fragment generated by PCR as described above. PCR-based mRNA analysis was performed with appropriate Pals2α and Pals2β sequence-specific primers using mouse multiple tissue cDNA panel I normalized for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyclonal antibodies against GST-Pals1 (1–181), GST-Pals1 (163–272), and GST-Pals2α (1–436) were raised in rabbits using the respective fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-agarose beads as immunogens (24.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of anti-Pals1 (1–163) was carried out with His-Pals1 (163–272) protein coupled to Affi-Gel support (Bio-Rad) as described before (24.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Lin-7 were described elsewhere (6.Borg J.-P. Straight S.W. Kaech S.M. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Karnak D. Turner R.S. Kim S.K. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31633-31636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 3 μg of NH2- or COOH-terminal EYFP-Pals1 or Pals2α alone or RK5-MycPals1 in combination with 1 μg of PSV-neo on 50% confluent 60-mm dishes. To generate stable MDCK clones, 2 days after transfection cells were split into three 100-mm dishes and were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was changed every other day. After 10 days in selection, colonies were picked up and plated on 24-well plates for expansion. The EYFP-Pals and Myc-Pals1 clones were analyzed by fluorescent microscope directly or following immunofluorescence staining (18.Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.-P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. When electrophoretically separated proteins from Triton X-100 lysates of different cell lines were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with radiolabeled GST-mLin-7, at least five discrete protein bands were identified, ranging from 55 to 100 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The same bands were also present in lysates from whole brain or kidney (data not shown). Both mLin-7 and mLin-2/Cask have been described as ubiquitously expressed proteins (5.Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 13.Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Irie M. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but differential patterns of mLin-7-binding proteins were seen in various cells. The band at 100 kDa is contributed in whole or in part by mLin-2/Cask. No bands were detectable with an amino-terminally truncated form of Lin-7 (mLin-7 1–30), which was previously shown to be defective in mLin2/CASK binding in pull-down assay (results not shown). To test the specificity of this interaction, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment using anti-mLin-7 polyclonal antibody. Fig. 1 B shows that the same proteins that are present in lysates specifically co-imunoprecipitated with mLin-7 in both A172 glioblastoma cells or MDCK canine kidney cells. mLin-2/CASK, Dlg2, and Dlg3 belong to the MAGUK superfamily of proteins and have been shown to bind to mLin-7 through an interaction that involves the amino-terminal region of mLin-7 (3.Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5.Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C.

Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31633-31636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that additional binding partners for mLin-7 exist. This motivated us to screen for such potential target proteins by using bacterial expression cloning (23.Margolis B. Young R.A. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning 2. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 1-14Google Scholar). We screened a 16 day mouse embryo λEXlox library with radiolabeled GST-mLin-7. We obtained 49 positive clones on primary screen and subjected them to successive rounds of purification until 16 positive clones were purified to homogeneity. Purified phages were converted to pEXLox plasmids by passing them through Cre recombinase-positive E. coli strain. We called these clones, PALS, for proteins associated with Lin-7. Among the six cloned genes, four belong to the MAGUK superfamily. Two did not show any sequence homology to Maguk proteins, and it is not clear if they represent true binding partners. Pals1 and Pals2 were novel MAGUK genes, while Pals3 was mLin-2/CASK (13.Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Pals4 was Dlg2/MPP2 (25.Mazoyer S. Gayther S.A. Nagai M.A. Smith S.A. Dunning A. van Rensburg E.J. Albertsen H. White R. Ponder B.A. Genomics. 1995; 28: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Pals1 (accession no. AF199008) is a gene possessing 56% homology to the mouse Dlg3/MPP3 (26.Lin L. Peters L.L. Ciciotte S.L. Chishti A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27.Smith S.A. Holik P. Stevens J. Mazoyer S. Melis R. Williams B. White R. Albertsen H. Genomics. 1996; 31: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) at the amino acid level. This clone was incomplete in 5′ direction, and the full-length cDNA was subsequently obtained by PCR from a 17-day mouse embryo library using the Rapid Screen Kit (OriGene). It contains an open reading frame encoding 675 amino acids of which the amino-terminal 130 amino acids are unique and do not show any homology to known sequences in the data base. The predicted molecular mass of this protein is 77.2 kDa. Pals2 was represented by two forms differing by an insertion of 14 amino acids. Pals2α cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. AF199009) contained an open reading frame of 539 amino acids and that of Pals2β (GenBank™ accession no. AF199010), 553 amino acids, respectively. The 14-amino acid insertion is located between the PDZ and the SH3 domains of the protein. The predicted protein shows 82% homology to mouse Dlg2/MPP2. During the course of this study, the sequences of mouse and human p55T gene were deposited in GenBank™ (accession nos. AF161181.1 and AF162130, respectively). The mouse P55T gene is similar to Pals2α with only two substitutions. These two amino acids in Pals2α match the human p55T sequence and are conservative substitutions. Searching for gene bank similarities, we have found that the human Pals2 gene matches fragments of a BAC clone sequences on chromosome 7 p15-p21 (BAC clone RG298G08, accession no. AC005084), which spans approximately 115 kb. The 42 bases that confer the longer form of Pals2 are present within this Bac sequence, which suggests that these two forms are splice variants. The significance of this splice variation is unclear at present. Sequence alignment of five Maguk proteins that bind mLin-7 showed a high degree of conservation at the already described PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase (Guk) domains (Fig.2). All sequences except Dlg3 also contain a conserved 4.1 protein binding site (28.Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Most differences are related to the amino-terminal portions of these proteins. It has been found that 220 amino acids located between the calmodulin kinase-like domain and the PDZ domain of mLin-2/CASK contain the binding site for mLin-7 (3.Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5.Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C.

Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31633-31636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Alignment between that region in mLin2/CASK and the sequences located amino-terminally from the PDZ domains in Dlg2, Dlg3, Pals1, and Pals2 reveal a high degree of homology between all five proteins in a region spanning approximately 90 amino acids (amino acids 139–229 in Pals1; Fig. 2). Our original clone of Pals1, obtained by bacterial expression cloning, started at amino acid 163 and lacked part of this conserved region. We cloned and expressed GST-Pals1 (163–590) and GST-Pals1 (163–272) proteins and tested them in a pull-down experiment using lysates containing full-length Myc-mLin-7. Both proteins bound Myc-Lin-7, indicating that amino acids 163–272 of Pals1 are sufficient for binding mLin-7 (Fig. 3and results not shown). We then produced a series of amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal truncations of GST-Pals1 (163–272). Fig.3 A shows a pull-down binding assay with six truncated Pals1 GST fusion proteins. The results of these experiments indicated the minimum mLin-7 binding domain is represented by amino acids 181–243 in Pals1. Within this region there is a 21-amino acid fragment (amino acids 207–228 in Pals1) with a high degree of conservation (Fig.2 A, L7B domain). However, a GST-Pals1 (201–243) construct containing just this fragment did not bind Myc-Lin-7, suggesting that the highly conserved region is not sufficient for binding and additional upstream residues are required for docking and/or proper folding.Figure 3Identification of the minimum mLin-7 binding domain.

Expressed GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione agarose and used in pull-down assay with lysates from MDCK cells expressing full-le"
https://openalex.org/W1970562267,"Thyroid hormone (T3) coordinates growth, differentiation, and metabolism by binding to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). The TRα gene encodes T3-activated TRα1 (NR1A1a) as well as an antagonistic, non-T3-binding alternatively spliced product, TRα2 (NR1A1b). Thus, the TRα1/TRα2 ratio is a critical determinant of T3 action. However, the mechanisms underlying this post-transcriptional regulation are unknown. We have identified a non-consensus, TRα2-specific 5′ splice site and conserved intronic sequences as key determinants of TRα mRNA processing. In addition to these cis-acting elements, a novel regulatory feature is the orphan receptor RevErbAα (NR1D1) gene, which is transcribed from the opposite direction at the same locus and overlaps the TRα2 coding region. RevErbAα gene expression correlates with a high TRα1/TRα2 ratio in a number of tissues. Here we demonstrate that coexpression of RevErbAα and TRα regulates the TRα1/TRα2 ratio in intact cells. Thus, both cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms contribute to cell-specific post-transcriptional regulation of TR gene expression and T3 action. Thyroid hormone (T3) coordinates growth, differentiation, and metabolism by binding to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). The TRα gene encodes T3-activated TRα1 (NR1A1a) as well as an antagonistic, non-T3-binding alternatively spliced product, TRα2 (NR1A1b). Thus, the TRα1/TRα2 ratio is a critical determinant of T3 action. However, the mechanisms underlying this post-transcriptional regulation are unknown. We have identified a non-consensus, TRα2-specific 5′ splice site and conserved intronic sequences as key determinants of TRα mRNA processing. In addition to these cis-acting elements, a novel regulatory feature is the orphan receptor RevErbAα (NR1D1) gene, which is transcribed from the opposite direction at the same locus and overlaps the TRα2 coding region. RevErbAα gene expression correlates with a high TRα1/TRα2 ratio in a number of tissues. Here we demonstrate that coexpression of RevErbAα and TRα regulates the TRα1/TRα2 ratio in intact cells. Thus, both cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms contribute to cell-specific post-transcriptional regulation of TR gene expression and T3 action. thyroid hormone receptor thyroid hormone RevErbAα splice site nucleotide(s) exonic splicing enhancer thymidine kinase green fluorescent protein base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) cytomegalovirus Rous sarcoma virus Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs)1 mediate the diverse physiological effects of thyroid hormone (T3) (1.Brent G.A.

TRs are encoded by two closely related genes, erbAα and erbAβ, in all vertebrates (4.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). Additional receptor diversity is generated by alternative processing of the TRα and TRβ pre-mRNAs. The alternatively spliced isoforms of TRα, TRα1 (NR1A1a) (5.Nuclear Receptors CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) and TRα2 (NR1A1b), are of particular interest. Although both are widely expressed, they are functionally antagonistic. Due to its variant C terminus, TRα2, unlike TRα1, does not bind T3 and lacks the major activation function present in other TRs (6.Koenig R.J. Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Brent G.A. Larsen P.R. Chin W.W.

The dominant negative activity of TRα2 appears to reflect both competition for binding to TR target genes as well as altered protein-protein interactions (8.Katz D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

Expression of the two TRα isoforms is highly regulated, with each mRNA expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. In some tissues TRα2 represents a relatively minor fraction of the TR-related isoforms, while in other tissues such as brain, kidney, and testes, TRα2 is the most abundant isoform (12.Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Perez-Castillo A. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Hodin R.A. Meng S. Chamberlain S.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A developmental increase in the T3 responsiveness of some cells correlates with a decrease in the relative expression of TRα2 mRNA, suggesting that TRα2 expression modulates T3action (13.Hodin R.A. Meng S. Chamberlain S.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, TRα2 may act as a tissue-specific antagonist of T3-responsive gene activation. Interestingly, the alternative post-transcriptional processing of the TRα transcript that gives rise to TRα2 mRNA occurs exclusively in mammals (14.Izumo S. Mahdavi V. Nature. 1988; 334: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 15.Koenig R. Warne R.I. Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1988; 85: 5804-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The mammalian TRα gene is also remarkable in that it partially overlaps the gene for another nuclear receptor that is encoded on the opposite DNA strand. This receptor gene, RevErbAα (RevErb, NR1D1), is convergently transcribed with respect to the TRα gene such that its 3′ end overlaps sequences coding for TRα2, but not TRα1 (18.Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19.Miyajima N. Horiuchi R. Shibuya Y. Fukushige S. Matsubara K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Cell. 1989; 57: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The unusual organization of these two genes, which code for structurally related transcription factors, may have important implications for regulation. In many cells and tissues, high levels of RevErb mRNA correlate with low levels of TRα2 mRNA relative to TRα1 (18.Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20.Hastings M.L. Milcarek C. Martincic K. Peterson M.L. Munroe S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4296-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conditions that alter RevErb expression levels often result in a reciprocal change in the ratio of TRα2 to TRα1 (21.Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Cardona G. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12859-12863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these observations is that the complementary 3′ ends of the RevErb and TRα2 transcripts form duplexes that negatively regulate TRα2 mRNA. In this case specific base pairing interactions between RevErb and TRα2 RNA may provide a transcript-specific mechanism for regulating the level of TRα1 and TRα2 mRNA levels. Although antisense RNA provides a well established mechanism for regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic systems, it is poorly characterized in eukaryotes (23.Kumar M. Carmichael G.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1415-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mechanisms regulating alternative processing of the TRα mRNAs are of interest from both a physiological and mechanistic perspective. In this study, we examine the requirements for alternative processing of TRα1 and TRα2 mRNA using a model erbAα minigene. Our results demonstrate that the activity of the TRα2-specific 5′ splice site (ss) is dependent on sequence elements located within the TRα2-specific intron. We also find that RevErb expression results in a decrease in TRα2 mRNA relative to TRα1, consistent with a role for RevErb mRNA in blocking TRα2 expression. These findings have important implications for the regulation and evolution of the thyroid hormone response in mammals. TRα and RevErb transcripts were expressed from a 9.1-kb MscI/BamHI fragment that spans exons 7–10 of the rat TRα gene and exons 2–8 of the overlapping RevErb gene (18.Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned into the HindIII andNotI sites of the pRcCMV vector (InVitrogen) to create pCMV-erbAm. A plasmid expressing TRα and RevErb was constructed by reversing the orientation of this insert relative to the CMV promoter and inserting the SV40 early promoter adjacent to the TRα gene. In this plasmid, pSVerbA/Rev(CMV), the 9.1-kb insert was cloned between the NotI and ApaI sites of pRcCMV and a 344-bpPvuII/HindII SV40 fragment replaced downstream vector sequences extending through another SV40 promoter to aBclI site. A control plasmid, pSVerbA(ΔCMV), lacking the CMV promoter, was made by deleting the NruI/NotI fragment upstream of the insert in pSVerbA/Rev(SV). The pSVerbA/Rev plasmids, with and without the CMV promoter, were modified by insertion of the complete green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence as a 0.75-kbKpnI/NotI fragment upstream of RevErb to produce pSVerbA/GFP-Rev(CMV) and pSVerbA/GFP-Rev(ΔCMV). pTKerbA/Rev(RSV) was constructed by replacing the CMV promoter in pSVerbA/Rev(CMV) with the RSV promoter and the SV40 promoter with the HSV1 thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. The RSV and TK promoters in this construct were obtained as a NdeI/HindIII fragment of pRSV2 (the gift of M. T. McNally, Medical College of Wisconsin) (24.McNally M.T. Gontarek R.R. Beemon K. Virology. 1991; 185: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and aBglII/HindIII fragment from pXK70R (the gift of K. W. Wilcox, Medical College of Wisconsin) (25.McKnight S.L. Gavis E.R. Kingsbury R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), respectively. A control plasmid, pTKerbA(ΔRSV), was made by omitting the RSV promoter. The minigenes with TRα2-specific 5′ss mutations were constructed using polymerase chain reaction. In pCMV-erbAm(Δ5′ss), the wild-type sequence (AG/GUGACU) at the 5′ss (/) is replaced with the sequence CC/CACACA. pCMV-erbAm(5′ss+5G) and pCMV-erbAm (5′ss+6G) contain a single G residue substitution at positions 5 and 6 of the TRα2-specific 5′ss, respectively. pCMV-erbAm(ΔBS) and pCMV-erbAm(ΔXS) were made by deleting a 3.5-kbBsu36I/SspI and a 3.2-kbXbaI/SspI from the TRα2 intron, respectively. pCMV-erbAm(ΔBS+344H) was constructed by inserting a 344-bpSphI/PstI fragment of λ phage into the deletion in pCMV-erbAm(ΔBS). For further analysis of the splicing enhancer, plasmid pCMV-erbAm was modified by deleting sequences extending from a BstEII site 260 nt to a XbaI site in the vector. A Bsu36I site within exon 10 was eliminated by end-filling to produce pErbA, which contains a unique Bsu36I site immediately downstream of the TRα1 stop codon. Expression and processing of the TRα mRNA from pErbA is comparable to that of pCMV-erbAm. pErbA(ΔBS) and pErbA(ΔXS) were derived from pErbA and include the same deletions as pCMV-erbAm(ΔBS) and pCMV-erbAm(ΔXS), respectively. pErbA(SE30) and pErbA(SE80) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the pErbA minigene using primers for sequences extending exactly 160 and 210 nt downstream, respectively, of the TRα2 5′ss. Sequences of plasmids and primers are available upon request. COS-1 and 293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Cells were replated at a density of 5 × 105cells/plate 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection of cells and isolation of RNA were carried out as described previously (20.Hastings M.L. Milcarek C.

Skeletal muscle RNA was prepared as a control from adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (26.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

The TRα2 poly(A) site probe was prepared from a cloned PstI/DdeI fragment yielding an RNA probe that overlaps the final 323 nt of TRα2. The TRα1 poly(A) site probe was made from a clonedStyI/HincII fragment, which overlapped the final 140 nt of TRα1. The TRα2 cDNA probe was prepared from a cloned 135-bp StuI/FseI fragment of TRα2 cDNA plasmid pα2ΔC-Sac/stop (27.Katz D. Berrodin T.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 805-814PubMed Google Scholar) that produced a probe that overlapped 80 nt of TRα1 and 134 nt of TRα2 mRNA. The exon 9A probe was prepared from a cloned DdeI/EcoO109I fragment that overlapped 97 nt of intron 8 and 154 nt of exon 9. RevErb poly(A) site probes were prepared from a cloned 516-bpStyI/EcoRI fragment. All other probes have been described (20.Hastings M.L. Milcarek C. Martincic K. Peterson M.L. Munroe S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4296-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Detailed information on each probe is available upon request. RNA assays were quantitated as by direct radioanalytic scanning of 32P-labeled blots or gels, following appropriate corrections for background and probe length and composition as described previously (20.Hastings M.L. Milcarek C. Martincic K. Peterson M.L. Munroe S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4296-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Formation of TRα1 and TRα2 reflects competition between two mutually exclusive alternative processing reactions: polyadenylation at the proximal TRα1-specific poly(A) site or splicing of the TRα2-specific 5′ss to exon 10 (Fig.1 A). To facilitate analysis of the requirements for alternative processing of TRα mRNAs, we constructed a minigene expression plasmid that includes the alternatively spliced exons and the entire region of overlap between TRα2 and RevErb in addition to other TRα and RevErb sequences (Fig.1 A). When this minigene was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, the resulting transcripts were alternatively spliced and polyadenylated at exactly the same sites used in the endogenous transcripts. RNase protection assays (Fig. 1 B) using probes complementary to the TRα2-specific 5′ss (lane 2), spliced TRα2 mRNA (lane 6), and to both polyadenylation sites (lanes 8–10) confirmed that the minigene transcripts were accurately processed. The sizes of the protected fragments are identical to those observed for endogenous mRNAs isolated from skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1, 5, and 11). Similarly, Northern blotting revealed two transcripts (3.9 and 1.4 kb; Fig. 2 B, lane 1) corresponding exactly to the expected sizes of the alternatively processed minigene transcripts. Only very low levels of endogenous transcripts were present in these cells, which were seen upon a 10-fold overexposure of lanes containing RNA from untransfected COS-1 cells (cf. Fig. 1 B (lanes 3 and 7) and Fig. 2 B (lane 5)). These results validate the use of the minigene as a model system for alternative processing of the TRα mRNAs.Figure 2TR α2 5′ splice site sequence is critical for balance between TR α1 and TR α2 mRNA processing. A, metazoan consensus 5′ss (28.Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar), the TRα1 coding sequence for mammals and non-mammals, and three separate 5′ss mutations made in pCMV-erbAm (+5G, +6G, Δss) are shown. Mutations are in lowercase, and non-consensus nucleotides are underlined. TRα consensus sequences correspond to the following data base files (GenBank™accession nos.): human (X55068), rat (M18028), mouse (X51983), sheep (Z68308), pig (AJ005797), frog (Xenopus laevis) (M35343,M35344), chicken (Y00987), penguin (AJ002363), flounder (D16461,D16462), and zebrafish (U54796). B, Northern blot analysis of 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from COS cells transfected with indicated plasmids. RNA from untransfected cells was included as a control (C, lane 5). Blots were hybridized with a probe from the region common to TRα1 and TRα2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sequence of the TRα2 5′ss differs from the metazoan 5′ss consensus at the highly conserved +5 position (Fig. 2 A) (28.Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). This sequence is also conserved in non-mammalian TRα genes, except for the presence of a purine at the position corresponding to +6 of the TRα2 5′ss (Fig. 2 A). This difference may account for the lack of splicing in the non-mammalian TRα gene. To test this hypothesis, we constructed three 5′ss mutations in the context of the rat TRα minigene (Fig.2 A). The first mutation (+5G) changes the +5C residue to G, thereby creating a 5′ss that matches the consensus. A second mutation (+6G) converts position +6 of the 5′ss from a U to a G as found in non-mammalian TRα1 genes. The third mutation (Δss) eliminates this 5′ss by changing six residues of the consensus sequence. Northern blot analysis of poly(A) mRNA from the different constructs demonstrates that the wild-type TRα transcripts were alternatively processed with a TRα1/TRα2 ratio of 3.3 (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Strikingly, the 5′ss consensus mutation (+5G) results in a complete switch to TRα2 splicing, with no detectable use of the TRα1 polyadenylation site (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The apparent increased expression of TRα2 (and some endogenously expressed RNAs) in lane 2 resulted from sample loading variation and is not reproducible. However, this overloading serves to demonstrate the complete absence of the TRα1 minigene transcript in the +5G mutation. The single-nucleotide difference between the mammalian and non-mammalian sequences is also important for splice site activity, as was apparent from the lack of splicing of the +6G mutant, which increased the ratio of TRα1/TRα2 mRNA about 7-fold (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Remarkably, this single base change reduced splicing nearly to the level of the Δss mutant, which has a completely crippled splice site and expresses only TRα1 (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). The switch to TRα1 processing and absence of cryptic splicing with the +6G and Δss mutations, and the switch to TRα2 expression with the +5G mutation, demonstrate that the suboptimal TRα2 5′ss allows both TRα1 and TRα2 to be derived from the primary transcript. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the strength of the TRα2 5′ss is critical for determining the balance between TRα1 and TRα2 mRNA processing. The suboptimal 5′ss in TRα2 mRNA presumably allows other factors to influence the balance between TRα2 alternative splicing and TRα1 polyadenylation. We considered that the activity of the TRα1 poly(A) site may be important in determining TRα alternative processing. However, deletion of the TRα1 poly(A) site produced only a modest enhancement of TRα2 mRNA splicing (data not shown). In addition, decreasing the length of the TRα2-specific intron by removing more than 60% of the central portion of this intron had little effect on TRα alternative processing (data not shown). We hypothesized that intronic sequences may regulate TRα2 mRNA processing. To test this, a deletion beginning 130 nt downstream of the TRα2 5′ss and ending 60 nt upstream of the TRα2 3′ss was constructed. The resulting minigene has a drastically shortened TRα2 intron of about 200 nt (ΔBS, Fig.3 A). By shortening the intron and removing the competing TRα1 polyadenylation site, this mutation was expected to enhance TRα2 splicing efficiency. Surprisingly, the deletion caused a striking decrease in splicing (Fig. 3 B,cf. lanes 2 and 4). Northern blot analysis and RNase protection assays confirm that the major product of this deletion is a transcript that is unspliced at the TRα2-specific 5′ss and extending to the TRα2 poly(A) site (results not shown). The loss of splicing observed with ΔBS indicates either that specific sequences within the deleted intron are required for TRα2 splicing or that the intron is shorter than a nonspecific minimal length. To test these possibilities, 344 nt of heterologous sequence was inserted into the ΔBS deletion (ΔBS+344H, Fig. 3 A). This nonspecific lengthening of the intron did not improve the efficiency of splicing (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, adding back 250 nt of the TRα2 intron to the 5′ end of the ΔBS deletion in the ΔXS deletion (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5 and 6) restored splicing efficiency to wild-type levels as shown quantitatively in Fig.3 C. These results provide evidence for a splicing enhancer sequence within a 250-nt region located 130–380 nt downstream of the TRα2 5′ss. The TRα2 splicing enhancer sequence was required for splicing at the inherently weak TRα2-specific 5′ss. However, the enhancer was not required when the TRα2 5′ss was mutated to the consensus (+5G) 5′ss sequence (Fig. 3 D, cf. lanes 4 and 8). This suggests that the function of the TRα2 intronic splicing enhancer is to regulate the suboptimal splicing characteristic of the wild-type TRα2 5′ss. As a first step toward more precisely mapping sequences required for enhancer activity, a phylogenetic comparison of sequences from this region of the TRα2 gene in mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates was carried out. The region analyzed includes coding and non-coding sequences from the first 500 nt of exon 9. The coding regions common to TRα1 and TRα2 and specific to TRα1 are very highly conserved among mammals with 96–98% identity (Fig.4 A). These sequences also are highly conserved among other vertebrates, with 80–88% identity between rat and frog. The conservation of these coding sequences reflects the highly conserved structure of the C-terminal portion of TRα1. It is noteworthy that a short, 80-nt segment (dark shading, Fig. 4 A) immediately downstream of the TRα1 stop codon, and within the 250-ntBsu36I/XbaI splicing enhancer fragment, is also conserved among mammals at a level (95%) comparable to that of the coding sequences immediately upstream. This high level of similarity drops off sharply (70–72% identity) further downstream of the stop codon, as seen in a comparison of three additional segments of identical length. Thus, the first 80 nt of the TRα1 3′-untranslated region are conserved at a level similar to the region coding for the highly conserved C-terminal portion of TRα1. In contrast to the conservation of coding sequence among all vertebrates, the non-coding sequences in non-mammalian vertebrates have essentially no similarity to the mammalian genes: only 29–39% identity in gapped alignments of 80-nt segments (Fig. 4 A). The very high conservation observed among mammalian sequence within the first 80 nt of the 3′-untranslated region of TRα1 mRNA strongly suggests that this region has a specific function, such as splicing, that is conserved in mammals but not in non-mammalian vertebrates. To test the role of the conserved 80-nt region in splicing, this sequence was inserted into the ΔBS deletion and assayed for its ability to promote splicing of TRα2 (Fig. 4 B). Splicing of this transcript, SE80, was compared with that of identical constructs that contain the ΔBS and ΔXS sequences previously described. The addition of 80 nt to the 5′ end of ΔBS (positions 130–210 in the TRα2-specific intron) results in splicing levels slightly higher than that seen in ΔXS or the wild-type TRα minigenes (Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 6). This result indicates that SE80 includes all of the sequences specific to ΔXS that are needed to enhance TRα2 splicing. We refer to this 80-nt sequence as the TRα2 splicing enhancer, SEα2. To precisely map SEα2, a 30-nt segment at the 5′ end of the conserved 80 nt region was also tested for enhancer activity (Fig.4 B). This transcript, SE30, displays nearly the same reduced level of splicing seen in ΔBS (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7 and 8). These results demonstrate that 50 nt located between positions 160 and 210 of the TRα2-specific intron are required for efficient splicing. To determine if SEα2 affects splicing of intron 8, as well as the TRα2-specific intron 9, splicing was assayed with a probe, spanning both the 3′ss and 5′ss of exon 9A. The results show that intron 8 was spliced out of approximately 95% of the transcripts from ΔBS, ΔXS, and SE80, a level similar to that observed for the wild-type transcript (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the presence or absence of SEα2 downstream of exon 9A has no effect on the activity of the upstream 3′ss, while dramatically altering the activity of the 5′ss for exon 9A. The structure of the TRα locus is remarkable in that the final exon of TRα2 overlaps the 3′ end of RevErb transcripts encoded on the opposite DNA strand (Fig. 1 A). We have shown previously that antisense transcripts derived from RevErb sequences regulate TRα splicing in vitro (29.Munroe S.H. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22083-22086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, such regulation has not been shown in vivo. To investigate the effect that the naturally occurring RevErb antisense RNA has on alternative processing of TRα mRNAs, we expressed RevErb from the opposite strand of the same insert used to express TRα mRNAs. RevErb minigene mRNA, beginning with exon 2, was expressed at high levels (Fig. 5, A andB, lane 4). This mRNA is correctly spliced and polyadenylated, as indicated by Northern blotting and RNase protection assays carried out at selected splice junctions (Fig. 5,B and C, and data not shown). Importantly, the 3′ end of the transcript mapped to a site that precisely matched that of endogenous RevErb mRNA from skeletal muscle (data not shown). Thus, the 3′ end of the rat RevErb minigene transcript, like the endogenous RNA, overlaps only TRα2 and not TRα1 (18.Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30.Lazar M.A. Jones K.E. Chin W.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TRα mRNA levels in 293 cells transfected with the minigene expressing both the TRα and RevErb genes (+R) were compared with those in cells expressing only TRα (−R, Fig. 5 A). A probe hybridizing to the common regions of TRα1 and TRα2 mRNA was used for Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 5, A and B) to allow the TRα1/TRα2 ratio to be determined accurately. A comparison of TRα expression with and without RevErb coexpression showed a striking 2.1-fold increase in the ratio of TRα1/TRα2 in the presence of RevErb relative to mRNA levels in its absence (Fig.5 B). These results were confirmed by RNase protection assays of total RNA, using the TRα2 cDNA probe shown in Fig. 1 (Fig.5 C). Using this probe, coexpression of RevErb resulted in 2.8 ± 0.4-fold increase in the TRα1/TRα2 ratio (Fig.5 C). The ratio of RevErb/TRα2 in these experiments was 34 ± 5 (Fig. 5 C), which is similar to ratios observed in cells expressing high levels of endogenous RevErb mRNA (20.Hastings M.L. Milcarek C. Martincic K. Peterson M.L. Munroe S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4296-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results were not due to promoter-related artifacts because similar results were obtained with a minigene employing the RSV early promoter to express RevErb and the herpes simplex virus TK promoter to drive TRα expression (data not shown). We also considered the possibility that the shift in ratio of TRα1/TRα2 observed upon expression of RevErb reflects direct or indirect effects of expressing the RevErb receptor protein, rather than the overlapping RevErb transcript. Although RevErb translation normally initiates at a start codon in exon 1, which is missing in the minigene, it is possible that the processed RevErb transcript is translated from an in-frame start codon in exon 2 (18.Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To eliminate possible translation of the RevErb reading frame, cells were transfected with plasmids that have the complete coding sequence for GFP terminated by a stop codon placed upstream of the RevErb minigene. This construct, pSVerbA/GFP-Rev(CMV), produced a GFP-RevErb mRNA transcript that efficiently expressed GFP (results not shown). Expression of this plasmid also showed a very similar shift in TRα1/TRα2 ratio as compared with the same construct lacking the CMV promoter (Fig. 5 C). Since translation of any portion of the RevErb coding sequence downstream of the stop codon following GFP is unlikely (3"

Therefore, it is important to characterize residual apoptotic pathways in CaP cells.

However, cells incapable of releasing Ca2+ stores are resistant to apoptotic stimuli, indicating that Ca2+ store release is also important. We investigated whether release of intracellular Ca2+ stores is sufficient to induce apoptosis of the CaP cell line LNCaP.

We compared the apoptotic pathways activated by intracellular Ca2+ store release with the dual insults of store release and cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation. Earlier processing of caspases-3 and -7 occurred when intracellular store release was the sole Ca2+ perturbation. Apoptosis was attenuated in both conditions in stable transfected cells expressing antiapoptotic proteins BclxL and catalytically inactive caspase-9, and in both scenarios inactive caspase-9 became complexed with caspase-7.

Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12616) Google Scholar). Accordingly, disorders of apoptosis contribute to a number of disease states. Degenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and AIDS, occur in the setting of excess apoptosis, whereas hyperplastic diseases, including cancer, often occur when apoptosis is attenuated (2.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar). Specifically, inhibition of apoptosis rather than enhanced cellular proliferation is the more critical pathophysiological insult that contributes to the development of prostatic adenocarcinoma (CaP)1 (3.Huang A.

Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 69: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). CaP is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in American men and is the second most common cause of death due to cancer, with estimates that 37,000 men died from CaP in 1999 (5.Landis S.H. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1999; 49: 8-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Successful CaP therapies have been shown to induce tumor regression via apoptosis; however, therapy-resistant cells fail to die in response to treatment (6.Denmeade S.R. Isaacs J.T. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 35: 281-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to characterize the residual functional apoptotic pathways in therapy-resistant CaP cells. Perturbation of calcium ion (Ca2+) homeostasis is a common occurrence in CaP cells induced to undergo apoptosis by a variety of agents, including chemotherapeutics (7.Marin M.C. Fernandez A. Bick R.J. Brisbay S. Buja L.M. Snuggs M. McConkey D.J. von Eschenbach A.C. Keating M.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2259-2266PubMed Google Scholar) and androgen ablation (8.Kyprianou N. English H.F. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1988; 13: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,9.Colombel M.C. Buttyan R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 369-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the influx of Ca2+ across the cell membrane results in a dramatic increase in cytosolic [Ca2+], this influx is often invoked by a less readily detectable cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation as a consequence of organellar Ca2+ store release (10.Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). For example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as an intracellular Ca2+ store that is released into the cytosol in response to a variety of stimuli, including binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to its cognate ER-localized receptor (IP3R) (11.Berridge M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The release of ER Ca2+ stores in turn induces a Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, also known as the Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) (12.Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312(Pt 1): 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Thus, the release of ER Ca2+ stores serves to trigger a larger perturbation in cytosolic [Ca2+]. Studies with an IP3R-deficient Jurkat T-lymphocyte cell line underscore the importance of ER Ca2+ stores in cellular signaling. In contrast to the parental cell line, these cells are defective in antigen-specific T-cell signaling and are resistant to multiple inducers of apoptosis, including Fas ligand, CD3 antibody, glucocorticoids, and irradiation (13.Marks A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272(2 Pt 2): H597-H605Google Scholar). These results are of interest because Jurkat cells have been used to study the role of caspases in apoptosis. Caspases are aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that constitute the effector arm of cell death (14.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar). Upon receipt of an apoptotic stimulus, large pro-domain initiator caspases (such as caspase-8 and -9) are activated by autoproteolysis, which converts the single polypeptide zymogen to form the active dimeric protease. Caspase-8 is activated when it is recruited by the adapter molecule FADD (Fas/APO-1-associated death domain protein) to death receptors upon extracellular ligand binding (15.Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 16.Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 is activated when cells are subjected to intracellular insults that result in the release of cytochrome c from damaged mitochondria. In the presence of cytochrome c the ATPase adapter molecule Apaf-1 binds to and activates caspase-9 in a reaction requiring ATP or dATP hydrolysis (17.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 18.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases amplify the death signal by proteolytically processing and activating downstream small pro-domain effector caspases (such as caspase-3 and -7). Activated effector caspases subsequently cleave a variety of apoptotic substrates, resulting in the biochemical and morphological changes that characterize apoptosis (19.Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Because IP3R-deficient Jurkat cells are incapable of mobilizing Ca2+ stores and are resistant to apoptosis, the question has arisen as to whether release of ER Ca2+ is by itself sufficient to induce apoptosis. To address this we chose to study thapsigargin (TG)-induced [Ca2+] perturbations in the human CaP cell line LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive CaP cell line derived from a lymph node metastasis (20.Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Chu T.M. Wajsman Z.L. Friedman M. Papsidero L. Kim U. Chai L.S. Kakati S. Arya S.K. Sandberg A.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1980; 37: 115-132PubMed Google Scholar). TG is the most potent and specific irreversible inhibitor of ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps localized in the ER (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps) (21.Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). As a consequence of SERCA pump inhibition, ER Ca2+ stores are rapidly released into the cytosol via ER Ca2+ leak channels, thereby activating an ICRAC-mediated sustained elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] (22.Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effects of ER Ca2+ store release independent of ICRAC-mediated cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation, we developed a technique to hold cytosolic [Ca2+] constant after TG-mediated ER store release. This release of ER [Ca2+] was found to be sufficient to induce apoptosis of LNCaP cells. To determine whether the apoptotic pathway elicited by ER Ca2+ store release differed from that elicited by the dual perturbations of cytosolic [Ca2+] increase and ER Ca2+ store release, we compared the caspase activation profiles evoked by each stimulus as well as the effects of antiapoptotic proteins. LNCaP human prostatic carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine. For dose-response studies, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in duplicate 6-well plates. Indicated concentrations of the drugs were achieved by adding 1000× stock solutions dissolved in Me2SO. Untreated cell culture medium and medium with 0.1% Me2SO were used as controls. Cells were trypsinized and counted at the appropriate time point using trypan blue dye exclusion to mark viable cells. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1%l-glutamine. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation as a consequence of TG treatment was evaluated using a modification of the original method (23.Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 109: 78-87PubMed Google Scholar). LNCaP cells treated with 10 nm PMA served as the positive control for inducing internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (24.Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P.E. Humphrey P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar). LNCaP cells cultured in 0.1% Me2SO and untreated cells served as the negative control. In brief, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in duplicate 100-mm plates, treated as indicated, and collected at the appropriate time point. Cells were lysed (10 volumes of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.6) and centrifuged (12,400 × g, 45 min) to remove insoluble DNA. The supernatant containing soluble DNA was precipitated (1 volume of 0.13 m NaCl in 70% ethanol) and recovered by vacuum centrifugation. The DNA was then dissolved (50 μL of 10 mm Tris buffer with 1 mm EDTA and 1% SDS, pH 7.4), extracted (4 × 50 μL, 24:1 chloroform/isoamyl alcohol) and resolved by electrophoresis on an agarose gel (1.8% for 4 h at 75 V). Fragment size was calibrated using a 1 Kb ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were seeded onto 12-well plates, treated as indicated, and fixed with Karnovsky's fixative followed by postfixation in osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m Sorensen's buffer. After fixation, cells were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and embedded in epoxy resin. Sections were cut en fasse and stained with both uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Electron micrographs were photographed using a Phillips EM-400 electron microscope. 60-mm dishes were plated with 1 × 106 cells, treated as indicated, and harvested at the appropriate time point. Floating cells were combined with trypsinized adherent cells and were fixed and analyzed in the Genentech Cytometry Laboratory following standard techniques (25.Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). For analysis of LNCaP cells transfected with antiapoptotic proteins, multiple time points for each condition were assessed and results reported are for those time points that gave the most significant results. This occurred at 24 h of TG treatment for cells in control [Ca2+] conditions and at 18 h of TG treatment for cells under the [Ca2+] clamp conditions. The [Ca2+] of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and supplemented RPMI 1640 cell culture medium was measured using a Ca2+ electrode (Ionetics, Costa Mesa, CA). A standard line was plotted on semi-log paper in order to correlate [Ca2+] with voltage using a series of Ca2+buffer standards ranging from 10−1 to 10−8m Ca2+ (CALBUF-1, World Precision Instruments, Saratosa, FL). Prior to each measurement, the electrode was calibrated in two buffer standards with [Ca2+] above and below the [Ca2+] of the measured solution, followed by a linearity check in a third standard. The pH of all solutions was simultaneously measured and set to 7.30–7.45. The solutions were then filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and stored at 4 °C. For intracellular [Ca2+] analysis of using Indo-1, cells were plated to 60% confluence on 4-well chamber slides (Nunc, Napierville, IL). The cells were prepared and analyzed in the Genentech Cytometry Laboratory following established protocols using a heated slide chamber attachment (26.Kao J.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Measurements with Fura-2 were achieved following a modified protocol of Grynkiewicz et al. (27.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 106 cells were plated onto 9 × 22-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 35-mm plates and washed with 2 ml of HBSS (Life Technologies, Inc.). HBSS was warmed to 37 °C for preparation of all solutions and washes. A Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (AM) stock (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was prepared in 20% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) in anhydrous Me2SO and was dissolved in HBSS for a final concentration of 3 μm Fura-2/AM. Cells were loaded (30 min, 37 °C) in 2.75 ml of this solution and washed (2 × 2 ml of HBSS). Fluorescence ratios (340/380-nm excitation) were measured using a spectrophotometer supplied with a xenon lamp (model F-2000, Hitachi, San Jose, CA) with a 510-nm emission recording in an unheated chamber with a stir bar. Calcium concentrations were determined by using a calcium calibration buffer kit (no. 2, Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. When cells were loaded with BAPTA/AM, 1000× to 5000× BAPTA/AM stock solutions were prepared in anhydrous Me2SO and dissolved in HBSS, and the cells were incubated (30 min at 37 °C) and washed in 2 ml of HBSS prior to Fura-2/AM or Indo-1/AM loading. All [Ca2+] measurements were performed in HBSS having [Ca2+] matched to the cell culture medium [Ca2+], because [Ca2+] measurements in the culture medium, even without phenol red, produced lower signals (data not shown). The expression construct encoding FLAG-tagged dominant negative caspase-9 (caspase-9 DN-FLAG) has been previously described (28.Duan H. Orth K. Chinnaiyan A. Poirier G. Froelich C.J. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16720-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Full length BclxL was cloned in-frame into the pcDNA3.1(−) myc-his vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Stable LNCaP cell lines were generated using CaPO4 precipitation-mediated transfection. Following transfection, cells were cultured in supplemented RPMI 1640 culture medium with 360 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For caspase analysis, monoclonal antibodies against the active subunits of caspase-3, -7, and -9 were generated at the Genentech (GNE) Hybridoma Facility. For positive controls, four flasks, each containing 30 ml of 90% confluent Jurkat cells, were treated for 2 h with 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and four equivalent flasks of untreated Jurkat cells were used as negative controls. Flasks of treated or untreated Jurkat cells were pooled and lysed in 3.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice for 30 min followed by three freeze-thaw cycles. For each experimental time point, five 15-cm plates of 70–80% confluent wild-type LNCaP cells were treated as indicated, harvested at the appropriate time point, pooled, and lysed as described for Jurkat cells. For Western blot analysis of caspase-3, 60 μl of each lysate was centrifuged (15,300 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) and 5× sample buffer containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol was added to the supernatant. After boiling, 35 μl of each sample was resolved on 4–20% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated in a mixture of anti-caspase-3 antibodies for immunoblotting (5 μg/ml GNE clone 2358 and 0.3 μg/ml clone E-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Caspase-7 and -9 were detected by a sequential immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting protocol. For immunoprecipitation 785 μl of cell lysate was centrifuged (as above), the supernatant was divided into two tubes, lysis buffer was added to a final volume of 1.0 ml per tube, and 10 μg/ml appropriate antibody (caspase-7 GNE clone 2347 or caspase-9 GNE clone 2352) was added. Samples were rotated for a minimum of 2 h at 4 °C, 15 μl of protein A+G beads (Calbiochem) was added, and samples were rotated for an additional 2 h. The beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer to elute bound proteins, and the divided samples were recombined and resolved on 4–20% (caspase 7) or 10–20% (caspase-9) acrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitated caspase-7 was detected by immunoblotting using 1 μg/ml anti-caspase-7 antibody (GNE clone 2347) and caspase-9 using a monoclonal antibody mixture (gift from Yuri Lazebnik, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY plus 4 μg/ml PharMingen clone B40). For expression analysis of transfected cell lines, standard Western blot protocols were followed as above using 40 μg of cellular lysates and a monoclonal antibody to BclxL (2 μg/ml, Pharmingen), the anti-caspase-9 antibody mixture described above, or a polyclonal antibody to neomycin phosphotransferase II for control pcDNA3-transfected cells (15 μg/ml, 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Positive controls included BclxLΔTM or caspase-9 recombinant protein and lysate from a caspase-9 DN stable transfected LNCaP cell for neomycin phosphotransferase II analysis. Wild-type LNCaP cell lysate served as the negative control in all cases. To determine the optimal TG concentration for inducing LNCaP cell death, lethality curves as functions of both dose and time were established (Fig.1 A). Most cell death occurred between 24 and 48 h using 100 nm TG. Based on these results and on phase-contrast microscopic evaluation of cellular morphology, treatment with 100 nm TG was chosen as the standard concentration for inducing LNCaP cell death. This is consistent with the concentration needed for complete SERCA pump blockade (29.Thomas D. Hanley M.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We used the structurally unrelated SERCA pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) to confirm that SERCA pump blockade was indeed the mechanism responsible for TG-induced LNCaP cell death. At 100 μm, a concentration also consistent with complete SERCA pump blockade (29.Thomas D. Hanley M.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), CPA induced LNCaP cell death following a similar time course as TG-induced lethality (data not shown). Because the only similarity shared between TG and CPA is the ability to inhibit SERCA pumps (29.Thomas D. Hanley M.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we concluded that the [Ca2+] perturbation induced by SERCA pump inhibition was likely responsible for inducing apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Because cell death can occur via apoptosis or necrosis, it was important to determine which mechanism was deployed in TG-treated LNCaP cells. Apoptosis is characterized by a number of morphological and biochemical events that distinguish it from necrosis. Whether a cell undergoes apoptotic or necrotic demise is cell type- and stimulus-specific (30.Wertz I.E. Hanley M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TG-induced cell death was therefore assessed by several measures. These included: 1) electron microscopic analysis, which revealed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including nuclear fragmentation and plasma membrane blebbing (Fig.1 B); 2) internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, the biochemical hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 1 C); and 3) flow cytometric analysis of DNA, demonstrating the progressive accumulation of hypodiploid DNA (Fig. 1 D). Together, these observations confirmed that TG treatment of LNCaP cells induced apoptosis. TG irreversibly inhibits the SERCA-type Ca2+ pumps, which lead to two distinct intracellular [Ca2+] perturbations: release of ER Ca2+stores and a sustained increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] via ICRAC (22.Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ indicator dyes Indo-1 and Fura-2 were used to characterize these TG-induced intracellular [Ca2+] fluctuations. Indo-1 was used to measure and compare the intracellular [Ca2+] of individual cells, and Fura-2 was used to measure the intracellular [Ca2+] of cell populations. Both Ca2+ dyes shared similar profiles, and Indo-1 analysis revealed that intercellular variation in cytosolic [Ca2+] was minimal (data not shown). Following exposure to 100 nm TG, a sustained plateau in cytosolic [Ca2+] was induced in LNCaP cells (Fig.2 A). To determine the relative contribution of each TG-induced [Ca2+] perturbation to the induction of LNCaP apoptosis, conditions were established to permit the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores while maintaining a constant (“clamped”) cytosolic [Ca2+]. We reasoned that, if the [Ca2+] clamp conditions protected LNCaP cells from TG-induced apoptosis, this would suggest that elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] rather than release of intracellular Ca2+ stores was critical for the induction of apoptosis. However, if apoptosis nevertheless proceeded under these conditions, then release of intracellular Ca2+ stores was likely a critical factor. We first attempted to clamp cytosolic [Ca2+] using the fast-acting Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. When LNCaP cells were loaded in 5–30 μm extracellular BAPTA, the TG-induced rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] was only transiently attenuated (Fig. 2 B). This was consistent with previous reports that the buffering capacity of BAPTA is overwhelmed with time (31.Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Extracellular BAPTA concentrations greater than 30 μmwere unsatisfactory because they induced LNCaP cell death (data not shown). Because it was also noted that the transient buffering capacity of BAPTA diminished after 6–8 h, possibly due to intracellular compartmentalization, export, or hydrolysis (26.Kao J.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) (data not shown), we decided to replenish BAPTA every 6 h, which maintained an effective cytosolic BAPTA concentration (Fig. 2). Because BAPTA loading alone was ineffective in preventing TG-induced elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+], we decided to reduce ICRAC-mediated Ca2+ influx using econazole and NiCl2, reagents that block depletion-activated Ca2+ channels (32.Thomas D. Kim H.Y. Hanley M.R. Vitam. Horm. 1998; 54: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Econazole and NiCl2 were unsatisfactory, because concentrations inhibiting TG-induced Ca2+ influx were lethal over 12–24 h (50 μmand 5 mm, respectively) and lower concentrations were ineffective (data not shown). However, these studies indicated that Ca2+ store release-activated Ca2+ channels are present and functional on LNCaP cell membranes (33.Skryma R.N. Prevarskaya N.B. Dufy-Barbe L. Odessa M.F. Audin J.

Because econazole and NiCl2 were unsatisfactory for attenuating TG-induced Ca2+ influx, EGTA was added to the extracellular medium to reduce the [Ca2+] gradient across the plasma membrane. To determine if LNCaP cells could be grown in reduced extracellular [Ca2+], cells were cultured in medium having [Ca2+] ranging from 6 to 165 μm, and viability was assessed after 60 h. The TG-induced ICRAC was negligible in extracellular [Ca2+] up to 120 μm (Fig. 2 C), and decreased viability was detected in medium having 80 μm [Ca2+] or less (data not shown). Thus, the range of extracellular [Ca2+] that permitted cell viability without contributing to a TG-induced cytosolic [Ca2+] increase was 90–120 μm. However, as expected, the approximately 0.1-μm increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] resulting from intracellular store release was not attenuated by extracellular EGTA (Fig. 2 C). Given this, we decided to use a combination of extracellular EGTA and intracellular BAPTA to maintain a complete cytosolic [Ca2+] clamp. Culturing cells in RPMI with 110 μm Ca2+ and 7 μm extracellular BAPTA/AM were therefore determined to be the optimal parameters for clamping cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 2 D). Because high concentrations of Ca2+ chelators have been shown to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores (34.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), it was important to determine whether the [Ca2+] clamp conditions led to Ca2+ store release. This was accomplished by exploiting the properties of reagents that specifically block depletion-activated Ca2+ channels to result in ICRAC such as econazole and NiCl2 (32.Thomas D. Kim H.Y. Hanley M.R. Vitam. Horm. 1998; 54: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Following treatment with 5 mm NiCl2, the TG-induced elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] due to ICRAC is diminished (Fig.3 A). Therefore, we reasoned that the attenuation of ICRAC-mediated Ca2+influx with NiCl2 can be used to detect the presence of intracellular Ca2+ stores, because by definition ICRAC only occurs after intracellular Ca2+stores have been released. When cells were cultured under the [Ca2+] clamp conditions for 24 h and treated with TG, as expected no fluctuation in cytosolic [Ca2+] occurred, although the depletion-activated Ca2+ channels likely opened in response to TG-induced Ca2+ store release. However, when extracellular Ca2+ was added, the cytosolic [Ca2+] rapidly increased presumably via Ca2+influx through the already opened depletion-activated Ca2+channels, which overwhelmed the chelating ability of the cytosolic BAPTA (as in Fig. 2 D). That the Ca2+ influx occurred via depletion-activated Ca2+ channels was confirmed by Ca2+ influx attenuation with NiCl2. As an additional control, cells were cultured under the clamp conditions for 24 h, and extracellular Ca2+was added prior to adding TG (Fig. 3 C). Before TG addition, no elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] was detected even though the [Ca2+] gradient was increased. This was likely because the Ca2+ channels on the cell membrane were closed, which would not be the case if the [Ca2+] clamp conditions had even partially led to Ca2+ store release. Thus, culturing cells under the [Ca2+] clamp conditions did not deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores. For the above experiments, similar results were obtained using"

These conditions are characterized by progressive accumulation of protein deposits of different ultrastructure. Herein, we studied the corneas with mutations at kerato-epithelin residue Arg-124 resulting in amyloid (R124C), non-amyloid (R124L), and a mixed pattern of deposition (R124H). We found that aggregated kerato-epithelin comprised all types of pathological deposits. Each mutation was associated with characteristic changes of protein turnover in corneal tissue. Amyloidogenesis in R124C corneas was accompanied by the accumulation of N-terminal kerato-epithelin fragments, whereby species of 44 kDa were the major constituents of amyloid fibrils. R124H corneas with prevailing non-amyloid inclusions showed accumulation of a new 66-kDa species altogether with the full-size 68-kDa form. Finally, in R124L cornea with non amyloid deposits, we found only the accumulation of the 68-kDa form. Two-dimensional gels revealed mutation-specific changes in the processing of the full-size protein in all affected corneas. It appears that substitutions at the same residue (Arg-124) result in cornea-specific deposition of kerato-epithelin via distinct aggregation pathways each involving altered turnover of the protein in corneal tissue.

The pathological inclusions display two different types of ultrastructure: amyloid fibrils in lattice type I dystrophy (CDLI) and non-amyloid amorphous aggregates in Groenouw type I (CDGGI) and Reis-Bücklers (CDRB). The fourth, Avellino corneal dystrophy (CDA), is a mixed form, which is characterized by amyloid and non-amyloid lesions in the same cornea. Mutations in theBIGH3 gene encoding for kerato-epithelin (KE)1 were found to be responsible for this entire group of conditions (1.Munier F.L. Korvatska E. Djemai A. Le Paslier D. Zografos L. Pescia G. Schorderet D.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). BIGH3is expressed in many tissues, including cornea, and is up-regulated by trnasforming growth factor-β (2.Skonier J. Neubauer M. Madisen L. Bennett K. Plowman G.D. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The function of KE is not yet understood, although it is thought to be an extracellular matrix protein mediating cell adhesion (3.Skonier J. Bennett K. Rothwell V. Kosowski S. Plowman G. Wallace P. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Neubauer M. Marquardt H. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Population analysis revealed two hot spots of mutations in KE, Arg-124 and Arg-555 (4.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Djemai A. Wang M.X. Frueh B. Chiou A.G. Uffer S. Ballestrazzi E. Braunstein R.E. Forster R.K. Culbertson W.W. Boman H. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 320-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). There is a strong correlation between each particular mutation and the affected phenotype. Changes of Arg-555, R555W and R555Q, result in the conditions of non-amyloid nature, CDGGI and CDRB, respectively. Changes of Arg-124 result in a more complex pattern of deposition: R124C causes CDLI, a localized amyloidosis; R124H causes a mixed form, CDA. The most recently described mutation, R124L, results in non-amyloid deposition (5.Mashima Y. Nakamura Y. Noda K. Konishi M. Yamada M. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1999; 117: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, by using immunohistology we demonstrated that KE is specifically co-localized with pathologic inclusions in all analyzed forms of the disease (6.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Chaubert P. Wang M.X. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Uffer S. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2213-2219PubMed Google Scholar). This supports the idea that the mutated protein aggregates in pathologic deposits (similarly to other deposition diseases). However, the immunohistology does not allow us to conclude whether KE is a major component of the deposits. In addition, using antibodies against two nonoverlapping parts of the protein we observed different staining patterns of amyloid (R124C) and non-amyloid (R555W) deposits. To get more insight into the mechanism of amyloid and non-amyloid conversion of KE we analyzed pathological corneas with different mutations at the single site Arg-124. Corneal buttons were obtained after keratoplasty of seven patients with different forms of 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies. Two control corneas were obtained from the corneal bank of Jules Gonin Hospital. Each cornea was divided into two parts: one was used for histology, and the other was reserved for protein analysis. The later ones were immersed in tissue-freezing medium (Jung, Germany) and stored at −80 °C before the assays. Three patients (P1–P3) were unrelated heterozygous with R124C mutation of the BIGH3 gene (6.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Chaubert P. Wang M.X. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Uffer S. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2213-2219PubMed Google Scholar); P4–P6 were heterozygous individuals with the R124H mutation (cases 2, 5, and 6, respectively (7.Konishi M. Mashima Y. Nakamura Y. Yamada M. Sugiura H. Cornea. 1997; 16: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)); and P7 was a heterozygous patient with the R124L mutation (5.Mashima Y. Nakamura Y. Noda K. Konishi M. Yamada M. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1999; 117: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). None of these patients had systemic diseases known to be associated with amyloidosis. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically in all cases. The presence of amyloid deposits was tested by Congo Red staining under polarized light. Mutations inBIGH3 were determined by direct sequencing of exon 4 (4.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Djemai A. Wang M.X. Frueh B. Chiou A.G. Uffer S. Ballestrazzi E. Braunstein R.E. Forster R.K. Culbertson W.W. Boman H. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 320-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Two rabbit polyclonal antisera against human KE (Swiss-Prot Q15582) were described previously (6.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Chaubert P. Wang M.X. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Uffer S. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2213-2219PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum anti-KE 69–364 was directed to KE sequence from 69 to 364 amino acids; antiserum anti-KE 426–682 was directed to KE residues from 426 to 682. The tissues were ground in liquid N2 and then homogenized with a Teflon potter in 8 m urea; 10% v/v glycerol, 2% w/v SDS; 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g, and the pellets were discarded. Protein content of the supernatants were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce). To eliminate the interference of 2-mercaptoethanol with the BCA assay, proteins were first precipitated in 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 0.0125% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 1 m urea. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the pellets were washed twice in ice-cold acetone, dried, and dissolved in 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1m NaOH. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 100 × 70 × 1 mm gels containing 10% (w/v) acrylamide and piperazine diacrylamine as a cross-linker (Bio-Rad). High resolution two-dimensional PAGE was prepared according to the method described by Henry et al. (8.Henry H. Tissot J.D. Messerli B. Markert M. Muntau A. Skladal D. Sperl W. Jaeken J. Weidinger S.

Dionisi-Vici C. Gonvers J.J. Bachmann C. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Molecular weights and isoelectric points were calculated using two-dimensional PAGE standards as reference (Bio-Rad). Silver staining was done as described (10.Bjellqvist B. Basse B. Olsen E. Celis J.E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional PAGE to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) by semi-dry electroblotting according to Laurière (11.Lauriere M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The anti-KE 69–364 and anti-KE 426–682 antibodies were diluted 5000- and 10,000-fold, respectively, in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20) followed by alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) diluted 4000-fold in blocking buffer. The immunodetected KE species were visualized by use of nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad). The blots were scanned with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) and processed by image analysis (ImageQuant v3.3 software, Molecular Dynamics) for band quantification. Polypeptides of interest were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Theoretical molecular mass and isoelectric point were calculated by use of the online software Compute Pi/Mw (http://www.expasy.ch/). To characterize the KE content in normal tissue, corneal protein extracts were subjected to one- and two-dimensional gels followed by Western blotting or silver staining. One-dimensional PAGE following immunostaining with both anti-KE 69–364 and anti-KE 426–682 antibodies revealed a major band migrating at 68 kDa, which corresponds to full-size secreted protein (Fig. 1, A and B). Apart from this major form, we observed several minor species that showed differential staining by the antibodies. Anti-KE 426–682 recognized fragments of 64, 57, 47, and 29 kDa. In contrast, anti-KE 69–364 stained much more weakly 64-, 57-, and 47-kDa bands and did not detect the 29-kDa fragment. This differential staining suggests that all the observed minor KE species were N-terminal deletions. Fig. 1 demonstrates that all of the KE species seen on the one-dimensional gel are resolved on a two-dimensional gel as a series of spots with different pI migrating at the same molecular weight. They may represent different posttranslational modifications of KE. The major 68-kDa KE fraction constituted 8 spots with a pI range within 6.3–6.8. The minor KE species were resolved as follows: the 64-kDa fragment was formed by 8 spots within pI 5.3–5.8; the 57-kDa fragment was formed by 7 spots within pI 5.6–6.3; the 47-kDa fragment was formed by 4 spots within pI 5.4–5.9, and the 29-kDa fragment was formed by 5 spots within pI 6.6–6.9. N-terminal sequencing of the 68-kDa fraction yielded the expected processed KE starting at position 24 of the protein sequence. Sequencing of the 64- and 47-kDa species confirmed these fragments had N-terminal deletions and start at positions 105 and 273, respectively. Sequencing data revealed no heterogeneity of the N termini. Although the 57- and 29-kDa species were not sequenced, their pI and molecular weights suggest N termini starting near residues 160 and 420, respectively. These sequencing data, together with immunostaining, demonstrate that species resulting from normal KE turnover in the cornea are C-terminal fragments of the protein (Fig. 1 C). Prior immunohistology of corneal sections revealed unusual accumulation of KE, which was co-localized with the pathological deposits in all R124C corneas used in this study (6.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Chaubert P. Wang M.X. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Uffer S. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2213-2219PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of corneal material from three patients heterozygous for R124C detected a 3-fold increase of KE content compared with normal cornea. Staining with both antibodies, however, showed that the amount of full-size protein (68-kDa band) did not significantly differ from the control. Instead, we observed massive accumulation of unusual KE fragments reacting exclusively with anti-KE 69–364 (Fig. 2 A). The 44-kDa fragment was the major species (as much as double the amount compared with 68-kDa KE in normal cornea, see histogram 2C). We also observed several minor fragments migrating at 39, 26, and 17 kDa of which the 26-kDa band was the most abundant. All of these fragments were consistently missing from normal corneas. At the same time, in R124C corneas we observed all of the fragments characteristic for KE proteolysis in normal cornea (Fig. 2 B). The only difference was a significant, 6-fold reduction in the amount of the 64-kDa fragment seen with anti-KE 426–682. Analysis of cultured primary skin fibroblasts established from patients with R124C mutation revealed no production of the disease-specific KE fragments found in affected corneas (data not shown). This suggests that other, tissue-specific, factors may be involved in the pathogenesis. Two-dimensional gels of R124C corneal proteins revealed drastic changes in the pattern of pI isomers forming the major 68-kDa KE fragment (Fig.3). This fraction was resolved as a train of 10 spots (compared with 8 spots in normal corneas) within pI range 5.8–6.8 (compared with pI 6.3–6.8 in controls). Although the substitution of arginine to cysteine may have explained this shift, we detected no changes in the pattern of pI isomers or number of spots for KE fragments of 64, 57, 47, and 29 kDa. Because the 64-kDa fraction still contains Arg-124 it is rather unlikely that R124C per se affects the electrophoretic behavior of the 68-kDa KE. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the 64-kDa species in the R124C cornea consist exclusively of the nonmutated KE allele. N-terminal sequencing of 3 spots from the 68-kDa fraction migrating within pI 5.8–6.2 and absent in normal cornea showed the N terminus at residue 26 (in contrast to 24 in the control). Interestingly, sequencing of the 44-kDa fragment also showed it to start at residue 26. In both cases sequencing revealed uniformity of the N termini. In addition, the 44-kDa fraction appears to be heterogeneous by molecular weight: the species are resolved as two closely migrating trains of 10 isoforms each (Fig. 3). The similar heterogeneity was observed for 26-kDa KE fraction consisting of 4 upper and 6 lower spots. Sequencing of the 26-kDa species yielded an amino terminus at residue 163. The C termini for both the 44- and 26-kDa fragments were calculated to be within the region surrounding residue 420 (Fig. 2 D). It appears that the 26-kDa species are the products of further proteolysis of 44-kDa fragment. The other two species of 39 and 17 kDa characteristic for R124C cornea are likely to originate from the N-terminal region of the protein, according to their exclusive staining with anti-KE 69–364. Prior histological analysis revealed a predominantly non-amyloid type of deposition in all R124H corneas used in our study (12.Konishi M. Yamada M. Nakamura Y. Mashima Y. Cornea. 1999; 18: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The proportion between non-amyloid and amyloid deposits was roughly estimated as 10:1 by Congo Red staining of corneal sections. Immunohistology of R124H corneas showed specific, positive staining of non-amyloid deposits with both anti-KE antibodies (data not shown). Western blot analysis of R124H corneal extracts showed a characteristic pattern of KE species that was different from normal and R124C corneas (Fig.4, A and B). We observed an accumulation of a 68-kDa fragment, which was about 2 times higher than in normal cornea (Fig. 4 C). In addition, a new 66-kDa fragment accumulated in amounts comparable to those of 68-kDa KE in normal cornea. This species was consistently missing from all other studied pathological samples, as well as from normal controls. Although the 66-kDa KE reacted with both anti-KE 69–364 and anti-KE 426–682 its reactivity compared with the 68-kDa KE was somewhat lower with anti-KE 426–682. This suggests that 66-kDa fragment may lack part of its epitopes from the C terminus. Two-dimensional gels of R124H corneas detected profound changes in the 68-kDa KE (Fig. 3). In contrast to the R124C cornea, this fraction appeared to be heterogeneous not only by charge, but also by molecular weight. It was resolved as two trains with close molecular weights each consisting of 12 isoforms within pI range 5.7–6.7 (compare with pI 6.3–6.8 in control). Interestingly, the 66-kDa species also migrated as two trains of 8–10 spots with close molecular masses. The distribution of other KE species, including a 64-kDa fraction still containing 124 residues, did not differ from normal cornea. Immunohistology of this cornea showed strong positive staining of non-amyloid deposits with both anti-KE antibodies (data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed an ∼2.5-fold excess of 68-kDa KE compared with normal cornea, whereas the pattern of other KE species did not significantly differ from normal control (Fig. 5). The 68-kDa fraction was resolved on two-dimensional gel as two trains of pI isomers with close molecular weight (Fig. 3). The upper train (8 spots within pI range 6.3–6.8) was similar to 68-kDa isomers seen in normal cornea. The lower train was formed by 10 (or 12) spots with a characteristic shift in charge toward both directions (pI 6.1- 7.0), although the predicted effect of R124L would be only a loss of charge. 5q31-Linked corneal dystrophies are hereditary deposition diseases of amyloid and non-amyloid nature resulting from different mutations in KE. It is a protein of unknown function, which is secreted at a substantial level in the extracellular milieu of many tissues, including the cornea. Analysis of protein content shows that KE is one of the major corneal proteins. Apart from the major 68-kDa band corresponding to full-size protein, which starts from residue 24, we also observed a set of proteolysis products characteristic for KE turnover in normal cornea. All these minor species were assigned as KE fragments with truncated N termini. Immunohistology of corneal sections showed diffuse distribution of the protein throughout the stroma with an increase in the subepithelial zone, but did not reveal any massive accumulation of KE in normal tissue (13.Streeten B.W. Qi Y. Klintworth G.K. Eagle Jr., R.C. Strauss J.A. Bennett K. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1999; 117: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The abundance and uniform distribution of KE in the stroma, as well as its physical interaction with some collagens (14.Hashimoto K. Noshiro M. Ohno S. Kawamoto T. Satakeda H. Akagawa Y. Nakashima K. Okimura A. Ishida H. Okamoto T. Pan H. Shen M. Yan W. Kato Y. Biochim, Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) infer the role of KE as a structural element of the corneal matrix. We and others showed that both corneal epithelium and stromal fibroblasts express KE (6.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Chaubert P. Wang M.X. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Uffer S. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2213-2219PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Escribano J. Hernando N. Ghosh S. Crabb J. Coca Prados M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because KE is present in blood serum, it is possible that part of the KE pool be originated also from extracorneal source. Recently, we showed specific co-localization of KE with all types of pathologic deposits in corneas with different forms of dystrophy (6.Korvatska E. Munier F.L. Chaubert P. Wang M.X. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Uffer S. Zografos L. Schorderet D.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2213-2219PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed corneas with three different mutations of Arg-124 by immunohistological and biochemical approaches. All affected corneas demonstrated positive staining of the deposits with anti-KE antibodies. Western blot analysis of the unfixed parts of corneas revealed a significant, severalfold increase in the amount of KE compared with normal control. These data allow us to conclude that KE itself aggregates into amyloid deposits in R124C and non-amyloid deposits in R124H and R124L corneas. At the same time, we observed different staining patterns of amyloid (R124C) and non-amyloid (R124H and R124L) deposits with antibodies against two nonoverlapping parts of KE. Although non-amyloid, amorphous inclusions reacted with both antibodies, amyloid inclusions in R124C corneas did not react with antiserum to the amino-terminal part. To our surprise, we detected massive accumulation of unusual N-terminal fragments of 44 and 26 kDa in R124C corneas. The drastic changes of the protein structure when undergoing amyloid conversion could explain the absence of staining of amyloid deposits with antibodies specific to the N-terminal part of KE. Independently of us, the appearance of N-terminal fragments of similar molecular weights in CDLI corneas was observed by Takacs et al. (16.Takacs L. Boross P. Tozser J. Modis Jr., L. Toth G. Berta A. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although the authors made no conclusion about the role of KE in the deposit formation. The massive accumulation of unusual KE fragments and exclusive co-localization of KE having specific immunostaining properties with amyloid inclusions infer that the major 44-kDa fragment found in R124C corneas is the amyloidogenic unit that comprises the amyloid fibril. Thus, amyloidogenesis of KE in R124C corneas is associated with abnormal proteolysis of the protein. This is consistent with other amyloid disorders where protein precursors generally undergo proteolysis during amyloid conversion. Known examples are immunoglobulin, gelsolin, serum amyloid A, cystatine C, and amyloid β precursor protein (17.Benson M.D. Kluve-Beckerman B. Liepnieks J.J. Murrell J.R. Hanes D. Uemichi T. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 199: 104-118PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Sipe J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1994; 31: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Despite almost ubiquitous KE expression in the organism, patients affected with 5q31-linked dystrophy, even homozygous ones, do not manifest any sign of systemic abnormality, suggesting a tissue-specific character of pathologic KE deposition. Because cultured fibroblasts established from R124C patients do not express disease-specific KE fragments, it seems that amyloid conversion occurs at later stages of the protein life cycle and that it is mediated by tissue-specific factors. A critical question is how a given mutation predisposes a protein to misfolding and aggregation. At present, even for the best studied amyloidosis there is no predictable pattern of mutations resulting in amyloid aggregation. However, many amyloid mutations appear to affect the structure of protein precursors by increasing β-sheet content. According to secondary structure predictions (19.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar), R124C, but not R124H and R124L, would introduce additional β-sheet content. In addition, in all analyzed R124C corneas we observed a dramatic, 6-fold decrease of the content of a 64-kDa KE species compared with normal cornea. We propose that R124C abolishes the site of KE proteolysis located near residue 105, which may be required for normal turnover of the protein. We speculate that this event initiates further steps leading to the accumulation of abnormal proteolytic fragments of KE and fibril formation. Our data also show that R124C influences the processing and post-translational modifications of full-size KE. We found that the N terminus of the 68-kDa form starting at residue 24 in normal cornea is changed for residue 26 in the R124C cornea. The same N terminus was found in the amyloidogenic 44-kDa fragment. Our sequencing data were consistent with those reported by other groups (16.Takacs L. Boross P. Tozser J. Modis Jr., L. Toth G. Berta A. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20.Klintworth G.K. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 743-748PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the R124C cornea demonstrates a remarkable shift in charge and increase in the number of species constituting the 68-kDa KE. The charge heterogeneity already present in wild type KE may be attributed to posttranslational modifications. The observed loss of positive charge in the 68-kDa KE found in R124C cornea may be because of the arginine to cysteine substitution, but it can also reflect mutation-specific changes of post-translation modifications of KE. It has been proposed that post-translation modifications of precursor proteins may be implicated in amyloid conversion (18.Sipe J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1994; 31: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Analysis of several R124H corneas showed that the pathologic KE accumulation is also accompanied by abnormal proteolysis of the protein. We observed a new unusual KE fragment migrating at 66 kDa, which was absent in others pathological corneas, as well as in normal controls. This specific 66-kDa KE form could be responsible for the deposit formation in R124H cornea though the involvement of the major 68-kDa form cannot be excluded because of its massive accumulation. The isoforms comprising this band showed the loss of positive charge. However, the observed value of pI shift as well as the number of isoforms were different from R124C cornea. Moreover, unlike in normal and R124C corneas, the species comprising the 68-kDa band manifested a heterogeneity by molecular weight. All this points to the effect of R124H mutation on KE processing and turnover in corneal tissue. All R124H corneas used in our study demonstrated the predominance of a non-amyloid type of deposition. Although clinical form of the disease, CDA, corresponding to this mutation was described as having a mixed type of deposition, it is important to note that granular, non-amyloid inclusions are the earliest manifestation and that amyloid deposition occurs later in the course of the disorder (21.Rosenwasser G.O. Sucheski B.M. Rosa N. Pastena B. Sebastiani A. Sassani J.W. Perry H.D. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1993; 111: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, not all patients with R124H develop a distinct deposition of amyloid (7.Konishi M. Mashima Y. Nakamura Y. Yamada M. Sugiura H. Cornea. 1997; 16: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several reported R124H homozygous patients exhibited exclusively non-amyloid deposition occurring very early in life. These data suggest that the primary pathological impact of R124H is the destabilization of KE that renders it prone to nonordered aggregation. In this respect, amyloid fibril formation can be viewed as a secondary event. The R124L mutation is associated with a severe, early onset form of the disease, which is characterized by a non-amyloid type of deposition (5.Mashima Y. Nakamura Y. Noda K. Konishi M. Yamada M. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1999; 117: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast to R124C and R124H corneas, we observed no accumulation of abnormal fragments. A severalfold increase of the 68-kDa form suggests that full-size protein constitutes non-amyloid inclusions in the R124L cornea. Two-dimensional gel resolution reveals a characteristic pattern of the 68-kDa species different from all other analyzed corneas. We conclude that the R124L mutation affects processing and stability of the major 68-kDa form but does not result in abnormal proteolysis of KE. Replacements of Arg-124 lead to different types of KE aggregation. In each case, misfolding and aggregation of this protein was accompanied with characteristic changes of its processing and metabolism in corneal tissue. It invokes that different therapies may be required for treatment/prevention of each particular form of disease. In view of this unique pleiotropic effect of KE substitutions, 5q31-linked dystrophy represents an attractive model for protein misfolding/aggregation studies.

Sec24p is an essential protein and involved in cargo selection. In addition to Sec24p, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two non-essential Sec24p-related proteins, termed Sfb2p (product of YNL049c) and Sfb3p/Lst1p (product of YHR098c). We here show that Sfb2p and, less efficiently, Sfb3p/Lst1p are able to bind, like Sec24p, the integral membrane cargo protein Sed5p. We also demonstrate that Sfb2p, like Sec24p and Sfb3p/Lst1p, forms a complex with Sec23p in vivo. Whereas the deletion ofSFB2 did not affect transport kinetics of various proteins, the maturation of the glycolipid-anchored plasma membrane protein Gas1p was differentially impaired in sfb3 knock-out cells. We generated several conditional-lethal sec24 mutants that, combined with null alleles of SFB2 andSFB3/LST1, led to a complete block of transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi (sec24–11/Δsfb2) or to cell death (sec24–11/Δsfb3). Of the Sec24p family members, Sfb2p is the least abundant at steady state, but high intracellular concentrations of Sfb2p can rescue sec24 mutants under restrictive conditions.

Association of the Sec23p/Sec24p COPII subcomplex to the vesicle budding site is thought to lead to a concentration of integral membrane cargo proteins (2.Springer S. Spang A. Schekman R. Cell. 1999; 97: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It has been shown by in vitro experiments that the Sec23p/Sec24p complex physically interacts with some vesicle targeting receptors, v-SNAREs (3.Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In another study we could demonstrate that it is the Sec24 protein that directly binds to a t-SNARE, the yeast syntaxin Sed5p (4.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which like its mammalian counterpart syntaxin 5 cycles between an early Golgi compartment and the ER (5.Wooding S.

Science. 1998; 279: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome revealed that this unicellular yeast has, in addition to Sec24p, two related proteins, termed Sfb2p (product of YNL049c) and Sfb3p/Lst1p (product of YHR098c), that share 56% and 23% of sequence identity with Sec24p. Whereas Sec24p is an essential protein (4.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7.Gimeno R.E,. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), recent reports demonstrated that Sfb2p and Sfb3/Lst1p are dispensable for cell viability (8.Pagano A. Letourneur F. Garcia-Estefania D. Carpentier J.L. Orci L. Paccaud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7833-7840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9.Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It was shown in one of these studies that the deletion of SFB3, but not of SFB2, led to a secretion defect of some undefined polypeptides (8.Pagano A. Letourneur F. Garcia-Estefania D. Carpentier J.L. Orci L. Paccaud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7833-7840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Another study disclosed that the knock-out of SFB3 resulted in a selective, but partial inhibition of ER export of the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p (9.Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, both studies suggest that the Sec24p-related protein Sfb3p might play a role as COPII component for specific cargo selection. In line with this, Sfb3p was shown to be able to form, like Sec24p, a complex with Sec23p (9.Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to get further insight into the functional relationship of Sec24p and its relatives, especially of Sfb2p. From the results obtained by a combination of biochemical and molecular genetic studies we come to the conclusion that the two Sec24p-related proteins are functional COPII components. They cannot only interact with Sec23p but also with integral membrane cargo proteins, their loss of function in sec24 mutants results in synthetic defects of ER-to-Golgi transport, and high intracellular concentrations of Sfb2p can rescue sec24 conditional mutants at non-permissive conditions. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. They were constructed by standard methods and grown in standard YPD or minimal medium as described (10.Guthrie C. Fink G.R.

Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The SFB2 gene was isolated by screening a subgenomic plasmid library constructed by complete digestion of yeast genomic DNA with KpnI andSacI and subsequent ligation into pBluescript KS+. TheKpnI-SacI fragment (4.3 kilobase pairs) containing the SFB2 open reading frame and its upstream (838 bp) and downstream (838 bp) regulatory sequences were then subcloned into the CEN-based vector pRS316 and the 2 μ-based vector pRS326 (12.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SFB3/LST1 gene was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR as a 3994-bp DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame (2787 bp) and 736-bp upstream and 471-bp downstream sequences using the primers: 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGATTTTGTTGGTGTTGTTTATT-3′ (containing an XhoI site) and 5′-CGGGATCCTGCAAGATTTACCAGAAGACAGTC-3′ (containing a BamHI site). The PCR product was digested withBamHI and XhoI and inserted into the vector pRS325. Cloning the correct fragment was verified by sequencing. SEC24, SFB2, andSFB3/LST1 gene deletions were performed in the diploid yeast strain (MSUC1A3D) by a PCR-based procedure with the kanamycin resistance gene as marker (13.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). The SFB3/LST1 gene was also disrupted by replacing most of its coding sequence (Eco47III-SnaBI fragment) with theLEU2 gene. The diploid strains heterozygous for either the deletion of SEC24, SFB2, or SFB3/LST1were subjected to sporulation and tetrad dissection. The diploid strain heterozygous for Δsec24 gave two viable spores, while those heterozygous for SFB2 or SFB3/LST1 gene deletions gave four viable spores. The haploid segregants carryingsfb2::KanMX 4,sfb3::KanMX 4, orsfb3::LEU2 were confirmed by PCR analysis and Southern blotting. Temperature-sensitivesec24 alleles were created by in vitromutagenesis with hydroxylamine, followed by plasmid shuffling (14.Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Briefly, a diploid strain heterozygous for the SEC24deletion (RPY5) was transformed with pRS316-SEC24, a CEN-based plasmid bearing the wild type SEC24 gene. After sporulation and tetrad dissection, the haploid segregant (RPY16) with the genomicSEC24 deletion and its viability supported by pRS316-SEC24 was obtained. Then, pRS315-SEC24, another CEN-based plasmid bearing the wild type SEC24 gene, was mutagenesized in vitrowith hydroxylamine as described (10.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). The plasmid pool after mutagenesis was introduced into the yeast strain RPY16. Colonies that received the pRS315-based plasmid were replica-plated onto medium containing 5′-FOA (WAK-Chemie Medical GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany), and the cells that lost the URA3-carrying but maintained theLEU2-bearing plasmid were selected. Finally, the colonies that contained the pRS315-based plasmids and revealed the temperature-sensitive phenotype were selected. Direct linkage between the mutations of the SEC24 gene and the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of the colonies was verified and characterized further. A polyclonal antibody against Gas1p was kindly provided by H. Riezman (Basel, Switzerland). Anti-Sed5p antibodies were produced and purified as described previously (15.Grabowski R. Gallwitz D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-MYC (9E10) and anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Antisera against Sec23p were produced in rabbits with the full-length Sec23p obtained by thrombin cleavage of a purified GST fusion protein produced in yeast. The Sec23p antibodies were affinity-purified on GST-Sec23p (4.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GST-Sly1p was expressed in Esherichia colifrom pGEX-TT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and purified as described (4.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Sly1p were affinity-purified with GST-Sly1p from an antiserum described previously (16.Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (17.Tsukada M. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2471-2481PubMed Google Scholar). Newly synthesized CPY, ALP, or Gas1p precipitated with affinity-purified antibodies were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Cells of different strains were grown in YEPG at 30 °C or 25 °C to mid-log phase and then pelleted, washed and resuspended in YEPG containing 0.1% glucose to induce the synthesis of invertase. In certain cases, the induction was carried out at non-permissive temperatures. After 60 min of induction, 1 OD600 unit of cells was collected, washed in 10 mm NaN3, and processed essentially as described (18.Schmitt H.D. Puzicha M. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1988; 53: 635-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All the yeast t-SNARE proteins fused to GST were constructed and purified and the affinity binding assays were performed as described (4.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with cytosol prepared from the yeast strain expressing both the Sfb2p-HA and the Sfb3p-MYC. Yeast strains were grown as specified in the figure legends. Cells were fixed with potassium permanganate and processed as described previously (19.Yang X. Matern H. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sec23p, Sec24p, Sfb2p, and Sfb3p/Lst1p were C-terminally tagged with six consecutive histidines followed by either two copies of c-MYC epitope (EQKLISEEDL) or three copies of HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) as follows. Two vectors, pU6H2MYC and pU6H3HA (EMBL accession no. AJ132965 and AJ132966, respectively) containing the 6His-2XMYC-loxP-KanMX-loxP cassette or the 6His-3XHA-loxP-KanMX-loxP cassette were constructed. Then, these expression cassettes were amplified using two primers, one (5′-TCC CAC CAC CAT CAT CAT CAC-3′) with 21 nucleotides annealing to the 5′-end of the 6XHis, the other (5′-ACT ATA GGG AGA CCG GCA GAT C-3′) with 22 nucleotides annealing to the 3′-end of the KanMX-loxP sequences. The 5′-primer was flanked by 42–45 nucleotides derived from the gene of interest (excluding the stop codon and in frame with the epitope), and the 3′-primer was flanked by nucleotides derived from the downstream sequence of the 3′-end of the gene of interest, starting from either the stop codon, or 50–100 nucleotides after the stop codon. Five μg of the PCR product were used to transform the protease-deficient yeast strain Cl3-ABY-86, and the positive colonies were selected on plates with 200 mg/liter Geneticin. The expression of tagged proteins was verified by immunoblotting using anti-MYC or anti-HA antibodies. Strains expressing both the HA- and MYC-tagged proteins were created as follows: first, the strains ADY1 and ADY2 containing the loxP-kanMX-loxPcassette and expressing Sfb2p-MYC and Sfb3p-MYC, respectively, was subjected to excision of KanR from the genome in the presence of CRE recombinase (20.Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), then the second gene was tagged with the HA epitope as above, creating the strains ADY5 and ADY6. The strains expressing the MYC-tagged Sfb2p, Sfb3p/Lst1p, Sec23p or Sec24p (ADY1, ADY2, ADY3, and ADY4, respectively), were grown in rich media with 200 mg/liter Geneticin to mid-log phase (1.0 OD600 unit/ml). Total protein extract was obtained with two different methods. (I) 2 ml of cells were centrifuged, washed with cold water, and lysed with 180 μl of 2m NaOH, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min on ice, and then precipitated by adding 20 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed with 1 m Tris and suspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). (II) 5 ml of cells were centrifuged, washed with cold water, resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm KOAc, 1 mm MgOAc, 0.9% CHAPS, 2 mm Pefabloc) and sonicated 5 s. To each sample was then added 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. All the samples with the same amount of starting material were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-MYC, anti-Sed5p, and anti-Sly1p antibodies, using enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative ratio of MYC-tagged protein to Sly1p was evaluated with a Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Yeast strains (ADY3, ADY4, ADY5, or ADY6) were grown to 1.2 OD600 units/ml. The cell pellets of 50-ml cultures were resuspended in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mmMgOAc, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Pefabloc, proteinase inhibitor tablet mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and the cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of Protein A-Sepharose-4B Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with end-over-end rotation. After centrifugation in a table-top centrifuge for 1 min at top speed, 600 μl of the supernatant were transferred to a new tube, and 100 μl of Protein A-Sepharose-4B, previously coupled with anti-MYC, or anti-HA antibodies (22.Harlow E.

After centrifugation at top speed for 1 min, the supernatant (S) was transferred to a new tube and an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added. The beads (IP) were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with PBS for 5 min each, resuspended in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer, and boiled 5 min. 20 μl from the IP sample (corresponding to 1/3 of the total IP) and 20 μl from the supernatant sample (S) (corresponding to 1/60 of the total supernatant) were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the antibodies specified in the figures. ADY6 strain was grown in rich media with 200 mg/liter Geneticin to 1 OD600 unit/ml. The pellet from a 250-ml culture was transferred to a mortar containing liquid nitrogen and smashed until a fine powder was obtained. The powder was dissolved in 6 ml of buffer A (20 mmHepes·KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm KOAc, 1 mm MgOAc, 2 mm Pefabloc, proteinase inhibitor tablet mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and centrifuged for 15 min at 500 ×g. The supernatant was divided into 4 tubes (600 μl each), and to each tube were added 600 μl of buffers A, B, C, and D, respectively. Buffers B, C, and D had the same composition as buffer A except for 2% Triton X-100 (B), 3 m KCl (C), or 8m urea (D). After incubation for 15 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g, the pellet (p10) was resuspended in 1.2 ml of 2× SDS buffer. The supernatant (1 ml) was subjected to further centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, the pellet (p100) was resuspended in 1 ml of 2× SDS buffer, and the supernatant (S100) was treated in the same way. All samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Cells of ADY6 strain were grown as above. The pellet from a 500-ml culture was resuspended in 6 ml of a detergent-containing buffer (20 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 250 mmsorbitol, 0.5% CHAPS, 2 mm Pefabloc, proteinase inhibitor tablet mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. 5 ml of the supernatant were loaded on to a Sephacryl S-400 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted at 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 2 ml were collected. Proteins of equal aliquots from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with the different antibodies. The chemiluminescence signals were quantitated with a Lumi-Imager. We had previously shown by affinity chromatography and two-hybrid analyses that the COPII component Sec24p binds specifically to the Golgi syntaxin Sed5p (4.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate whether the Sec24p-related yeast proteins Sfb2p and Sfb3p/Lst1p (Fig.1) would also interact with Sed5p. Soluble proteins of newly created yeast strains expressing the C-terminally tagged Sfb2p-HA or Sfb3p-MYC protein were incubated with agarose beads to which GST alone or GST fused to all different yeast syntaxins were bound. After washing the beads with buffer containing 0.15 m KCl, Sfb2p and Sfb3p/Lst1p bound Sed5p specifically (Fig. 2). However, under the conditions used, Sfb3p/Lst1p interacted less efficiently with the GST-Sed5 fusion protein than Sfb2p.Figure 2Sfb2p and Sfb3p bind to Sed5p. 0.5 μm purified GST or GST fusions with the t-SNAREs lacking their transmembrane domain were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated for 90 min in 200 μl of 1× PBS buffer with 500 μg of yeast cytosol prepared from the yeast strain expressing Sfb2p-HA and Sfb3p-MYC (ADY6). After intensive washing, the bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-HA (Sfb2p) or anti-MYC (Sfb3p) antibodies. The GST-Tlg2p fusion gave an unspecific signal with the anti-HA but not with the anti-MYC antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because of their ability to bind Sed5p, we termed the Sec24p-related proteins Sfb2p and Sfb3p (for Sed fivebinding). To inquire into the functional relationship of Sec24p and its relatives, we knocked out SFB2 and SFB3 in the laboratory strains that we intended to use for studying possible synthetic defects with sec24 mutants. We found that cells ofsfb2 and sfb3 deletion mutants as well as those of the double knockout grew like wild type cells at temperatures between 15 °C and 37 °C. Pulse-chase experiments were performed at 30 °C to follow the fate of various proteins that pass the ER and the Golgi compartments on the way to their final destination: the soluble and membrane-bound vacuolar hydrolases carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), secreted invertase, and the glycolipid-anchored plasma membrane protein Gas1p. Whereas the vacuolar hydrolases reached their target organelle with identical kinetics in wild type and in the three knockout strains, a clear delay of Gas1p processing was observed in sfb3 single and thesfb2/sfb3 double deletion mutants (Fig.3 A). Processing and secretion of invertase, followed by staining the enzyme in nondenaturing gels, was only marginally affected in the deletion strains. The bulk of invertase was secreted, but apparently not fully glycosylated as in wild type cells (Fig. 3 B). It thus appears that the deletion of SFB3 results in a differential delay of transport of the plasma membrane protein Gas1p, whereas the lack of Sfb2p does not affect protein transport at all. It was previously noted that SEC24is an essential gene (4.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7.Gimeno R.E,. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We created several temperature-sensitive mutants to be able to search for synthetic effects with mutants ofSFB2 and SFB3 which are non-essential genes (8.Pagano A. Letourneur F. Garcia-Estefania D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and to inquire into the possibility that this COPII component might serve a dual role in transport vesicle budding and fusion. A collection of haploid temperature-sensitive strains was prepared with the essential SEC24 gene deleted and kept alive at 30 °C by expressing Sec24p from hydroxylamine-mutagenized single-copy recombinant plasmid. The plasmid-borne sec24 genes from three strains unable to grow at temperatures higher than 35 °C were sequenced and found to contain single codon changes each within a 240-amino acid stretch of the N-terminal region, which also contains a zinc finger-like structure (Fig. 1). The sec24–11 andsec24–16 alleles encode proteins with the non-conservative substitutions D351Y and T185I, respectively, whereassec24–13 has an amber mutation at codon 112. The latter finding indicates that the genetic background of the strain used includes an amber suppressor activity. Although growth of the mutants ceased completely within 30–40 min after shift to 37 °C, the mutant Sec24 proteins were rather stable at non-permissive temperature (Fig.4 C). For further studies, thesec24–11 allele was integrated into the genome to replace the wild type SEC24 gene. The sec24–13 andsec24–16 alleles were expressed from the centromere-containing plasmids in sec24 deletion strains. At 25 °C all three mutants behaved like wild type with respect to the transport of invertase, Gas1p, CPY, and ALP (data not shown). At the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C, a slight delay of CPY and ALP maturation was observed (Fig. 4). However, compared with wild type cells, most of the proteins analyzed were properly and efficiently processed indicating that they reached their final destinations. In sharp contrast, vesicular protein transport in sec23–1mutant cells, as expected, appeared to be completely blocked (Fig.4 A). As SEC24 is essential, and Sec24p in complex with Sec23p is thought to be required for the formation of vesicles at the ER, these findings came as a surprise. We reasoned that the Sec24p-related Sfb2p and/or Sfb3p could have compensated for the loss of Sec24p function in vesicle budding. The chromosomally integrated sec24–11allele was therefore combined with the deletion of eitherSFB3 or SFB2. The combination of thesfb3 null with the sec24–11 allele led to lethality, whereas Δsfb2/sec24–11 cells were viable. In contrast to the single mutants, CPY, ALP, and Gas1p transport was completely blocked in this double mutant (Fig.5, A and B). A portion of newly synthesized invertase was accumulated in its ER core-glycosylated form, but most of the enzyme appeared to reach the periplasmic space in a somewhat hypoglycosylated form (Fig.5 C). Electron microscopic inspection after potassium permanganate staining of fixed cells revealed that, compared with wild type (Fig.6 A), sfb2 null (data not shown) and sec24–11 mutant cells at 37 °C (Fig. 6 B) had an about 2-fold increased number of 30–50-nm vesicles. Interestingly, the Δsfb2/sec2"

One of these kinase inhibitors the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein (p21) was originally identified as a cyclin-dependent kinase and PCNA-binding protein (1.Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) that was able to inhibit CDK catalytic activity (2.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar) and as a gene whose expression was induced by the tumor suppressor protein p53 (3.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

It has now become clear that p21 is capable of contributing to the regulation of cell division on several different levels. These include mediation of negative growth signals, functions in differentiation and senescence, and the more recently defined roles for p21 as a modulator of the apoptotic response (4.Asada M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 7.Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The most well defined function of p21 linked to its activity as a growth inhibitor is as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI). During the response to DNA damage, p21 levels increase in a p53-dependent manner leading to the inhibition of Cdk2 catalytic activity (6.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of p21 has been shown to be sufficient for both cyclin-CDK binding and inhibition as it contains a cyclin binding motif (aa 16–24) and a CDK interaction site (aa 45–65) (7.Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 8.Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A.

A second cyclin binding motif lies at the extreme C terminus of p21, and although this domain is sufficient to bind and inhibit some cyclin-CDKs, its function within the full-length protein remains unclear (12.Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 13.Ball K.L. Lain S. Fahraeus R. Smythe C. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p21 inhibits cyclin-CDK activity is controversial. However, recent developments showing that p21 is not a general G1-CDK inhibitor but that it can differentially regulate individual cyclin-CDK combinations begins to explain some of the discrepancies. Whereas previously it was reported that p21 could be associated with both active and inactive G1 cyclin-CDK complexes (14.Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 15.Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. et al.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) and that changes in the stoichiometry of p21 regulated this transition, recent studies have established that a single molecule of p21 is sufficient to inhibit completely the catalytic activity of cyclin A-Cdk2 (16.Hengst L. Gopfert U. Lashuel H.A. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3882-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This correlates with studies showing that all the p21-containing Cdk2 complexes in cells are catalytically inactive (17.Cai K. Dynlacht B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12254-12259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, all the cyclin D-Cdk4-pRb kinase activity in proliferating cells is in complex with either p21 or its close relative p27 (18.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 19.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), and at a molar ratio of 1:1 p21 does not efficiently inhibit cyclin D-Cdk4 activity (18.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 20.Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In fact, it appears from in vitro studies that p21 can stimulate the assembly of catalytically active cyclin D-Cdk4 by stabilizing the pre-formed complex (18.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), and in cells p21 appears to assemble and target the nuclear localization of cyclin D1-Cdk4 (19.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas p21 is a potent inhibitor of Cdk2-containing complexes, it is a positive modulator of Cdk4 activity. In addition to a second cyclin-binding site, the C terminus of p21 also contains a region that interacts with the replication and repair protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (aa 144–151), a putative nuclear localization sequence (aa 140–157), and two cleavage sites for the apoptosis-associated protease, caspase 3 (21.Park J.A. Kim K.W. Kim S.I. Lee S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that p21 and PCNA were both components of a quaternary cyclin D-Cdk4 complex in proliferation cells (1.Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 14.Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and it has subsequently been shown that p21 and PCNA can also bind directly to each other in the absence of cyclin-CDKs (22.Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Binding of p21 to PCNA blocks the ability of PCNA to act as a processivity factor for DNA polymerase δ and ε, modulating the primer template recognition complex and inhibiting DNA replication in vitro (23.Waga S. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although there is clear evidence that p21-PCNA complexes form in response to DNA damage, it has proved difficult to show a significant effect of p21 on DNA replication in cells. However, recent data suggest that the interaction with PCNA is important in preventing endoreduplication (24.Stewart Z.A. Leach S.D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), inhibiting S-phase progression (25.Rousseau D. Cannella D. Boulaire J. Fitzgerald P. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3290-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and promoting DNA repair (26.Savio M. Stivala L.A. Scovassi A.I. Bianchi L. Prosperi E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar, 27.McDonald III, E.R. Wu G.S. Waldman T. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2250-2255PubMed Google Scholar). The data describing a role for p21 in nucleotide excision repair (NER) suggests that although p21 can inhibit PCNA-dependent gap filling activity, it can only do this when gap filling is uncoupled from incision, and therefore cellular NER is refractive to inhibition (28.Shivji M.K. Ferrari E. Ball K. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the other hand, p21-null human colon cancer cells (HCT116) are defective in their ability to repair certain types of DNA damage, and efficient repair is restored following expression of exogenous wild type p21 but not a mutant form of p21 missing the PCNA-binding site (27.McDonald III, E.R. Wu G.S. Waldman T. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2250-2255PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that p21 is required to aid efficient disassembly of PCNA from repair sites leading to an increase in the rate at which damaged DNA is repaired (26.Savio M. Stivala L.A. Scovassi A.I. Bianchi L. Prosperi E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, PCNA has been shown to play a role in the regulation of p21 activity by modulating the rate at which p21 is degraded (29.Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To date the majority of studies involving p21 have concentrated on its transcriptional regulation by p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms (30.Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Evidence is now beginning to emerge that p21 can also be regulated by post-translational mechanisms. The best characterized of these is C-terminal cleavage of p21 by a member of the caspase family of proteases (21.Park J.A. Kim K.W. Kim S.I. Lee S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31.Gervais J.L. Seth P. Zhang H. J. Biol.

This appears to be an early event during DNA damage-induced apoptosis that affects both PCNA binding (31.Gervais J.L. Seth P. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19207-19212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33.Zhang Y. Fujita N. Tsuruo T.

Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) of p21. In addition, evidence implicating reversible phosphorylation as a mechanism for regulating p21 comes from several studies. The strongest data to date, however, is a study of p21 during cellular differentiation (34.Erhardt J.A. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23517-23523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Stimulation of PC12 cells to differentiate using nerve growth factor led to loss of epitope binding by a C terminus-specific anti-p21 monoclonal antibody, although there appeared to be no overall change in p21 protein levels. Phosphatase treatment of the lysates resulted in recovery of the epitope, suggesting that reversible phosphorylation within the extreme C-terminal region of p21 occurs in response to nerve growth factor-stimulated signaling pathways. However, potential phosphorylation sites on p21 were not identified in this cell system nor were possible biochemical effects of this phosphorylation on p21 activity defined. The main difficulty in mapping such regulatory phosphorylation sites on p21 protein is the relatively low level expression of p21 protein in cultured cells that precludes an accurate biophysical study of post-translational regulatory mechanisms. In our study, a eukaryotic cell model system was developed using recombinant human p21 protein expressed in Sf9 cells to acquire relatively large amounts of p21 in an extensively phosphorylated state for biochemical characterization. The PCNA binding activity of p21 protein synthesized in this cell system can be modulated by protein phosphatase inhibitors or phosphatase treatment, suggesting that in vivo phosphorylation of p21 can in fact modulate its activity. A biochemical approach was subsequently used to map the phosphorylation sites within p21 whose modification in vitro can inhibit p21-PCNA complex formation to the C-terminal domain at residue Thr145, Ser146, and Ser160. An antibody specific for the phospho-Ser146 p21 epitope was developed and used to demonstrate that the inactive isoform of p21 recovered fromSf9 cells treated with phosphatase inhibitors had been phosphorylated in vivo at Ser146. These data identify the first phosphorylation site within the C-terminal regulatory domain of p21 whose modification in vivomodulates p21-PCNA interactions and define a eukaryotic cell model that can be used to study post-translational signaling pathways that regulate the p21 protein. All biotinylated peptides were synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes, Peptide Systems (Clayton, Australia). Each peptide had a biotin-SGSG spacer at the C terminus and a free N terminus. The peptides were dissolved in Me2SO at 5 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C. Untagged human p21 and PCNA were expressed in Escherichia coli using a pT7-7 expression vector and purified by the methods previously described (34.Erhardt J.A. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23517-23523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35.Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). PCNA for ELISA was expressed inSf9 insect cells infected with baculovirus containing a human PCNA construct. The cells were harvested 2 days post-infection by low speed centrifugation, and the pellet was lysed in an equal volume of extraction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotonin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1.2 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 400 μg/ml Pefabloc before centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. For generation of the αp21-phospho-Ser146 serum, phosphopeptide, KRRQTS[PO3]MTDFYHSK (synthesized by Dr. G. Bloomberg, University of Bristol), was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize a rabbit by standard methods (36.Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For affinity purification of the rabbit sera, the same phosphopeptide, KRRQTS[PO3]MTDFYHSK, was coupled to Reacti-Gel beads (Pierce) at a concentration of 0.8 mg of peptide per ml of beads following the manufacturer's instructions. After coupling excess reactive groups were blocked by adding 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. The phosphopeptide coupled beads were added to the rabbit sera (250 μl of beads per 10 ml of sera) and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The phosphatase inhibitors NaF and okadaic acid had previously been added to the rabbit sera at concentrations of 50 mm and 50 nm, respectively, to prevent endogenous phosphatases removing the phosphate group. Following incubation the beads were pelleted and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. To elute the bound antibody, 0.5 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, was added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were pelleted; the supernatant containing the eluted antibody was collected, and the pH was neutralized using 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. p21 purified from E. coli (1 μg) was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm DTT, 100 μm ATP with [γ-32P]ATP (250 cpm/pmol)) containing 0.5 milliunits of protein kinase A or 0.1 milliunits of casein kinase 2 or 0.06 milliunits of protein kinase C plus 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol. Following incubation the reactions were stopped either by (i) removing a 10-μl sample of the reaction mixture, adding to Laemmli sample buffer, and subjecting to SDS-PAGE prior to drying and autoradiography or (ii) by adding a 20-μl sample of the reaction mixture to 0.5 ml of ice-cold 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and leaving on ice for 1 h to precipitate the p21. The precipitated protein was pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and twice with 0.5 ml of H2O followed by a final rinse with acetone. The incorporation of radioactivity into the precipitated p21 was determined by Cerenkov counting. Alternatively, p21 phosphorylated at Ser146 in the absence of radiolabel was detected using αp21-phospho-Ser146 IgG by Western blot analysis following the method of Ball and Lane (37.Ball K.L. Lane D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), using the affinity purified αp21-phospho-Ser146 IgG and mAb 118 at 1 μg/ml. p21 was phosphorylated by either PKA or PKC as described above, and the reactions were stopped by adding urea to a final concentration of 6 m. After reducing and alkylating any cysteines (38.Stone K.L. Lo Pristi M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudairu P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1989: 31-47Google Scholar), the p21 was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described above. The precipitated pellets were dissolved in 250 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 1% n-octyl-β-glucopyranoside. After reducing the detergent concentration to 0.25% with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, the phosphorylated p21 was digested by incubating with either trypsin or Asp-N (1:40, protease:total protein by weight) overnight at 30 °C. The resulting peptide mixtures were then separated on a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column with a 0–70% acetonitrile gradient. The peptide peaks containing radiolabeled phosphate were collected, and the phosphorylation site(s) for each enzyme were mapped using a combination of mass spectrometry and solid phase Edman degradation. Peptide ELISAs for determination of PCNA binding were performed as described previously (39.Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using Sf9 cell lysates containing human PCNA (see above). Binding of αp21-phospho-Ser146 IgG to immobilized peptides was determined by ELISA using the method of Craig et al. (45.Craig A.L. Burch L. Vojtesek B. Mikutowska J. Thompson A. Hupp T.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To measure the interaction of full-length p21 with PCNA, microtiter plates were coated for 16 h at 4 °C with 0.5 μg/well purified recombinant human p21 diluted in 0.1 mCO3/HCO3, pH 9.0. After extensive washing with PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST), the wells were blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder in PBST (milk-PBST) for 2 h at room temperature. Increasing amounts of Sf9 cell lysate from cells expressing human PCNA diluted in 0.1% milk/PBST was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were incubated with anti-PCNA polyclonal antibody 3009 (37.Ball K.L. Lane D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) diluted 1:1000 in 2% milk/PBST for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) diluted 1:1000 in 2% milk/PBST for 1 h at room temperature. Extensive washing with PBST was carried out between each incubation. Finally, chromogenic substrate (50 μl) complete 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma), prepared in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, was added per well. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl/well 1 m H2SO4. The plates were analyzed using a Dynatech 5000 ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using BIAcore. Human PCNA purified from E. coli(35.Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) was captured on a CM5 sensor chip surface by amine coupling as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length purified p21 was passed over the surface of the chip, and the binding characteristics of different phosphorylated forms of p21 were observed. SPR response was measured in resonance units (RU), for most proteins 1000 RU corresponds to a surface concentration of approximately 1 ng/mm2. HBS (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.05% BIAcore surfactant P20) was used as a buffer in this system at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Sf9cells grown in Ex-Cell 400 (JRH Bioscience) + 5% FCS were infected with baculovirus carrying a full-length untagged p21 construct following the method described by Hupp and Lane (40.Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18165-18174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After 48 h the cells were treated with okadaic acid dissolved in ethanol (or ethanol alone) at a final concentration of 10 nm and incubated for a further 90 min. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed on ice in an equal volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotonin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1.2 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 400 μg/ml Pefabloc, 50 mm NaF, and 1 nm okadaic acid) or under denaturing conditions in an equal volume of urea buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 8m urea, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 100 mmDTT), centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant removed. TheSf9 cell supernatant (extracted under non-denaturing conditions, see above) was diluted 1:10 in lysis buffer containing pure recombinant PCNA at 5 μg/ml, and immunoprecipitation (41.Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) was carried out using the anti-p21 monoclonal antibody AB1 (Oncogene Sciences) linked to protein G. Alternatively, the supernatant was diluted 1:2 in lysis buffer with and without 0.2 units/ml alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. They were then diluted 1:5 in lysis buffer containing 2.5 μg/ml PCNA, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with AB1 as above. The immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE (42.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected using AB1 (p21) and the polyclonal serum 3009 (PCNA (37.Ball K.L. Lane D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) following the method described in Ball and Lane (37.Ball K.L. Lane D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although there is increasing evidence to suggest that the biochemical activity of p21 is regulated at the post-translational level, the sites of modification have not been mapped, and the effect of modification on the biochemical activity of p21 has not been determined. We were interested in whether targeting of p21 by protein kinase signaling pathways had the potential to regulate its activity and more particularly PCNA binding. Sf9 cells expressing recombinant human p21 were used as a model system to determine whether kinase signaling pathways that target p21 exist in cells. Insect cell-viral expression systems have been previously used as a unique model to identify novel regulatory phosphorylation sites in cyclin-dependent protein kinases (43.Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), SV40 viral T-antigen (44.Hoss A. Moarefi I. Scheidtmann K.H. Cisek L.J. Corden J.L. Dornreiter I. Arthur A.K. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4799-4807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the tumor suppressor protein p53 (40.Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18165-18174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 45.Craig A.L. Burch L. Vojtesek B. Mikutowska J. Thompson A. Hupp T.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The advantage that this expression system has in identifying novel signaling pathways that target a protein of interest is as follows: (i) relatively large amounts of a target protein can be purified and used for biophysical study; (ii) the target protein is not degraded, which is a common problem with cell cycle proteins normally expressed at very low levels; and (iii) eukaryotic signaling pathways are highly conserved and functioning in this cell system (46.Midgley C.A. Craig A.L. Hite J.P. Hupp T.R. Ravid K. Freshney R.J. DNA Transfer to Cultured Cells. Wiley-Liss, NY1998: 27-54Google Scholar). Various growth conditions were tested in the p21 expression system, and the majority of the p21 produced in insect cells was competent for binding to E. coli expressed recombinant human PCNA (Fig.1"
https://openalex.org/W2142239045,"The isoprenoids farnesol and juvenile hormone III (JH), metabolites of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, have been shown to stimulate fetal epidermal development in rodents. In this study we determined whether this effect might be attributed to a direct induction of keratinocytes differentiation and examined the mechanisms responsible for these effects. Rates of cornified envelope formation, a marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, as well as protein and mRNA levels of two proteins required for cornified envelope formation, involucrin (INV) and transglutaminase, increased 2- to 3-fold in normal human keratinocytes (NHK) treated with either farnesol or JH, even at low calcium concentrations (0.03 mm), which otherwise inhibit differentiation. In contrast, neither cholesterol nor mevalonate affected INV or transglutaminase mRNA levels. Effects of farnesol and JH on INV and transglutaminase mRNA levels were additive with high calcium concentrations (1.2 mm) that independently stimulate keratinocyte differentiation. In contrast, keratinocyte DNA synthesis was inhibited by these compounds. Both farnesol and JH stimulated INV and transglutaminase promoter activity, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. A series of truncation and deletion experiments revealed a farnesol-responsive region (−2452 to −1880 base pairs (bp)) in the INV gene. This region contained an AP-1 site. A single base pair mutation of the AP-1 site at −2116 to −2110 bp abolished farnesol responsiveness, identical to effects by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) activators. Farnesoid X-activated receptor mRNA was not detected in NHK, but farnesol treatment increased activities of both a PPAR response element and PPARα mRNA levels in NHK. Furthermore, the increase in PPRE activity by farnesol was dependent upon PPARα in CV-1 cells. Finally, topical applications of farnesol increased mRNA and protein levels of the differentiation-specific genes, profilaggrin and loricrin, determined by immunohistochemistry and in situhybridization, in wild-type but not in PPARα−/− murine epidermis. These findings suggest a novel role for selected isoprenoid cholesterol intermediates in the regulation of differentiation-specific gene transcription and a convergence of PPARα with the cholesterol synthetic pathway.

Many of the genes expressed in these suprabasal layers are necessary for the formation of the CE, the specialized external envelope of the terminally differentiated corneocyte, which confers rigidity and mechanical resistance (9.Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 107-150Google Scholar). Corneocytes, the critical structural components of the stratum corneum, together with extracellular lipids, provide the outermost epidermal layer with a barrier to systemic water loss, necessary for life in a terrestrial environment (10.Downing D.T.

Numerous studies suggest an important role for RXR-heterodimerizing nuclear hormone receptors in the regulation of epidermal differentiation. The most intensely studied members of this group are retinoic acid receptor (RAR) isoforms. For example, overexpression of a truncated inactive RARα during fetal development results in aberrant epidermal development (14.Imakado S. Bickenbach J.R. Bundman D. Rothnagel J.A. Attar P.S.

The regulation and role of epidermal lipid synthesis..Adv. Lipid Res. 1991; 24: 57-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon those early observations, we assessed whether farnesol and JH might regulate growth and differentiation. We showed recently that both of these isoprenoids accelerate epidermal development in fetal rats (21.Hanley K. Jiang Y. Crumrine D. Bass N.M. Appel R. Elias P.M. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23.Hanley K. Komuves L.G. Bass N.M. He S.S. Jiang Y. Crumrine D. Appel R. Friedman M. Bettencourt J. Min K. Elias P.M.

In the present study we explore the mechanisms responsible for these effects. We show here that farnesol directly stimulates differentiation in NHK as well as in adult murine epidermis. Furthermore, these effects are not mediated by FXR, but rather by PPARα, suggesting that the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation by isoprenoid sterol intermediates is dependent upon PPARα activation.DISCUSSIONRecent studies have revealed that an increasing number of endogenous lipid metabolites, such as lipid-soluble vitamins, fatty acids, and oxysterols, share properties of classic hormones;i.e. they interact directly with nuclear hormone receptors to regulate transcription. Farnesol is a 15-carbon isoprenoid derived from farnesylpyrophosphate, a key intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The ability of farnesol to accelerate the development of the fetal epidermal permeability barrier led us to ask whether farnesol directly affects differentiation and proliferation in epidermal keratinocytes. Our previous work has shown that fatty acids and oxysterols, activators of the nuclear hormone receptors PPARα and LXR, respectively, stimulate epidermal barrier ontogenesis and keratinocyte differentiation (24.Hanley K. Jiang Y. He S.S. Friedman M. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25.Hanley K. Ng D.C. He S.S. Lau P. Min K. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 788-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the epidermis, with its high rate of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, generates endogenous metabolites that locally regulate keratinocyte growth and differentiation. We explored here whether the sterol intermediates farnesol or JH also regulate NHK growth and differentiation. We show that treatment of NHK with either farnesol or JH results in increased cornified envelope formation and in increased mRNA and protein levels of the differentiation-specific genes INV and transglutaminase, with a parallel inhibition of DNA synthesis.The effects of ligands and activators of nuclear receptors on keratinocyte differentiation in vitro can differ dramatically from those effects that are observed in vivo. For example, all-trans-retinoic acid, the ligand for the retinoic acid receptor, inhibits differentiation in vitro, whereas topical treatment of the intact animal does not suppress differentiation (17.Eichner R. Gendimenico G.J. Kahn M. Mallon J.P. Capetola R.J. Mezick J.A. Br. J. Dermatol. 1996; 135: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18.Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1002-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Conversely, differentiation is stimulatedin vitro but inhibited in vivo by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the vitamin D receptor ligand (16.Kang S. Li X.-Y. Voorhees J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 15-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Bikle D.D. Pillai S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 3-19PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Berth-Jones J. Hutchinson P.E. Br. J. Dermatol. 1992; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined the effects of farnesol on murine epidermal differentiation in vivo. Farnesol increased the expression of loricrin and filaggrin both at the protein and mRNA level in wild-type mice, indicating that farnesol promotes differentiation in vivo as well as in vitro.Farnesol and JH increase INV and transglutaminase promoter activity, indicating regulation of these genes at the transcriptional level. Our experiments with deletional INV constructs revealed a region of the INV promoter (−2452 bp to −1880 bp) that was responsive to farnesol and JH. Mutation of the AP-1 site within this region abolished farnesol responsiveness, indicating that this AP-1 site is involved in the transcriptional regulation of INV by farnesol. This site also mediates the INV transcriptional response to calcium (33.Ng D.C. Su M.-J. Kim R. Bikle D.D. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 16-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 Our studies suggest, however, that farnesol and JH stimulate differentiation at least in part by a pathway independent of calcium, because in the presence of maximally stimulatory calcium levels, farnesol further increased INV transcription and mRNA levels.Several members of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily functionally interact with AP-1 proteins such as c-Jun and c-Fos, which are expressed in differentiated keratinocytes (42.Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2681-2687PubMed Google Scholar). Both positive and negative interactions have been reported, depending on cell type (43, 44 and refs. therein). The cell type specificity is determined in part by the composition of the AP-1 complexes and by interactions with additional transcriptional regulators. Future studies to determine whether nuclear receptors and AP-1 or other transcription factors present in NHK interact to regulate keratinocyte differentiation will contribute to the elucidation of the cascade of events leading to the transcriptional induction of genes such as INV.The farnesol-responsive region on the INV gene (−2452 bp to −1880 bp) which we have localized in the present study is also responsive to PPARα activators (24.Hanley K. Jiang Y. He S.S. Friedman M. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus we explored the possibility that farnesol-regulated INV transcription occurs via PPARα-mediated pathways. We demonstrate here that farnesol transactivates a PPRE in NHK, and that farnesol and the PPARα-specific activator Wy-14643, when applied together in suboptimal doses, exert additive effects on PPRE activation, whereas no further effects are observed with both agents at maximal concentrations. These results are similar to the combined effects of these agents on fetal epidermal barrier development (21.Hanley K. Jiang Y. Crumrine D. Bass N.M. Appel R. Elias P.M. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which also suggests a common mechanism of action. Additionally, we show that farnesol, like PPARα activators, regulates mRNA levels of PPARα in NHK. Furthermore, in cells that do not contain endogenous PPARs, we demonstrate that PPARα is activated by farnesol, similar to studies by another laboratory (45.O'Brien M.L. Rangwala S.M. Henry K.W. Weinberger C. Crick D.C. Waechter C.J. Feller D.R. Noonan D.J. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).To clearly delineate the role of PPARα in farnesol-stimulated epidermal differentiation, we examined the effects of topical farnesol on normal murine skin and in mice lacking functional PPARα (PPARα−/−). In previous studies we found that the stimulatory effects of PPARα activators on epidermal differentiation are not observed in PPARα−/− mice, indicating that the effects of these compounds are mediated by PPARα.2 The in vivostudies presented here provide definitive evidence that farnesol also exerts its effects on keratinocyte differentiation via PPARα activation, because farnesol did not stimulate the expression of profilaggrin or loricrin protein or mRNA in PPARα−/− mice. PPARα is a promiscuous receptor that is activated by a wide variety of compounds, including fibrates and fatty acids. Direct binding of farnesol to PPARα has not been observed 3Communication with T. Willson, Glaxo-Wellcome. ; whether PPARα may be activated by a farnesoid metabolite awaits further studies.Fatty acids and cholesterol are major constituents of mammalian cell membranes, and their cellular levels must be regulated so as to provide a balanced supply of these lipids during normal cellular growth. Regulation of lipid synthesis is of further importance in the epidermal keratinocyte, because the generation of large quantities of cholesterol and fatty acid in the proper ratio is critical for the maintenance of the epidermal permeability barrier (46.Mao-Quiang M. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Arch. Dermatol. 1993; 129: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that one mechanism by which this balance may be maintained is through activation of PPARα, which regulates many of the genes involved in fatty acid catabolism, by at least one intermediate in the cholesterol synthetic pathway, farnesol. Another point of transcriptional regulation at which the sterol and fatty acid synthetic pathways converge is through activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by cellular sterols (47.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). SREBPs are membrane-bound transcription factors which, when intracellular sterol levels decrease, are proteolytically cleaved to release the mature form (47.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). This truncated mature form then can enter the nucleus and regulate genes important for cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis, such as hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and reductase, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (47.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 48.Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, cholesterol can regulate fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in concert via SREBPs, whereas compounds derived from intermediates in the cholesterol synthetic pathway can regulate fatty acid metabolism via PPARα. This provides the cell with multiple mechanisms with which to maintain a balance between two essential membrane lipids and extends the role of isoprenoids beyond protein prenylation and stimulation of apoptosis and inhibition of DNA synthesis (50.Crick D.C. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 51.Voziyan P.A. Haug J.S. Melnykovych G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, previous studies have shown that PPARα activators can ameliorate the epidermal hyperplasia that occurs in essential fatty acid-deficient mice and in murine skin following repeated barrier disruption,2 suggesting that farnesol may be useful as a topical agent for the treatment of various dermatoses characterized by aberrant growth and differentiation.In summary, the results presented here reveal a novel role for the isoprenoid farnesol in PPARα-regulated transcription of differentiation-specific genes and suggest a convergence of the biosynthetic pathways of two of the major lipid species in the skin, fatty acids and cholesterol. Mammalian epidermis is comprised of stratifying, progressively differentiating keratinocytes, with the cells of each strata displaying a gene expression pattern that reflects the extent of their differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 1.Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Although proliferative cells in the basal layer express keratin genes, such as K5 andK14, suprabasal cells sequentially express K1 andK10 (2.Fuchs E. Green H.

Many of the genes expressed in these suprabasal layers are necessary for the formation of the CE, the specialized external envelope of the terminally differentiated corneocyte, which confers rigidity and mechanical resistance (9.Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 107-150Google Scholar). Corneocytes, the critical structural components of the stratum corneum, together with extracellular lipids, provide the outermost epidermal layer with a barrier to systemic water loss, necessary for life in a terrestrial environment (10.Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Elias P.M. Menon G.K. Adv. Lipid Res. 1991; 24: 1-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased extracellular calcium, resulting in elevated intracellular calcium, is perhaps the best known signal for the induction of normal human keratinocyte (NHK) differentiation (12.Hennings H. Kruszewski F.H. Yuspa S.H. Tucker R.W. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 4: 777-780Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13.Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Other extra- and intracellular signals by which NHK differentiation is controlled are not yet fully understood. Numerous studies suggest an important role for RXR-heterodimerizing nuclear hormone receptors in the regulation of epidermal differentiation. The most intensely studied members of this group are retinoic acid receptor (RAR) isoforms. For example, overexpression of a truncated inactive RARα during fetal development results in aberrant epidermal development (14.Imakado S. Bickenbach J.R. Bundman D. Rothnagel J.A. Attar P.S.

For a subset of the chemoprotective compounds, protection is generated by an increase in the abundance of protective enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). In the present study, we developed a cell culture system that potently responds to phenolic antioxidants and found that antitumor prostaglandins (PGs) are potential inducers of GSTs. We screened primary hepatocytes and multiple cell lines for inducing GST activity upon incubation with the phenolic antioxidant (tert-butylhydroquinone) and found that rat liver epithelial RL34 cells most potently responded. Based on an extensive screening of diverse chemical agents on the induction of GST activity in RL34 cells, the J2 series of PGs, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2) in particular, were found to be potential inducers of GST. Enhanced gene expression of Class π GST isozyme (GSTP1) by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 was evident as a drastic elevation of the mRNA level. Hence, we examined the molecular mechanism underlying the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2-induced GSTP1 gene expression. From functional analysis of various deletion mutant genes, we found that the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 reponse element was localized in a region containing a GSTP1 enhancer I (GPEI) that consists of two imperfect phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements. When the GPEI was combined with the minimum GSTP1 promoter, the element indeed showed an enhancer activity in response to 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2. Point mutations of either of the two imperfect 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements in GPEI completely abolished the enhancer activity. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 specifically stimulated the binding of nuclear proteins including the transcription factor c-Jun, but not Nrf2, to GPEI. These results suggest that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 induces the expression of the ratGSTP1 gene through binding of proteins, including c-Jun, to a specific GPEI.

De Long M.J. Prochaska H.J. Cory J.G. Szentivanyi A. Cancer Biology and Therapeutics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 197-216Crossref Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the induction of electrophile processing Phase II enzymes,e.g., glutathione S-transferases (GSTs),1UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, is a major protective mechanism (2.Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1989; 28: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3.Prestera T. Holtzclaw W.D. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The induction of these enzymes is accompanied by elevations of intracellular GSH levels, which augment cellular protection. Induction of Phase II enzymes is evoked by an extraordinary variety of chemical agents, including Michael reaction acceptors, diphenols, quinones, isothiocyanates, peroxides, vicinal dimercaptans, and others (4.Prestera T. Zhang Y. Spencer S.R. Wilczak C.A. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 5.Talalay P. De Long M.J. Prochaska H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

With few exceptions, these agents are electrophiles, and accordingly, many of these inducers are substrates for phase II detoxification enzymes. The transcriptional activation of the chemoprotective response genes by these compounds has been traced to a cis-acting transcriptional enhancer called an antioxidant response element (ARE) (7.Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3826-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), or alternatively, the electrophile response element (8.Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer T. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). AREs have been detected in the promoters of various phase II detoxification enzyme genes, including GST genes (for review,see Ref. 9.Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The GSTs are a family of enzymes that catalyze the nucleophilic addition of the thiol of reduced glutathione (GSH) to a variety of electrophiles (for review, see Ref. 10.Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. CRC Critical Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). In addition, the GSTs bind with varying affinities to a variety of aromatic hydrophobic compounds. It is now generally accepted that the GSTs are encoded by at least five different gene families. Four of the gene families (Classes α, μ, π, and θ) encode the cytosolic GSTs, whereas the fifth encodes a microsomal form of the enzyme.There has been considerable interest in the properties of the Class π GST isozyme (GSTP1), particularly in relationship to carcinogenesis and human cancer. A number of studies have shown that GST P1 is the predominant GST isozyme found in human cancer tissue and that it serves as a putative tumor marker in some instances of both rodent and human disease (11.Sato K. Kitahara A. Satoh K. Ishikawa T. Tatematsu M. Ito N. Gann. 1984; 75: 199-202PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Tatematsu M. Mera Y. Ito N. Satoh K. Sato K.

Indeed, this protein is one of the most reliable markers for the identification of hepatic preneoplastic foci. GSTP1 is almost undetectable in normal rat hepatocytes and is markedly overexpressed in hepatic foci arising spontaneously or in animals treated with carcinogens (13.Sato K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 205-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). GSTP1 is the enzyme with the highest activity in the detoxification of carcinogens, such as the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene. In addition, Berhane et al. (17.Berhane K. Widersten M. Engström Å. Kozarich J.W. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) have reported that GSTP1 is more effective in the detoxification of electrophilic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds produced by radical reactions, lipid peroxidation, ionizing radiation, and metabolism of drugs than other GSTs. These observations suggest that GSTP1 is an important determinant in cancer susceptibility and that its elevated synthesis is required to prevent toxic compounds from accumulating in the cells. It has recently been reported that deletion of the GSTP1 gene from mice results in increased skin tumorigenesis (18.Henderson C.J. Smith A.G. Ure J. Brown K. Bacon E.J. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It has been shown that the 5′ upstream region of the GSTP1 gene contains a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) and a related enhancer element termed GSTP1 enhancer I (GPEI) with characteristics similar to those of ARE. The GPEI contains a dyad of TRE-like elements (19.Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20.Okuda A. Imagawa M.

PGs have been shown to have a beneficial effect in a variety of animal models of hepatic failure due to toxins (CCl4, acetaminophen, galactosamine, or alcohol), hypoxia, ischemia, and immune-mediated diseases (25.Rush B.

PGs are primarily derived from arachidonic acid, which is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipases. Arachidonic acid is first converted to an unstable endoperoxide intermediate by cyclooxygenase and subsequently converted to one of several related products, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2, and thromboxane A2, through the action of specific PG synthetases (Scheme FSI). Among them, PGD2 is known to play an important role in a number of biological processes, including platelet aggregation, relaxation of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle, and nerve cell function (32.Giles H. Leff P. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although PGD2 is known to mediate effects through interactions with a cell surface receptor (33.Hirata M.

A. 1994; 91: 11192-11196Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), it readily undergoes dehydration in vitro and in vivo to yield additional biologically active PGs of the J2 series (34.Fitzpatrick F.A.

The cyclopentenone-type PGs, such as the A and J series of PGs, have no cell surface receptor but are actively transported into cells and accumulated in the nuclei, where they act as potent inducers of cell growth inhibition and cell differentiation (37.Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The actions of cyclopentenone PGs are attributed to the synthesis of the various proteins, such as heat shock proteins (38.Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19764-19770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 270: 21779-21784Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In the present study, we developed a cell culture system that potently responds to the phenolic antioxidants resulting in the induction of GST activity and found that the J2 series of PGs, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2) in particular, preferentially induces the synthesis of GSTs. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2-induced GST expression, the effect of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 on the promoter activity of GSTP1 was also examined.DISCUSSIONWe showed here that one established rat liver epithelial cell line exhibited the greatest enhancement of GST induction in response to the phenolic antioxidants (Figs. 1 and 2). The RL34 cell line is a nonmalignant epithelial cell that has been confirmed to be hepatocytes and maintained normal diploid karyotypes for over 10 months without spontaneous neoplastic transformation (58.Karasaki S. Okigaki T. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4491-4499PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Okigaki T. Davis M. Quan S.G. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1976; 52: 312-315Crossref Google Scholar, 60.Okigaki T. Tissue Culture Assoc. Man. 1977; 3: 565-566Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cell line has been shown histologically and biochemically to possess characteristics of well differentiated liver parenchymal cells (59.Okigaki T. Davis M. Quan S.G. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1976; 52: 312-315Crossref Google Scholar, 60.Okigaki T. Tissue Culture Assoc. Man. 1977; 3: 565-566Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have observed that the basal level of GST isozymes in RL34 cells is significantly lower than that in hepatoma cell lines. 2Y. Kawamoto, Y. Nakamura, T. Osawa, and K. Uchida, unpublished observations. It is therefore conceivable that, like normal liver, the RL34 cells retain a regulatory mechanism that could be modulated by the phase II inducers. Using the RL34 cells, we screened diverse chemical agents on the induction of GST activity and found a chemoprotective potential of J series of PGs, particularly 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2.The conversion of arachidonic acid into prostanoid metabolites has been studied in detail (61.Fukushima M. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of this biosynthetic pathway with the activation profile reveals that induction of GST expression is mediated mainly by metabolites of PGD2, the most active of which is the terminal metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (Fig. 3). Members of the PGJ2 series have been reported to have their own unique spectrum of biological effects, including the inhibition of cell cycle progression, the suppression of viral replication, the induction of heat shock protein expression, and the stimulation of osteogenesis (37.Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A characteristic of this and another class (A series) of PGs is that they contain α,β-unsaturated ketones, which are very susceptible to nucleophilic addition reactions with thiols and are essential for the actions of the PGs (62.Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts Jr., L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 63.Atsmon J. Freeman M.L. Meredith M.J. Sweetman B.J. Roberts Jr., L.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1879-1885PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that PGA1 forms a monoconjugate with thiols, whereas Δ12-PGJ2 forms a bisconjugate with two thiols (64.Cagen L.M. Fales H.M. Pisano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6550-6554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 65.Parker J. Ankel H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the binding of PGA1 to synthetic polymer-supported thiols as a model of thiol-containing proteins is reversible, but that of Δ12-PGJ2 is irreversible (66.Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An irreversible bisconjugate with thiol groups of proteins may be required for the stimulation of the GSTP1 promoter activity. Several previous observations have also indicated that PGD2 and its J-ring metabolites might exert effects through interactions with intracellular proteins: (i) Narumiya et al. (67.Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that radiolabeled Δ12-PGJ2 is actively incorporated into cells and transferred to the nucleus, where it is associated with proteins; and (ii) some PGs, including PGD2, PGJ2, and Δ12-PGJ2, have been shown to bind with high affinity to liver fatty acid-binding protein and intracellular protein involved in the uptake, intracellular transport, and metabolism of free fatty acids and their acyl-CoA esters (68.Khan S.H. Sorof S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9401-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although PGD2 and its metabolites are known to form in vivo (36.Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 69.Nowark J. Wennmalm A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1979; 106: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the rapid metabolism and potential for sequestration of these compounds by binding proteins complicates the quantitation of their levels. Little is known regarding the in vivo levels of the J2 series of PGs other than that Δ12-PGJ2 is present in human and monkey urine in significant quantities (∼150 ng/24 h in human males) (36.Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Higher amounts of other, uncharacterized Δ12-PGJ2 immunoreactive compounds have also been detected in human urine (36.Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).On the other hand, based on the facts that (i) some PGs (including PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2, and TxA2) have their own receptors (70.Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. Breyer R.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 8-17PubMed Google Scholar), and that (ii) 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 is a ligand for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, which promotes adipocyte differentiation (71.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar, 72.Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Wilson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar), it may not be unlikely that the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2-induced GPEI activation followed by GSTP1 expression is intracellular receptor-mediated. Although the detailed mechanism by which the J2 series of PGs induces GPEI activation is presently unknown, the fact that at least one of the PGJ2 series, Δ12-PGJ2, is actively incorporated into the nucleus of cells and is associated with proteins (67.Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar) has led to speculation that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ or other receptors could be involved in the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2-induced GST expression. Thus, whether cyclopentenone PGs stimulate GST induction via interaction with an intracellular receptor deserves further study.It is believed that activation of phase II enzyme genes is regulated by signal transducing kinase cascades (73.Ainbinder E. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 243: 49-57Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yu et al. (74.Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) have recently identified extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 kinase pathway to be involved in the ARE-mediated induction of phase II enzymes by t-BHQ and an isothiocyanate compound. They have also shown that the induction involve direct activation of Raf-1 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase), which phosphorylate and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase). Our preliminary experiment has also demonstrated that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 indeed stimulates phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2. 3K. Uchida, Y. Kawamoto, and T. Osawa, unpublished data. It is therefore likely that activation of Raf-1 followed by stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase pathway is involved in the induction of GSTP1 by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2.We showed here that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 stimulated the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the GSTP1gene and then induced GST mRNA and protein in RL34 cells (Fig. 4). It appeared that this stimulation required the specific region containing the GPEI, which specifically responded to 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 activation (Figs. 6 and 7). It has been shown that the enhancer of GSTP1 expression is regulated by multiple factors, including activator protein-1, which is known to be a heterodimer composed of the products of the jun andfos oncogenes (75.Diccianni M.B. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5153-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The present study also attested that c-Jun was involved in the formation of nuclear proteins-GPEI complexes induced by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (Fig. 8). c-Jun is a member of a multiprotein family that has been implicated in a number of signal transduction pathways associated with cellular growth, differentiation, neuronal excitation, and cellular stress (76.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 77.Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that c-Jun is required for cellular defense against toxicity (51.Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), it may not be unlikely that c-Jun functions as an important component that activates GPEI followed by the expression of GSTP1. On the other hand, another candidate of trans-acting factor(s) for the induction of GST and other Phase II enzymes has been recently identified. Venugopal and Jaiswal (81.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) have reported that the transcription factor Nrf2 positively regulates the ARE-mediated expression of Phase II detoxification enzyme genes. Itoh et al. (82.Itoh K. Chiba S. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama M. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar) have also shown by gene-targeted disruption in mice that Nrf2 is a general regulator of the Phase II enzyme genes in response to electrophiles and reactive oxygens. More recently, the general regulatory mechanism underlying the electrophile counterattack response has been demonstrated, in which electrophilic agents alter the interaction of Nrf2 with its repressor protein (Keap1), thereby liberating Nrf2 activity from repression by Keap1, culminating in the induction of the Phase II enzyme genes and antioxidative stress protein genes via AREs (83.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). There is also a hypothesis that the loss of factor(s) responsible for the repression of GSTP1 is responsible for an increase in the steady-state concentrations of this message. Indeed, theGSTP1 gene has a negative regulatory region or a silencer element approximately 300 bp upstream of the transcription start site (45.Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In any event, it is certain that multiple DNA elements and factors are involved in GSTP1 gene expression. Further studies of factors interacting with GPEI and other functionalcis-acting elements are required for elucidation of the specific expression of the gene in association with chemoprotective response and carcinogenesis.In summary, we have found that the J2 series of PGs, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 in particular, are potential inducers of GST in rat liver epithelial RL34 cells. The enhanced gene expression of GSTP1 by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 appeared as a drastic elevation of the mRNA level. From functional analysis of various deletion mutant genes, the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 reponse element was found to be localized in a region containing an enhancer element (GPEI) that consists of two imperfect TREs.

The capacity of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) to generate nitrosative stress was investigated in the murine macrophage line ANA-1. Sequential activation with the cytokines IFN-γ and either tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1β resulted in the induction of iNOS and production of nitrite (20 nm/min) but failed to elicit nitrosation of extracellular 2,3-diaminonapthalene. Stimulation with IFN-γ and bacterial lipopolysaccharide increased the relative level of iNOS protein and nitrite production of ANA-1 cells 2-fold; however, a substantial level of NO in the media was also observed, and nitrosation of 2,3-diaminonapthalene was increased greater than 30-fold. Selective scavenger compounds suggested that the salient nitrosating mechanism was the NO/O2 reaction leading to N2O3 formation. These data mimicked the pattern observed with a 5 μm concentration of the synthetic NO donor (Z)-1-[N-ammoniopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (PAPA/NO). The NO profiles derived from iNOS can be distinct and depend on the inductive signal cascades.

The formation of NO is catalyzed by a diverse family of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoenzymes (1.Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E. Chaudhuri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of the immune system can result in the expression of the inducible isoenzyme iNOS in numerous cell types (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils, glia, and hepatocytes). Although iNOS has been implicated in a diverse array of pathologic events, the relative contributions of NO and derived reactive nitrogen oxide species to disease processes are often unclear. Moreover, whether immune-stimulated cells can regulate the reactivity of NO per se by shifting the balance between NO and its various intermediate reaction partners, thereby altering subsequent effector interactions of nitrogen oxide species with target biomolecules, remains unanswered. In this study, we address these issues in the context of nitrosative stress, a condition often opposing oxidative stress (7.Grisham M.B. Jourd'Heuil D. Wink D.A. Am. J.

Acidified nitrite (HNO2) is a nitrosating agent, but it is formed only in low pH environments, such as that of the stomach (10.Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation.

Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) formed by the reaction of NO with molecular oxygen (O2) has a strong propensity to nitrosate both amine and thiol moieties at physiological pH (19.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. De Graff W.G. Mitchell J.B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The present study examined the nitrogen oxide profiles of a murine macrophage cell line to determine the conditions that may result in nitrosative stress on the extracellular milieu. The data show that macrophages produce a nitrosating agent consistent with the chemical profile of N2O3 (14.Kosaka H. Wishnok J.S. Miwa M. Leaf C.D. Tannenbaum S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); however, this phenotype was dictated by the inductive stimuli received by the macrophage.DISCUSSIONSynthetic donors such as PAPA/NO can generate NO flux sufficient to elicit nitrosation reactions via N2O3. Of the NOS isozymes, only iNOS can catalyze the formation of similarly high levels of NO for prolonged periods of time. This is due, in part, to the continuous association of calmodulin with iNOS and a decreased susceptibility to product feedback inhibition. The present study showed that the capacity of cells to nitrosate extracellular target compounds was not due solely to the presence of iNOS but was also dependent on the nature of the inductive stimuli.Relationship between Nitrite, Nitrate, and NO Trapped by OxymyoglobinNitrite and nitrate are stable higher oxidation products of NO that are often used as indirect measurements of NOS activity in aerobic aqueous media (25.Ignarro L.J. Fukuto J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Byrns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8207Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 26.Lewis R.S. Tamir S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29350-29355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Nitrite can be derived from numerous nitrogen oxide reactions. The stimulation of IFN-γ-primed ANA-1 cells with bacterial LPS resulted in the formation of approximately 2-fold more nitrite than that formed by cells stimulated with the cytokines IL-1β or TNF-α (Fig. 1 A). For each condition, nitrite values were highly correlated with the level of NO trapped by extracellular oxymyoglobin (Fig. 1 B); however, the rate of nitrite production was greater than that of oxymyoglobin oxidation. NO is trapped extremely rapidly by the dioxygen ferrous heme adduct of oxymyoglobin (k = 3.4 × 107m−1 s−1; Ref. 27.Eich R.F. Li T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R. Aitken J.F. Mathews A.J. Johnson K.A. Smith R.D. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6976-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a portion of the NO derived from iNOS was oxidized to nitrite prior to leaving the cell and that this occurs regardless of the immunostimulant combinations used to induce iNOS expression.Nitrate is derived primarily from the interactions of NO with oxyhemoproteins. An apparent constitutive release of nitrate (2 nm/min) from unstimulated ANA-1 cells was observed. Substitution of l-arginine with the iNOS competitive inhibitor N-methylarginine, however, showed that this nitrate was not derived from endogenously produced NO. These data suggest that a modest portion of nitrate was taken up from the culture media via anion transporters and was subsequently released following incubation in nitrate-free buffer during the assay period (28.Shingles R. Roh M.H. McCarty R.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A minor level of iNOS-specific nitrate (2 nm/min) production was distinguished from background only in cultures of ANA-1 cells stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS.iNOS Inductive Signals Confer High NO Level and Nitrosative CapacityThe concentration of NO derived from ANA-1 cells was measured either indirectly by oxymyoglobin oxidation or directly with an electrochemical probe. The oxymyoglobin data show that IFN-γ-primed ANA-1 cells produced incrementally greater amounts of NO following stimulation with either TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS. In contrast, an electrochemical probe placed within 100 μm of the cell bed detected a substantial amount of NO in the assay buffer only with the IFN-γ/LPS stimulant combination (Fig. 2 A). Whereas oxymyoglobin can be envisioned as millions of randomly distributed highly sensitive NO probes, the electrochemical probe registers the presence of NO at a fixed and more distal point in space.The stark contrast in NO profiles with the electrochemical probe predicts that the nature of the NO interactions with molecular targets in the milieu surrounding a macrophage will differ dependent on the signals received for iNOS induction. This dichotomy was clearly illustrated in the capacity of murine macrophages to nitrosate the extracellular target compound DAN. Consistent with an earlier report using RAW 264.7 cells (15.Simon D.I. Mullins M.E. Jia L. Gaston B. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), IFN-γ-primed ANA-1 cells stimulated with LPS nitrosated DAN present in the media. In comparison, the rate of DAN nitrosation in sister cultures of IFN-γ-primed ANA-1 cells stimulated with either TNF-α or IL-1β was 85–90% lower (Fig. 2 B). This dichotomy was also observed with primary murine macrophages, the IC-3, J774, and RAW 264.7 cell lines (data not shown). In addition, IFN-γ-primed macrophages nitrosated DAN following stimulation with LPS derived from Gram-positive bacteria as well as viral and parasite antigens (data not shown).Relationship of Nitrosative Capacity to iNOS Levels and Specific ActivityThe addition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and urate to the assay buffer did not affect the levels of DAN nitrosation under each stimulant condition (Table I). These data suggested that the dichotomy for DAN nitrosation were not related to the differential consumption of NO by oxidative pathways. Rather, the mechanisms may operate at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Western blot analysis showed that ANA-1 macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS had more than twice the iNOS protein of those treated with cytokines (Fig. 1 C). These data correspond to the differences observed for both nitrite production and oxymyoglobin oxidation. Nitrite production and nitrosative capacity were plotted as a function of cell density to examine whether nitrosative capacity was determined by the amount of iNOS per cell and the subsequent mass transport of NO. At an equivalence for nitrite production (and by extension, iNOS), the nitrosative capacity of ANA-1 cells stimulated with IFN-γ/LPS exceeded that of those stimulated with cytokines by 8–10-fold (Fig. 3). These data show that the specific activity of iNOS for nitrite formation and cellular nitrosative capacity are not coupled.Differences in nitrosative capacity may be related to the physical configuration of iNOS within the cell. Incubation of a sonication lysate derived from IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated ANA-1 cells in an optimized reaction mixture resulted in a 50% reduction in nitrite formation relative to that produced by intact cells. In contrast, lysis of ANA-1 cells stimulated with IFN-γ and TNF-α resulted in only a 10% reduction in nitrite formation. These data rule out the significance of arginine transport and the availability of iNOS co-factors (e.g. NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, and flavins) in conferring nitrosative capacity. Dilution of the cell contents upon lysis may alter the ratio between dimeric and inactive monomeric forms of iNOS in a manner independent of tetrahydrobiopterin levels (29.Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a disproportional decrease in nitrite production from lysed IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated ANA-1 cells may reflect the disruption of a membrane association critical for catalytic activity. Although metabolic incorporation of radiolabeled myristate, palmitate, and acetate onto iNOS was not observed in immunoprecipitates from IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages (31.Vodovotz Y. Russell D. Xie Q.W. Bogdan C. Nathan C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar), the status of iNOS acylation or prenylation in macrophages further stimulated with either cytokines or LPS remains unclear.Characterization of the Nitrosating SpeciesSynthetic iron nitrosyl complexes can catalyze NO exchange reactions through what has been termed transnitrosation (18.Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 32.Vanin A.F. Malenkova I.V. Serezhenkov V.A. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The elegant work by Lancaster and co-workers (16.Lancaster Jr., J.R. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 17.Nüssler A.K. Geller D.A. Sweetland M.A. Di Silvio M. Billiar T.R. Madariaga J.B. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) has shown that cells such as macrophages and hepatocytes form iron nitrosyl complexes following iNOS induction with cytokines and LPS. A potential role for iron nitrosyl complexes in the nitrosation of DAN, however, was not supported by several data. First, the addition of iron scavengers to the assay buffer did not impede DAN nitrosation by IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated ANA-1 cells (Table I). An interesting exception, albeit at high concentrations, was phenanthroline. Second, approximately 225 μm (70 ng/μl) of the prototypical iron nitrosyl (NO+ donor) compound sodium nitroprusside was required to match the rate of DAN nitrosation observed with 4 × 105 IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated ANA-1 cells (Fig. 5 A). S-Nitrosation of albumin by synthetic dinitrosyl iron complexes also required concentrations in the high micromolar range (18.Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A recent study found that the cumulative effect of IFN-γ/LPS treatment on J774 macrophages was to decrease iron uptake (to less than 2 pg per 4 × 105 cells) rather than increase iron release (33.Mulero V. Brock J.H. Blood. 1999; 94: 2383-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the observed level of DAN nitrosation by ANA-1 cells in our 3-h assay period was not due to an iron nitrosyl complex mechanism.Nitrite production was correlated with the NO profiles observed using oxymyoglobin regardless of stimulant status. In contrast, triazole formation from DAN and electrochemical detection of NO were exclusive to macrophages induced with IFN-γ/LPS. An enhanced capacity for NO to travel from a source cell to a distal point alters the potential reactivity of NO at that point. Specifically, the formation of the nitrosating agent N2O3 may predominate under these conditions. N2O3 was not initially accepted as a relevant species in biological systems because the rate constant for the reaction between NO and O2 was considered to be too slow (k = 2 × 106m−2 s−1; Ref. 34.Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) to compete with other potential pathways for NO consumption (e.g.hemeproteins and superoxide). However, the rate of the NO/O2 reaction has a second-order dependence on NO concentration, indicating that the formation of N2O3 can prevail when the flux of NO is high (34.Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35.Fukuto J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 36.Lewis R.S. Dean W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).The synthetic NO donor PAPA/NO generates N2O3in an aerobic environment. Formation of both nitrite and triazole by 4 × 105 ANA-1 cells stimulated with IFN-γ/LPS was equivalent to that generated by approximately 5 μmPAPA/NO (Fig. 4). For both ANA-1 cells and PAPA/NO under these conditions, the IC50 values for the N2O3 scavenger compounds ascorbic acid and glutathione were remarkably similar (Fig. 5). These data suggest that N2O3 derived from the NO/O2reaction was the nitrosating agent for DAN consistent with the previous findings of Tannenbaum and co-workers (14.Kosaka H. Wishnok J.S. Miwa M. Leaf C.D. Tannenbaum S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The partitioning of NO and O2 to the hydrophobic regions of membranes can greatly accelerate their reactivity with each other (37.Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, two observations suggest that N2O3 was formed outside the cell. First, the profiles for NO in the media using the electrochemical probe and the nitrosation of DAN are congruous. Second, the uptake mobilities of ascorbate and glutathione into the macrophage cytoplasm are very different (14.Kosaka H. Wishnok J.S. Miwa M. Leaf C.D. Tannenbaum S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the quenching profiles of both ascorbate and glutathione were similar between nitrosating cells and PAPA/NO in solution.ConclusionThis study shows that nitrosative alterations may occur to biomolecules containing either thiol or amino moieties in cells neighboring macrophages only if iNOS was induced in a selective manner (e.g. activation by direct contact with pathogens or their products). Nitrosative conditions generated by synthetic NO donors have been shown to inhibit the activity of enzymes involved in glycolysis (37.Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and DNA repair (38.Molina y Vedia L. McDonald B. Reep B. Brune B. DiSilvio M. Billiar T.R.

The nitrosative capacity of 4 × 105 LPS-activated ANA-1 cells was equivalent to that of 5 μm PAPA/NO in a volume of 1 ml (Fig.4 B). In the much smaller dimensions of a biological compartment, macrophages may elicit nitrosative stress through N2O3-mediated reactions equivalent to higher concentrations of NO donor. We have observed that IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated macrophages can inactivate target enzymes in neighboring cells equivalent to that achieved with millimolar levels of synthetic NO donor. 2X. Zhou and M. G. Espey, unpublished observations. Despite many advances in our understanding of redox mechanisms, the role of nitrosative stress in disease processes is poorly understood. This study provides a novel framework for deciphering how macrophages may regulate the nitrogen oxide chemistry derived from iNOS during specific pathologic situations. The data show that macrophage exposure to inflammatory cytokines in the absence of direct contact with infectious agents or their products was insufficient to prompt a nitrosative profile. Determination of the mechanisms that govern the relationship between nitrosative and oxidative stress will unlock many fundamental aspects regarding how nitrogen oxides are involved in fighting pathogens (40.Wink D.A. Laval J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2125-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), regulating cell-mediated immunity (41.Fang F.C. J. Clin.

Identification of genes and proteins that act as nitrosative switches may provide new pharmacological targets to control iNOS-generated nitrogen oxide chemistry in a wide range of diseases. Nitric oxide (NO)1 is a unique molecule that regulates numerous cellular functions solely through its chemical reactivity with the surrounding milieu. The formation of NO is catalyzed by a diverse family of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoenzymes (1.Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E. Chaudhuri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar). Activation of the immune system can result in the expression of the inducible isoenzyme iNOS in numerous cell types (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils, glia, and hepatocytes). Although iNOS has been implicated in a diverse array of pathologic events, the relative contributions of NO and derived reactive nitrogen oxide species to disease processes are often unclear. Moreover, whether immune-stimulated cells can regulate the reactivity of NO per se by shifting the balance between NO and its various intermediate reaction partners, thereby altering subsequent effector interactions of nitrogen oxide species with target biomolecules, remains unanswered. In this study, we address these issues in the context of nitrosative stress, a condition often opposing oxidative stress (7.Grisham M.B. Jourd'Heuil D. Wink D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G315-G321PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 9.Espey M.G. Miranda K.M.

In nitrosation reactions, N-nitrosamines andS-nitrosothiols are formed by the addition of a nitrosonium equivalent (NO+) to amine and thiol moieties, respectively (10.Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1988Google Scholar).

These different processes were inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based synthetic MMP inhibitors and rTIMP-2, but not by rTIMP-1 or cysteine, serine, or aspartic proteinase inhibitors.

HT1080 and A2058 cells transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA (but not vector-transfected A2058 cells) were able to bind125I-rTIMP-2, to activate pro-MMP-2, and to process MT1-MMP into an inactive 43-kDa form. Under these conditions,125I-rTIMP-2 bound to the cell surface was rapidly internalized and degraded in intracellular organelles through a bafilomycin A1-sensitive mechanism, and125I-bearing low molecular mass fragment(s) were released in the culture medium. These different processes were inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based synthetic MMP inhibitors and rTIMP-2, but not by rTIMP-1 or cysteine, serine, or aspartic proteinase inhibitors. These results support the concept that the MT1-MMP-dependent internalization and degradation of TIMP-2 by some tumor cells might be involved in the regulation of pericellular proteolysis. matrix metalloproteinases membrane type 1 MMP tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase recombinant TIMP 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate concanavalin A Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium bovine serum albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyclonal antibodies Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),1 also known as matrixins, form a family of at least 19 structurally related neutral zinc endopeptidases. These MMPs are collectively able to degrade a wide variety of substrates, including extracellular matrix as well as non-extracellular matrix proteins (1.Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Consequently, MMPs are thought to be involved in a large number of both normal and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and arthritis (2.Woessner J.F. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the association of MMPs with cancer cell invasion and metastasis has suggested that these proteinases represent an attractive target for the development of novel antitumoral therapies (3.Brown P.D. APMIS. 1999; 107: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Most members of the MMP family are produced as proenzymes consisting of an amino-terminal propeptide, a catalytic domain, and a hemopexin-like domain at the carboxyl terminus (2.Woessner J.F. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). The synthesis of most MMPs is specifically regulated at the level of gene expression (4.Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 299-356Crossref Google Scholar). However, the catalytic activity of these proteinases is further controlled at additional levels, including activation of the proenzyme (by propeptide removal) and inhibition of the active enzyme by specific endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMPs, the TIMPs (5.Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike most MMPs, MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A) is constitutively secreted by many types of cells (6.Yu A.E. Hewitt R.E. Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and its activation involves a cell surface-anchored MMP possessing a hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain. This enzyme was recently identified as membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP or MMP-14) (7.Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

TIMP-2, a 21-kDa non-glycosylated MMP inhibitor that preferentially complexes with pro-MMP-2, has been shown to play a pivotal role in this activation process. Indeed, the active form of MT1-MMP, which is generated through a furin-dependent mechanism (13.Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 14.Maquoi E. Noël A. Frankenne F. Angliker H. Murphy G. Foidart J.-M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), first binds TIMP-2 through its catalytic domain, thus docking soluble TIMP-2 to the cell surface. This bimolecular complex subsequently functions as a receptor for the secreted 66-kDa pro-MMP-2 through the interaction between the C-terminal domain of the enzyme and the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (15.Strongin A.Y.

In the presence of an adjacent free active MT1-MMP, the propeptide of MMP-2 is first cleaved between Asn37 and Leu38, generating an activated 62-kDa intermediate form. When present at a sufficiently high concentration on the cell surface, this intermediate form is further processed to fully activated 59-kDa MMP-2 by an intermolecular autolytic cleavage (7.Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Atkinson S.J. Crabbe T. Cowell S. Ward R.V. Butler M.J. Sato H. Seiki M.

Alternatively, this second cleavage can be achieved through the action of plasmin (20.Baramova E.N. Bajou K. Remacle A. L'Hoir C. Krell H.W. Weidle U.H. Noël A. Foidart J.-M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). When present in excess relative to active MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 completely blocks the first step of this activation process (7.Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol.

Beyond its role in pro-MMP-2 activation, TIMP-2 is also involved in other biological activities, including cell adhesion (23.Ray J.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), proliferation (24.Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shinagawa A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and apoptosis (25.Valente P. Fassina G. Melchiori A. Masiello L. Cilli M. Vacca A. Onisto M. Santi L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Albini A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), as well as stabilization of some MMPs (26.Farina A. Tacconelli A. Teti A. Gulino A. Mackay A.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2957-2960PubMed Google Scholar). However, the most notable function of TIMP-2 is its capacity to form tight 1:1 stoichiometric complexes with active MMPs, resulting in the inhibition of the catalytic activity of these proteinases. In this context, an imbalance between the concentrations of active MMPs over TIMP-2, resulting in an increased proteolytic activity, has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis as well as angiogenesis (27.Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). Conversely, exogenously added TIMP-2 has been shown to suppress growth, invasion, metastasis, and neovascularization in several tumor models (28.DeClerck Y.A. Perez N. Shimada H. Boone T.C. Langley K.E. Taylor S.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 701-708PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Imren S. Kohn D.B. Shimada H. Blavier L. DeClerck Y.A.

In accordance with these experimental observations, high MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios have been associated with poor clinical outcomes in different tumor types (33.Grigioni W.F. D'Errico A. Fortunato C.

We have demonstrated that pro-MMP-2 activation by HT1080 cells, a human fibrosarcoma cell line, was stimulated when these cells were either treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or concanavalin A (ConA) or plated on a thin coat of type IV collagen. 2E.

Sounni, A. Remacle, A. Noël, G. Murphy, and J.-M. Foidart, submitted for publication. Interestingly, we observed that these different treatments concomitantly reduced the concentration of secreted TIMP-2 without affecting the TIMP-2 mRNA level, thus suggesting the potential occurrence of a post-transcriptional regulation of extracellular TIMP-2 concentration. In the current study, we have investigated the mechanism accounting for the reduced extracellular TIMP-2 level observed in TPA- and ConA-treated HT1080 cells. Our results demonstrate that TIMP-2 initially complexed to cell surface-anchored MT1-MMP is rapidly internalized and subsequently degraded, resulting in the depletion of extracellular TIMP-2. HT1080 human fibrosarcoma; MCF7, T47D, and BT549 human breast carcinoma; and A2058 human melanoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 mm Hepes buffer at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere (5% CO2 and 95% air). All culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Merelbeke, Belgium).

(November 11, 1993) Patent WO 93/21942Google Scholar) were prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and used at final concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 μm in 0.1% Me2SO. Human recombinant TIMP-2 (rTIMP-2) was obtained from transformed Chinese hamster ovary cell supernatants as described previously (20.Baramova E.N. Bajou K. Remacle A. L'Hoir C. Krell H.W. Weidle U.H. Noël A. Foidart J.-M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Amiloride (5–500 μm), aprotinin (0.1–10 μm), E-64 (2.5–250 μm), soybean trypsin inhibitor (50–200 μg/ml), leupeptin (2–500 μg/ml), pepstatin A (5–20 μm), and phosphoramidon (31–250 μg/ml) were purchased from Sigma (Bornem, Belgium). A2058 cells were transfected, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), with either pc3MT1800S (human MT1-MMP cDNA cloned in the pcDNA3 expression plasmid) or pcDNA3 (control plasmid) vectors. Transfectants were isolated by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Three clones were selected: one transfected with the vector alone (C.IV.3) and two transfected with the MT1-MMP expression vector (S.I.3 and S.I.5). Expression of MT1-MMP was assessed by Northern and Western blotting as described below. Cells growing exponentially in T-75 flasks (Falcon Becton-Dickinson, Meylan, France) were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 10% fetal calf serum-containing medium, and allowed to recover from trypsinization for at least 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free DMEM and diluted in the same medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; fraction V, Sigma) to a density of 6 × 105 cells/ml. This suspension (100 μl/well) was seeded in 96-well plates (Falcon). Cells were subsequently supplemented with 100 μl of serum-free DMEM (untreated control), ConA (final concentration of 30 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), or TPA (final concentration of 10 ng/ml; Sigma). In some experiments, proteinase inhibitors were also added. The resultant culture supernatants were collected after different incubation times and stored frozen at −20 °C. The resulting cell monolayers (60,000 cells) were washed once with 100 μl of serum-free DMEM and extracted with 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm iodoacetamide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h at 4 °C. Alternatively (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)), cell monolayers were sonicated (10 s, 100 Hz) in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. rTIMP-2 was iodinated to a specific activity of 20–40 μCi/μg using the IODO-GEN technique (Pierce). Briefly, 0.8 mCi of 125I− (Na125I; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Gent, Belgium) was added to 10 μg of rTIMP-2 in 35 μl of 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). This solution was transferred into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube coated with 10 μg of IODO-GEN. After a 2-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by transferring the reaction mixture into 0.2 ml of 0.05 msodium phosphate (pH 7.5). 125I-rTIMP-2 was separated from free 125I− and potentially aggregated forms by filtration through a 0.9 × 50-cm column (Econo column, Bio-Rad) of Sephacryl S200 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The integrity of iodinated rTIMP-2 was evaluated by SDS-15% PAGE, followed by autoradiography, which did not reveal any degradation after β-mercaptoethanol (700 nm) reduction.125I-rTIMP-2 was also incubated with an excess of the recombinant catalytic domain of human MT3-MMP, and under these conditions, >90% of the inhibitor bound to the active site of the enzyme (data not shown). Finally, we confirmed that125I-rTIMP-2 was able to bind in vivo to the catalytic domain of plasma membrane-anchored MT1-MMP by demonstrating a specific binding of iodinated rTIMP-2 to transfected COS-1 cells overexpressing wild-type MT1-MMP, but not to cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive mutant form (Glu217 replaced by Ala) of MT1-MMP. 3A. Remacle, F. Frankenne, C. Munaut, E. Baramova, N. E. Sounni, S. Atkinson, A. Noël, G. Murphy, and J.-M. Foidart, manuscript in preparation. Assays of 125I-rTIMP-2 binding to cells plated in 96-well plates (see above) were performed in triplicate as follows. After adhesion, confluent cell monolayers were supplemented with 125I-rTIMP-2 up to a final concentration of 0.6 nm for indicated culture periods. In some experiments, unlabeled rTIMP-1 (0.1 μm), unlabeled rTIMP-2 (0.1 μm), a synthetic MMP inhibitor (GI129471, 0.01–10 μm), or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) was added to the cells 10 min prior to the addition of125I-rTIMP-2. Nonspecific binding, which was evaluated by adding unlabeled rTIMP-2 in excess (500 nm), never exceeded 1% of the total added radioactivity. Cell monolayers were washed once with 100 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (DMEM/BSA) and extracted with 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; the radioactivity associated with the total cell extracts was measured in a γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific radioactivity (see above) from cell extract-associated radioactivity measured in the absence of unlabeled rTIMP-2. Results are expressed as percentages of the total radioactivity added per well. Culture supernatants were collected after different incubation periods, immediately mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (with or without the reducing agent: 700 nm β-mercaptoethanol), and stored at 4 °C until electrophoresis. Samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-15% PAGE. Once dry, gels were autoradiographed. The percentages of degraded radiolabeled rTIMP-2 were calculated based on densitometric analysis of autoradiographs. Specific125I-rTIMP-2 degradation was calculated by subtracting the percentage of spontaneous degradation (measured by incubating125I-rTIMP-2 in the absence of cells; this degradation ranged from 4 to 8% of the total radioactivity) from the percentage of degraded radiolabeled rTIMP-2 measured in the presence of cells. Cells were prepared as described above and seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 106cells/ml (500 μl/well) in serum-free DMEM/BSA. Assays of125I-rTIMP-2 internalization were performed in triplicate as follows. After adhesion, cell monolayers were incubated with125I-rTIMP-2 (0.6 nm) at 4 °C for 40 min. Free ligand was removed by two washings with serum-free DMEM/BSA at 4 °C. At time 0, prewarmed medium supplemented or not with ConA (30 μg/ml) was added (400 μl/well), and cell monolayers were then incubated at 37 °C for up to 180 min. At different times, culture supernatants were collected and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 12% (w/v), placed on ice for 60 min, and then centrifuged to separate acid-soluble (degraded) and acid-insoluble (intact) 125I-rTIMP-2. The amount of cell surface-bound125I-rTIMP-2 was determined by subjecting the corresponding cell monolayers to acid washes (50 mm glycine HCl and 100 mm NaCl (pH 3)) for 2 × 2 min at 4 °C. The radioactivity remaining in the cells after the acid washes, defined as non-acid-extractable cell-associated radioactivity (internalized125I-rTIMP-2), was measured after dissolution of the cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (200 μl/well). Radioactivities associated with cell lysates, acid washes, supernatants, and trichloroacetic acid-soluble materials were measured in a γ-counter. Results are expressed as percentages of125I-rTIMP-2 initially bound to the cell surface at time 0 (sum of radioactivities measured in cell lysates, acid washes, and supernatants). Cell monolayers cultured in 96-well plates were treated for 24 h with either the weak base NH4Cl (5–30 mm) or bafilomycin A1 (0.1–100 nm dissolved in Me2SO; Sigma). For control experiments, serum-free DMEM or Me2SO (0.1%) was used. The influence of these drugs on TIMP-2 synthesis and degradation was evaluated by ELISA (see below) and trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described above under “Internalization Assay.” Analysis of gelatinolytic activities in supernatants and total cell extracts was performed by gelatin zymography. Test samples (10 μl) were mixed with equal volumes of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and directly subjected to electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. Gels were run at 10 mA, washed with 2% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and incubated in activation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3) for 16 h at 37 °C. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the gelatinolytic activities were detected as clear bands against a blue background. Samples of total cell extracts were analyzed using monoclonal antibody 2D7 directed against the hemopexin-like domain of MT1-MMP (kindly provided by P. Basset, Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France) as described previously (14.Maquoi E. Noël A. Frankenne F. Angliker H. Murphy G. Foidart J.-M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), except that the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Mini-Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell device (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was extracted from the cell monolayers by RNAzol B treatment (Biogenesis, Bournemouth, United Kingdom). An aliquot of RNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed on agarose gels containing 10% formaldehyde and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was hybridized with MMP-2, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2 cDNA probes labeled with 32P using random priming synthesis (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membrane was rehybridized to a human 28 S rRNA oligonucleotide probe (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), used as an internal control. The amounts of the different transcripts were quantified by densitometric analysis of autoradiographs of the Northern blots using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) equipped with Molecular Analyst software. All results were corrected for RNA loading as a function of the densitometric data obtained for the 28 S rRNA signals. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 concentrations in supernatants and total cell extracts were determined using sandwich ELISAs. TIMP-1 was measured by using a commercial kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. rTIMP-2 (see above) was used to raise polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) in rabbits and in embryonated chicken eggs (SM1 pAbs). The specific anti-rTIMP-2 IgGs from chicken were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (39.Jensenius J.C. Andersen I. Hau J. Crone M. Koch C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 46: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Rabbit pAbs were purified by affinity chromatography. Rabbit pAbs (diluted 1:750) were adsorbed onto Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Wells were subsequently saturated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of PBS supplemented with 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. Supernatants or total cell extract samples (50 μl) were added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with 200 μl of PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, 50 μl of the SM1 pAbs (diluted 1:200) were added for 1 h at 37 °C. The plate was again washed three times with 200 μl of PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, and 50 μl of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (diluted 1:10,000; Organon Teknica, Turnhout, Belgium) were added for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing with water, ABTS (750 mg/liter; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.004% H2O2substrates in ABTS buffer (pH 5.6) were added for 1 h at 37 °C. Absorbances were measured at 405 nm using an automated microtiter plate reader (Multiscan MS, Labsystems, Zellik, Belgium). The sensitivity of these ELISAs for TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were 1.25 and 0.3 ng/ml, respectively, and the concentration versus absorbance curve was linear in the 3.13–50 and 0.6–20 ng/ml ranges, respectively. Each sample was run in duplicate. Results were finally expressed in nanograms/well. Supernatant samples (1–2 ml) were loaded onto a 1 × 60-cm column of Superdex 75 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4) and 5 mm KI. A P60 pump (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted 2-ml fractions/min, which were subsequently counted in a γ-counter. To discriminate between the radioactivity peaks associated with free 125I and peptide-bound 125I, 1-ml aliquots from the gel-filtration low molecular mass peaks were loaded onto 1-ml Oasis columns (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) equilibrated with water. After a 2-ml wash with 5% ethanol, the bound material was eluted with 0.5 ml of 100% ethanol. The unbound fraction corresponds to the mixture of flow-through and wash eluates. In a previous study, we found that treatment of HT1080 cells with TPA or ConA stimulated the activation of pro-MMP-2 and induced a marked decrease in the TIMP-2 level in the culture medium.2Although the exact mechanism accounting for this lower TIMP-2 level is currently unknown, it could not be ascribed to a reduction of the TIMP-2 mRNA level. We therefore hypothesized that it might result from either the degradation or modification of the localization of the secreted TIMP-2. To investigate these hypotheses, we analyzed the fate of125I-rTIMP-2 (0.6 nm) added to HT1080 cells treated for up to 48 h with either TPA or ConA. Both culture supernatants and cell monolayers were collected at different times and subjected to SDS-PAGE and γ-counting, respectively (Fig.1). When 125I-rTIMP-2 was incubated in the absence of cells, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼21 kDa (Fig. 1 A), corresponding to the intact inhibitor. After reduction, this band migrated with a slightly higher apparent molecular mass, in agreement with the presence of six disulfide bonds, which maintain the tertiary structure of the molecule. When125I-rTIMP-2 was incubated in the presence of HT1080 cells, the intensity of the 21-kDa band decreased concomitantly with the appearance of an ad"

Recently we have shown for the first time that the humanMMP-1 gene is a p53 target gene subject to repression by wild type p53 (Sun, Y., Sun, Y. I., Wenger, L., Rutter, J. L., Brinckerhoff, C. E., and Cheung, H. S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 11535–11540). Here, we report that cotransfection of fibroblast-like synoviocytes with p53 expression and hMMP13CAT reporter plasmids revealed that (i)hMMP13, another member of the human MMP family, was down-regulated by wild type p53, whereas all six of the p53 mutants tested lost the wild type p53 repressor activity in fibroblast-like synoviocytes; (ii) this repression of hMMP-13 gene expression by wild type p53 could be reversed by overexpression of p53 mutants p53–143A, p53–248W, p53–273H, and p53–281G; (iii) the dominant effect of p53 mutants over wild type p53 appears to be a promoter- and mutant-specific effect. An intriguing finding was that p53 mutant p53–281G could conversely stimulate the promoter activity of hMMP13 up to 2–4-fold and that it was dominant over wild type p53. Northern analysis confirmed these findings. Although the significance of these findings is currently unknown, they suggest that in addition to the effect of cytokines activation, the gene expression of hMMP13 could be dysregulated during the disease progression of rheumatoid arthritis (or cancer) associated with p53 inactivation. Since hMMP13 is 5–10 times as active as hMMP1 in its ability to digest type II collagen, the dysregulation or up-modulation of MMP13 gene expression due to the inactivation of p53 may contribute to the joint degeneration in rheumatoid arthritis.

Gay R.E. Koopman W.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1993; 3: 141-155Google Scholar). The progressive destruction of articular cartilage in RA is partly mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (3.Martel-Pelletier J. McCollum R. Fujimoto N. Obata K. Cloutier J.M. Pelletier J.P.

Collagenase-1 (MMP-1), stromelysin (MMP-3), gelatinase A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) are all present at significantly elevated levels in cartilage, synovial membranes, and synovial fluid of patients with RA (5.Harris Jr., D.E.

Last K. Knauper V. Murphy G. Neame P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that MMP-13 may represent a particularly significant mediator of tissue destruction in arthritis. The p53 tumor suppressor gene has been implicated in the malignant progression of cancers, and the mutational inactivation ofp53 is the most frequent genetic alteration in human cancers. Recent studies have linked this powerful tumor suppressor to RA. It has been demonstrated independently by two groups that p53 protein is overexpressed in RA synovium and in synoviocytes cultured from RA patients (12.Firestein G.S. Nguyen K. Aupperle K.R. Yeo M.

Although wt-p53 can exert its repressive activity on many different genes, most mutants of p53 have lost this wt-p53 repressor activity. This repressive function has been correlated with the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis, whereas the loss of p53 repressive function results in decreased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli (26.Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor-derived p53 mutants can also transcriptionally activate a number of gene promoters, whereas wt-p53 inhibits the expression of the corresponding genes (27.Chin K.V. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Science. 1992; 255: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 28.Margulies L. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol.

Here we report that MMP-13, another member of the human MMP family, is also a p53 target gene subject to repression. All 6 of the p53 mutants tested have lost this wt-p53 repressor activity, and most of them are dominant over wt-p53 in the regulation of hMMP-13 gene expression.

The −1599 human MMP13 promoter/CAT reporter plasmid (hMMP13CAT) used in this study contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the transcriptional control of the hMMP13 promoter (32.Tardif G. Pelletier J.P. Dupuis M. Hambor J.E. Martel-Pelletier J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Wild type p53 and mutant p53 expression plasmids were obtained from Dr. A. J. Levine at Rockefeller University and have been described previously (1.Sun Y. Sun Y. Wenger L. Rutter J.L.

The −4327hMMP1 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid (hMMP1luci) contains the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of thehMMP1 promoter and has been described previously (1.Sun Y.

The reporter plasmid p53-luci, which contains the luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) plus tandem repeats of the consensus binding sequence for p53, was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The hMMP-13 probe was a 1900-base pairHindIII insert from a pGEM-T-MMP13 plasmid obtained from Dr. P. Mitchell at Pfizer Central Research. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was an 800-base pair HindIII insert from a pBS-GAPDH plasmid that contains a sequence encoding part of the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Canine fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were isolated by enzymatic dispersion of canine synovial tissues. Briefly, the tissues were minced and incubated with 1 mg/ml collagenase in serum-free DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C, filtered through a nylon mesh, extensively washed, and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After overnight culture, non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were cultivated in DMEM plus 10% FBS. Synoviocytes used were third to seventh passage cells. The Saos-2 cell line, a human osteosarcoma cell line containing no endogenous p53, was obtained from ATCC and propagated in McCoy's medium supplemented with 15% FBS. Transfections were performed either using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) or the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Exponentially growing FLS or Saos-2 were plated at a density of 5 × 105cells/well in 6-well cluster plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 2 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS (FLS) or 2 ml of McCoy's, 10% FBS (Saos-2) and grown until 80% confluent (24–36 h). The cells were then washed, placed in fresh OPTI-MEM I medium, and cotransfected with varying amounts of p53-expressing plasmid and 1.2 μg of hMMP13CAT reporter plasmid using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent or 4 μl of Superfect reagent per well as described in the figure legends. The parent vector (pCMV) without the p53 coding sequence was used as control and to maintain the total amount of DNA transfected constant. After 18 h, the cells were gently washed with DMEM and subsequently incubated with fresh DMEM or McCoy's containing 10% serum. The cells were harvested 24 h later by lysis with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and CAT activity was determined on a Packard 2200CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.) following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) and reported as counts/min. When p53-luci or hMMP1luci was used, cells were harvested, and extracts were assayed for luciferase activity on an EG & G Berthold Autolumat LB953 Rack Luminometer. Three transfections, each run in triplicate, were performed. The reporter activities were normalized relative to the amount of protein in the lysates as determined by using a protein assay kit from Pierce. We were unable to normalize to β-galactosidase activities as p53 represses the traditional viral promoters that drive expression of these reporters. However, in some experiments, 0.3–0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (Stratagene) was also included, and cells were stained with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-choro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, and 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6 in phosphate-buffered saline. We did not normalize reporter activities against the average percentage of cells stained blue as it gives results similar to normalizing to total protein (data not shown). Instead, we presented data as the average of the reporter activities normalized to total protein and corrected with the staining result (1.Sun Y. Sun Y. Wenger L. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11535-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and the relative promoter activity of hMMP-13 in the presence of wt-p53 or mutant p53 was calculated based on the level of promoter activity of hMMP-13 in the presence of pCMV. Saos-2 cells in 100-mm plates were transiently transfected with 18 μg of wt-p53 or mutant p53–175H- or p53–281G-expressing plasmid. After 18 h, fresh McCoy's medium containing 10% serum was added. The cells were harvested 24 h later, and total cellular RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and quantified by optical density. The total RNA samples (20 μg) were subjected to Northern blot analysis. After electrophoresis in MOPS electrophoresis buffer, the RNA was transferred in 10× SSC buffer by capillary action using a sponge. The RNA was fixed to the nylon membrane by ultraviolet light exposure with a Stratagene UV linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was prehybridized 2–4 h in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50% formamide. The filter was hybridized with random-primed 32P-labeled probes (Life Technologies, Inc.). After overnight hybridization at 42 °C in 6× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA, and 50% formamide, the membrane was washed twice in 1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice at 55 °C using 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The filters were autoradiographed with Kodak X-OMAT AR film for 24–72 h at −70 °C. The signal obtained from the Northern blots was normalized to the signal for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to correct for slight differences in RNA loading. Saos-2 cells in 60-mm plates were transiently transfected with 6 μg of wt-p53- or mutant p53-expressing plasmid, or empty vector, using 12 μl of Superfect transfection reagent. After 18 h, fresh McCoy's medium containing 10% serum was added. The cells were harvested 24 h later and subjected to Western blot analysis. The protein samples (5 μg) derived from p53 or pCMV-transfected cells were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were electrophoretically blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were preblocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h. This was followed by overnight incubation with monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) that binds to an amino-terminal epitope between amino acid residues 11 and 25 of wt and mutant p53 of human origin. The membrane was washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for 2 h. After the membrane was washed, immunolabeled bands were visualized with a color development solution containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. When FLS were cotransfected with hMMP13CAT reporter plasmid together with varying amounts of wt-p53 expression plasmid (pCMV-p53), a 4-fold reduction was observed in CAT activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1, open bars). Saos-2 cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line lacking endogenous p53 (33.Masuda H. Miller C. Koeffler H.P. Battifora H. Cline M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7716-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), were also used in the transfection assays as recipient cells. We observed up to a 10-fold reduction in CAT activity and up to an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity (p53-luci) when Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with −1599hMMP13CAT, p53-luci, and wt-p53 expression plasmid (Fig. 1,filled bars). As expected, most of the tumor-derived p53 mutants examined lost the wt-p53 activity to repress the promoter activity of hMMP13 (Fig.2 A). Of the six tumor-derived p53 mutants examined, five mutants, p53–143A, p53–175H, p53–273H, p53–280T, and p53–281G, lost this repression activity in both FLS and Saos-2 cells. The mutant p53–248W lost the wt-p53 repressor activity completely in SF cells and half in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 2 A). An intriguing finding was that the mutant p53–281G actually stimulated the promoter activity of hMMP13 up to 2–3-fold, and this stimulation was dose-dependent (Fig. 2 B). We next examined the hMMP13 mRNA levels following transfection of the Saos-2 cells with p53 expression plasmids. Fig.2 C shows that (i) the hMMP13 messenger could be detected in the human osteosarcoma cell line (lane 1), and (ii) the level of hMMP13 messenger RNA was suppressed slightly by transfected wt-p53 (lane 2) but up-modulated substantially by the p53 mutants p53–175H and p53–281G (lanes 3 and 4). The less significant repression ofhMMP-13 messenger by wt-p53 observed is probably due to low transfection efficiency. We cotransfected a fixed amount of wt-p53 with increasing amounts of mutant p53 expression plasmids together with hMMP13CAT. The repression of hMMP13CAT reporter activity by wt-p53 could be reversed by p53 mutants p53–143A, p53–248W, p53–273H, and p53–281G, indicating that certain p53 mutants indeed have a dominant effect over wt-p53 on the regulation of hMMP13 gene expression (Fig. 3 A). Increasing the ratio of mutant p53 to wt-p53 to 2-fold (in FLS) or to 7-fold (in Saos-2) produced a reversion up to 100% (Fig. 3,A and B). However, complete dominance of wt-p53 activity over mutants was observed for p53 mutants p53–175H and p53–280T, despite the 10-fold lower quantities of wt-p53 expression plasmid than mutated p53 expression plasmid used in cotransfection experiments (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the dominant effect of mutant p53 over wt-p53 and vice versa is due to the difference in the level of p53 protein expression, p53 protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.4, approximately equivalent amounts of protein were expressed in the cells transfected with wt-p53- or mutant p53-expression plasmids (lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, and8), although the amount of protein that was expressed in the cells transfected with p53–175H- and p53–280T-expression plasmids was about 30–35% less than that in cells transfected with wt-p53 expression plasmid (compare lanes 4 and 7 tolane 2). The amount of p53 protein was increased when more p53 expression plasmid was used (data not shown), and no p53 protein was detected in cells transfected with the empty vector pCMV (lane 1). Three independent transfections were performed, and similar results were obtained. Fig. 4 shows a representative result. The p53 mutants p53–143A, 175H, 280T, and 281G, which have been shown to lose wt-p53 activity to repress the promoter activity of hMMP1 (1.Sun Y. Sun Y. Wenger L. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11535-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), were tested to see whether they were dominant over wt-p53 in the regulation of the promoter activity of hMMP1 in Saos-2 cells. Results revealed that among the four p53 mutants only p53–281G was dominant over wt-p53 (Fig. 5 A). Complete dominance of wt-p53 over mutant was observed for p53 mutant p53–143A, p53–175H, and p53–280T, despite a 9-fold lower quantity of wt-p53 expression plasmid than mutated p53 expression plasmid used in cotransfection experiments (data not shown). Increasing the ratio of mutant p53–281G to wt-p53 to 3-fold produced a reversion of up to 100%, and the reversion was dose-dependent (Fig. 5 A). Further increasing the ratio of p53–281G to wt-p53 led to an induction of the promoter activity of hMMP1. However, the mutant p53–143A, which was dominant over wt-p53 in the regulation of the promoter activity ofhMMP13 (Fig. 3), lost its dominant effect completely in the regulation of the promoter activity of hMMP1 (Fig.5 A). These results indicate that the dominant effect of p53 mutants over wt-p53 and vice versa is a promoter- and p53 mutant-specific effect. To exclude the possibility that our observation is an artifactual effect, we cotransfected the cells with hMMP13CAT and hMMP1luci together with wt-p53 and mutant p53–143A expression plasmids. With the increase of the amount of p53–143A expression plasmid, the repression of hMMP13CAT by wt-p53 was gradually reversed, but the repression of hMMP1luci by wt-p53 was maintained (data not shown). The effect of p53 mutants was also tested with the p53-luci reporter construct. As expected, all six of the p53 mutants tested lost the ability to activate p53-luci almost completely (data not shown). When cotransfected with wt-p53 expression plasmid, a 35–65-fold activation of the reporter activity of p53luci was observed, and when cotransfected with the p53 mutants, a range from a 2-fold repression to a 2-fold activation was observed (data no shown). In addition, results revealed that reversion of the reporter activity of p53-luci activated by wt-p53 was observed for p53 mutants p53–143A (Fig. 5 B, circles), p53–273H (Fig. 5 B, reverse triangles), p53–280T (Fig. 5 B, diamonds), and p53–281G (Fig. 5 B, hexagons) indicating that the four mutants above have some dominant effect over wt-p53 protein in the transactivation of p53-luci. However, wt-p53 was completely dominant over p53–175H (Fig. 5 B, squares) and p53–248W (Fig. 5 B, triangles). Next, we cotransfected the Saos-2 cells with hMMP13CAT and p53-luci together with wt-p53 and mutant p53–280T expression plasmids. With the increase of the amount of p53–280T expression plasmid, the repression of hMMP13CAT by wt-p53 was maintained, but the activation of p53-luci by wt-p53 was gradually reversed (data not shown). These results further confirm that the dominant effect of p53 mutants over wt-p53 and vice versa is a promoter- and p53 mutant-specific effect. Numerous studies have indicated that changes in the synovial membrane in RA share common features with the process of tumor invasion (34.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Kleiner D.E.

The discovery that p53 is overexpressed in RA synovium and that the p53 gene in RA is abnormal further highlights the common features shared between RA synovial cells and cancer cells. Several recent studies have implied that p53inactivation in cancer cells might contribute to elevated MMP expression (45.Ozdemir E Kakehi Y. Okuno H. Habuchi T. Okada Y. Okada O. J. Urol. 1997; 158: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 46.Ioachim E.E. Athanassiadou S.E. Kamina S. Carassavoglou K. Agnantis N.J. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 1665-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Our data here show directly for the first time that hMMP13 is indeed a p53 target gene subject to repression and that mutant p53 either loses this repression activity or up-modulates the promoter activity of the hMMP13 gene. It has been reported that wt-p53 represses, whereas mutant p53 activates, transcription driven by the multidrug resistance gene, the human interleukin-6 gene, the human basic fibroblast growth factor gene, and c-MYC (27.Chin K.V.

Here we report another case where mutant p53 gains a function as it transactivates transcription, whereas wt-p53 represses transcription driven by the hMMP13 gene promoter. The activation of hMMP13 promoter by p53–281G suggests a possible direct interaction between p53–281G and the promoter that is currently under examination. hMMP13 was originally isolated from breast carcinoma (8.Freijie J.M. Diez-Itza I. Balbin M. Sanchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolovia J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773PubMed Google Scholar), and it has recently been found in some other tissues related to malignancy (47.Uria J.A. Balbin M. Lopez J.M. Alvarez J. Vizoso F. Takigawa M. Lopez-Otin C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 91-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 48.Johansson N. Airola K. Grenman R. Kariniemi A.L. Saarialho-Kere U. Kahari V.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 499-508PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been found in the synovium of RA and osteoarthritis patients, but the overall expression of MMP13was higher in RA synovium compared with osteoarthritis synovium (6.Lindy O. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T. Ding Y. Santavirta S. Ceponis A. Lopez-Otin C. Arthritis & Rheum. 1997; 40: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our findings that hMMP13 is a p53 target gene raises the possibility that the regulation of hMMP13 gene transcription by p53 might be an important regulatory mechanism ofhMMP13. The higher hMMP13 protein expression and accumulation in RA and in certain tumors could be attributed to the combined effects of the activation by cytokines/growth factors and the inactivation of negative regulator(s) of hMMP13 gene transcription, such as the p53 tumor repressor protein. Because up to 20–40% of p53 cDNA isolated from RA synovium has been found to harbor mutation (13.Firestein G.S. Echeverri F. Yeo M. Zvaifler N.J. Green D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10895-10900Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we asked whether wt-p53 or mutant p53 was clearly dominant. The configuration of one wild type and one mutated allele is a necessary intermediate step on the pathway toward complete loss of wt-p53 and possibly relevant to RA disease progression. The repression of hMMP13CAT reporter activity by wt-p53 could be reversed by most of the p53 mutants examined indicating that p53 mutants indeed have some dominant effect over wt-p53 on the regulation of hMMP13 gene expression. However, the complete dominance of wt-p53 over certain p53 mutants suggests that in certain cells both wt-p53 alleles must be lost for a complete loss of wt-p53 activity in the regulation of hMMP13 gene expression. Our results have shown that that the dominant effect of p53 mutants over wt-p53 and vice versa is a promoter- and mutant-specific effect. This promoter- and mutant-specific effect was further confirmed by cotransfection assays. We have cotransfected the cells with hMMP13CAT and hMMP1luci together with wt-p53 and mutant p53–143A expression plasmids or hMMP13CAT and p53luci together with wt-p53 and mutant p53–280T expression plasmids. With the increase of the amount of mutant p53 expression plasmid, the regulation of one of the two cotransfected promoter by wt-p53 was gradually reversed, whereas the regulation of the other promoter was maintained (data not shown). Therefore, only certain genes will be dysregulated if one wt-p53 allele is lost or mutated. These results indicated that the regulation of gene promoters by p53 and p53 mutants is much more complex than previously thought. The promoter-specific and mutant-specific effects suggest a direct regulation of the hMMP-13 and MMP-1promoters by p53 and its mutants. It also suggests that p53 mutants not only act to inactivate the wt-p53 and that a direct interaction between p53 mutant and the promoter may exist. Another interesting finding was that the reporter activity of p53-luci was increased further when low amounts of mutant p53 were cotransfected with wt-p53 (Fig. 5 B). This phenomenon suggests that the transcription complex formed by wt-p53 and mutant p53 at a ratio 1:1 has a higher transactivation activity than the transcription complex formed by wt-p53. One explanation for this observation is that p53 mutants inactivate the wt-p53 repressor activity more effectively than they inactivate the wt-p53 transactivation activity. Since the minimal promoter of p53-luci contains the luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) plus tandem repeats of the consensus binding sequence for p53, wt-p53 may transcriptionally regulate the minimal promoter of p53-luci through two mechanisms as follows: transactivation through binding to the consensus p53-binding sites, and repression through interfering with the binding basal transcription factors to the TATA motif within the minimal promoter of p53-luci (49.Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,50.Ragimov N. Krauskopf A. Navot N. Rotter V. Oren M. Aloni Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1183-1193PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription complex formed by wt-p53 and mutant p53 at a ratio 1:1 may have lost the wt-p53 repressor activity but still maintains most of the wt-p53 transactivation activity; therefore, the net effect is the further increase of the reporter activity of p53-luci. With the increase of the ratio of mutant p53 to wt-p53, the transactivation activity of wt-p53 was gradually reversed. Unlike the activation of gene expression, the mechanism of repression of gene expression by wt-p53 is not well defined. p53 can bind to the TATA-binding protein and repress its promoter activity (51.Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 52.Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Hokoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CCAAT-binding factor (54.Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), cAMP-response element-binding protein (55.Desdouets C. Ory C. Matesic G. Soussi C.B. Sobczak-Thepot J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and glucocorticoid receptors (56.Maiyar A.C. Phu P.T. Huang A.J. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 312-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A cis-acting element, G(G/C)AA(G/C)TGA, capable of mediating the down-regulation by p53 was mapped within the Rb promoter (57.Shiio Y. Yamamoto T. Yamaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5206-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Examination of the hMMP-13 promoter indicates that there are two sites (−378GGAAGTAA and −82GGAAGTGG) that closely match the sequence G(G/C)AA(G/C)TGA identified in the Rb promoter. In addition there is a p53 response element located in the −123 to −97 region of the hMMP13 promoter, a CCAAT box in −500 and AP-1 in −56. The potential role of these sites in the regulation ofhMMP13 by wt-p53 and mutant p53, especially p53–281G, is currently under examination in our laboratory. In recent years many genes that are believed to play an important role in RA pathogenesis have been shown to be down-regulated by p53 (1.Sun Y. Sun Y. Wenger L. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E.

Interestingly, within the handful of genes known to be activated by mutant p53, four of them are related to RA: human IL-6 (28.Margulies L. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15096-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human basic fibroblast growth factor (29.Ueba T. Nosaka T. Takahashi J.A. Shibata F. Florkiewicz R.Z. Vogelstein B. Oda Y.

Although the significance that p53 mutations cause the dysregulation of gene expression of hMMP13, hMMP-1, and other genes in the process of joint degeneration in RA is currently not clear, an association of overexpression of MMPs and synovial hyperplasia with the inactivation of p53 may exist and warrants further investigation.

Protistenk. 1995; 145: 221-230Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This protozoan is found in freshwater lakes and streams throughout the world, and is an intestinal parasite of humans and other mammals.Giardia has just two stages in its simple life cycle: a swimming trophozoite form, and an infective cyst form. The transformation of the trophozoite into the cyst is accompanied by the activation of gene transcription of cyst-specific genes (4.Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Giardia trophozoites have the unusual ability to switch the make-up of the major protein on its cell surface by varying the expression of a repertoire of genes encoding these variant-specific surface proteins (VSPs).1Although antigenic variation in Giardia is commonly thought to be a mechanism to evade the immune response of the host, the biological significance of VSPs in Giardia has not been determined (5.Nash T. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6.Nash T.E. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1997; 352: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The initiation of transcription is a key step in regulating gene expression and has been studied extensively in organisms ranging from yeast to man. Although results from these studies were presumed to be representative of all eukaryotes, little is known about this process in organisms lower than yeast on the evolutionary tree. In higher eukaryotes, the basal level of transcription by RNA polymerase II is dependent on the assembly of a set of general transcription factors on the core promoter which consists of either a TATA box, an initiator, or both (reviewed in Ref. 7.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). While the binding of the transcription factor TBP (TATA box-binding protein) to the TATA box has been well characterized, less is known about proteins which interact with the initiator. Since TBP is required for transcription from TATA-less promoters, it is possible that TBP can bind directly to the initiator, or alternatively, it is recruited indirectly to this region by its interaction with another protein which binds this motif (8.Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In some genes, additional factors and their specific recognition sites are used to modulate transcription regulation. For example, the mammalian β-globin and the histone H2B genes have an additional promoter element, called the CAAT box, located between 40 and 100 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site (reviewed in Ref. 9.La Thangue N.B. Rigby P.W.J. Hames B.D. Glover D.M. Transcription and Splicing, Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press, Oxford1988: 1-41Google Scholar). This element, with the consensus sequence GG(C/T)CAATCT, is bound by a family of transcription factors which up-regulate transcription of these genes. Since little information is available about promoter structure and function in lower eukaryotes, we were interested in determining the requirements of a “minimal” gene promoter in one of the lowest eukaryotes, G. lamblia. Furthermore, knowledge about the constitutive transcription of a housekeeping gene, such asGDH, would be a starting point for future studies on regulated gene expression, such as during the processes of encystation and antigenic variation in this medically important parasite. All transfection plasmids used were based on the constructs P11 and 3′Δ2 described previously (10.Yee J. Dennis P.P. J. Biol.

Plasmid 1 represents the P11 construct, a pGEM-3Zf(−) vector (Promega) carrying a 2.29-kb genomic DNA fragment from G. lamblia (Portland-1 isolate) that contains the entire coding region of the GDH gene (1350 bp) and its accompanying 5′ (820 bp) and 3′ (120 bp) flanking sequences. Plasmids 2–7 contain subcloned DNA fragments generated from P11, by either restriction enzyme digests or PCR amplification. Plasmids CWP-1 and -2 are pCR II-based vectors (Invitrogen) that contain the first 400 bp of coding region subcloned from constructs containing the full-length cyst wall protein genes (12.Lujan H.D.

Plasmid 3′Δ2N/H3 resulted from the removal of the 600-bp HindIII DNA fragment containing a portion of GDH 5′ noncoding region from 3′Δ2N. Further deletions of the GDH 5′ noncoding region from 3′Δ2N/H3 are contained within plasmids 5′Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, Δ5, Δ6, and Δ7. In NΔ2N, the DNA fragment containing the remaining 18 codons of the GDH gene in 3′Δ2N/H3 was removed. Deletion of the 5′ noncoding region in NΔ2N to 44 bp resulted in the plasmid 5′Δ5N. In Fig. 3, the unaltered sequence of the GDH 5′ noncoding region remaining in 5′Δ5N is shown on the top line. Constructs 2 to 10 were made by replacing this region (aHindIII/NcoI fragment) in 5′Δ5N with duplex oligonucleotides containing nucleotide substitutions within this sequence. These duplexes were generated by annealing different sets of complementary oligonucleotides that left overhanging HindIII and NcoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. The following procedure was adapted from one used for Trypanosoma (15.Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Giardia cultures were washed and concentrated to 3 × 108 cells/ml in buffer A (150 mm sucrose, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Each 400-μl sample was incubated for 5 min on ice followed by permeabilization with lysolecithicin (500 μg/ml, Sigma) for 1 min. The cells were washed twice and resuspended into 100 μl of buffer A at room temperature. An equal volume of transcription buffer (2× stock: 20 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 180 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 50 mm phosphocreatine, 1.2 mg/ml creatine kinase, 4 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 2 mm CTP, 1 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) was added and transcription was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature. After transcription, 600 μl of RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test “B,” Inc.) was introduced to each sample, and RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's directions. The recovered RNA was used immediately to probe slot blots containing fragments of the GDH gene and its 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. Giardia (P-1 isolate) were grown and prepared for electroporation as described previously (11.Yee J. Nash T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (50 μg) was added and the cells were immediately electroporated at 350 V, 1000 microfarads, and 720 Ω (low voltage setting on a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator 600). The cuvette was placed back on ice for 15 min before the cells were added to 15 ml of culture medium in a capped glass culture tube. Six hours after electroporation, lysates of the transfected cells were prepared as described previously (11.Yee J. Nash T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For each assay recorded (Turner TD-20e luminometer), 20 μl of the cell lysate supernatant was used along with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The relative luciferase activities listed under “Results” (as percentages of the values obtained in control transfections) are averages of at least six independent experiments and have standard deviations within 10% of the presented value. In every experiment, electroporation of each sample was performed in duplicate and each duplicate was assayed twice for luciferase activities. RNA was extracted fromGiardia cultures 6 h after transfection with plasmid 3′Δ2. Electroporations and RNA purification were performed as described above. A sample of the RNA (10 μg) was treated with 5 units of DNase I (amplification grade, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. The digestion was stopped by the addition of EDTA (2 mm) followed by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. A 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide, oJY-Luc/PE (sequence complementary to codons 6–13 of the luciferase gene), was hybridized to the DNase I-treated RNA and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and dNTPs (16.Newman A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3833-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resulting extension products were electrophoresed on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel alongside a DNA sequence ladder generated from the plasmid 3′Δ2 using the same oligonucleotide as a primer. Nuclear extracts were prepared from freshly harvested Giardia cultures using a modification of the procedure of Andrews and Faller (17.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar).Giardia was lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin) and by the addition of 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After incubation on ice for 10 min, a nuclear pellet was recovered by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 4 °C (12,000 rpm for 15 s in an Eppendorf centrifuge). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin), and incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional inversion of the sample tube. The extraction mixture was centrifuged for 4 min at 4 °C (12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge) and the extracted protein was recovered in the supernatant. The protein concentration of the extract was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The extract was divided into small aliquots, frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −70 °C. The nuclear protein preparation procedure was monitored by fluorescent dye staining (Hoechst 33258 dye diluted 1:1000 from a 1 mg/ml stock solution) of the Giardia nuclei at various stages during its isolation and extraction. The oligonucleotides used are shown in Fig. 4. Complementary oligonucleotides are labeled “a” for the plus strand and “b” for the minus strand. For duplex oligonucleotides, the two complementary oligonucleotides were added in equimolar amounts to a 200-μl volume of an annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl), heated in a 90 °C water bath for 5 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature over 1 h. Both single-stranded and double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The oligonucleotide duplex containing the yeast GAL4-binding site has the sequence: plus strand, TCGACGGAGTACTGTCCTCCG; minus strand, TCGACGGAGGACAGTACTCCG. The oligonucleotide duplex containing the adenovirus E1B TATA box has the sequence: plus strand, CTAGAGGGTATATAATGCGCCAGCT; minus strand, GGCGCATTATATACCCT. Both these oligonucleotide duplexes were gifts from I. Sadowski. A 245-bp HindIII-SacI fragment containing theGDH sequence from −223 to +21 was cloned into a pGEM3Zf(−) vector (Promega). A 51-bp fragment containing the minimal promoter region of the GDH gene was prepared from the pGEM clone by using oligonucleotides 1b and 2a (see Fig. 4) as primers in a PCR amplification reaction. The primers were annealed at 50 °C and extended at 72 °C for 30 cycles in a 100-μl reaction. The 51-bp PCR product was gel purified and its sequence was checked by direct sequencing using the CircumVent thermal cycle dideoxy DNA sequencing kit (New England Biolabs). The fragment was radiolabeled by the substitution of half the total concentration of either dATP or dCTP with [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dCTP, respectively, in the PCR amplification. For radiolabeling purposes, amplification was performed for 15 cycles in a 25-μl reaction. The radiolabeled GDH fragment was gel purified prior to use. Transcription of RNA in vitro was from the 245-bpHindIII/SacI fragment cloned into the pGEM vector described above. The pGEM clone was linearized at the EcoRI site in the polylinker and transcription was initiated at the SP6 promoter by the addition of nucleotide triphosphates and SP6 RNA polymerase. The RNA was radiolabeled by the incorporation of [α-32P]CTP. The DNA template was removed after transcription by treatment with RQ1-RNase-free DNase (Promega) and the RNA was gel purified prior to use. Poly(dI-dC), poly(dA), and poly(dT) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Binding reactions contained 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 3–5 μg of nuclear extract protein, and 0.02–0.05 pmol of radiolabeled probe in a 20-μl volume of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). In competition experiments, all components, including probe and competitor DNA, were pre-mixed before the final addition of the protein extract. In the studies on single-stranded DNA binding, the poly(dI-dC) was first heated at 100 °C and cooled quickly on ice prior to its addition to the binding reaction. The reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min. A 5% polyacrylamide gel was pre-electrophoresed for 1–2 h at 200 V in 0.5 × TBE, 1% glycerol with a replacement of fresh running buffer prior to sample loading. Samples were loaded onto the gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 150 V for 1.5–2 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed (10% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 30 min), dried onto filter paper, and subjected to autoradiography. The binding reactions using oligonucleotides 1a/b and 2a/b as probes were scaled up 5-fold and performed in duplicates. After incubation on ice, samples were subjected to UV irradiation by a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (5-ns pulse at 266 nm, 60 mJ/pulse; Quanta-Ray, GCR14). One set of each duplicate reaction was subjected to electrophoresis through a standard band shift gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to autoradiography and gel slices corresponding to the shifted bands on the autoradiograph were removed. The gel slices were placed in the sample wells of a discontinuous 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with the remaining set of UV-treated binding reactions and a molecular weight marker. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography as described above. To examine transcription of the Giardia GDHgene contained within a 2.2-kb genomic DNA fragment, we developed a nuclear run-on assay in this organism by adapting a procedure used for Trypanosomes (15.Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this procedure, Giardia cells were permeabilized and newly synthesized RNA was pulsed-labeled by the addition of [α-32P]UTP. The RNA was extracted and used to probe slot blots containing different segments of the 2.2-kb genomic fragment (Fig. 1), all of which detect only the GDH locus in Southern blot hybridizations ofGiardia genomic DNA. Strong hybridizations were obtained to DNA fragments containing the GDH coding region (fragments 1, 2, and 6) and a portion of its associated 3′-noncoding sequence (fragment 7). In contrast, no hybridizations were observed for noncoding sequences beyond 6 bp upstream of the GDHtranslation start codon (fragments 4 and 5) except for weak hybridization to a DNA fragment located 200 bp further upstream (fragment 3) which corresponds to a portion of an open reading frame encoding an uncharacterized gene. The negative controls consisting of genes for two Giardia cyst wall proteins, CWP1and CWP2, and two empty cloning vectors, pGEM and pCRII, showed no hybridizations while the positive control rRNAshowed the strongest hybridization. In order to use Giardia transfections to identify theGDH promoter, we needed to ensure that transcription initiation from plasmids transfected into Giardia is the same as that from its endogenous genes. We examined the 5′ ends of RNA transcribed from the transfected plasmid 3′Δ2 (11.Yee J. Nash T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) which uses theGDH 5′-flanking sequence to drive the expression of a luciferase reporter. RNA was extracted from the cells after transfection and an oligonucleotide specific to the luciferase portion of the transcript was annealed and extended using reverse transcriptase (data not shown). The sizes of extension products obtained indicate that transcription from the transfected construct initiates at the same major site as that determined previously for the endogenousGDH gene (10.Yee J. Dennis P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7539-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To map promoter activity within the GDH 5′-flanking sequence, effects on luciferase activity from deletions of this region contained on expression plasmids were measured in transfected cells (Fig. 2). Only minor effects on luciferase activity were observed when the 5′-flanking sequence was deleted to within 44 bp of the translation start codon (5′Δ5). However, luciferase activity decreased dramatically if deletions extended beyond this point (5′Δ6 and 5′Δ7), and dropped further to background levels if the 5′-flanking sequence was completely eliminated (5′Δ2). Removal of the small amount of GDH coding region remaining (18 codons) in the transfection constructs (NΔ2N and 5′Δ5N) did not affect luciferase activity significantly. The upstream sequence of the GDH gene, containing the 44-bp region identified in the deletion analysis, was aligned against similar regions from other Giardia genes reported in the GenBank data base (data not shown). An A/T-rich region, varying from 10 to 16 nucleotides in length, was found in all sequences in the alignment with the exception of the variant specific antigen genes. The A/T-rich element contains the transcription initiation site in genes which have been transcript mapped and overlaps frequently with the putative translation start codon in all genes examined. A second motif, present in single or multiple copies on either DNA strand, is located upstream of, and occasionally overlaps with, the AT-rich element. We referred to this motif as the g-CAB element, for the Giardia CAT box, and its consensus sequence is CAnT, where n ≥ 3. Nucleotide substitutions were made on the 5′Δ5 plasmid (Fig.3, line 1) to determine whether the g-CAB and the AT-rich elements have promoter function in vivo and to identify other promoter elements within the minimal 44-bp sequence. Results obtained from Giardia transfected with these mutant constructs showed that substitutions within a TATA box-like sequence, located between the AT-rich and the g-CAB element (line 3) have no significant effect on luciferase activity; while alterations to the g-CAB element (line 2) have a slight effect on luciferase activity. In contrast, alterations within the AT-rich element (line 9) resulted in a marked reduction of luciferase activity. This reduction was observed even when alterations to this element were limited to nucleotides that are not sites for transcription initiation (line 10). Surprisingly, luciferase activity also decreased when the order of nucleotides within this element was changed (line 8) although the A/T content remained the same as the wild type sequence. Mutations to an AG-dinucleotide, located between the g-CAB and the AT-rich element, also caused a decrease in luciferase activity (line 4), but mutations to another AG-dinucleotide further downstream (line 5) did not. When alterations to the g-CAB element and the upstream AG-dinucleotide were combined in the same mutant construct (line 7), the decrease in luciferase activity was greater than that obtained with alterations to either motifs alone (line 2 and 4). To investigate whether the minimal promoter region contains binding sites for transcription factors, a 51-bp PCR fragment encompassing this region was amplified from a larger cloned fragment of theGDH upstream sequence to use as a probe in band shift assays (Fig. 4). When the radiolabeled PCR fragment was incubated with proteins from a Giardia nuclear extract, two shifted complexes, called C1 and C2, were observed (Fig.5 A). The C1 complex is initially observed at low protein concentrations and C2 appears as the protein concentration increases. The protein-binding sites on the 51-bp fragment were localized by using short oligonucleotide duplexes that span this region in band shift assays (Fig. 4). The oligonucleotide duplex 1a/b represents the region of the GDH sequence between −7 and +10, and contains the AT-rich element. The oligonucleotide duplex 2a/b represents the region of the GDH sequence between −25 and −41, and contains the g-CAB element. Lastly, the oligonucleotide duplex 3a/b represents the region (−8 to −24) between the two motifs and contains the first AG-dinucleotide. The oligonucleotide duplexes 1a/b and 2a/b, containing the AT-rich and the g-CAB elements, respectively, were able to compete for protein binding to the 51-bp fragment while the oligonucleotide duplex containing the region between the two motifs did not compete (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, addition of duplex oligonucleotides containing either the binding site for the yeast GAL4-binding site (G4-a/b) or the adenovirus EIB TATA-box (E1B-a/b) did not compete for protein binding to the 51-bp fragment (data not shown). To investigate further the sequence specificity of protein binding to the 51-bp fragment, oligonucleotides were constructed to contain mutations to the g-CAB and the AT-rich element which were found to cause a reduction in luciferase activity in Giardiatransfections (Fig. 3). When an oligonucleotide duplex was made to contain alterations to the AT-rich element (as in line 8 of Fig. 3), this altered duplex (1*a/b) could not compete for protein binding (Fig.5 B). Similarly, when the g-CAB element was changed (as in line 2 of Fig. 3), the altered oligonucleotide duplex (2*a/b) could not compete for protein binding (Fig. 5 B). To examine directly the protein binding ability of the AT-rich and the g-CAB elements, the oligonucleotide duplexes 1a/b and 2a/b containing each of these motifs were radiolabeled and incubated with nuclear protein extracts (Fig. 5 C). On a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, both probes in the presence of nuclear extract exhibited a complex with retarded mobilities relative to the mobility of the free probes. Surprisingly, both oligonucleotide duplexes can also cross-compete with each other with approximately equal affinities while oligonucleotide duplex 3a/b which contains the region between the two motifs could not compete for protein binding. This observation suggested that the two duplex probes, containing the AT-rich and the CAAAT element, respectively, bind to the same protein or proteins in the nuclear extract. The size of the protein bound to each probe was analyzed by UV cross-linking (Fig. 5 D). Duplicates of the binding reactions with probes 1a/b and 2a/b were subjected to UV irradiation and one set of each reaction was subjected to electrophoresis through a standard band shift gel. The major shifted band that was observed with each probe were cut out separately from the gel and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with the remaining set of UV-treated binding reactions. The autoradiograph of this SDS-polyacrylamide gel showed that the major shifted band from both oligonucleotide probes migrated at the same molecular mass of approximately 68 kDa (Fig.5 D). A band of this molecular weight was also apparent in the unfractionated binding reactions. In a control experiment, gel slices of the complexes were cut from band shift gels of identical binding reactions that were not cross-linked. The DNA recovered from these gel slices was subjected to electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Only bands representing the free probes were observed in the autoradiograph of this gel (data not shown). To determine whether the 68-kDa protein can also bind single-stranded DNA, a series of experiments was performed using single-stranded oligonucleotides as either probes or competitors in band shift assays (Fig. 6). When the single-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes in band shift assays, both plus and minus strands containing the AT-rich element (1a and1b) and the minus strand of the g-CAB element (2b) could bind proteins (Fig. 6 A). Although we assumed that the complexes observed previously with the duplex oligonucleotide probes represented binding of the 68-kDa protein to the double-stranded DNA, it is possible that the protein was bound to single-stranded DNA melted from the duplexes. To investigate this possibility, oligonucleotide 2a, which could not bind protein was radiolabeled and annealed to the unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide 2b which could bind protein (Fig. 6 A). After annealing, this mixture was subjected to electrophoresis through a 20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel beside a sample of radiolabeled 2a. Examination of the autoradiograph obtained from this gel revealed that >90% of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide 2a when mixed with 2b was in the duplex form (data not shown). When this mixture was used in the band shift assay, no radiolabeled complex was observed (Fig.6 B, 2a·/b). In the complimentary experiment with the duplex probe containing unlabeled oligonucleotide 2a and radiolabeled oligonucleotide 2b, a radiolabeled complex was observed (Fig. 6 B, 2a/b·). Thus, the 68-kDa protein appears to bind single-stranded oligonucleotide 2b and 2b derived from the 2a/b dupl"

Both ERK and p70S6k were phosphorylated in response to the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and the activation was rapid, transient, and preceded increased p21 expresion under defined conditions where serum was present.

Multiple signaling pathways have been shown to influence both p53 activation and p21 expression. Recently, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), members of the mitogen activated kinase (MAPK) family, which typically are activated by mitogens and are associated with a proliferative response, have been shown to influence diverse cell functions including differentiation (20.Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), apoptosis (21.Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell.

In vascular tissue, MAPK pathways were shown to mediate either proliferative or growth inhibitory responses in human arterial smooth muscle cells, depending on the availability of downstream targets (24.Bornfeldt K.E.

In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, ERK activation mediated by nerve growth factor was implicated in the induction of p21 and subsequent inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity, outlining a pathway where ERK activity was involved in an anti-proliferative effect (25.Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, some studies (26.Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Song X. Sheppard H.M. Norman A.W. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1677-1682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have linked ERK activation to the subsequent phosphorylation of p53, which as noted above can activate p21 and lead to an anti-proliferative effect.An important component of the proliferative response initiated by mitogens often associated with MAPK activation is the activity of p70S6k/p85S6k, ubiquitous kinases derived from alternative splicing of a common gene and shown to have multiple targets leading to diverse responses (28.Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29.Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin.

The concerted activation of MAPK and p70S6k has been noted in many hormonally activated pathways leading to growth, but there is little information regarding the relationship between these kinases and anti-proliferative responses. A few studies have noted that NO can activate MAPK in selected cell types (32.Callsen D. Pfeilschifter J. Brune B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4852-4858PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T.

Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). There is little data available characterizing a pathway linking NO and p70S6k. The present study defines conditions in rat adventitial fibroblasts where an NO donor activates both ERK activity and p70S6k, the relationship between these kinases is examined with respect to the effects of cGMP-mediated events, and a novel dependence upon p70S6k activation in the NO-induced increase in p21 expression is described.RESULTSCharacterization of ERK and p70S6k Activation by SNAPThe effect of SNAP on the activation of ERK and S6K was examined using standardized conditions where quiescent, subconfluent cells were incubated for 15 h with 10% FCS to ensure most cells were in the cell cycle, and then the cells were exposed to 100 μmSNAP for between 5 min and 4 h. As Western blot analysis shows in Fig. 1 A, both ERK and p70S6k were activated transiently by SNAP, with a maximal response for both kinases at approximately 15 min. The bar graph in the lower portion of Fig. 1 Asummarizes results for three separate experiments and indicates the maximal activation of p70S6k (15–30 min) may lag slightly behind that for ERK activation (5–15 min). In the bar graph, densitometric analysis of the smaller detectable band for each kinase was performed routinely (ERK, 42 kDa; p70S6k, 70 kDa) since those bands were more readily and reproducibly detected by Western blot analysis than the heavier moieties. The acute response to SNAP was dose-dependent between 10 and 500 μm (Fig. 1 B) and activation of both kinases occurred in response to SNAP even when 10% FCS was removed prior to SNAP addition (Fig. 1 C), although the time course for activation was more rapid, with a maximal response consistently found to be about 5 min for both kinases.To determine if the response of the cells to SNAP following incubation in 10% FCS for 15 h was mediated by a mechanism involving NO-induced increases in cGMP, cells were pretreated with cPTIO, a substance known to scavenge NO selectively. Alternatively, cells were pretreated with ODQ, a drug known to selectively inhibit soluble guanylate cyclase, the enzyme activated directly by intracellular NO. Both substances completely blunted the response to SNAP, whereas if PDGF were added using conditions comparable to those used for SNAP, the anticipated activation of both ERK and p70S6k were observed, yet neither cPTIO nor ODQ effected this response (Fig.2 A). In separate experiments (data not shown) cPTIO or ODQ added separately had no effect on the low basal activity of either ERK or p70S6k, and an alternate NO scavenger, hydroxocobalamin, also suppressed the response to SNAP. Addition of either 8-bromo-cyclic GMP or dibutyryl cAMP also activated both enzymes, and did so at concentrations as low as 1.0 μm (Fig. 2 B). To further define the putative cGMP dependent step, Raf-1 activation was measured in response to SNAP, PDGF, and the selective inhibitors of PKG (Fig. 2 C). Raf-1 is a kinase located upstream of ERK which is acted upon by divergent signaling pathways that ultimately activate ERK. SNAP did activate Raf-1, with peak stimulation at 5 min (data not shown), and this effect was blocked in the presence of eitherR p-8-Br-cGMPS or KT5823, inhibitors of either the regulatory or catalytic domains of PKG (R p-8-Br-cGMPS (G) and KT5823 (K), respectively), whereas the activation of Raf-1 by PDGF was unaffected by the PKG inhibitors. Thus, the data suggested that NO initiated an acute activation of ERK and p70S6k through a pathway requiring generation of cGMP and activation of PKG. To assess the role of specific kinases activated by either cAMP or cGMP, specific inhibitors of both classes of enzymes were added prior to SNAP addition. Inhibitors of PKG (R p-8-Br-cGMPS (G) and KT5823 (K)) suppressed the activation of both ERK and p70S6k, whereas inhibitors of PKA (H89 (H) andR p-8-Br-cAMP (A)) had no effect in the response to SNAP (Fig. 2 D). To ensure the specificity and efficacy of the inhibitors used in the experiments of Fig. 2, C andD, we treated the cells with isoproterenol, which was anticipated to activate CREB, a PKA-sensitive transcription factor. CREB and the related protein ATF-1, which both were immunoreactive to the phospho-CREB antibody used, were phosphorylated in response to isoproterenol (Fig. 2 E). That response was attenuated by treatment with either H89 or R p-8-Br-cAMP, but was unaffected by addition of the PKG inhibitors. The effects of the inhibitors were statistically significant when the experiments were performed three separate times (Fig. 2 E).Figure 2Role of cyclic nucleotides on activation of ERK , p70S6k, and Raf-1. A, following pretreatment of quiescent cells with 10% FCS for 15 h, ODQ (1 μm), or cPTIO (10 μm) were added 30 min prior to SNAP (100 μm) or PDGF (20 ng/ml). After 15 min in 10% FCS, cell lysates were extracted and immunoblotting assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented is representative of at least three independent experiments.B, following incubation in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h, cells were transferred to a serum-free medium for 30 min and then untreated or treated with different concentrations of either 8-Br-cGMP or dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2-cAMP) as indicated for 5 min. Data shown inA and B are representative of several individual experiments performed either in serum-free medium or in 10% FCS.C, following incubation in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h, cells were treated with 100 μm SNAP or 20 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min after pretreatment for 30 min with specific inhibitors of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. The PKG inhibitors used were 25 μm R p-8-Br-cGMP (G) and 1 μm KT5823 (K). The PKA inhibitors used were 25 μm R p-8-Br-cAMP (A) and 3 μm H89 (H). The cell lysates were extracted and immunoblotting assays was performed using anti-phosphorylated Raf-1. The data shown is representative of two independent experiments.D, following incubation in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h, cells were treated with 100 μm SNAP for 15 min after pretreatment for 30 min with specific inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases exactly as described above.

The concentrations of PKG and PKA inhibitors used were the same as those in C and D. Nuclear extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibody against CREB only when activated by phosphorylation at Ser133.

When either wortmannin or LY-294002, both inhibitors of PI3K, or rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of the p70S6k, but not the p90Rsk, were added at appropriately low concentrations, there was a selective inhibition of the phosphorylation of the 70-kDa isoform, but not the p85S6k in response to SNAP (Fig. 3 B). However, ERK activation was only affected by wortmannin and LY-294002, but not by rapamycin, which acts on an intermediate responsible for p70S6k activation, rather than PI3K or the p70S6k itself (38.Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar).Figure 3Role of wortmannin and rapamycin on the activation of ERK and p70S6k. A, following incubation in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h, cells were treated with 100 μm SNAP for 15 min following preincubation with the designated concentration of PD98059 for 30 min.B, following incubation in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h, cells were treated with 100 μm SNAP for 15 min following preincubation with the designated concentration of 100 nm wortmannin (W), 25 μm LY294002 (LY), or 10, 5, or 1 nm rapamycin (R) as indicated. For the experiments shown in A andB, ERK and p70S6k were assayed as described above from whole cell extracts and each immunoblot is representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since the data suggested a role for ERK in the activation of p70S6k, direct evidence for an association between those proteins induced by PDGF or SNAP was attempted using immunoprecipitation techniques (Fig. 4,A and B). Antibodies against p70S6k(for Fig. 4 A) or ERK (for Fig. 4 B) were used for immunoprecipitation of extracts from untreated cells or those treated with PDGF (Fig. 4 A) or SNAP (Fig. 4 B). Subsequent Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed clearly that the ERK42 was associated with p70S6k following PDGF addition, and the 70-kDa isoform of p70S6k was associated with ERK following SNAP addition, whereas considerably weaker signals for either enzyme were obtained in untreated cells. In separate experiments, the immunoprecipitating antibody and that used for Western blot analysis were reversed for experiments with either PDGF or SNAP, and the results were comparable to those shown in Fig. 4, A and B(data not shown). Thus, the data implicated ERK activation as a prerequisite for the activation of p70S6k by PDGF or SNAP, and suggested that the subsequent effects of SNAP on p21 expression may be mediated through a mechanism requiring activated p70S6k.Figure 4Evidence for the SNAP-induced association between the kinases. A, following incubation in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with serum-free medium for 30 min. Where indicated, cells were then treated for 5 min with 20 ng/ml PDGF. The cell lysates were prepared and an aliquot (600 μg of total) was immunoprecipitated with anti-total p70S6kantibody and Western blot analysis was performed on the resuspended immunoprecipitate using the phospho-specific antibodies for either p70S6k (upper panel) or ERK (lower panel). Lane 5, the same amount of cell lysate from PDGF-treated cells was immunoprecipitated with beads only without addition of anti-total p70S6k antibody to examine the specificity of coprecipitation. A separate aliquot of the cell lysate (25 μg) was directly analyzed for either p70S6k(upper) or ERK (lower) by Western blot.B, following incubation in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h, cells were treated with 100 μm SNAP for 15 min and an aliquot of the cell lysates (50 μg) subsequently analyzed for either p70S6k (upper left) or ERK (lower left) by Western blot. The remaining extract (800 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with anti-total ERK antibody and Western blot analysis was performed on the resuspended immunoprecipitate using the phospho-specific antibodies for either p70S6k (upper right) or ERK (lower right). The band labeledIgG (HC) in A (upper panel) and B (upper right) refers to the rabbit IgG heavy chain detected by the anti-rabbit p70S6kantibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Relationship between ERK and p70S6k Activation and the Subsequent Induction of p21Effect of Cyclic Nucleotides on p21 Protein ExpressionTo determine if the induction of p21 protein by SNAP was dependent upon either cGMP or cAMP, the experiments summarized in Fig.5 were performed. Either ODQ or the inhibitors of PKA and PKG suppressed SNAP-induced protein expression both at the level of protein, as shown in Western blot analysis (Fig.5 A) or, consistent with data in our previous study (5.Gu M. Brecher P. Arterioscler Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), steady-state mRNA levels using Northern blot analysis (Fig.5 A). When analogues of cGMP and cAMP were added to the cells (Fig. 5 B), p21 protein expression was increased, which also was consistent with data in our previous study (5.Gu M. Brecher P. Arterioscler Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of PKG and PKA inhibitors or cyclic nucleotides on p21 induction. Cells were incubated with 10% FCS for 15 h. A, cells were preincubated with either 50 μm R p-8-Br-cGMP, 50 μm R p-8-Br-cAMP, or 1 μm ODQ for 30 min, and then treated with 100 μm SNAP for 4 h in the medium containing 10% FCS. p21 protein and p21 mRNA level were determined by Western and Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inhibition of SNAP-induced p21 expression by PKA and PKG inhibitors, and by ODQ is shown in the representative images and statistically in the bar graph at the bottom ofA, summarizing results from three separate experiments. *,p < 0.05, significantly different from the control; †, p < 0.05, significantly different from the samples treated with SNAP. B, cells were treated with 10 or 100 μm of either 8-Br-cGMP or dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2-cAMP) for 4 h. Cell extracts were obtained and p21 protein was measured. Results shown are representative of four similar experiments indicating significant increases in p21 protein in response to either cyclic nucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The effect of either ERK or p70S6k activation on SNAP-induced p21 expression also was examined using both Western and Northern blot analysis by pretreating cells with PD98059 prior to SNAP addition (Fig. 6) or rapamycin (Fig.7). The increase in p21 protein was attenuated by the ERK inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 A), but SNAP-induced changes in p21 steady state mRNA levels were unaffected by this drug (Fig. 6 B). Data in Fig. 7 shows the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on both p21 protein and mRNA induced by SNAP, even when rapamycin was added at the low concentrations (1–5 nm) consistent with a specific inhibition of p70S6k activity (38.Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of either protein kinase G or p70S6k prevented SNAP from increasing both p21 mRNA and protein, whereas inhibition of ERK only affected post-transcriptional effects on p21.Figure 6Effect of PD98059 on SNAP-mediated p21 induction. Cells were incubated in the presence of 10% FCS for 15 h.

Both protocols showed that rapamycin addition essentially completely suppressed the phosphorylation of p53 (Fig. 8 A) and the enhanced DNA binding activity induced by SNAP (Fig. 8 B) without affecting the total p53 level (Fig. 8 A).

https://openalex.org/W2075169074,"A genetic strategy was developed for the isolation of a mutant strain of Azotobacter vinelandii that exhibits in vivo nitrogenase activity resistant to inhibition by acetylene. Examination of the kinetic features of the altered nitrogenase MoFe protein produced by this strain, which has serine substituted for the α-subunit Gly69 residue, is consistent with other studies that indicate the MoFe protein normally contains at least two acetylene binding/reduction sites. The first of these is a high affinity site and is the one primarily accessed during typical acetylene reduction assays. Results of the present work indicate that this acetylene binding/reduction site is not directly relevant to the mechanism of nitrogen reduction because it can be eliminated or severely altered without significantly affecting nitrogen reduction. Elimination of this site also results in the manifestation of a low affinity acetylene-binding site to which both acetylene and nitrogen are able to bind with approximately the same affinity. In contrast to the normal enzyme, nitrogen and acetylene binding to the altered MoFe protein are mutually competitive. The location of the α-Ser69 substitution is interpreted to indicate that the 4Fe-4S face of the FeMo cofactor capped by the α-subunit Val70 residue is the most likely region within FeMo cofactor to which acetylene binds with high affinity.

It catalyzes the MgATP-dependent reduction of nitrogen (N2), protons, and a variety of triply bonded substrates, including acetylene (1.Burris R.H. Hardy R.W.F. Bottemely F. Burns R.C.

Burris R.H. Evans H.J. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman & Hall, New York1991: 685-735Google Scholar). During catalysis, the Fe protein delivers electrons one at a time to the MoFe protein in a process that requires hydrolysis of two MgATP for each electron transfer event (3.Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1997; 30: 260-266Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that electrons are initially delivered from a [4Fe-4S] cluster located within the Fe protein to an [8Fe-7S] “P cluster” (4.Peters W.P. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis M.S. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) contained within the MoFe protein. Intramolecular electron transfer then occurs from the P cluster to a [7Fe-9S-Mo-homocitrate] cluster called FeMo cofactor (5.Burgess B.K. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1377-1406Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because FeMo cofactor has been identified as providing the substrate reduction site (6.Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6737-6744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its structure and reactivity has received considerable attention (7.Dance I. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 581-586Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8.Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2965-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 9.Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem.

Of particular interest to our laboratories is the contribution of the FeMo cofactor polypeptide environment toward its ability to bind and effect the reduction of various substrates. In previous work we gained insight about the functioning of nitrogenase by characterizing an alteredAzotobacter vinelandii MoFe protein for which the α-subunit His195 residue was substituted by glutamine (11.Kim C.-H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This altered MoFe protein does not significantly reduce nitrogen (11.Kim C.-H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) but is still able to reduce acetylene and does so with essentially unaltered kinetic parameters. Even though nitrogen cannot serve as an effective substrate for the α-Gln195 MoFe protein, it remains a potent inhibitor of both acetylene and proton reduction. The major conclusion from this previous work was that nitrogen and acetylene compete for occupancy of a common or shared site. This interpretation is complicated, however, by other observations. First, in the case of the normal MoFe protein, acetylene is a noncompetitive inhibitor of nitrogen reduction, whereas nitrogen is a competitive inhibitor of acetylene reduction (12.Dilworth M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13.Rivera-Ortiz J.H. Burris R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 537-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Hwang J.C.

J. 1978; 173: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as a MoFe protein altered by amino acid substitution (17.Shen J. Dean D.R. Newton W.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) indicates that there are two acetylene-binding sites located within the MoFe protein. In light of these observations we became interested in determining if it is possible to obtain a MoFe protein that is altered in its ability to reduce acetylene but remains capable of normal nitrogen reduction.DISCUSSIONAn explanation of the effect of the α-Ser69substitution on the ability of the altered MoFe protein to reduce acetylene can be considered in the context of previous work. First, Davis et al. (15.Davis, L. C., Henzl, M. T., Burris, R. H., and Orme-Johnson, W. H. (1979) Biochemistry 4860–4869Google Scholar) report evidence for the presence of high affinity and low affinity acetylene-binding sites on theClostridium pasteurianum nitrogenase enzyme. TheK m they report for the low affinity acetylene-binding site (0.23 ± 0.1 atm) is similar to the one reported here for the α-Ser69 MoFe protein (0.14 ± 0.01 atm). Second, EPR studies by Lowe et al. (16.Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were interpreted to indicate the presence of two binding sites for acetylene on the MoFe protein from Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, we previously reported that substitution of the α-Arg277 residue by histidine elicits CO-induced cooperativity of acetylene binding to the altered MoFe protein (17.Shen J. Dean D.R. Newton W.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, there is clear evidence that at least two acetylene binding sites are located within the MoFe protein. In the case of the α-Ser69 MoFe protein, the high affinity acetylene-binding site appears to have been eliminated or severely altered without significantly altering the capacity of the altered enzyme to reduce nitrogen. Also, the remaining low affinity acetylene binding site in the α-Ser69 MoFe protein does not appear to be significantly altered, maintaining a K m value similar to the value previously reported by Davis et al. (15.Davis, L. C., Henzl, M. T., Burris, R. H., and Orme-Johnson, W. H. (1979) Biochemistry 4860–4869Google Scholar) and a V max that is only slightly less than the value derived for wild-type MoFe protein (Table II).Elimination of the high affinity acetylene-binding site by the α-Ser69 substitution can be considered in light of the FeMo cofactor structure and its polypeptide environment (Fig.3 a). This structure has a central prismatic waist of six Fe atoms, each of which is ligated to three sulfides in a nearly trigonal planar geometry. These six Fe atoms are arranged such that three pairs of Fe atoms are shared at the intersection of three geometrically identical 4Fe-4S faces within the FeMo cofactor (Fig. 3 b). The α-Gly69 residue is located immediately adjacent to the α-Val70 residue that caps one of the 4Fe-4S faces of FeMo cofactor. These two residues are located near the end of a short helix that is positioned between the P cluster and FeMo cofactor. We propose that the high affinity acetylene-binding site is provided by the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 and that the α-Ser69 substitution results in movement of α-Val70 so that the high affinity acetylene-binding site is no longer accessible. An alternative interpretation that invokes either a kinetic or electronic explanation for the effect of the α-Ser69 substitution on acetylene reduction is probably not reasonable. The basis for this conclusion is that reduction of nitrogen to ammonia requires six electrons, whereas reduction of acetylene requires only two electrons. Thus, any kinetic or electronic perturbation that impairs acetylene reduction is also expected to impair nitrogen reduction, yet the α-Ser69MoFe protein is not significantly impaired in its ability to reduce nitrogen. For this reason and because there is no apparent perturbation in the S = 3/2 EPR signal of the α-Ser69 MoFe protein when compared with the wild type, it is also unlikely that a global rearrangement in the polypeptide environment of FeMo cofactor has been elicited by the α-Ser69 substitution.Our interpretation of the reciprocity in the competitive inhibition of nitrogen and acetylene reduction exhibited by the α-Ser69MoFe protein is that the low affinity acetylene-binding site and the nitrogen-binding site are the same. For simplicity, this site is hereafter referred to only as the “nitrogen binding” site. If the 4Fe-4S face of FeMo cofactor that is capped by α-Val70provides the high affinity acetylene-binding site, where is the nitrogen binding site? Our results do not provide a definitive answer to this question. Nevertheless, based on the results described here and results previously obtained with an altered MoFe protein having the α-His195 MoFe protein substituted by glutamine, we argue that this site is probably provided by the same 4Fe-4S face that is capped by α-Val70. Inspection of the FeMo cofactor polypeptide environment shows that the ε imidazole nitrogen of the α-His195 residue is hydrogen-bonded to a central sulfide that is a member of the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 ( Ref. 37.Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Substitution of α-His195 by glutamine results in an altered MoFe protein that can bind nitrogen with normal affinity but does not significantly reduce it (11.Kim C.-H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the α-Gln195 MoFe protein is unaltered in its ability to either bind or reduce acetylene, so the high affinity acetylene-binding/reduction site must remain intact. An important observation is that the α-Gln195 MoFe protein cannot significantly reduce nitrogen, yet nitrogen remains an effective competitive inhibitor of acetylene reduction. Thus, acetylene cannot be bound and reduced at the high affinity site when nitrogen is bound to the active site. A simple working model that explains this situation is that the nitrogen binding site overlaps with the high affinity acetylene-binding site, both of which are located within the same 4Fe-4S face of FeMo cofactor. It should be noted, however, that we have no data to show that the binding of acetylene at the high affinity site necessarily prevents binding of nitrogen. Thus, although the nitrogen-binding site appears to overlap with the high affinity acetylene-binding site, it is not established that the converse is true. For reasons described below, the presence of a nitrogen binding site that overlaps with both the high affinity and low affinity acetylene binding sites within the same 4Fe-4S face is a model we favor. Nevertheless, other possibilities that explain the available data have not been excluded. For example, because certain Fe and S molecules are shared between adjacent 4Fe-4S faces provided by FeMo cofactor (Fig. 3), binding of a substrate at one face could, in principle, prevent binding of a second molecule at an adjacent face.We consider the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 an attractive candidate for providing the physiologically relevant substrate-binding site for three other reasons. First, α-Val70 is located at the end of a short helix that is directly connected to the P cluster through the cluster coordinating α-Cys62 residue (Fig. 3). This helix provides a potential through-protein route for electron transfer directly from the P cluster to the FeMo cofactor. Second, the P cluster is known to undergo a redox-dependent structural rearrangement that could be coupled to electron or proton transfer to the FeMo cofactor (4.Peters W.P. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis M.S. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 38.Lanzilotta W.N. Christiansen J. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11376-11384Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The short helix that spans from the P cluster to the FeMo cofactor is an ideal candidate for providing communication between the two cluster types. For example, slight movement of α-Val70 residue as a consequence of events occurring at the P cluster could play an important role in the correct positioning of substrate for reduction (Fig. 3 a). From this perspective it is interesting that the amino acid sequence between and including α-Cys62 to α-Val70 is among the most highly conserved primary sequences among all known MoFe proteins. The conservation in primary sequence of this segment also extends to the corresponding region from the alternative nitrogenases (39.Joerger R.D. Loveless T.M. Pau R.N. Mitchenall L.A. Simon B.H. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3400-3408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this context it is interesting to note that the residue within the VFe protein corresponding to α-Gly69 from the MoFe protein is substituted by a leucine. The VFe protein also exhibits aK m for acetylene binding that is approximately 10 times higher than for the MoFe protein (40.Eady R.R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Arguments made for a possible functional role for the α-Val70 residue in nitrogenase catalysis can also be made for the α-Arg96residue. The α-Arg96 residue is hydrogen-bonded to the same FeMo cofactor 4Fe-4S face capped by the α-Val70(Fig. 3 c). This residue is also connected by a short helix to the α-Cys88 residue, which provides a bridging ligand to the two subcluster fragments of the P cluster. Whether or not either or both of these residues directly participate in catalysis, the 4Fe-4S face they approach is distinguished from the two other 4Fe-4S faces in its potential for communication with the P cluster. Third, of the three 4Fe-4S faces provided by FeMo cofactor, the richest source of potential proton donors necessary for substrate reduction is found in proximity to the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 (Fig. 3,a and c). Such potential proton donors include α-His195, α-Arg96, and a pool of water molecules organized around the α-carboxylate group of homocitrate.In summary, substitution of the MoFe protein α-Gly69residue by serine results in elimination of a high affinity acetylene-binding site located within the MoFe protein. This substitution also eliminates the nonreciprocity in the mutual inhibition patterns of acetylene and nitrogen reduction exhibited by the wild type protein. The location of the α-Ser69substitution leading to the acetylene-resistant phenotype indicates that the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 is a likely candidate to provide the high affinity acetylene-binding site. We believe that the genetic approach described here should also prove useful for the evaluation of the binding of other nitrogenase substrates and inhibitors. Nitrogenase is composed of two component proteins designated the Fe protein and the MoFe protein. It catalyzes the MgATP-dependent reduction of nitrogen (N2), protons, and a variety of triply bonded substrates, including acetylene (1.Burris R.H. Hardy R.W.F. Bottemely F. Burns R.C. A Treatise on Dinitrogen Fixation, Sections I and II: Inorganic and Physical Chemistry and Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 569-604Google Scholar, 2.Yates M.G. Stacey G. Burris R.H. Evans H.J. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman & Hall, New York1991: 685-735Google Scholar). During catalysis, the Fe protein delivers electrons one at a time to the MoFe protein in a process that requires hydrolysis of two MgATP for each electron transfer event (3.Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1997; 30: 260-266Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that electrons are initially delivered from a [4Fe-4S] cluster located within the Fe protein to an [8Fe-7S] “P cluster” (4.Peters W.P. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis M.S. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) contained within the MoFe protein. Intramolecular electron transfer then occurs from the P cluster to a [7Fe-9S-Mo-homocitrate] cluster called FeMo cofactor (5.Burgess B.K. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1377-1406Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because FeMo cofactor has been identified as providing the substrate reduction site (6.Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6737-6744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its structure and reactivity has received considerable attention (7.Dance I. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 581-586Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8.Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2965-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 9.Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 10.Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 335-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to our laboratories is the contribution of the FeMo cofactor polypeptide environment toward its ability to bind and effect the reduction of various substrates. In previous work we gained insight about the functioning of nitrogenase by characterizing an alteredAzotobacter vinelandii MoFe protein for which the α-subunit His195 residue was substituted by glutamine (11.Kim C.-H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This altered MoFe protein does not significantly reduce nitrogen (11.Kim C.-H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) but is still able to reduce acetylene and does so with essentially unaltered kinetic parameters. Even though nitrogen cannot serve as an effective substrate for the α-Gln195 MoFe protein, it remains a potent inhibitor of both acetylene and proton reduction. The major conclusion from this previous work was that nitrogen and acetylene compete for occupancy of a common or shared site. This interpretation is complicated, however, by other observations. First, in the case of the normal MoFe protein, acetylene is a noncompetitive inhibitor of nitrogen reduction, whereas nitrogen is a competitive inhibitor of acetylene reduction (12.Dilworth M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13.Rivera-Ortiz J.H. Burris R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 537-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Hwang J.C. Chen C.H. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Second, kinetic and spectroscopic evidence obtained using the unaltered MoFe protein (15.Davis, L. C., Henzl, M. T., Burris, R. H., and Orme-Johnson, W. H. (1979) Biochemistry 4860–4869Google Scholar,16.Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) indicates that there are two acetylene-binding sites located within the MoFe protein.

Eady R.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, we previously reported that substitution of the α-Arg277 residue by histidine elicits CO-induced cooperativity of acetylene binding to the altered MoFe protein (17.Shen J. Dean D.R.

Thus, any kinetic or electronic perturbation that impairs acetylene reduction is also expected to impair nitrogen reduction, yet the α-Ser69MoFe protein is not significantly impaired in its ability to reduce nitrogen. For this reason and because there is no apparent perturbation in the S = 3/2 EPR signal of the α-Ser69 MoFe protein when compared with the wild type, it is also unlikely that a global rearrangement in the polypeptide environment of FeMo cofactor has been elicited by the α-Ser69 substitution. Our interpretation of the reciprocity in the competitive inhibition of nitrogen and acetylene reduction exhibited by the α-Ser69MoFe protein is that the low affinity acetylene-binding site and the nitrogen-binding site are the same. For simplicity, this site is hereafter referred to only as the “nitrogen binding” site. If the 4Fe-4S face of FeMo cofactor that is capped by α-Val70provides the high affinity acetylene-binding site, where is the nitrogen binding site? Our results do not provide a definitive answer to this question. Nevertheless, based on the results described here and results previously obtained with an altered MoFe protein having the α-His195 MoFe protein substituted by glutamine, we argue that this site is probably provided by the same 4Fe-4S face that is capped by α-Val70. Inspection of the FeMo cofactor polypeptide environment shows that the ε imidazole nitrogen of the α-His195 residue is hydrogen-bonded to a central sulfide that is a member of the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 ( Ref. 37.Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Substitution of α-His195 by glutamine results in an altered MoFe protein that can bind nitrogen with normal affinity but does not significantly reduce it (11.Kim C.-H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the α-Gln195 MoFe protein is unaltered in its ability to either bind or reduce acetylene, so the high affinity acetylene-binding/reduction site must remain intact. An important observation is that the α-Gln195 MoFe protein cannot significantly reduce nitrogen, yet nitrogen remains an effective competitive inhibitor of acetylene reduction. Thus, acetylene cannot be bound and reduced at the high affinity site when nitrogen is bound to the active site. A simple working model that explains this situation is that the nitrogen binding site overlaps with the high affinity acetylene-binding site, both of which are located within the same 4Fe-4S face of FeMo cofactor. It should be noted, however, that we have no data to show that the binding of acetylene at the high affinity site necessarily prevents binding of nitrogen. Thus, although the nitrogen-binding site appears to overlap with the high affinity acetylene-binding site, it is not established that the converse is true. For reasons described below, the presence of a nitrogen binding site that overlaps with both the high affinity and low affinity acetylene binding sites within the same 4Fe-4S face is a model we favor. Nevertheless, other possibilities that explain the available data have not been excluded. For example, because certain Fe and S molecules are shared between adjacent 4Fe-4S faces provided by FeMo cofactor (Fig. 3), binding of a substrate at one face could, in principle, prevent binding of a second molecule at an adjacent face. We consider the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 an attractive candidate for providing the physiologically relevant substrate-binding site for three other reasons. First, α-Val70 is located at the end of a short helix that is directly connected to the P cluster through the cluster coordinating α-Cys62 residue (Fig. 3). This helix provides a potential through-protein route for electron transfer directly from the P cluster to the FeMo cofactor. Second, the P cluster is known to undergo a redox-dependent structural rearrangement that could be coupled to electron or proton transfer to the FeMo cofactor (4.Peters W.P. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis M.S. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 38.Lanzilotta W.N. Christiansen J. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11376-11384Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The short helix that spans from the P cluster to the FeMo cofactor is an ideal candidate for providing communication between the two cluster types. For example, slight movement of α-Val70 residue as a consequence of events occurring at the P cluster could play an important role in the correct positioning of substrate for reduction (Fig. 3 a). From this perspective it is interesting that the amino acid sequence between and including α-Cys62 to α-Val70 is among the most highly conserved primary sequences among all known MoFe proteins. The conservation in primary sequence of this segment also extends to the corresponding region from the alternative nitrogenases (39.Joerger R.D. Loveless T.M. Pau R.N. Mitchenall L.A. Simon B.H. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3400-3408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this context it is interesting to note that the residue within the VFe protein corresponding to α-Gly69 from the MoFe protein is substituted by a leucine. The VFe protein also exhibits aK m for acetylene binding that is approximately 10 times higher than for the MoFe protein (40.Eady R.R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Arguments made for a possible functional role for the α-Val70 residue in nitrogenase catalysis can also be made for the α-Arg96residue. The α-Arg96 residue is hydrogen-bonded to the same FeMo cofactor 4Fe-4S face capped by the α-Val70(Fig. 3 c). This residue is also connected by a short helix to the α-Cys88 residue, which provides a bridging ligand to the two subcluster fragments of the P cluster. Whether or not either or both of these residues directly participate in catalysis, the 4Fe-4S face they approach is distinguished from the two other 4Fe-4S faces in its potential for communication with the P cluster. Third, of the three 4Fe-4S faces provided by FeMo cofactor, the richest source of potential proton donors necessary for substrate reduction is found in proximity to the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 (Fig. 3,a and c). Such potential proton donors include α-His195, α-Arg96, and a pool of water molecules organized around the α-carboxylate group of homocitrate. In summary, substitution of the MoFe protein α-Gly69residue by serine results in elimination of a high affinity acetylene-binding site located within the MoFe protein. This substitution also eliminates the nonreciprocity in the mutual inhibition patterns of acetylene and nitrogen reduction exhibited by the wild type protein. The location of the α-Ser69substitution leading to the acetylene-resistant phenotype indicates that the 4Fe-4S face capped by α-Val70 is a likely candidate to provide the high affinity acetylene-binding site. We believe that the genetic approach described here should also prove useful for the evaluation of the binding of other nitrogenase substrates and inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2127205368,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a member of the thrombospondin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. All members of the family contain a highly conserved region of thrombospondin type 3 sequence repeats that bind calcium. A mutation in COMP previously identified in a patient with pseudoachondroplasia resulted in abnormal sequestration of COMP in distinctive rER vesicles. The mutation, Asp-446 → Asn, is located in the type 3 repeats of the molecule. This region was expressed in a mammalian culture with and without the mutation to study the structural or functional properties associated with the mutation. The biophysical parameters of the mutant peptide were compared with those of the wild type and revealed the following difference: secondary structural analysis by circular dichroism showed more α-helix content in the wild-type peptides. The calcium binding properties of the two peptides were significantly different; there were 17 calcium ions bound/wild-type COMP3 peptide compared with 8/mutant peptide. In addition, wild-type COMP3 had a higher affinity for calcium and bound calcium more cooperatively. Calcium bound by the wild-type peptide was reflected in a structural change as indicted by velocity sedimentation. Thus, the effect of the COMP mutation appears to profoundly alter the calcium binding properties and may account for the difference observed in the structure of the type 3 domain. Furthermore, the highly cooperative binding of calcium to COMP3 suggests that these type 3 sequence repeats form a single protein domain, the thrombospondin type 3 domain.

Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the other four members of the gene family, COMP is an oligomer composed of identical subunits (2.Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The chains associate at the N terminus through a coiled-coil domain. Assembly of the oligomer requires the formation of an α-helical coiled-coil domain that is later stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds (3.Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy shows the COMP molecule to be composed of five flexible arms with a large globular domain at the end of each arm and often described as being bouquet-like in its appearance (4.Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TSP 3 and 4 also form pentamers (4.Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Qabar A. Derick L. Lawler J. Dixit V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2809-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas TSP 1 and 2 are trimeric molecules (2.Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The TSP family members have in common the domain structure typified by the oligomerization domain, three or four epidermal growth factor domains (EGF), and an invariant number of thrombospondin type 3 sequence repeats considered as seven or eight domains, the number depending on how the amino acid sequence is aligned (2.Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A comparison of TSP 1, 2, 3, and 4 with COMP sequence reveals a high degree of conservation in the type 3 repeats. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the TSP family members is distinctive, although somewhat complementary and occasionally overlapping (7.Tucker R.P. Adams J.C. Lawler J. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). COMP was originally discovered in cartilage extracts and has been immunolocalized to developing as well as mature cartilage (8.Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg A. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Fife R.S. Brandt K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 506-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). COMP has also been found within and around the tendon (10.DiCesare P. Hauser N. Lehman D. Pasumarti S. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). There are no known human pathologies associated with the thrombospondin family members with the exception of COMP. In the last few years COMP mutations have been identified in two dominantly inherited skeletal disorders: pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). These osteochondrodysplasias result from base substitutions, deletions, or additions in the COMP gene. PSACH is characterized by a disproportionate short stature and joint laxity. Manifestations of PSACH usually first appear at the onset of walking with a distinctive waddling gait. MED patients generally present with debilitating hip pain in childhood. Short stature maybe observed later in childhood. The radiological abnormalities of MED are restricted to the epiphyses, whereas there is additional involvement of the metaphyses and the spinal column in patients with PSACH. Patients with both disorders manifest symptoms of precocious osteoarthritis. Another extracellular matrix component of cartilage, type IX collagen, has also been implicated in MED. This form of MED (EDM2) was mapped to chromosome 1p32, and the locus was identified as the COL9A2. Mutations have been identified in COL9A2 (11.Muragaki Y. Mariman E.C. van Beersum S.E. Perala M. van Mourik J.B. Warman M.L. Olsen B.R. Hamel B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A third MED locus has recently been mapped to COL93A, and a mutation was identified (12.Paassilta P. Lohiniva J. Annunen S. Bonaventure J. Le Merrer M. Pai L. Ala-Kokko L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1036-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). There seems to be a growing consensus that the phenotypes of the MED patients with known type IX collagen mutations are less severe than those with COMP mutations (12.Paassilta P. Lohiniva J. Annunen S. Bonaventure J. Le Merrer M. Pai L. Ala-Kokko L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1036-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, there is a variation in the severity of symptoms within families of a known single mutation creating a complex genetic or physiological explanation. Unlike MED that can result from mutations in one of three genes, PSACH is only associated with mutations in the COMP gene. The mutations in COMP associated with PSACH and MED predominantly occur within the thrombospondin type 3 repeats, the region proposed to bind calcium (13.Deere M. Sanford T. Ferguson H.L. Daniels K. Hecht J.T. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 80: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14.Cohn D.H. Briggs M.D. King L.M. Rimoin D.L. Wilcox W.R. Lachman R.S. Knowlton R.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 785: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presumed importance of calcium binding to the biological function of COMP is largely based on studies of TSP 1 demonstrating that calcium binding occurs in a cooperative manner and protects against proteolysis (15.Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16.Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No structural information is known about these type 3 repeats. This region contains 17 cysteines and a large number of acidic residues; it also contains 13 putative EF hands. The structural conformation of these repeats therefore is expected to be highly sensitive to the presence of calcium (17.Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the Asp-446 → Asn mutation on these sequence repeats, we have expressed wild-type and mutant peptides in a mammalian cell culture system. Earlier biochemical methods to isolate COMP from cartilage have demonstrated the importance of cationic interactions. COMP was selectively extracted using the cationic chelator EDTA (4.Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that COMP is secured in the cartilage matrix through cationic interactions and further demonstrates the potential importance of calcium binding and the effect of a mutation at one of these sites. A second cation, zinc, has been proposed to promote COMP interactions with collagen types I and II (18.Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This interaction occurs between the collagen triple helical domains and the globular C terminus of COMP. The interactions of these two cartilage matrix components, COMP and type II collagen, suggest a crucial biological function of COMP. In comparison, there is very little information on ligands that form molecular interactions with the type 3 repeats of COMP. The fate of a COMP molecule in PSACH has been established for the Asp-446 → Asn mutation: COMP is sequestered inside the rER vesicles (19.Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It was also determined in this study that type IX collagen was found in these vesicles as well. The stored material is organized into a lamellar pattern of alternating electron dense and lighter layers with COMP and type IX localizing to the more dense layers (19.Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Earlier studies of aggrecan have also shown it to be present in the enlarged rER vesicles (20.Stanescu V. Maroteaux P. Stanescu R. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1982; 138: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21.Stanescu V. Stanescu R. Maroteaux P. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1984; 66: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast to these cartilage macromolecules, type II collagen is secreted and assembled into the extracellular matrix of PSACH cartilage (19.Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The secretory pathways for aggrecan and type II collagen differ (22.Vertel B.M. Velasco A. LaFrance S. Walters L. Kaczman-Daniel K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and presumably the pathway for aggrecan is shared by COMP and type IX collagen. These investigations present a complex scenario where mutations in COMP cause a gross accumulation of cartilage-specific macromolecules. Assuming that the wild-type allele is transcribed and translated at approximately the same rate as the one containing the mutation, then probability suggests that 97% of the molecules will contain one or more mutant polypeptide chains. However, it is not known if the mutant chains fold properly and are subsequently assembled into COMP pentamers. Also unknown is whether the mutant molecules interact with other cartilage components retained in the rER (i.e.aggrecan and type IX collagen) in a specific manner or if the secretion of the aberrant molecule is retarded, potentially causing nonspecific aggregation. In this report, we describe the specific structural consequences of the mutation in the thrombospondin type 3 domain. Primary chondrocytes were isolated as described previously from PSACH patient cartilage (19.Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and cultured for up to eight passages. The region containing the TSP type 3 repeats was amplified following reverse transcription of total RNA (Life Technologies, Inc., Superscript Preamplification Kit) using a forward primer that contained anNheI cleavage site (5′-agtagctagctggtcgcgacactgacctagac-3′), whereas the reverse primer contained an NotI site (3′-ccpgagaacgctgaagtcacgtaggcggccgcatttgata-5′). The resulting polymerase chain reaction bands were gel-purified and ligated into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). One wild-type clone and one carrying the PSACH mutation were selected following cDNA sequence analysis of the plasmids. These COMP3 cDNA fragments were excised from the pCRII sequencing vector with NheI andNotI and ligated into the respective cloning site in the expression vector pCEPSP-rF17H (23.Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This vector was derived from plasmid pCEP4 (Invitrogen) and engineered to contain the signal sequence of BM40 for secretion of the peptide into the extracellular medium (24.Mayer U. Pöschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The pCEP-COMP3 expression vectors were cultured in DH52 cells and DNA-isolated under sterile conditions. For stable episomal expression, human embryonic kidney cells (293-EBNA cells, Invitrogen) were transfected with the pCEP-COMP3 constructs in the presence of calcium chloride (25.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Selection antibiotics Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc., G418) and hygromycin-B (Calbiochem) were added to the cell culture medium 48 h after transfection at a concentration of 500 μg/ml. The concentration of antibiotics was reduced to 250 μg/ml following an additional 48 h. Serum-free medium was collected and tested for the presence of the COMP3 peptides using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel band was identified as COMP3 by N-terminal sequencing following transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (the first ten residues were APLAGRDTDLD). The COMP3 peptide starts with APLA, the C terminus of the signal sequence; the remainder of which is removed following processing and secretion. Medium from the cultured cells was collected and fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The COMP3 peptides remained in the 60% ammonium sulfate supernatant following precipitation and centrifugation. After dialysis into 20 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, the supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m in the same buffer. Pooled fractions containing the COMP3 peptides were further separated by molecular sieve chromatography on a Superose-12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the COMP3 peptide in 10 mm MOPSO, pH 6.8, was analyzed in the presence and absence of 5 mmcalcium chloride at 5 °C. The spectra was recorded between 260 and 180 nm on a Jasco J-500A or Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter using thermostatted cells for temperature. Secondary structural analysis was determined using a variable selection method (26.Compton L.A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal.

Tertiary structure was analyzed by velocity sedimentation in a sucrose gradient (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 5–20% sucrose). Peptide solutions at concentrations of 10 μm were prepared in the presence of either 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA tetrasodium. The centrifugation was performed for 20 h at 56,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman L80M ultracentrifuge using an SW 60Ti rotor. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated as described previously (28.Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7637-7646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the COMP3 peptide was assessed by equilibrium sedimentation using a Spinco Model E centrifuge (Beckman) at 17,000 rpm at 20 °C in double sector cells (29.Zeng B.

The COMP molecule is composed of five identical polypeptide chains and within each chain is a linear arrangement of domains or repeated domains (Fig. 1 A). The Asp-446 → Asn mutation previously characterized in a PSACH patient (19.Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A.

Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), COMP3 peptides were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (293-EBNA cells). The first step of protein purification was ammonium sulfate fractionation of the cell culture medium followed by column chromatography. The COMP3 peptides remained in solution at 60% saturation (Fig. 1 B). Following dialysis of the ammonium sulfate supernatant, the peptides were further purified by cation exchange and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2, A andB). Rotary shadowed images of COMP molecules indicate that the arms are flexible rods that connect the “stalk” of the bouquet (the coiled-coil domain) to the globular domain (4.Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These arms are composed of 4 EGF-like and type 3 repeats. It is presumed that EGF-like repeats form small globular domains that are aligned linearly from the solution structural determination of a pair of EGF-like domains (34.Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It is not known what the type 3 repeat structures are or how they are organized relative to one another. From the data presented here (Fig.3 A), COMP3-Wt peptides appear to be short rods with an average length of 14.2 nm ± 1.68 (n = 28). This measurement is consistent with that based on the rotary shadowed images of native COMP molecules. The reported distance between the coiled-coil and the middle of the globular domain of a full-length COMP subunit is 28.6 nm (4.Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 4 EGF-like domains would be ∼12 nm based on the structural measurements of one EGF-like domain in human factor IX (35.Baron M. Norman D.G. Harvey T.S. Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Tse A.G. Brownlee G.G. Campbell I.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This would leave 16.4 nm for the TSP type 3 repeats and half of the terminal globule based on these reported molecular measurements. Thus, the length of the COMP3-Wt peptide at 14.2 nm is structurally consistent with the native wild-type COMP domains. The COMP3-Mu peptides were shorter with an average length of 10.3 nm ± 1.68 (n = 35; Fig. 3 B). Whereas the size of these peptides is small and near the limit of resolution of the rotary shadow technique, the measured differences between COMP3-Wt and -Mu are supported by additional measurable variations between the two species of peptides. It is likely that the mutation affected the overall structure of COMP3-Mu. Differences in secondary structure were observed in circular dichroism spectra between peptide populations in the presence and absence of calcium (Fig.4 A). Analysis of the spectra indicates that the differences were notable in the loss of helical structure and an increase in the antiparallel β-sheets in COMP3-Mu compared with COMP3-Wt peptides (see TableI). The change in the secondary structure was directly coupled to the presence of calcium. Titration experiments with calcium showed a cooperative structural change for both peptides (Fig. 4 B). However these experiments did not allow the determination of the number of binding sites; therefore we measured calcium binding by equilibrium dialysis (see below).Table ISecondary structure analysis of COMP3 peptidesStructureH%A%P%T%O%Total %RMSECOMP92802341100<0.20COMP + Ca102022839100<0.34Mutant92702341100<0.20Mutant + Ca62322741100<0.20CD analysis of COMP3 peptide at 5 °C in MOPSO.

The molecular weights of COMP3-Wt and -Mu peptides were measured by sedimentation equilibrium in a model E analytical ultracentrifuge. The solutions showed monodisperse species with molecular masses of 31,260 ± 170 Da for COMP3-Wt and 30,780 ± 100 Da COMP3-Mu (data not shown). The partial specific volume was calculated from the amino acid composition and found to be 0.678 cm3/g (36.Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and the degree of hydration was estimated to be 0.3 g/g. A comparison of the measured molecular weights with the molecular mass determined from the amino acid sequence (28,632 Da) indicates that the COMP3 peptides have little or no post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation). The slightly higher molecular weight of the COMP3-Wt peptides could be a reflection of more bound calcium (see below). The COMP3 peptides were analyzed for shape by centrifugation in 5–20% sucrose gradients in the presence and absence of calcium (Fig.5). Sedimentation coefficientss 20,w in the absence of calcium were 2.5 ± 0.1 S and 2.7 ± 0.1 S for the wild-type and mutant peptide, respectively. In the presence of calcium the sedimentation coefficient of the wild-type peptide changed to 2.8 ± 0.1 S, whereas the mutant peptide showed no change ins 20,w value. The increase ins 20,w of 2.5 to 2.8 for COMP3-Wt peptides indicates a significant change in the frictional ratio upon binding of calcium. This would be consistent with an earlier study of thrombospondin 1 that demonstrated an elongation of the subunit “arms” in the presence of EDTA (37.Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J.H. Chao F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3762-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the determined sedimentation coefficient and molecular weight of COMP3-Wt and assuming the degree of hydration is 0.3 ml/g, the frictional ratio is 1.38 in the presence of calcium. This frictional ratio indicates that the hydrodynamic dimensions of the wild-type COMP3 peptide are 15.0 × 2.1 nm for a prolate ellipsoid or 13.4 × 1.8 nm for a rod. The measured length of the rotary shadowed image of the wild-type peptide, 14.2 nm, is consistent with these calculations. One important but speculative function of the type 3 domains in the thrombospondin family is to bind calcium. COMP3 peptide solutions were dialyzed against concentrations of calcium chloride ranging from 50 μm to 2 mm. A small amount of radiolabeled calcium was added for quantitative purposes. The free and protein-bound calcium concentrations were calculated for several experiments using protein concentrations that varied from 1.6 to 10.3 μm (Fig.6). The resulting plot indicated that the number of bound calcium molecules/molecule was much lower for the COMP3-Mu peptides (8 compared with 17 for COMP3-Wt). The Hill coefficient, a measure of the cooperativity of the binding curve, showed COMP3-Wt bound calcium in a more cooperative manner (3.74versus 1.57 for mutant COMP3). Also, the concentration at half saturation was 102 and 218 μm for wild-type and mutant peptide, respectively. Data presented here show the first measurable consequence that relates a mutation in COMP to a molecular mechanism involved in generating the PSACH phenotype. This consequence is an altered potential for mutant COMP peptides to bind calcium. The secondary and tertiary structures are quantitatively affected by the reduced calcium binding. Most mutations in COMP are clustered within the type 3 repeats in the skeletal dysplasias PSACH and MED; presumably other COMP mutations alter molecular structure in a similar way. The calcium binding data indicate a very complex scenario with a large number of potential binding sites and a highly cooperative mechanism for binding. The primary structure of the type 3 repeats conforms to the consensus sequence of the EF-hand motif, a common structure associated with calcium-binding proteins. Sites contain a stretch of amino acids represented by X, Y, Z, -X, -Y, -Z that provide coordinating oxygens for calcium-ligand interactions in a distinctive geometry. There are up to 13 such sites in the type 3 repeats that share homology with the EF-hand structure (16.Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) compared with 17 calcium ions shown to bind the COMP3 peptides here. The difference suggests that the COMP3 peptide forms a more complex structure than that represented by linear repeated sequences. The 17 potential binding sites determined for the COMP3 peptides are also higher than that previously calculated for TSP I where 35 ± 3 ions of calcium bound one trimeric TSP I molecule (15.Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which is approximately 12 calcium ions per polypeptide. One of these 12 is assumed to be bound to the EGF-like repeat with the consensus sequence of a calcium binding EGF domain; the COMP domain structure predicts two calcium binding EGF repeats based on residues crucial for ligand binding (38.Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These differences may be because of slight variations in design of binding assays such as ligand concentration (15.Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or the small sequence differences between COMP and TSP 1. In addition to the 13 EF-hand-repeating motif structure, the type 3 repeats have also been organized into 8 repeating units called 3A and 3B with the asparatic acid and cysteine residues aligned (39.Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This alignment suggests that the cysteine residues may form intradomain disulfide bonds, thus stabilizing the eight repeated units. However, the disulfide bonds have not been established and it is difficult to see how more than eight calcium ions would bind with this domain structure. The structural organization of the type 3 repeats is commonly viewed as a series of separately folded motifs along the polypeptide chain, although no structural data have been presented to support or dispute this presumption. The highly cooperative calcium binding data presented here strongly suggest that these sequence repeats form a single protein domain. This is also supported by the sequence conservation within all five thrombospondin family members. If the peptide was composed of independently folded domains, one could expect more variations within these repeated sequences. Therefore we propose that the type 3 sequence repeats form a single protein domain: the TSP type 3 domain. It is interesting to note that the mutant peptide bound less than half the normal amount of calcium and yet theoretically only one potential binding site would be directly affected. This suggests that other factors are involved. Calcium binding to TSP I occurs by a cooperative mechanism suggesting that there is a conformational change upon an initial binding event that effects the conformation of other sites. Thus, the impact of an amino acid mutation at one calcium binding site could greatly alter binding at other sites. The reduced calcium binding in the mutant COMP peptide has significant biological relevance in view of the effect of COMP mutations on skeletal development. Following translation of a COMP polypeptide, the chains normally assemble into a mature pentameric COMP molecule and are trafficked through the Golgi and secreted. The sequestration of COMP by PSACH chondrocytes may potentially be the result of quality control mechanisms within the rER that retain incorrectly folded proteins. Unsecreted COMP would thus accumulate in the rER and possibly form aggregates that include COMP and other cartilage components such as aggrecan and type IX collagen. Both of these molecules have been shown to be retained intracellularly in PSACH chondrocytes (19.Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20.Stanescu V. Maroteaux P. Stanescu R. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1982; 138: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In another calcium binding molecule, fibrillin, calcium binding maintains the tertiary structure of two adjacent EGF-like domains (34.Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The results suggested that the calcium bound at the interface between the domains fixes the domains in a linear orientation. It is important to note that there is a significant difference in the potential effect of loss of calcium binding in fibrillin compared with COMP. In contrast to the calcium bound to fibrillin, calcium binding to COMP occurs in a cooperative manner. Perhaps calcium stabilizes a particular structure in COMP that promotes proper folding, secretion, and matrix assembly. The thrombospondin family members contain three regions that have been shown to or have potential to bind divalent cations: the two calcium binding EGF-like repeats, the type 3 domain with some homology to other calcium binding molecules, and the C terminus that has been shown to bind zinc (18.Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Of these, the only ionic association with biological relevance is that of zinc binding, which permits interaction with collagens I and II at the C terminus. This interaction is enormously significant in that COMP is a component of tendon and cartilage, two tissues that are affected in PSACH by COMP mutations. From the data presented here that show altered conformation of COMP3 peptides with the Asp-446 → Asn mutation, we speculate that the native molecular structure is also affected. It is likely that the interaction with fibrillar collagens and potentially other extracellular matrix components may be disrupted. In conclusion, data presented here demonstrate a direct, specific, measurable effect of PSACH-associated COMP mutations on molecular properties. The mutation, Asp-446 → Asn, reduces the potential of the COMP3 peptide to bind calcium ions resulting in a highly altered conformation. The secondary and tertiary structure was disturbed. With these results, it is proposed that the pathogenesis of PSACH includes the profound alteration of the type 3 domain and possibly the overall molecular structure. Future studies will be required to understand how the altered structure causes storage of selected cartilage components. We acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of Jay E. Gambee, Bruce A.

Taken together, these results imply that the α1-Npp cannot be accommodated within the core of the fibril and that the variable region and/or minor helix facilitates its exclusion to the fibril surface.

The major triple helix of collagen XI is not accessible to antibodies unless the fibrils are disrupted, which led to the model that it is located in the interior of the fibril (1.Mendler M.

Collagen XI is a heterotrimeric molecule consisting of α1, α2, and α3 collagen chains (6.Eyre D. Wu J.-J. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 261-281Google Scholar). The α3(XI) chain is an overglycosylated form of the α1(II) collagen chain (7.Furuto D.K. Miller E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains are distinct gene products (8.Fichard A. Kleman J.P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains contain similar large, N-terminal domains (NTDs),1 comprising a “PARP” or “PARP-like” domain, a variable region, and a minor triple helix (Fig. 1 a; Refs. 9.Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 10.Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol.

The PARP (proline-arginine rich protein) domain was originally isolated as a distinct protein from bovine cartilage (11.Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but was later demonstrated to be a fragment of the N terminus of the α2(XI) chain (12.Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, the proteolytic processing site of the α1(XI) chain has been identified (13.Moradi-Ameli M. Rousseau J.C. Kleman J.P. Champliaud M.F. Boutillon M.M. Bernillon J. Wallach J. Van der Rest M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14.Moradi-Ameli M. de Chassey B. Farjanel J. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and since nearly all of the domain is removed by this processing event, both the PARP-like and PARP domains are now termed the amino-propeptides (Npp). The Npp domains are structurally homologous to modules found in seven other collagen chains, as well as the glycoproteins laminin and thrombospondin (15.Moradi-Ameli M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16.Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both the α1 and α2 chains contain a variable region that lies between the Npp and the minor helix, and alternative splicing of the mRNA within these variable domains generates considerable sequence diversity (10.Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). During chondrocyte differentiation, splicing of the α2(XI) mRNA rapidly converges to expression of a single protein isoform that lacks all segments encoded by alternatively spliced exons (19.Sugimoto M. Kimura T. Tsumaki N. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Kawahata H. Yasui N. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Ochi T. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Conversely, alternative splicing of the α1(XI) mRNA at two separate sites during the differentiation process results in divergence from a single species to a complex set of protein isoforms. Six possible isoforms are synthesized, which are named according to the peptide encoded by the exon: p6a, p6b, p8, p[6a+8], p[6b+8] and p0, an isoform that contains constitutively expressed regions only (Fig.1 a). 2The recombinant proteins, which include the α1-Npp domain in addition to variable region, are referred to as p8 or p[6a+8] to designate which of the alternatively expressed peptides were present. Alternative splicing leads to considerable structural complexity, since the p6a and p8 peptides are acidic while the p6b peptide is extremely basic (18.Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although collagen XI comprises a relatively small amount of the total collagen present in cartilage fibrils, its presence is essential for the regulated assembly, organization, and development of the cartilage. This is evidenced by studies on the autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia (Cho) mouse, where a frameshift in the α1(XI) gene leads to a functional knock out of the gene product (20.Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The cartilage of these mice is atypical in that the collagen fibrils are much thicker than normal (21.Seegmiller R. Fraser F.C. Sheldon H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 580-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22.Seegmiller R.E. Myers R.A. Dorfman A. Horwitz A.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1981; 9: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), an observation that is consistent with a regulatory role for type XI collagen in fibril assembly. It has been proposed that the mechanism by which this occurs is similar to that by which collagen V limits the diameter of type I/V fibrils in the cornea (23.Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 24.Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the NTD of type V collagen at the fibril surface inhibits further accretion of collagen I monomers by steric hindrance or by electrostatic mechanisms (25.Marchant J.K. Hahn R.A. Linsenmayer T.F. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In accordance with this model, the NTD of type XI collagen would limit the diameter of heterotypic cartilage fibrils and this may rely in part on the shape and dimensions of the NTD. The goal of this study, therefore, was to examine the structure of the Npp alone or with the alternatively spliced peptides, p8 and p[6a+8] to further elucidate the regulatory mechanism. These two isoforms are representative of both the non-cartilage form and up to 30% of the α1(XI) in cartilage (26.Davies G.B. Oxford J.T. Hausafus L.C. Smoody B.F. Morris N.P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA constructs that code for the p8 and p[6a+8] isoforms were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from an immortalized rat chondrosarcoma cell line as a template (27.Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Horton Jr., W.E. Morris N.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

The upstream primer included a unique NheI site, while the downstream primer encoded six histidine codons in tandem, a stop codon, a SpeI site, and a uniqueXhoI site, at the 3′ end. These primers were based on published cDNA sequence of the rat α1(XI) NTD (18.Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The sequences were amplified using the Advantage HF PCR kit (CLONTECH) with the following amplification conditions: an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 45 s), annealing (65 °C for 30 s), elongation (72 °C for 1 min), and a final elongation for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2.5% Nusieve agarose gel (3:1; FMC Bioproducts) and were cloned into theNheI-XhoI-cut pCEP4 mammalian episomal expression vector (Invitrogen), which had been modified to include the signal peptide and 5′-untranslated region of the basement membrane protein BM40 (28.Mayer U. Zimmermann K. Mann K. Reinhardt D. Timpl R. Nischt R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Secreted recombinant proteins retain four amino acids from this signal peptide at the N terminus. Positive clones were selected by ampicillin resistance in Escherichia coli and their identity verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was harvested and transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that express the EBNA-1 protein (Invitrogen) using Pfx-2 lipid (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and transformed cells were positively selected for by addition of hygromycin (400 μg/ml) and G418 (50 μg/ml). These cells were expanded for large scale culture in serum-free DMEM/F-12. Expression of recombinant protein was detected for up to 2 months, and medium was collected twice a week. Pooled media was clarified by centrifugation before proceeding with protein purification. The α1-Npp sequence was amplified with the upstream primer 5′-TAA CTA GCT CCA GTT GAT ATA CTG AAA GCT TTA GAT TTT-3′ (Fig.1), which included a unique NheI restriction site. The downstream primer was 5′-ATT AGG ATC CAC TAG TGA TGG TGA TGG TGA TGC TGA GCG GCC TTG GAT GTT AAG TCA CA-3′, which encoded six histidine residues, a stop codon, a SpeI site, and a uniqueBamHI site at the 3′ end. The α1-Npp sequence was amplified using the Advantage HF PCR kit (CLONTECH), cloned into the pET 11a expression vector (Stratagene), and the identity was verified by sequencing. Positive clones were selected and plasmid DNA was used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS-competent cells, which express T7 polymerase (Invitrogen). These were grown in LB medium, and α1-Npp was purified from the inclusion bodies of these cells by solubilizing in 8m urea, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was refolded by rapid dilution in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7. 8, containing 0.25 m NaCl and then dialyzed against chelating column start buffer (see below). Recombinant p8 and p[6a+8] proteins were precipitated from serum-free medium by 30% ammonium sulfate and resuspended in start buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 2 m urea, pH 7.1) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm[4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride]hydrochloride and 1 mm benzamidine). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (18,000 × g for 30 min) and the resultant supernatant filtered through a 0.8-μm filter. This was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) charged with 0.2 m cobalt chloride and equilibrated in start buffer. The absorbance was monitored continuously at 280 nm, and the flow rate was 2 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted by a step gradient to 0.25 m imidazole. Proteins in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel, reducing conditions) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled, concentrated to 1 ml by ultrafiltration (Centriprep, Amicon), and passed over a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mmsodium phosphate, 2 m urea, pH 7.2. The absorbance was monitored continuously at 280 nm, and the flow rate was 0.25 ml/min. Purified recombinant protein was then concentrated on a Centricon filter unit (Amicon). α2-Npp was extracted with guanidine HCl from bovine nasal cartilage and purified as described previously (11.Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified p8 and p[6a+8] recombinant proteins were digested with CnBr in 70% formic acid to isolate the N terminus containing the disulfide-bonded cysteines. After digestion the sample was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC (Vydac C18 column 218TP52), and the N-terminal peptide was identified by Edman sequencing (Routine 3.5 chemistry, ABI Sequencer). This peptide was digested with chymotrypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm NH4OAc, pH 6.8 at 20 °C for 18 h, then purified by reverse-phase HPLC with the following conditions: solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O; solvent B, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile; gradient, 0–1.6% B, 63–29.6% B, 95–60% B, 105–80% B, 105.1–1.6% B. Disulfide-bonded peptides were identified by Edman sequencing. One hundred pmol of α1-Npp protein was digested with 2 pmol of sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) for 4 h in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. 1 pmol of the peptide digest was pressure-loaded onto a 75-μm capillary HPLC column for on-line analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in an ion-trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan, San Jose, CA) as described (29.Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4350) Google Scholar). As peptides eluted from the column, their mass/charge ratios were measured in the mass spectrometer. A second stage of mass spectrometry was then performed automatically, where a selected peptide ion was fragmented to collect sequence information. Disulfide bonds are stable under the conditions used, and no bond breakage between cysteines occurred. A mass/charge ratio 1315.8, [M + 3H]3+ corresponding to a trio of disulfide-bonded peptides was encountered during the run. A tandem mass spectrum was automatically collected, which was used to determine the correct order of disulfide arrangement. This trio was the only peak not present in an identical run where the peptide digest was reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C. ScanProsite was used to identify potential N-glycosylation sites, while the NetOGlyc 2.0 prediction server was used to predict potential GalNAcO-glycosylation sites of α1(XI) NTD. To assess whether the recombinant p[6a+8] protein was glycosylated, a sample was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and incubated overnight at 37 °C with either 0.5 units of N-glycosidase F alone or in combination with 0.25 milliunits ofO-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Digested and undigested control samples were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. For analysis of protein shape, p[6a+8] recombinant protein was passed over a Superose 12 molecular sieve column. This was performed in both denaturing (8m urea, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 0.1% Triton X-100) and non-denaturing conditions (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.1). The absorbance was monitored continuously at 280 nm, and the flow rate was 0.25 ml/min. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze every second fraction of the denatured buffer run to determine the elution position of p[6a+8]. The elution position was compared with a set of known globular proteins (670 to 1.35 kDa (Bio-Rad); 67 to 13.7 kDa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) resuspended in identical buffers and run immediately prior to each of the experimental runs. The purified isoforms (10 μg/ml) were dialyzed against 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, sprayed onto mica, and shadowed with platinum (30.Morris N.P. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bentz H. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5638-5644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The images were viewed by transmission electron microscopy. Measurements were estimated from photomicrographs using a calibrated eyepiece. Only molecules with defined, extended tails were measured. To make the measurements more accurate, the size of the platinum particles, measured from the background, was subtracted from this value. Statistical analysis was performed and a standard error of the mean calculated. Purified recombinant isoforms (0.5–1 mg/ml) were dialyzed extensively against 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. Each sample was analyzed in the far-UV range (260–180 nm) at 24 °C by CD spectroscopy on a Jasco J-500 spectropolarimeter interfaced to a computer, using a quartz cell with a path length of 100 μm. Spectra were smoothed, and buffer base lines were subtracted. The secondary structure was subsequently estimated using the variable selection method with an initial set of 33 basis spectra (31.Compton L.A. Mathews C.K. Johnson Jr., W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method of analysis is thought to be advantageous in estimating the β-sheet content of a protein (32.Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The concentration of each sample was determined in triplicate by amino acid analysis. Samples were gas-phase hydrolyzed using 300 μl of 6 nHCl, 2% phenol at 110 °C for 22 h, and the hydrolysates were analyzed on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer using sodium citrate buffers. For determination of the structure of the variable region, the difference between the normalized spectra of the α1-Npp and the p[6a+8] was obtained using a calculation that accounted for the different number of amino acids present in each domain. The resultant spectrum of the variable domain was then solved. The secondary structure of the α1-Npp and variable region of the α1(XI) NTD were predicted from the following programs: (a) information theory with nil decision constants (Gor1; Ref. 33.Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar), (b) Gor2, a modification of Gor1 (34.Gibrat J.F. Garnier J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), (c) Gor 4, a further improved version of Gor1 (35.Garnier J. Gibrat J.F. Robson B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (d) self-optimized method for protein secondary structure prediction (SOPM; Ref. 36.Geourjon C. Deleage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), (e) SOPMA, an improved version of SOPM (37.Geourjon C. Deleage G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 681-684PubMed Google Scholar), (f) PHDSec (38.Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar), (g) hierarchical neural network (39.Guermeur Y. Geourjon C. Gallinari P. Deleage G. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), (h) Predator (40.Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and (i) nnPredict (41.Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). These prediction programs can all be accessed at the EXPASY web server, where the default options, if any, for e.g. window lengths and similarity thresholds, were chosen. Not all these programs predicted the same secondary structure for each sequence, so the prediction was based on agreement of at least four out of the nine methods implemented. The α1-Npp domain alone or the complete p[6a+8] isoform (Fig.1 b) were expressed as recombinant proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, respectively, as sufficient quantities could not be purified from cartilage. Recombinant p[6a+8] was initially purified by chelating affinity chromatography utilizing the 6-histidine tag incorporated into the construct (Fig. 2 a). SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies directed against the 6-histidine tag indicated that the material in pool B contained the recombinant protein (results not shown). However, Coomassie Blue staining of the same material showed the presence of a high M r contaminating protein (Fig.2 c, lane 2). The fractions containing partially purified recombinant protein were pooled, concentrated and passed over a Superose 12 molecular sieve column (Fig. 2 b). SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Blue staining of the peak fractions indicated that the high M r contaminating protein was successfully removed (Fig. 2 c, lane 3), leaving substantially pure recombinant p[6a+8] protein in the second peak (Fig. 2 c, lane 4). These fractions were pooled and the protein concentrated for use in structural analyses. Recombinant α1-Npp was purified in an identical manner and the purified product is shown (Fig. 2 c,lane 5). The typical yields of purified recombinant protein were 1 mg of p[6a+8]/4 liters of DMEM/F-12 medium or 1 mg of α1-Npp/liter of LB medium. The disulfide bonds formed by the recombinant p[6a+8] protein were analyzed by peptide mapping under non-reducing conditions. After digestion with cyanogen bromide and chymotrypsin, Edman sequence analysis of disulfide-linked peptides revealed that Cys-1 was linked to Cys-4 and that Cys-2 was linked to Cys-3 (Fig. 3 a). There remains a possibility that a small amount of protein was not folded correctly but as the protein migrated as a single species on SDS-PAGE and eluted as a single, symmetrical peak on molecular sieve chromatography, it is likely that most, if not all, of the protein was folded correctly. The proper disulfide bond pairing of the recombinant α1-Npp was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Disulfide analysis by LC-MS/MS of a tryptic digest of α1-Npp resulted in the detection of the mass/charge ratio for a trio of predicted disulfide cross-linked peptides with two possible cross-linked conformations (Fig. 3 b). A tandem mass spectrum corresponding to this peptide revealed the correct disulfide order because disulfides did not break under the conditions employed and amino acid sequence could be verified across the S-S bonds. Only a single peak disappeared in a comparison between native and reduced tryptic digests, and no other masses corresponding to any other predicted disulfide-linked peptides were identified, suggesting that the conformation detected was the only one present in the recombinant protein. The disulfide bond pattern detected for both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic recombinant proteins was identical to that of the highly homologous α2-Npp domain isolated from cartilage (11.Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the recombinant proteins are likely to be correctly folded. ScanProsite was used to analyze N-glycosylation sites in α1-Npp and the variable region. The sequence -NISE- was identified as a potential site within the p8 peptide. To assess whether the recombinant p[6a+8] was glycosylated, a sample was digested with N-glycosidase F, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. It was found that the N-glycosidase digested sample migrated slightly further on SDS-PAGE compared with undigested control samples (Fig.4). This was also true for recombinant p8 protein, and in both cases double digestion with N- andO-glycosidase did not further increase the rate of migration (results not shown). Moreover, during the amino acid sequence analysis performed to map the disulfide bonds, the asparagine residue of the amino acid sequence -NISE- was absent, consistent with anN-glycosylation at this site within the p8 peptide. Following the molecular sieve purification of the p[6a+8] isoform, standard globular proteins were passed over the column in identical buffer conditions. It was observed that, in non-denaturing buffer, the p[6a+8] eluted at a much greater apparent molecular mass (∼280 kDa) than its mass calculated from its amino acid sequence (Fig. 5 a). The elution of p[6a+8] as a single, sharp, symmetric and included peak in non-denaturing conditions was an indication that the greater apparent molecular mass was not due to multimer formation, but rather an asymmetric conformation. When chromatographed under denaturing conditions (8 m urea, 14 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100; Fig. 5 b), the p[6a+8] eluted at a position corresponding to approximately 66 kDa, the same apparent molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE. Moreover, the α1-Npp domain eluted at a position corresponding to its molecular mass in non-denaturing conditions (results not shown), suggesting that asymmetry resides in the variable region. The indication of an asymmetric conformation of p[6a+8] was investigated further by use of rotary shadowing and electron microscopy. Rotary-shadowed images of both the recombinant α1-Npp and the α2-Npp domain showed a homogeneous population of small round particles, indicating formation of a compact, globular domain (Fig. 6, a andb). This observation is similar to the rotary shadowing images of the NC11 domain, a homologous domain found in type XVI collagen (42.Tillet E. Mann K. Nischt R. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Conversely, the p[6a+8] isoform, which contains variable region in addition to the Npp domain, displayed two distinct foldin"
https://openalex.org/W2024973593,"The reversible acetylation of histones is associated with structural alterations in the chromatin fiber that affect various DNA-related activities. Here we show that the histone acetyltransferase p300 specifically acetylates HMG-14, a nonhistone structural protein that binds to nucleosomes and reduces the compactness of the chromatin fiber. We identify 7 major acetylation sites, 6 of which are novel and have not been known to be acetylated in either HMG-14 or the closely related HMG-17 protein. All the acetylation sites involve evolutionarily conserved residues: 3 within the HMG-14/-17 nucleosomal binding domain and 4 in or near the bipartite nuclear localization domains of the proteins. In tissue culture cells the acetylation pattern is indicative of a selective process in which a subfraction of HMG-14 is preferentially acetylated. We find that the nucleosomal binding domain is a major target for acetylation in vivo and that the specific acetylation of HMG-14 by p300 weakens its interaction with nucleosome cores. Our results suggest that p300 modulates the interaction of HMG-14 with nucleosomes. Thus, p300 may affect chromatin-related activities not only by modifying histones or transcription factors but also by targeting structural nonhistone proteins.

Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the acetylation of specific lysine residues in the histone tails leads to chromatin decompaction (10.Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 11.Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), thereby reducing the repressive effect of chromatin on transcription and replication as well as other DNA-related activities. However, it is also possible that histone acetylation affects the interaction of specific nucleosomes with regulatory factors (1.Hansen J. Tse C. Wolffe A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or with the nuclear matrix (2.Davie J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and that specific acetylation marks discrete functional states of the chromatin (12.Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4249-4356Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 13.ONeill L.P. Turner B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3946-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is significant that the reversible acetylation of histones is targeted and specific; that is, discrete lysine residues are targeted by specific acetyltransferases (2.Davie J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Most of the studies on the function and specificity of the acetylation activity of transcription coactivators focused on the reversible acetylation of the N termini of histone tails. However, these transcription coactivators also acetylate nonhistone proteins (14.Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), a modification that has significant functional consequences. Thus, the binding of p53 to its target DNA sequence is facilitated by the residue-specific acetylation by PCAF1 and p300 (15.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A.

A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) is affected by a p300-mediated acetylation. The acetylation of HMG-I by CBP, but not by PCAF, leads to interferon-β enhanceosome disassembly and turns off interferon-β gene expression (20.Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). PCAF also specifically acetylates lysine 2 in the nonhistone HMG-17, a modification that alters the interaction of the protein with the nucleosome core. Interestingly, PCAF does not acetylate the closely related protein HMG-14 (21.Herrera J. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 are the only nuclear proteins known to specifically bind to the 146-base pair nucleosome core particle (22.Bustin M. Reeves R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. 54. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 35-100Google Scholar). Although these proteins, as well as other members of the HMG class, are relatively abundant and ubiquitously found in all higher eukaryotes, very few studies examined their pattern of acetylation. In duck erythrocytes, Allfrey and co-workers (23.Sterner R. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8892-8895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identify two acetylation sites, at positions 2 and 4, in both HMG-14 and HMG-17 and an additional acetylation site at position 10, in HMG-17 (23.Sterner R. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8892-8895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that PCAF specifically acetylates Lys 2 in HMG-17 but does not acetylate the closely related HMG-14 (21.Herrera J. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) suggests that in a fashion analogous to the acetylation of the histone tails, the acetylation of HMG-14/-17 is targeted and specific; that is, specific lysine residues are differentially acetylated by specific acetylases. We therefore searched for additional acetylases that modify these proteins in a biologically meaningful way and studied the ability of the transcription co-activator p300, which is a potent histone acetylase (24.Ogryzko V.V. Sciltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar), to acetylate HMG-14/-17. Here we report that p300 specifically acetylates both HMG-14 and HMG-17 at multiple sites. All of the acetylation sites are at lysine residues that are conserved among all the members of the HMG-14/-17 protein family. Most of the acetylation sites identified have not been previously reported and represent novel sites for this type of modification. The most prominent acetylation sites are located in the nucleosomal binding domain of the protein, suggesting that acetylation may alter the interaction of HMG-14 with chromatin. By equilibrium dialysis we demonstrate that indeed, the p300-mediated acetylation reduces the affinity of HMG-14 to nucleosomes. Additional prominent acetylation sites are located in the bipartite nuclear localization signal of the protein (25.Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these modifications may also affect the intranuclear distribution of HMG-14/-17 proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that the p300 acetylation may affect the cellular function of HMG-14/-17 proteins. Recombinant human p300 containing the Flag tag (Eastman Kodak Co.)

Cytochrome c and acetyl-CoA were obtained from Sigma, [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [3H]acetyl-CoA (26 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Inc. Assays were performed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm dithiotheitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mm butyric acid) (28.Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or in 2× TBE (89 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 89 mm sodium borate, 1 mm EDTA), 1 mm dithiotheitol buffer at protein substrate concentrations of 0.1 to 0.25 mg/ml. The concentration of either [3H]acetyl-CoA or [1-14C]acetyl-CoA was 18 μm. The concentration of recombinant p300 in the reaction mixture was 8 ng/μl. The standard assay was performed at 37 °C for 20 min and initiated by adding the protein substrate to a mixture containing the acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA in the relevant buffer. HMG-14 was acetylated by p300 using 120 μm nonradioactive sodium acetyl-CoA (Sigma), as described above. To increase the yield of acetylated protein, the reaction time was extended to 3 h, with addition of fresh enzyme and 120 μm of acetyl-CoA every hour. The reaction mixtures were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC on an Aquapore (7 μm) butyl column (250 × 4.6 mm) using a 0–30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. HMG-14 was eluted from the column at approximately 20% acetonitrile. The HMG-14 peak was collected and digested with either Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Arg-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or human plasma kallikrein (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. The digested HMG-14 was run on the Beckman System Gold HPLC using an Upchurch α-chrom C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (flow rate of 200 μl/min.). Peptides were sequenced on a Beckman LF3000G protein sequencer equipped with System Gold on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis. HMG-14 was acetylated in 2× TBE, 1 mm dithiotheitol containing radioactively labeled acetyl-CoA for 3 h at 37 °C (as described above). Fresh p300 and acetyl-CoA were added after each hour. After acetylation, p300 was heat-inactivated by incubating the reaction mixture at 95 °C for 5 min. The dialysis was performed using Teflon equilibrium chambers (Sialomed Inc.) and 100-kDa cutoff membranes as described by Herreraet al. (21.Herrera J. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For mass spectral analysis we employed either the PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager™ DE matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight spectrometer using the delayed extraction protocol or surface-enhanced lazer desorption ionization PBS, (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.). In the surface-enhanced lazer desorption ionization PBS analysis, 1–2 μl of an HPLC fraction (lyophilized and redissolved in water) were spotted on a hydrophobic chip, and 1 μl of matrix (saturated sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 50% HPLC grade water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was added. Logarithmically growing (around 0.5 × 106cells/ml) or stationary phase (1.4–1.6 × 106cells/ml) HeLa S3 cells grown in suspension were concentrated 25-fold by centrifugation. The concentrated cells were incubated in 37 °C while shaking gently for 10 min with 200 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) and for 1 additional h in the presence of 10 μmtrichostatin A (WAKO) and 0.25 mCi/ml [3H]acetate (20 Ci/mmol, Moravek). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the HMGs were extracted with 5% perchloric acid. The remaining pellets were extracted with 0.25 m sulfuric acid to obtain the core histones, which were used as controls. The HMGs from the homogenate were precipitated overnight at −20 °C with 6 volumes of acetone, 0.3 m HCl. The core histones were precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone. The precipitated proteins were washed with 95% acetone, air-dried, and dissolved in water. To determine the protein specific activity the proteins were run on 15% SDS-PAGE, and their amounts were estimated by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. The bands were excised, digested at 70 °C overnight with 30% hydrogen peroxide, and the [3H]acetate incorporation into each band was determined by scintillation counting. Rabbit anti-p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which does not cross-react with CBP, was used to specifically immunoprecipitate p300 from HeLa nuclear extracts (Upstate Biotechnology). Various amounts of the anti-p300 antibody (see “Results”) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 2× TBE with 20 μg of total protein from the HeLa nuclear extract. As controls, higher concentrations of rabbit nonimmune IgG were used in parallel. 13 μl of packed agarose-protein A (Life Technologies, Inc.) were washed twice with 2× TBE and added to every immunoprecipitation reaction. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C (with rotation) for 2–3 h, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 3 times in 2× TBE. Both the washed beads and the depleted supernatants were made 1 mm in dithiotheitol in a total volume of 13 μl of 2× TBE buffer and brought to a final concentration of 80 μm [14C]acetyl-CoA. 0.5 μg of HMG-14 was added to each reaction tube and acetylated for 30 min in 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-gel sample buffer, and then boiling for 5 min. The level of acetylation was quantified by running the products on 15% SDS-PAGE as described above. To examine whether the two closely related nonhistone proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 are specifically acetylated by p300 we tested the ability of the enzyme to incorporate radioactive acetate into these proteins. Phosphorimage analysis of proteins separated on SDS-gels (Fig.1 B, see Fig. 1 A for corresponding Coomassie) demonstrates that the recombinant human p300 efficiently acetylates both HMG-14 and HMG-17. The acetylation is specific since lysozyme and cytochrome c, which also have a high content of lysines, were not acetylated by the enzyme (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 1, A and B). Nucleosomal histones served as positive controls. The labeling was enzyme-dependent since reaction mixtures containing [14C]acetyl-CoA but lacking enzyme failed to incorporate acetate into the HMG proteins (not shown). We conclude therefore that both HMG-14 and HMG-17 are specifically acetylated by p300. To assess the number of acetylation sites in HMG-14 and HMG-17, the acetylated proteins were run on Triton-acid-urea polyacrylamide gels under conditions known to resolve acetylated species of core histones. Both Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 C) and autoradiographic analysis (Fig. 1 D) resolved five molecular species in both HMG-14 and HMG-17. As expected, the number of molecular species and the relative intensities of the bands correlated with the substrate to enzyme ratios in the reaction mixture (compare lanes 1 with2 and 3 with 4). Quantitative analysis, obtained by densitometric scanning and scintillation counting of each band, clearly indicated that the relative specific activity of the bands correlates with their electrophoretic mobility. The bands marked 0 (Fig. 1 D) were not radioactive. The bands marked as 1 contained about 8 × 104cpm. For comparative purposes the specific activity of these bands was taken to be 1.0. For HMG-14, the relative specific activity of the bands marked 2, 3, and 4 was 1.6, 2.1, and 4.4, respectively. For HMG-17, the relative specific activity of bands 2 and 3 was 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The specific activity of the bands marked 4 and 5 was higher, but due to the low protein stain, could not be reliably measured. Analysis of the acetylation reactions of HMG-14 by reverse phase HPLC using C4 Aquapore columns also indicated that p300 acetylates this protein at multiple sites in a substrate-dependent manner. An increase in the acetyl-CoA concentration increased the number of peaks and shifted the elution profile toward longer retention time. At saturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA (120 μm), at least five peaks could be resolved (Fig. 1 E). We conclude therefore that p300 acetylates HMG-14 (and HMG-17) at multiple sites. The only reported acetylation sites in HMG-14 are the lysine residues at positions 2 and 4 (23.Sterner R. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8892-8895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings that HMG-14 is efficiently acetylated by p300 at multiple sites indicated the presence of additional acetylation sites in the protein. To identify the protein regions containing the acetylated residues, we used peptides corresponding to various regions of HMG-14 to compete for the acetylation of the intact protein. Peptides corresponding either to the N-terminal region or to the nucleosomal binding domain or spanning one of the nuclear localization signals efficiently inhibited the acetylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2, A–C). Peptide 6, corresponding to the C-terminal region of the protein, was incapable of competing with HMG-14 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that this region does not contain a major acetylation site. The peptides themselves were poor substrates for acetylation (not shown), suggesting that the specificity of acetylation is not solely dependent on the peptide sequence in the vicinity of the target site (21.Herrera J. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To identify the sites acetylated by p300 in the intact HMG-14 protein, we cleaved the acetylated protein with the specific proteases Asp-N, Arg-C, or kallikrein (Fig. 2 E). The peptides were fractionated by HPLC, and the purified peptides were sequenced on a Beckman sequencer. Using a synthetic peptide we unequivocally identified the retention time of ε-N-acetyllysine (Fig.2 D), thus enabling us to use nonradioactive acetyl-CoA to determined the ratio of ε-N-acetyllysine to lysine after each sequencing step and quantify the relative levels of acetylation of each of the lysines in HMG-14 (Fig. 2 E). Using this approach we find that there are seven major acetylation sites (more than 25% of the lysines at that position modified): one in the N-terminal region at Lys-2, which is part of nuclear localization signal (25.Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), three in the nucleosomal binding domain at lysines 30, 37, and 41, and three at or near the second element of the bipartite nuclear localization signals of the protein, at lysines 54, 58, and 60. In addition, we identify 6 minor acetylation sites: 5 of them at positions 13, 17, 26, 47, and 52 in the N-terminal half of the protein, and 1 of them at position 81 in the C-terminal region. Additional studies with truncation mutants were in full agreement with these findings. The specific activity of truncation mutants lacking either the first 4 amino acids or the last 26 amino acids was very similar to that of the intact protein (not shown). With the exception of Lys-2, all of these acetylation sites are novel sites that were not previously known to be acetylated in either HMG-14 or in HMG-17. The acetylation is specific to the identified residues since some of the lysine residues in the protein were not acetylated at all. To test whether cellular p300 actually acetylates HMG-14, we specifically immunoprecipitated p300 from HeLa nuclear extracts with previously characterized antibodies and tested the ability of both the immunoprecipitates and the depleted supernatants to acetylate recombinant HMG-14. As demonstrated in Fig.3, the immunoprecipitates efficiently acetylated HMG-14. The specific activity of HMG-14 acetylated by the material immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of specific antibodies was 4.5-fold higher than that immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of nonspecific, control IgG (compare lanes 1 and 4in Fig. 3, A and B). A 2-fold increase in the amount of anti p300 antibodies did not significantly change the activity of the immunoprecipitate, suggesting that the antibodies were sufficient to immunodeplete most of the p300 acetylase activity in the HeLa extracts. Conversely, the supernatant from the p300-depleted extracts lost more than 50% of the acetylase activity as compared with the supernatants of the extracts treated with twice the amount of control antibodies (compare lane 5 with lane 8). Although the activity of p300 in HeLa nuclear extracts is not necessarily proportional to that in living cells, our results suggest that p300 is an active, major HMG-14 acetyltransferase in vivo. To examine the in vivo pattern of HMG-14 acetylation, we labeled both logarithmically growing and stationary phase HeLa S3 cells with [3H]acetate in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and in either the presence or absence of the histone deacetylase inhibitors Trichostatin A or sodium butyrate. In logarithmically growing cells, in the absence of histone deacetylase inhibitors, the specific activity of HMG-14 was 75-fold lower than that of histone H3. The deacetylase inhibitors Trichostatin A and sodium butyrate increased the specific activity of histone H3 3.5-fold but did not affect the specific activity of HMG-14, suggesting that distinct type of deacetylases are acting on HMG-14. Indeed a HeLa nuclear extract deacetylated radioactively labeled H4, but not labeled HMG-14, in a Trichostatin A-sensitive manner (not shown). In stationary phase cells the specific activity of HMG-14 was 5.5 higher, whereas that of histone H3 was 2-fold lower than the specific activities of the proteins extracted from logarithmically growing cells, and the specific activity of HMG-14 was only 6-fold lower than that of histone H3. From these experiments we conclude that HMG-14 is acetylated in vivo and that the in vivo levels of HMG-14 acetylation may correlate with the metabolic state of the cell. Next, we isolated the HMG fraction from radioactively labeled stationary phase cells and purified the various HMG proteins on HPLC. We noted two peaks with an elution time corresponding to free and acetylated HMG-14 (Fig. 4 A). Examination by SDS-PAGE (not shown) indicated that most of the cellular HMG-14 was present in the major peak, eluting at a retention time of 9.4 min. The smaller peak eluting at 9.8 min also contained HMG-14 as determined by SDS electrophoresis, mass spectra, and sequence analysis (not shown). The specific activity of the HMG-14 in this late-eluting peak was 33 times higher than that of the HMG-14 eluting in the major peak. Thus, the HPLC retention time of the in vivoacetylated HMG-14 is longer than that of nonacetylated HMG-14, an observation that is in agreement with the in vitro studies on HMG-14 acetylation (Fig. 1). This highly acetylated fraction composes approximately 3% of total cellular HMG-14. We note that this level is higher than that of other acetylated nonhistones such as HMG-I(Y) (20.Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and p53 (15.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), where the cellular levels of acetylation were too low to be quantified. The results suggest that in HeLa cells the HMG-14 acetylation pattern is not random and does not target all the potential acetylation sites in all of the HMG-14 molecules. The acetylation pattern is indicative of a selective process in which a subfraction of the HMG-14 is highly acetylated, whereas most of the cellular HMG remains unacetylated. Since the in vitro analysis revealed novel acetylation sites located in the central region of HMG-14, we tested whether this HMG-14 region is also acetylated in vivo.3H-Labeled HMG-14 was isolated from stationary phase HeLa cells by a 5% PCA extraction followed by two cycles of reverse phase HPLC and proteolysis with kallikrein. The resulting peptides were separated on Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gels, and the specific activity of each of the peptides was determined. The peptides were identified by calibration experiments in which recombinant HMG-14 protein was proteolized with kallikrein, and the digestion products were separated both on Tris-Tricine gels (Fig. 4 B) and on reverse phase HPLC (not shown). The peptides that were run on the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The HPLC fractions were also subjected to N-terminal sequencing and to mass spectroscopy analysis. As already demonstrated (Fig. 2 E), kallikrein digests HMG-14 at two major sites: the C terminus of residue 19 and the C terminus of residue 59. Thus, the partial digestion products identified on the gel (Fig.4 B) are the intact protein and the fragments spanning residues 20–99, 20–59, and 1–19. From the data summarized in Fig. 4 C it is apparent that thein vivo pattern of HMG-14 acetylation is in full agreement with the p300-mediated in vitro acetylation pattern obtained by sequence analysis (Fig. 2 E). Thus, the specific activity of the peptide-spanning amino acids 20–59 is very similar to that of either the entire protein or to a longer peptide spanning residues 20–99. These results clearly indicate that the central region of HMG-14, which contains the nucleosomal binding domain of the protein, is acetylated in vivo. The high level of acetylation in the nucleosomal binding domain of the protein raises the possibility that the p300-mediated acetylation may modulate the interaction of HMG-14 with nucleosomes. Since p300 acetylates HMG-14 at multiple sites, it is not possible to obtain a homogeneous fully acetylated HMG species suitable for the determination of an affinity constant by mobility shift assays. We therefore performed equilibrium dialysis experiments to examine the effect of the p300-mediated acetylation on the binding of HMG-14 to nucleosome core particles. In this test the acetylated and nonacetylated HMG-14 species compete for binding to nucleosome cores under identical conditions. We first acetylated HMG-14 with [14C]acetyl-CoA and then heat-inactivated the p300. We already demonstrated that the heat treatment does not affe"

Economic development is a condition sine qua non for ambitious nature conservation projects in Africa. Therefore, [ Musters et al. ][2] plead for local sustainable development projects, preferably in presently domesticated areas.

https://openalex.org/W2171585151,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a central role in modulating the cellular responses to DNA damage. Several recent studies, undertaken with the whole genomic DNA or full-length gene segments, have shown that p53 is involved in nucleotide excision repair and it selectively influences the adduct removal from the non-transcribed strand in the genome. In this study, we have analyzed the damage induction at nucleotide resolution by ligase-mediated polymerase chain reaction and compared the repair of ultraviolet radiation-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers within exon 8 of p53 gene in normal and Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts as well as in normal and human papillomavirus 16 E6 and E7 protein-expressing human mammary epithelial cells. The results demonstrate that (i) loss or disruption of p53 function decreases efficiency of DNA repair, by preferentially affecting the repair of non-transcribed strand and of intrinsically slow repair sites in transcribed strand; (ii) mutant p53 protein affects DNA repair, at least of non-transcribed strand, in a dominant negative manner; and (iii) pRb does not have an effect on the repair of DNA damage within transcribed or non-transcribed strand.

It is now well established that NER along genome is heterogeneous, CPDs are more efficiently removed from transcriptionally active genes, and TCR is generally faster than GGR (2.Petit C. Sancar A.

GGR acts on the elimination of lesions from non-transcribed strand (NTS) and transcriptionally inactive genes, whereas TCR removes lesions from DNA strand transcribed by RNA polymerase II. In mammalian cells, a variety of cellular responses following genotoxic exposure may contribute to prevent DNA lesions from interfering with essential cellular functions. Of those cellular responses, activation of p53 pathway is well studied and documented (11.Oren M. Rotter V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12.Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

It is believed that p53 activation signals the G1 arrest to delay the transit from G1 to S, thus preventing the effects of DNA lesions on vital cellular functions. Accumulating evidence indicates that p53 plays a role in DNA repair, especially in GGR (13.Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A.

Conceivably, p53 could be involved in NER by regulating its downstream genes, which are either related to or actively participate in NER.

Chen C.-Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent evidence has shown that p48, a UV-damaged DNA-binding protein is transcriptionally regulated by p53, linking p53 to NER (22.Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Besides transcriptional activation, p53 may also be directly involved in repair or repair-related processes. For example, in addition to demonstrated p53 binding to insertion/deletion mismatches (23.Lee S. Elenbass B. Levine A.J. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), p53 has also been found to both physically and functionally interact with p62, XPD, and XPB, three components of basal transcription factor IIH (10.Frit P. Bergmann E. Egly J.-M. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24.Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.-R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Despite a plethora of experimental data, the definitive role of p53 in NER and the mechanistic basis of its interaction with repair machinery has not been fully delineated in eukaryotic systems. Several observations, either supporting a pronounced effect of p53 for an efficient repair of NTS alone or its involvement also in the repair of transcribed strand (TS), have been put forth to identify the role of p53 in NER (13.Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14.Smith M.L. Chen I.-T. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J.

These observations are primarily based upon the assessment of an average of the repair events within an entire genome, a specific gene segment, or in some cases an episomally replicating plasmid within mammalian host cells. Thus, in the present study we performed the damage analysis at nucleotide resolution and systematically compared DNA repair of individual UV-induced CPD sites in normal, p53 mutant (p53-Mut), and p53 nullizygous (p53-Null) Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) fibroblasts, as well as in normal, human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6 and E7 protein-expressing human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Our results show that, compared with the efficiency of TS repair, a significantly reduced rate of CPD removal was observable at all the dipyrimidine target sites of exon 8 NTS in both p53-Null and p53-Mut LFS cell lines. A close comparison of the extent of damage removal at 24 and 48 h after UV irradiation indicated that the repair of NTS was more severely affected in p53-Mut cells than in p53-Null cells. Relatively slight decrease in the initial rate of repair within TS, discernible at 24 h after treatment, was fully apparent at the inherently slow repair sites, e.g.codons 286 and 294 of p53 gene. This selective effect of p53 protein on the slow repair site of TS was much more clearly demonstrable at the same site in HPV 16 E6-expressing HMEC in which p53 is functionally inactivated by E6 protein. Like LFS cells, HPV 16 E6-expressing HMEC show a reduced rate of repair of CPDs in the NTS than in the TS. Both normal HMEC, having wild-type p53 and pRb proteins, and the isogenic HPV 16 E7-expressing HMEC, having wild-type p53 and compromised pRb protein expression, failed to show the deficiency of CPD repair in NTS as seen clearly due to the absence of p53 within human cells. Thus, pRb, another important cell cycle regulatory protein, does not seem to influence the NER process to a meaningful extent. The normal human (p53-WT) fibroblasts (OSU-2) were established in culture as described earlier (27.Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M.F. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LFS fibroblast strains, MDAH087 (p53-Mut, harboring a codon 248 single-base substitution) and MDAH041 (p53-Null, harboring a codon 184 frameshift mutation, resulting in premature termination of translation of p53 protein), both >200 population doubling, post-crisis p53 homozygous cell strains, were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Tainsky (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Austin, TX). These fibroblast cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Normal HMEC were established in culture according to Stampfer (28.Stampfer M.R. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1985; 9: 107-115Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). HPV 16 E6 protein-expressing HMEC 76E6 and HPV 16 E7 protein-expressing HMEC 76E7 were kindly provided by Dr. Vimla Band (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA). These cells were grown in DFCI medium supplemented with required nutrients and growth factors as described (29.Wazer D.E. Liu X.-L. Chu Q. Gao Q. Band V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3687-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For experiments to assess DNA damage and repair, the monolayer cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm dishes and then placed in serum-free medium for 12 h. Under these growth and maintenance conditions, the index of cellular DNA replication, as measured from changes in the specific radioactivity of DNA pre-labeled with [3H]dThd, does not show significant genome duplication during the test periods of repair analysis (27.Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M.F. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The medium was removed, and cells were washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline and irradiated with desired doses of UV (254-nm) light at a rate of 0.5 J·m−2·s−1 as measured by Kettering model 65 radiometer (Cole-Palmer Instrument Co., Vernon Hill, IL). After irradiation, fresh serum-free medium was added to cell culture and incubation continued for desired periods. Briefly, after UV exposure, desired incubation periods, and washes to remove any floating dead cells, the adherent cells were recovered by trypsinization and immediately lysed for DNA isolation by a salt precipitation procedure as described (13.Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30.Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 12-15Crossref Scopus (17886) Google Scholar). The CPDs were cleaved and converted to single-strand breaks by digestion with T4 endonuclease V (31.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G. Pfeifer G.P. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 199-210Crossref Google Scholar). The ligation-inhibiting 5′-pyrimidine overhang was removed by Escherichia coli photolyase (31.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G. Pfeifer G.P. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 199-210Crossref Google Scholar) (generous gift from Dr. Aziz Sancar, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). DNA was then recovered and quantitated as described previously (13.Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The same amount of DNA (1–2 μg) was used for each reaction set of LMPCR. LMPCR is an extremely sensitive genomic sequencing method used for the detection of DNA damage (31.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G. Pfeifer G.P. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Press, New York1996: 199-210Crossref Google Scholar, 32.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). DNA, specifically cleaved at CPDs, was used to create blunt end DNA fragment by extension of primer specific to p53 with DNA sequenase 2.0. Blunt-ended DNA was then ligated to a double-strand linker and followed by amplification with the longer oligonucleotide of the linker and a second nested p53-specific primer. After 20–21 cycles of polymerase chain reaction, DNA fragments were size-fractionated on an 8% urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel, electroblotted onto a nylon filter, and hybridized to a single-stranded p53-specific 32P-labeled probe generated by polymerase chain reaction using a third p53-specific primer. The filter was used to expose a PhosphorImager screen and the individual band intensities quantitated upon imaging and processing by Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics). The filters were also used to expose Kodak X-Omat film for autoradiography and documentation by image scanning. LMPCR analysis of each sample was carried out in duplicate, and results described are from at least three independent experiments. Loss or disruption of normal p53 function generally results in decreased efficiency of repair of CPDs of non-transcribed DNA strand. To compare repair of CPDs in p53-WT containing normal human fibroblasts, p53-Mut, and p53-Null LFS fibroblasts, formation and removal of CPDs induced by UV at a dose of 20 J·m−2 were mapped by LMPCR, in both strands of exon 8 of p53 from genomic DNA. Under such an exposure condition, no discernible differences in formation of CPDs in genomic DNA could be seen in these three cell lines as measured by immuno-slot blot assay (13.Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, repair of CPDs by LMPCR could be seen at almost all the potential dimer sites of NTS, albeit with a clearly demonstrable variation in the rates of their repair. For example, repair at many sites in p53-WT normal human fibroblasts was apparent after 8 h, followed by an approximately 30–70% repair after 24 h and 60–95% repair after 48 h (Fig. 1 A, Table I). Higher efficiency of removal of CPDs was seen at 5′ side of adjacent pyrimidine sites, e.g.codons 270, 274, and 289. Consistent with earlier observation by Tornaletti and Pfeifer (32.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), repair of CPDs at codon 278, which is one of the frequently mutated in human skin cancers, was slower than those of surrounding positions. However, repair of CPDs (5′-TCTC^C) at codon 289/290 was also found to be slower. It may be noted that this dimer is located at the 3′ end of four adjacent potential pyrimidine sites.Table IRepair of CPDs of exon 8 of p53 genomic DNA in normal and LFS fibroblastsCPD remainingaRepair rates were measured at mutation hotspots (M) and at various surrounding sites.

Open table in a new tab In p53-Null cells, repair of CPDs at most of the dipyrimidine sites of NTS was slower compared with that of the same CPDs at same position in p53-WT cells. Moreover, slow repair sites were more prominently affected (Fig. 1, A and B, Table I). For example, dimer C^CT, at codon 278, was 68% repaired at 24 h and 82% repaired at 48 h in p53-WT cells, whereas in p53-Null cells, there was only 35% and 60% repair observed at these sites within 24 and 48 h, respectively. Repair of CPDs (5′-TCTC^C) at codon 289/290 was also drastically affected by the loss of p53 function (Fig.1 B). These observations were further confirmed by comparison of normal HMEC with HPV 16 E6 protein-expressing HMEC. In the case of 76E6 HMEC, in which p53 protein is degraded by E6 protein-mediated ubiquitin proteolysis pathway (33.Scheffner M. Werness J.M. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar), the overall p53 modulation of DNA repair events appeared exactly like that of p53-Null fibroblast cells described above (redundant data not shown). Among the cell lines tested, repair of CPDs in NTS was most dramatically affected in p53-Mut fibroblasts (Fig. 1 C and Table I). In this cell line, repair of CPDs at all dipyrimidine sites was significantly slow. Approximately 80–100% of CPDs remained after 24 h, and 50–100% of CPDs remained 48 h after UV irradiation. These results, in conjunction with the data from p53-Null cells, indicate that mutant p53 protein affects DNA repair in a dominant negative manner. This would seem to suggest that p53 protein regulates DNA repair, at least of the non-transcribed strand, by direct protein-protein interaction. Such a dominant effect could be exerted by interaction with the proteins of NER assembly or by altered transcription of proteins essential for optimal assembling and targeting of the damage recognition complex. At the position of one potential dipyrimidine site, (5′-C^CTCACC) at codon 295, an abnormal signal was distinctly and reproducibly detected in p53-Null and p53-Mut cells, but not in p53-WT cells (Fig. 1, A–C). Accordingly, a distinct LMPCR generated band could be seen in the control unirradiated sample lane. We surmise that this band could not arise due to nonspecific or enzymatic cleavage as the signal gradually decreased between 4- and 48-h time intervals following irradiation. According to the nature of LMPCR, an assay specialized for detecting nicks in individual DNA strand, this signal could only represent a specific DNA strand break at this site; due to its occurrence within DNA topoisomerase consensus sequence, it could be the result of an arrested cleavable complex. Surprisingly, such an abnormal DNA break signal was also found in HPV 16 E6-expressing HMEC, but not in normal or in HPV 16 E7-expressing HMEC. This further confirmed that the DNA strand break at this codon site is specific and only appears in cells that are rendered deficient for normal p53 function. Interestingly, exposure of cells to UV seemed to induce the repair of this DNA strand break, as was evident from time-dependent gradual disappearance of the band at this site. To examine the effects of loss of normal p53 function on the repair of CPDs within TS, repair of CPDs in TS of exon 8 of p53 gene was mapped by LMPCR (Fig. 2). As expected, removal of CPDs from TS was generally faster than from NTS, albeit with a clearly discernible site-specific variation in the removal of CPDs at individual dipyrimidine sites. Consistent with earlier observation (32.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), repair of CPDs in p53-WT cells at codons 286 and 294 was seen to be slower than that of surrounding positions. A p53-dependent decreased repair of CPDs was found at several sites of exon 8 in both p53-Null and p53-Mut LFS cells at 24 h after UV irradiation. The intrinsically slow repair dipyrimidine sites,e.g. at codons 286 and 294, were preferentially affected by the absence of normal wild type function than surrounding CPD sites (Fig. 2 and Table I). The intrinsically slow repair is suggested to be the basis for mutational predisposition of these p53 gene sites in human cancers (32.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). An absence of p53 function would be expected to further exacerbate the cellular instability through decreased repair of exogenously or endogenously induced DNA damage. Since the effect of loss of p53 function on TCR has not been fully resolved, we extensively mapped repair of CPDs in TS of exon 8 of p53 gene in normal, isogenic HPV 16 E6 and E7 protein-expressing HMECs. It may be noted that HPV 16 E7 protein selectively activates ubiquitin proteolysis pathway causing degradation of pRb protein, while it stabilizes p53 protein (29.Wazer D.E. Liu X.-L. Chu Q. Gao Q. Band V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3687-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The data shows that the repair of CPD was faster in HMEC than fibroblast, and dimers at most of the sites were quantitatively removed within 48 h after UV treatment. Furthermore, unlike normal fibroblasts, slow repair of CPDs within sites like codon 286 and 294 was not very obvious in either the normal or HPV 16 E7 protein-expressing HMEC (Fig.3, A and C). Thus, p53-expressing cells appear to have normal NER despite the absence of a functional pRb protein. On the other hand, a clearly visible slower repair at the same sites was found in p53-compromised HPV 16 E6 protein-expressing HMEC (Fig. 3 B and TableII). This observation further confirmed that loss of functional p53 affects the removal of CPDs from TS by TCR and preferentially affects removal of CPDs at slow repair sites.Table IIRepair of CPDs of exon 8 of p53 genomic DNA in normal, HPV 16 E6 and E7 protein-expressing HMECCPD remaining afterDNACodonSequence (5′–3′)HMEC76E6a76E6 and 76E7 represent HPV 16 E6 and E7 protein-expressing HMEC, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The biochemical mechanisms of NER involve damage recognition and open complex formation by factors such as XPA, RPA, XPC, and transcription factor IIH, dual incision of the damaged DNA strand by endonucleases XPF-ERCC1 and XPG, repair synthesis mediated by a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent DNA polymerase and ligation of newly synthesized DNA strand. The precise reaction mechanisms of NER have recently been established to a significant extent (for review, see Refs. 1.Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. Fundam. Mol. Mech.

Nonetheless, how NER is regulated or connected to other cellular functions still remains to be explored. Several investigators have examined the involvement of p53 in regulation of NER. Different systems and approaches have been used for assessment of DNA repair. Immunoassay was mostly used for direct assessment of GGR, whereas endonuclease-sensitive site assay was used for examination of strand-specific repair. It is becoming clear that functional p53 is required for efficient GGR (13.Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14.Smith M.L. Chen I.-T. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), precise nature of p53 participation in TCR still remains unclear. In this study, we provide the first detailed analysis of effects of loss of functional p53 on the removal of CPDs in both DNA strands at nucleotide resolution. First, the results confirmed that functional p53 is required for efficient GGR (13.Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15.Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33327-33332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results show that expression of mutant p53 protein more significantly affects removal of CPDs from non-transcribed strand than loss of p53 protein, indicating that mutant p53 protein affects GGR in a dominant negative manner. The results also show that p53 is involved in TCR and repair of CPDs at slow repair sites is the first target to sustain meaningful effects due to the loss of p53 function. In a recent review, Mckay et al. (17.McKay B.C. Francis M.A. Rainbow A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have strongly argued that p53 plays a definitive role in TCR. The difference of observations by various laboratories may be the result of different assays used to detect strand-specific repair. Using the normal endonuclease-sensitive site assay, we too were unable to demonstrate any detectable differences in TCR between normal and LFS fibroblasts as well as between normal and HPV 16 E6 protein-expressing HMEC for both UV- and benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-induced DNA damage. 2Q. Zhu, M. A. Wani, M. El-mahdy, and A. A. Wani, unpublished results. Repair differences between cells did not become pronounced and meaningful until full mapping of repair of CPDs in normal, HPV 16 E6 and E7 protein-expressing HMEC was conducted within the same gene segment by LMPCR. The reasons are that (i) LMPCR is a much more powerful assay in demonstrating variations of repair along particular sites and stretches of specific gene sequences, (ii) fully discernible differences were visualized mainly during the initial stages of repair, i.e.before 24-h time points, and (iii) slow repair sites were more prominently subjected to the influence exerted by the loss of p53 function. Several investigations suggest that p53-regulated gene products may participate or be associated with NER. Using host reactivation assay, it has been shown that UV- and heat shock- inducible NER is p53-dependent (14.Smith M.L. Chen I.-T. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 17.McKay B.C. Francis M.A. Rainbow A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that the expression of p53-downstream genes, e.g. p48 gene, was dependent on p53 and involved in GGR (22.Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). It should be noted that p48 has been suggested to have a role in the repair of DNA in chromatin and damage recognition. If effects of loss of function in p53-Null LFS fibroblasts and HPV 16 E6 protein-expressing HMEC on NER reflect requirements of p53-activated downstream genes in NER, dominant negative effects of mutant p53 protein on DNA repair of non-transcribed strand may reflect direct participation of p53 in NER. It has been shown that p53 binds to three components of basal transcription factor: p62, XPD, and XPB (10.Frit P. Bergmann E. Egly J.-M. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, XPB and XPD cells are deficient in repair of non-transcribed DNA and inefficiently repair the transcribed strand including sequences near the transcription start site (34.Tu Y. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, contact with these factors may not be the only mechanism by which p53 directly participates in NER. Given that mutant p53 protein negatively regulates NER by binding XPB and XPD, TCR should be the first target. However, dominant negative effects of mutant p53 protein on DNA repair of non-transcribed strand were more distinctly observed. In fact, wild-type rather than mutant p53 protein has been shown to inhibit DNA helicase activity of XPD and XPB (35.Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In search for the components of NER complex that could be interacting in vivowith p53, we have found that recognition of UV-induced damage links p53 pathway to NER and that HHR23A is involved in regulating transcriptional activity of p53. 3Q. Z. Zhu, M. El-mahdy, M. A. Wani, and A. A. Wani, submitted for publication. Interestingly, it has been shown that XPC protein, complexed with HHR23A and HHR23B, also plays a role in damage recognition and chromatin unfolding (37.Baxter B.K. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17517-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It seems that p53 regulates the early steps of damage recognition of NER or chromatin unfolding during NER processes through both transcription activation and protein-protein interaction. However, no experimental evidence shows that p53 protein recognizes or binds UV-induced CPDs. In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is wrapped around histone octamers forming nucleosomes, which are the repeating units of chromatin. Proteins involved in cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair, require access to DNA within chromatin structural hierarchy. Heterogeneity of NER may partially reflect the accessibility of damaged DNA to NER components. In support of this, very fast repair has been seen in both DNA strands near the transcription initiation site (38.Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that several sequence positions in 5′-flanking region of thetRNAval gene, which lacks TCR, were also repaired more efficiently than the gene itself (38.Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 39.Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the case of a run of potential CPD sites in the non-transcribed DNA strand, if each DNA repair event in GGR is considered as an independent event, as suggested by its biochemical mechanisms, there is no reason for higher efficiency of CPD removal at 5′ end. This is only possible if TCR or transcription somehow helped damaged DNA to become more accessible at 5′ end. Thus, besides transcription coupling, accessibility of damaged DNA contributes a very important parameter to the heterogeneity of NER. In this regard, p53 may regulate NER through modulating accessibility of damaged DNA rather than damage recognition. One would expect that CBP/p300, a p53 coactivator that has been shown to have acetyltransferase activity (36.Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.-Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), could also be involved in p53-regulated DNA repair. Investigation of such DNA repair participating principles should become an area of active interest in the near future. We are grateful to Dr. Aziz Sancar for providing photolyase enzyme and John Croyle for assistance with high resolution image scanning."

In phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 thymoma cells, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinases and promotes cell adhesion. In this study, clonal EL4 cell lines with varying abilities to activate ERKs in response to PMA were used to examine signaling events occurring downstream of ERK activation. Paxillin, a multifunctional docking protein involved in cell adhesion, was phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues in response to PMA treatment. This response was correlated with the extent and time course of ERK activation. PMA-induced phosphorylation of paxillin was inhibited by compounds that block the ERK activation pathway in EL4 cells, primary murine thymocytes, and primary murine splenocytes. Paxillin was phosphorylated in vitro by purified active ERK2. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that PMA treatment generated a complex pattern of phosphorylated paxillin species in intact cells, some of which were generated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation in vitro.

Ligation of integrins on the cell surface initiates a cascade of events referred to as “outside-in” signaling. These events, initiated within the focal adhesion complex, include activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 and protein-protein interactions between focal adhesion components (1.Weisberg E. Sattler M. Ewaniuk D.S. Salgia R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Paxillin, a multifunctional docking protein, binds to FAK and is phosphorylated upon integrin ligation (2.Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 3.Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Additional steps downstream of integrin ligation include activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases (4.Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling events also regulate adhesion, in a process referred to as “inside-out” signaling (5.Longhurst C.M. Jennings L.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For example, receptor-mediated signals can “prime” integrins by increasing their affinity for ligand (6.Wei J. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) can enhance adhesion via a mechanism that does not require direct phosphorylation of integrin subunits (7.Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F. Sonnenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7293-7296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation events involving multiple components of the focal adhesion complex may regulate adhesion (8.Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Adhesion-mediated signaling has been most thoroughly studied in fibroblasts and epithelial cells but is also very important in lymphocytes. Paxillin is phosphorylated upon adhesion of mature T-cells to fibronectin (11.Miron S. Kachalsky S.G. Hershkoviz R. Lider O. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) or P-selectin (12.Haller H. Kunzendorf U. Sacherer K. Lindschau C. Walz G. Distler A. Luft F.C. J.

Med. 1996; 184: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although paxillin is a well characterized substrate for the tyrosine kinases FAK and Pyk2, it is also phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues in response to adhesion (3.Turner C.E. Int. J.

Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11016-11022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The functional roles of these phosphorylation events and the kinases involved have not been fully elucidated. Our laboratory has utilized EL4, a murine thymoma cell line, as a model system in which to explore the relationship between activations of PKC isoforms and ERK mitogen-activated kinases. EL4 cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant to the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) have been described by our laboratory and others. In EL4 cells, PMA resistance is defined as a phenotype that confers resistance to the toxic effects of PMA. In PMA-sensitive EL4 cells, activation of PKC leads to the activation of ERKs (15.Meier K.E. Licciardi K.A. Haystead T.A.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to other downstream responses, including IL-2 expression (16.Farrar J.J. Ruller-Farrar J. Simon P.L. Hilfiker M.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2470-2476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PMA-induced cell death is blocked by PD98059, an inhibitor of the MEK/ERK pathway, in PMA-sensitive cells (18.Sansbury H.M. Fulwood S. Wisehart-Johnson A.E. Qi C. Meier K.E. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ERK activation results in growth arrest has not been delineated. In contrast, in PMA-resistant EL4 cells, PMA activates PKC isoforms but causes little or no ERK activation. The molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance to ERK activation appear to involve steps upstream of Raf-1 activation (22.Richardson A.F. Sando J.J. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23.Gause K.C. Homma M.K. Licciardi K.A. Seger R. Ahn N.G. Peterson M.J. Krebs E.G. Meier K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16124-16129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several phenotypic differences have been noted between sensitive and resistant cells, including a higher level of expression of PKCε in sensitive cells (23.Gause K.C. Homma M.K. Licciardi K.A.

Hahn C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27654-27661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). None of these differences has been shown to be responsible for the defect in ERK activation in resistant cells. Regardless of the mechanisms involved in PMA resistance, EL4 cell lines can provide useful models in which to explore the roles of ERK activation in downstream responses. One of the responses of sensitive EL4 cells to PMA is enhanced adherence to tissue culture substrate (21.Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton E.G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized PMA-sensitive and -resistant EL4 cell lines to demonstrate a role for ERKs in regulating the phosphorylation state of paxillin. EL4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology), nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin. The clonal cell lines WT2 and V7, derived by limiting dilution of WT and PV cells, 2H. M. Sansbury, H. Ku, S. M. Knoepp, and K. E. Meier, manuscript in preparation. were maintained in suspension culture dishes (Corning) and tissue culture flasks (Falcon), respectively. V7 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes (4 × 106 cells/5 ml) 2 days before experiments, while WT2 cells were maintained at <2 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were cultured without serum for 18 h before experiments. Thymocytes and splenocytes were prepared from thymi and spleens, respectively, of 6–8-week-old BDF1 mice (Jackson Laboratories), purified over a 1.080 g/ml OptiPrep gradient (Nycomed Pharma), and washed twice with RPMI. Reagent sources (and solvents) were as follows: PMA, Calbiochem (ethanol); PD98059, Calbiochem (Me2SO); U0126, Promega (Me2SO). Growing cells (≥95% viability) were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at 2 × 105 cells/well with 2 ml of complete medium. Cells were incubated with 100 nm PMA or 0.1% ethanol (vehicle) at 37 °C for varying times. Cell number was determined by counting trypan blue-excluding cells, using a hemacytometer. Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (20.Rayter S.I. Woodrow M. Lucas S.C. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4549-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1200 × g. Any adherent cells were collected by scraping. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Extracts were sedimented at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The insoluble pellet did not contain significant amounts of FAK or paxillin. 3H. Ku and K. E. Meier, unpublished observations. Samples of 100 μg of protein, as determined by a Coomassie protein assay (Pierce), were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% Laemmli gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper, incubated with antibodies, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibody sources were as follows: phospho-ERK, Promega; ERK1, Santa Cruz (recognizes ERK1 and ERK2); paxillin, Transduction Laboratories (recognizes paxillin and Hic-5) and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); phosphotyrosine, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (4G10). Blots were imaged by densitometry. For immunoprecipitations, whole-cell extracts (1000 μg in 1 ml) were precleared with protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or protein G (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were added and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with mixing. Protein A- or protein G-agarose was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. For some experiments, immunoprecipitates from samples containing 250 μg of protein were treated with or without 1 unit of calf intestine phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and processed for immunoblotting. Paxillin, immunoprecipitated from whole-cell extract (250 μg of protein), was incubated with active GST-ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or active ERK2 (Calbiochem) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 4 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 μm PKC inhibitor (RFARKGALRQKNV), 1 μmprotein kinase A inhibitor (TTYHDFIASGRTGRRNAIHD), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 50 μm ATP (with or without [γ-32P]ATP; NEN Life Science Products). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, or drying and autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (25.Alexander K.A. Cimler B. Meier K.E. Storm D.R J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V7 cells (100-mm dish) were serum-starved for 13 h and then incubated in 5 ml of phosphate-free buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 136 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 0.33 mmCaCl2, 1 g/liter glucose) for 1 h. [32P]Orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and then with or without 100 nm PMA for 15 min. Paxillin was immunoprecipitated as described above. Whole-cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer containing 8 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 1% dithiothreitol, 1.5% Pharmalyte (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and bromphenol blue. For some experiments, paxillin immunoprecipitates were resuspended in this lysis buffer. For the first dimension, lysates (400 μg of protein) or immunoprecipitates were applied to Immobiline Dry Strips (pH 4–7) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to flat bed electrophoresis for 3 h at 500 V and then for 16 h at 3500 V. For the second dimension, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% Laemmli gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for autoradiography and/or immunoblotting. WT2 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in quadruplicate in 24-well tissue culture plates containing complete medium. PD98059 (50 μm) or vehicle (0.2% Me2SO) was added for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by PMA (100 nm) or vehicle (0.2% ethanol) for 60 min. Cells were gently washed four times with 0.5 ml of medium. Attached cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin and counted using a hemacytometer. Photomicroscopy was performed using a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with Hoffman interference optics. In our efforts to better define the basis of PMA sensitivity and resistance in EL4 cells, a series of clonal cell lines was developed. Cell lines derived from our original PMA-sensitive cell line were designated “WT” (wild type). A flask of nonclonal WT cells maintained on standard tissue culture plastic underwent a spontaneous shift in phenotype, observed as increased adherence to substrate. This cell line, designated as “PV,” was retained and used to derive clonal lines designated as “V” (variant). Clonal cell lines were incubated with and without 100 nm PMA to establish their phenotypes (Fig.1). PMA inhibited proliferation of all WT-derived clones, indicating that they were PMA-sensitive. PV-derived clones V5, V7, V9, and V11 continued to proliferate in the presence of PMA, indicating that they were PMA-resistant. Clone V3 and V10 cells proliferated slowly and showed partial sensitivity to PMA. Subsequent studies examined the phenotypes of the clonal cell lines in more detail. The ability of PMA to induce ERK activation was examined in clonal EL4 cell lines by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Protein levels for ERK1 and ERK2 were similar between all cell lines tested, with ERK2 being the predominant isoform (see legend to Fig. 2). PMA induced robust ERK activation in all of the WT-derived clones, as indicated by the appearance of phosphorylated active ERK. Clones V3 and V10 likewise responded to PMA with ERK activation. V3 and V10 thus exhibit an intermediate phenotype, since they survive in the presence of PMA (Fig. 1) despite ERK activation (Fig. 2). The other PMA-resistant clones (V5, V7, V9, and V11) showed little or no ERK activation when treated with 100 nm PMA for 15 min. As discussed above, the PMA-resistant clones were derived from a variant cell line that showed increased adhesion. We therefore examined the expression of proteins involved in adhesion-mediated signal transduction. One of these proteins was paxillin. Paxillin, migrating at ∼59 kDa, was expressed at similar levels in PMA-sensitive and -resistant clones (Fig. 2). The calculated size of human paxillin (GenBankTM accession no. P49023) is 61 kDa. Phosphorylation of paxillin results in the appearance of multiple species of lower mobility on SDS-PAGE (i.e. “gel shift”) (25.Alexander K.A. Cimler B. Meier K.E. Storm D.R J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PMA induced shifts in paxillin mobility in all clones examined. However, the shifts were most extensive (i.e. to ∼72 kDa) in clones in which ERKs were activated. In clones V5, V7, V9, and V11, which were resistant to ERK activation, only partial shifts in paxillin mobility occurred in response to PMA. These data suggested that phosphorylation of paxillin was correlated with ERK activation. A second protein of ∼47 kDa was recognized in WT-derived cells by the anti-paxillin antibody. This protein also shifted in mobility in response to PMA (Fig. 2). Hic-5 (GenBankTM accession no.L22482), a paxillin homolog, has a calculated size of 48 kDa, is recognized by the anti-paxillin antibody used here, and undergoes mobility shifts upon phosphorylation (27.Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitakia T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Leupaxin (GenBankTM accession no. AF062075), another paxillin homolog, is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells (28.Lipsky B.P. Beals C.R. Staunton D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11709-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but is 44 kDa in size. The 47-kDa protein may thus represent murine Hic-5 or a related protein. WT2 and V7 were chosen as representative PMA-sensitive and -resistant cell lines, respectively, for further studies. Paxillin family members are substrates for the tyrosine kinases FAK and Pyk2. Additional work with EL4 clones has established that only PMA-resistant cells (e.g. V7) and not PMA-sensitive cells (e.g. WT2) express FAK.2Thus, FAK is not required for PMA-induced phosphorylation of paxillin. Although both sensitive and resistant EL4 cells express Pyk2, PMA does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in either cell type.2 These observations prompted us to search for alternative pathways for the observed PMA-induced phosphorylation of paxillin. In order to examine the relationship between ERK activation and paxillin phosphorylation, we compared PMA-induced ERK activation between WT2 and V7 clones in more detail (Fig.3 A). Immunoblotting of whole-cell extracts with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies revealed rapid and prolonged activation of ERKs in WT2 cells. ERK activation was greatly attenuated in V7 cells, consistent with Fig. 2 and with previous data for other PMA-resistant cell lines (19.Pearlstein K.T. Staiano-Coico L. Miller R.A. Pelus L.M. Kirch M.E. Stutman O. Palladino M.A. J. Natl. Can. Inst. 1983; 71: 583-590PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Gause K.C. Homma M.K. Licciardi K.A. Seger R. Ahn N.G. Peterson M.J. Krebs E.G. Meier K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16124-16129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the time course of ERK activation differed between the two clonal cell lines. PMA (100 nm) induced maximal ERK phosphorylation within 1 min in WT2, while ERK activation was maximal, albeit weak, after 15 min in V7. Thus, V7 cells are not completely refractory to PMA. Rather, PMA-induced ERK activation is delayed and blunted in comparison with that seen in WT2 cells. In the same experiment, paxillin phosphorylation was examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). Partial shifts in paxillin mobility occurred in WT2 cells within 1 min after PMA addition. Additional species (∼72 kDa) appeared by 30 min, with complete loss of the lower and presumably unphosphorylated ∼59-kDa band. Thus, PMA induced a rapid and progressive phosphorylation of paxillin in WT2 cells. In contrast, PMA-induced shifts were delayed (>15 min) in V7 cells. The extent of the shift was less complete in V7 than in WT2 cells, such that the unphosphorylated 59-kDa band was present in V7 cells throughout the incubation. These data show that paxillin phosphorylation is correlated with ERK activation in both EL4 clones but is much more extensive in WT2 than in V7 cells. Treatment of paxillin immunoprecipitates from PMA-treated cells with calf intestinal phosphatase resulted in loss of the lower mobility bands from both WT2 and V7 cells (Fig. 3 B), confirming that the gel shifts were due to phosphorylation. The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was examined (Fig.3 C). In WT2 cells, PMA treatment induced a weak and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at 15 min. In contrast, paxillin gel shifts were sustained for at least 180 min after the addition of PMA to WT2 cells. In V7 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was seen in untreated cells but not in PMA-treated cells. The absence of significant PMA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in either cell line suggested that the bulk of the observed phosphorylation occurred on serine/threonine residues. The differences in the time course for PMA-induced ERK activation between WT2 and V7 cells (Fig. 3) suggested that the pathways mediating PMA response might differ between the two cell lines. The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in these pathways was therefore investigated. The dose response for PMA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in WT2 and V7 cells is shown in Fig.4. The basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly lower in V7 cells than in WT2 cells (Fig.4 A). This difference has been noted previously between other PMA-sensitive and -resistant cell lines (22.Richardson A.F. Sando J.J. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The factors responsible for this difference have not been elucidated. Notably, maximal phosphorylation of both ERKs and paxillin was achieved with lower doses of PMA in WT2 cells (1 nm PMA) than in V7 cells (0.1 μm PMA). Protein-tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors were used to further examine the potential role of tyrosine phosphorylation in PMA response. In WT2 cells, genistein partially inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK in response to PMA treatment (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, genistein almost completely blocked the ability of PMA to stimulate ERK phosphorylation in V7 cells (Fig. 4 A). Genistein also attenuated PMA-induced phosphorylation of paxillin in V7. Interestingly, in WT2 cells, genistein reduced the extent of the paxillin phosphorylation induced by PMA (i.e. the ∼72-kDa species was absent) but did not block the response. In WT2, phosphorylation of the 47-kDa paxillin homolog was also reduced by genistein. Dephostatin, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, had no effect on phosphorylation of ERK or paxillin in WT2 cells (Fig.4 B). In contrast, dephostatin (>10 μm) inhibited both events in V7 cells (Fig. 4 B). Thus, although PMA can induce ERK activation in both cell lines, the response appears more dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in V7 than in WT2 cells. More importantly, the data shown in Fig. 4 provide further evidence that ERK activation is correlated with paxillin phosphorylation in EL4 cells. We next examined whether paxillin phosphorylation occurred upstream or downstream of ERK activation. When WT2 and V7 cells were pretreated for 90 min with 50 μm PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK activation (29.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar), PMA-induced ERK2 phosphorylation was completely inhibited (Fig. 5 A). PD98059 reduced paxillin phosphorylation in WT2 cells and abolished this response in V7 cells. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting was used to confirm the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in paxillin phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). In V7 cells, PD98059 completely inhibited PMA-induced phosphorylation of paxillin. In WT2 cells, although the maximal PMA-induced shift in paxillin (∼72-kDa band) was prevented by PD98059, partial shifts still occurred. These data suggest that PMA-induced phosphorylation of paxillin involves kinase(s) in addition to MEK/ERK but that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is required for maximal phosphorylation. Thus, paxillin phosphorylation occurs downstream of ERK activation. EL4 is a transformed murine cell line that retains characteristics typical of T lymphocytes. We therefore asked whether ERK-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin also occurs in primary lymphocytes. In murine thymic lymphocytes (Fig.6 A), PMA-induced ERK2 activation was maximal by 1 min and then gradually declined. Paxillin mobility shifts were observed by 1 min but became more extensive after 15–30 min. Interestingly, the uppermost bands seen at 15–30 min in thymocytes were not observed in PMA-treated WT2 EL4 cells. Thymocytes were next incubated with PMA in the absence and presence of two MEK inhibitors. U0126 is an alternative inhibitor of MEK activation (30.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Both U0126 and PD98059 inhibited ERK activation and paxillin phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). U0126 was more potent than PD98059, in accordance with published data (30.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F.

Paxillin phosphorylation was also examined in murine splenocytes (Fig.6 B). PMA-induced phosphorylation of paxillin was inhibited by PD98059 and U0126 in splenocytes, as was the case in thymocytes. These data indicate that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin occurs in at least two types of primary lymphocytes. Paxillin and its homologs are proline-rich proteins that contain numerous consensus sites, (S/T)P (31.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar), for potential phosphorylation by ERKs. The possibility that paxillin served as an ERK substrate was therefore examined. Paxillin was immunoprecipitated from untreated WT2 cells, incubated with recombinant active GST-ERK2 in the absence and presence of Mg-ATP, and subjected to immunoblotting (Fig.7 A). In the presence of Mg-ATP and active GST-ERK2, paxillin and the 47-kDa protein were phosphorylated, as assessed by gel shifts. Paxillin from V7 cells was also phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro, indicating that similar phosphorylation sites exist in both cell types. The reagent concentrations used here were optimized for maximal phosphorylation (data not shown). Nonetheless, phosphorylation of paxillin in vitro did not replicate the maximal shift seen in intact PMA-treated WT2 cells. Further verification of ERK-mediated phosphorylation was obtained from an in vitro reaction utilizing [32P]ATP and active ERK2. Phosphate was incorporated into paxillin in the presence of active ERK2 and ATP (Fig. 7 B). The32P-labeled band co-migrated with the major phosphorylated bands detected by immunoblotting, confirming that the gel shift was due to phosphorylation by ERK2. Phosphoamino acid analysis results (data not shown) showed phosphorylation of paxillin on serine/threonine, with no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation. We next asked whether paxillin species that were phosphorylated by ERK in vitro were also phosphorylated in intact cells. Due to the complexity of the phosphorylation pattern observed for paxillin on one-dimensional gels, we utilized two-dimensional PAGE to visualize the full spectrum of paxillin species with high resolution (Fig. 8,A–D). An extremely complex pattern of paxillin species was seen on two-dimensional gels, even in u"

Previous investigations have indicated that calcium spirulan (Ca-SP), a novel sulfated polysaccharide, enhanced the rate of inhibition of α-thrombin by HCII. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the activation of HCII by Ca-SP. Interestingly, in the presence of Ca-SP, an N-terminal deletion mutant of HCII (rHCII-Δ74) inhibited α-thrombin, as native recombinant HCII (native rHCII) did. The second-order rate constant for the inhibition of α-thrombin by rHCII-Δ74 was 2.0 × 108m−1 min−1 in the presence of 50 μg/ml Ca-SP and 10,000-fold higher than in the absence of Ca-SP. The rates of native rHCII and rHCII-Δ74 for the inhibition of γ-thrombin were increased only 80- and 120-fold, respectively. Our results suggested that the anion-binding exosite I of α-thrombin was essential for the rapid inhibition reaction by HCII in the presence of Ca-SP and that the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII was not required. Therefore, we proposed a mechanism by which HCII was activated allosterically by Ca-SP and could interact with the anion-binding exosite I of thrombin not through the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII. The Arg103 → Leu mutant bound to Ca-SP-Toyopearl with normal affinity and inhibited α-thrombin in a manner similar to native rHCII.

Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Besides its critical role in hemostasis, thrombin elicits cellular responses through the thrombin receptor that may contribute to inflammation, wound healing, and atherosclerosis (2.Coughlin S.R. Vu T.K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Heparin cofactor II (HCII)1 is an important plasma protein that selectively inhibits thrombin (3.Tollefsen D. Petska C. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of sulfated polysaccharides in addition to heparin and dermatan sulfate catalyze HCII to accelerate markedly the reaction of HCII with thrombin (4.Ciaccia A.V. Monroe D.M. Church F.C. J.

Jurd K.M. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Calcium spirulan (Ca-SP) is a novel sulfated polysaccharide isolated from a blue-green alga Spirulina platensis by Hayashi et al. (8.Hayashi K. Hayashi T. Morita N. Kojima I. Phytother. Res. 1993; 7: 76-80Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9.Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Maeda M. Kojima I. J. Nat. Prod. 1996; 59: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). They reported an inhibitory effect of Ca-SP on the replication of enveloped viruses. We have recently showed that Ca-SP enhances the rate of inhibition of thrombin by HCII and that the molecular conformation maintained by calcium ions is essential to exhibit antithrombin activity (10.Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Ozawa T. Niiya K. Sakuragawa N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of activation of HCII by Ca-SP has not been clarified. Current evidence suggests that binding of either heparin or dermatan sulfate to HCII displaces the N-terminal acidic domain of the inhibitor, which normally occupies the glycosaminoglycan-binding site. The N-terminal acidic domain then binds to the anion-binding exosite I of thrombin, facilitating proteolytic attack on the reactive site peptide bond of HCII (11.Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Deletions within the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII markedly reduced the rate of α-thrombin inhibition in the presence of either heparin or dermatan sulfate (12.Ragg H. Ulshöfer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Ragg H. Ulshöfer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol.

The rates for inhibition of the mutants within anion-binding exosite I on thrombin and γ-thrombin by HCII also reduced markedly in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate (15.Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Phillips J.E. Shirk R.A. Whinna H.C. Henriksen R.A. Church F.C. J. Biol.

These experiments provide strong support for the allosteric mechanism described above. Moreover, it has been reported recently that a variety of sulfated polyanions stimulate HCII by a mechanism requiring the N-terminal acidic domain (19.Colwell N.S. Grupe M.J. Tollefsen D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the mechanism by which Ca-SP stimulates HCII, we have constructed a deletion mutant of the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII (rHCII-Δ74) and determined the effect of Ca-SP on the rate of inhibition of α-thrombin by rHCII-Δ74 in comparison with native recombinant HCII (native rHCII). In the presence of Ca-SP, rHCII-Δ74 inhibited α-thrombin in the same manner as native rHCII. Our results suggest that the stimulatory effect of Ca-SP is not mediated through the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII. The experiments using γ-thrombin suggest that anion-binding exosite I of α-thrombin plays an important role in the stimulation of the thrombin inhibition by Ca-SP. The results of previous experiments using recombinant variant forms of HCII have suggested that the binding sites for heparin and dermatan sulfate are overlapped in part but are not identical (20.Blinder M.A. Andersson T.R. Abildgaard U. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5128-5133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Blinder M.A. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8129-8135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous report has indicated that the binding site of HCII for Ca-SP is neither the heparin- (Lys173) nor dermatan sulfate-binding site (Arg189) (10.Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Ozawa T. Niiya K. Sakuragawa N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on alignment of the amino acid sequence, HCII contains Arg103 in a position homologous to Arg47 of antithrombin (AT) (23.Blinder M.A. Marasa J.C. Reynolds C.H. Deaven L.L. Tollefsen D.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations at Arg47 have been discovered in AT, and the mutant molecules lose the abilities to bind to heparin and accelerate the thrombin inhibition by heparin (24.Koide T. Odani S. Takahashi K. Ono T. Sakuragawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that Arg103 of HCII does not play a major role in the binding of heparin and dermatan sulfate to HCII (21.Blinder M.A. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that Arg103 in HCII molecule is not required for Ca-SP binding and Ca-SP-dependent thrombin inhibition. Human α-thrombin was purchased from Sigma. Human γ-thrombin was from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Heparin (bovine lung) and dermatan sulfate (pig skin) were from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Chromogenic substrate S-2238 was from Kabi-Vitrum (Stockholm, Sweden). Calcium spirulan was isolated from S. platensis and purified as described previously (25.Lee J.-B. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Sankawa U. Maeda M. Nemoto T. Nakanishi H. J. Nat. Prod. 1998; 61: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The purified Ca-SP was homogenous on high performance liquid chromatography analysis and composed of rhamnose, 3-O-methylrhamnose, 2,3-di-O-methylrhamnose, 3-O-methylxylose, uronic acids, and sulfate. The backbone of Ca-SP consisted of 1,3-linked rhamnose and 1,2-linked 3-O-methylrhamnose units with some sulfate substitution at the 4-position. We previously described the construction of the vector pYT/WT for the expression of native recombinant HCII (26.Hayashi T. Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Sasaki H. Sakuragawa N. Thromb. Res. 1997; 87: 105-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Deletion mutation was constructed in native pYT/WT vector using the polymerase chain reaction-based QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers (obtained from Grainer Japan, Tokyo, Japan) used for deletion were as follows, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGGACATCGTCGACAGT-3′ and 5′-CAGACTGTCGACGATGTCCATAGCTGTTTCCTG-3′. The obtained deleted plasmid was named pYM/Δ74. The native pYT/WT was performed mutagenesis for Arg103 → Leu using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit; mutagenic primers used in this procedure were 5′-CATGGCAAGAGCCTGATCCAGCGTCTTAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTAAGACGCTGGATCAGGCTCTTGCCATG-3′. The nucleotides in italics indicate the site of codon substitution. The final constructs were confirmed by sequencing using the chain termination method of Sanger et al. (27.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Recombinant HCII was expressed in Escherichia coli MV1184 cells and purified from the cell lysates as described previously (10.Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Ozawa T. Niiya K. Sakuragawa N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit. Thrombin inhibition assay was performed at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% BSA (assay buffer). The second-order rate constant (k 2) of thrombin inhibition by HCII was determined as follows. In the case ofk 2 <1 × 107m−1 min−1, HCII (150–600 nm native rHCII or rHCII-Δ74) and thrombin (1.9 nm α-thrombin or 13 nm γ-thrombin) were incubated with or without heparin, dermatan sulfate, or Ca-SP in 1 ml of assay buffer. Samples (each 200 μl) were removed at appropriate intervals, and then 50 μl of 1 mg/ml S-2238 was added. The residual thrombin activity was determined by measuring the change in the absorbance at 405 nm. The apparent first-order rate constants (k obs) for thrombin inhibition were determined by fitting the data to the following equation:k obs t = ln([E]0/[E]t), in which [E]0 is the initial thrombin activity and [E]t is the thrombin activity at timet. The second-order rate constants (k 2) were calculated by dividingk obs by the initial concentration of rHCII. In the case of k 2 ≧ 1 × 107m−1 min−1,k 2 values for thrombin inhibition by HCII were calculated by a single incubation time point (20 s incubation), as described previously (10.Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Ozawa T. Niiya K. Sakuragawa N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The concentration of rHCIIs used in this experiment was 15 nm. A suspension of 2 g of AF-amino Toyopearl 650M gel (Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in 2 ml of 0.2 mK2HPO4 containing 60 mg of Ca-SP and 20 mg of NaCNBH3 (Sigma) was incubated at room temperature for 3 days with shaking. After this coupling reaction, the gel was washed with H2O, 0.5 m NaCl/0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl/acetate buffer, pH 4, and H2O, successively. To remove free amino groups remaining in the gel, the gel was acetylated with acetic anhydride in 0.2m sodium acetate. The relative affinity of native rHCII and Arg103 → Leu mutant for immobilized Ca-SP was determined using the Ca-SP-Toyopearl column. The samples in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl were loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of 50 mm to 0.5m. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and were analyzed by thrombin inhibition assays in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml Ca-SP, as described above. Native recombinant HCII (native rHCII) and the N-terminal deletion mutant (rHCII-Δ74) were purified from bacterial lysates and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). Each purified rHCII molecule showed a single band corresponding to the predicted size of the non-glycosylated polypeptide (∼60 kDa for native rHCII and 45 kDa for rHCII-Δ74). As reported previously, Ca-SP markedly enhanced the antithrombin activity of HCII (plasma HCII and native rHCII) (10.Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Ozawa T. Niiya K. Sakuragawa N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca-SP, rHCII-Δ74 inhibited α-thrombin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it could hardly inhibit α-thrombin in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate under the experimental conditions (Fig.2). We then measured the second-order rate constant for inhibition of α-thrombin by rHCII-Δ74 in the presence of Ca-SP. Fig. 3 shows that rHCII-Δ74 exhibits typical bell-shaped curves for inhibition of α-thrombin in the presence of increasing concentration of Ca-SP. The optimal Ca-SP concentration was 50 μg/ml, which was identical for native rHCII (10.Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Ozawa T. Niiya K. Sakuragawa N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the Ca-SP concentration, the rate constant for the inhibition of α-thrombin by native rHCII was 4.3 × 108m−1 min−1 (see Table I). The rate constant by rHCII-Δ74 was 2.0 × 108m−1 min−1 and was 10,000-fold higher than in the absence of Ca-SP. In contrast to the effect of Ca-SP, heparin or dermatan sulfate increased only 55- and 4-fold, respectively, at their optimal concentration. The concentration of Ca-SP that gave 50% inhibition of α-thrombin (IC50) with rHCII-Δ74 was approximately 0.1 μg/ml, similar to that of native rHCII (Fig. 4). Thus, rHCII-Δ74 behaved in a manner similar to native rHCII in the presence of Ca-SP. These results indicate that Ca-SP-accelerated thrombin inhibition is not mediated through the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII.Figure 2Inhibition of α-thrombin by rHCII -Δ74 in the presence of Ca-SP. Purified rHCII-Δ74 (0–50 μl) was incubated with α-thrombin (1.9 nm) in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml Ca-SP (●), 25 μg/ml heparin (▵), or 250 μg/ml dermatan sulfate (■) in 200 μl of assay buffer at room temperature.

Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the k 2, values presented were the mean of at least three determinations. γ-Thrombin is a proteolytic derivative lacking residues in anion-binding exosite I (28.Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The second-order rate constants for inhibition of α-thrombin and γ-thrombin by native rHCII and rHCII-Δ74 are summarized in Table I. In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, the rate of inhibition of γ-thrombin by native rHCII was 10-fold less than that of α-thrombin, whereas rHCII-Δ74 inhibited γ-thrombin at a rate constant similar to that for α-thrombin. These results suggest that, without glycosaminoglycan, native rHCII interacts weakly with anion-binding exosite I. The rate of inhibition of α-thrombin by native rHCII and rHCII-Δ74 increased 3000–10,000-fold in the presence of Ca-SP. By contrast, the rate of inhibition of γ-thrombin was increased only 80–120-fold by Ca-SP. Thus, in the presence of Ca-SP, deletion of the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII does not affect the maximum rate of reaction, but deletion of anion-binding exosite I of thrombin greatly reduces the reaction rate. These experiments indicate that anion-binding exosite I is required for rapid inhibition of α-thrombin by native rHCII and rHCII-Δ74 in the presence of Ca-SP. In order to investigate the binding site of HCII to Ca-SP, we prepared the Arg103 → Leu mutant of HCII. Native rHCII and the Arg103 → Leu mutant were subjected to Ca-SP-Toyopearl chromatography to determine their relative affinities for Ca-SP. Native rHCII and the Arg103 → Leu mutant were eluted from the column with a peak at 0.2 mNaCl, suggesting that the positive charge of this residue is not necessary for the interaction with Ca-SP (Fig.5). In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, the Arg103 → Leu variant had a second-order rate constant for α-thrombin inhibition of 1.6 × 105m−1min−1 which was similar to that of native rHCII. The effect of Ca-SP on the α-thrombin inhibition by the Arg103 → Leu variant is shown in Fig.6. The mutation Arg103 → Leu did not affect the ability of Ca-SP to accelerate the inhibition of α-thrombin. This result is consistent with the data from the affinity chromatography which indicate that the variant binds normally to Ca-SP. Thus, Arg103 in HCII molecule is probably not critical for both Ca-SP binding and Ca-SP-dependent thrombin inhibition.Figure 6Effects of Ca-SP concentration on the inhibition of α-thrombin by the Arg103 → Leu variant.Incubations were performed with rHCIIs (20 nm) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. ●, native rHCII; ○, rHCII (Arg103 → Leu). A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been known that the major effect of glycosaminoglycan binding to HCII is to promote the inhibition of thrombin allosterically (11.Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The HCII-glycosaminoglycan complex interacts with thrombin anion-binding exosite I, probably through the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII (14.Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that rHCII-Δ74 inhibits α-thrombin in the presence of Ca-SP indicates that Ca-SP-accelerated thrombin inhibition is not mediated through the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII. The experiments with γ-thrombin indicate that anion-binding exosite I on thrombin plays an important role in the mechanism of inhibition of thrombin by HCII in the presence of Ca-SP. Therefore, we propose that the stimulation of the thrombin-HCII reaction by Ca-SP can occur by the following mechanism. HCII is activated allosterically by Ca-SP, and the HCII·Ca-SP complex interacts with thrombin anion-binding exosite I. This interaction could facilitate the formation of a stable complex by binding the active site of thrombin into approximation with the reactive site of HCII. However, the interaction is independent on the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII. γ-Thrombin is a proteolytically cleaved form of α-thrombin that has a reduced affinity for hirudin but retains the ability to hydrolyze synthetic peptide substrates and to bind heparin (28.Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Heparin stimulates inhibition of both α-thrombin and γ-thrombin by AT 5000-fold (29.Church F.C. Pratt C.W. Noyes C.M. Kalayanamit T. Sherrill G.B. Tobin R.B. Meade J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, Ca-SP stimulated inhibition of γ-thrombin by native rHCII and rHCII-Δ74 only 80–120-fold (for inhibition of α-thrombin; 3000–10,000-fold). In addition, heparin and dermatan sulfate stimulated the γ-thrombin inhibition only 2–12-fold. AT has been proposed to employ a template mechanism that requires a glycosaminoglycan-binding site on thrombin (i.e. anion-binding exosite II) for heparin-stimulated inhibition of thrombin (30.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the contribution of anion-binding exosite II to the reaction with HCII by Ca-SP has not been investigated, our data could not exclude a template mechanism. The template mechanism may explain the modest increase in the rate of inhibition of γ-thrombin by native rHCII and rHCII-Δ74. Since the ability of Ca-SP to stimulate the inhibition of γ-thrombin is higher than those of heparin or dermatan sulfate, Ca-SP may form a better template. The Lys165 to Phe195 region of HCII has been suggested to be the glycosaminoglycan-binding site (22.Whinna H.C. Blinder M.A. Szewczyk M. Tollefsen D.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8129-8135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the displacement mechanism, the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII occupies the glycosaminoglycan-binding site in the absence of glycosaminoglycan. The result that rHCII-Δ74 inhibits α-thrombin in the presence of Ca-SP raises the possibility that the binding site of HCII for Ca-SP is not included in the glycosaminoglycan-binding site (the Lys165 to Phe195 region). Furthermore, our previous report has indicated that the binding site of HCII for Ca-SP is neither the heparin- (Lys173) nor dermatan sulfate-binding site (Arg189) (10.Hayakawa Y. Hayashi T. Hayashi T. Hayashi K. Ozawa T. Niiya K. Sakuragawa N. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). AT does not contain a domain corresponding to the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII, and the Arg47 in AT molecule has been known as a heparin-binding site (24.Koide T. Odani S. Takahashi K. Ono T. Sakuragawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We thus performed mutagenesis at the homologous position in HCII (Arg103). However, our results indicate that Arg103 is not critical for both HCII binding to Ca-SP and thrombin inhibition mediated by Ca-SP. The binding site should be determined in further experiments. In summary, we propose a mechanism for the activation of HCII by Ca-SP in which the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII is not required. Fibrin-bound thrombin is resistant to inactivation by AT or HCII in the presence of heparin due to the formation of thrombin-heparin-fibrin ternary complexes (31.Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Labanowski J.K. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26088-26095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, because fibrin binds exosite I on thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin is more resistant to inhibition by HCII than by AT (32.Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6226-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been reported that covalent conjugation of HCII and dermatan sulfate may be superior for the inhibition of clot-associated coagulant activity (33.Monagle P. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Andrew M. Chan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33566-33571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since the inhibition of thrombin by HCII activated with Ca-SP does not require the N-terminal acidic domain, Ca-SP-activated HCII may play an important role in the inhibition of fibrin-bound thrombin. Proteolyzed forms of α-thrombin have been proposed to exist in vivoand could participate in either physiological or pathological events (34.Fenton J.W., II Ofosu F.A. Moon D.G. Maraganore J.M. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1991; 2: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As has been shown here, Ca-SP stimulates the inhibition of γ-thrombin by HCII as compared with heparin or dermatan sulfate. Thus, the revelation of the mechanism of activation of HCII by Ca-SP may provide new avenues for development of antithrombotic agents.

Following the release of the clamp loader from the clamp, the catalytic core polymerase subassembly (pol III core) within pol III holoenzyme couples with the β clamp at the 3′ terminus to form a highly processive polymerase (9.O'Donnell M.E.

A. 1984; 81: 7747-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Chromosome replication is performed by the large pol III holoenzyme assembly, which contains two catalytic cores, one clamp loader, and two β clamps (1.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed.

The τ dimer organizes the structure, as it holds together two molecules of pol III core and associates with one molecule of the γ complex. This assembly is referred to as pol III* and has the composition (α1ε1θ1)2τ2γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1(13.Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Hence, other subunits and ATP are needed for the organizational task of positioning DNA inside the open ring and reclosing the β clamp around DNA. In the γ complex, the δ subunit is sequestered from interaction with β (22.Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Upon binding ATP, the γ complex undergoes a conformational change that exposes δ for interaction with β, whereupon the clamp opens, and the ATP·γ complex·β composite binds DNA (8.Hingorani M.M.

Hydrolysis of ATP is required for the clamp to close around DNA and to effect the dissociation of the γ complex from β (7.Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M.

Two molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed in a sequential fashion during the clamp loading process (49.Hingorani M.M. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5131-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This study examines the γ complex for ability to assemble β onto different DNA structures. Overall, the γ complex can act on a surprisingly wide array of DNA templates. We found that on a flush primed site, the γ complex exhibits polarity, utilizing the primer/template junction at the 3′-end of the primer during the clamp assembly process. However, the 3′ terminus of the primed site does not need to be annealed to the template strand. Indeed, no ends are required for the γ complex to assemble β onto DNA; a ssDNA/dsDNA junction appears to be a sufficient substrate upon which the γ complex may load β. Although the γ complex can assemble β onto a 10-mer duplex, it has spatial requirements that extend beyond this small site. A protein positioned 12 bp from the 3′ terminus of a primed site blocks clamp loading action; at least 14 bp 3′ to the bound protein are required for assembly of β onto DNA. Likewise, a large DNA secondary structure positioned within 16 nucleotides of the 3′ terminus blocks γ complex action. Use of β by pol III* in chain elongation requires even more space on the primed site; a protein or DNA secondary structure placed closer than 20–22 bp from the 3′ terminus prevents chain extension. The biological significance of these structural constraints for DNA polymerase III holoenzyme action is discussed.

The gene was placed into pET11, and εmut was prepared from induced cells as described (12.Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7747-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). εmut was used with the other subunits of pol III* to reconstitute pol III* εmut lacking exonuclease activity (13.Onrust R.

EBNA1PK is the 200-residue C-terminal DNA-binding domain of EBNA1 to which a 6-residue kinase recognition site has been attached; it was isolated and purified as described (29.Zhang D. Frappier L.

[3H]β (520 cpm/fmol) was prepared by reductive methylation using formaldehyde and [3H]NaBH4 (30.Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Buffer A contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 30 mm sodium citrate (final pH 8.0). Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 8 mm MgCl2.

Buffer D contained 90 mm Tris base and 90 mm boric acid. Supercoiled pBluescript SK+ (2.96 kilobases; Stratagene) was propagated in the DH5α strain of E. coli, and plasmid was extracted by alkaline lysis and then purified through QIAGEN columns and further purified by ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride as described (31.Maniatis T.

Relaxation was judged to be complete within 30 min as indicated by analysis of time points on a neutral agarose gel (ethidium bromide added after electrophoresis). M13mp18 phage was prepared by two consecutive bandings in cesium chloride as described (33.Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). M13EBNA1 ssDNA was prepared as described (27.Yao N. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1421-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in the series of experiments of Fig. 3 contain 41 nucleotides complementary to M13EBNA1 ssDNA (map positions 6236–6276). The “3′-tail” 56-mer oligonucleotide has 41 nucleotides complementary to M13EBNA1 ssDNA at the 5′-end, followed by a stretch of 15 T residues at the 3′-end. The “ 5′-tail ” 56-mer oligonucleotide has 15 T residues at the 5′-end, followed by 41 nucleotides complementary to M13EBNA1 ssDNA. The “3′- and 5′-tail” 71-mer oligonucleotide has 41 nucleotides complementary to M13EBNA1 flanked by 15 T residues on both the 3′- and 5′-ends. The control flush 41-mer oligonucleotide was annealed to M13EBNA1 ssDNA. Two types of oligonucleotide primers were implemented to determine the polarity of γ complex clamp loading and to define the minimal length of DNA γ complex required for clamp loading. For the polarity experiments, two 34-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized having an 18-nucleotide EBNA1-binding sequence at either the 3′ or 5′ terminus. For the length determination, a set of nine primers was synthesized that had the EBNA1-binding sequence located at the 5′ end. In this latter set of “5′ EBNA1-block” primers, the distance between the 3′ end and the EBNA1 block ranged from 10 to 45 nucleotides (i.e. counting the 18 nucleotide EBNA1 site and one 5′ nucleotide beyond it, these primers ranged in size from 29 to 45 nucleotides). To verify that each template contained a primer with an EBNA1-binding site, [32P]EBNA1PK (dimer) of known specific activity was added to a defined molar amount of M13EBNA1 ssDNA hybridized with each EBNA1 block oligonucleotide. Results showed approximately one molecule of [32P]EBNA1PKbound to each EBNA1-blocked template as expected (for 5′-EBNA1 block, 420 fmol of EBNA2/417 fmol of template; and for 3′-EBNA1 block, 391 fmol of EBNA2/417 fmol of template). A 10-mer DNA oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-GGGCGCGAGC-3′ was annealed to M13EBNA1 ssDNA (map positions 40–49) in a 200:1 primer/template ratio. Another singly primed template containing a 15-mer oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-ATTTGGGGCGCGAGC-3′ (map positions 40–54 on M13EBNA1 ssDNA) was also constructed and annealed in an identical fashion. Eight oligonucleotides ranging in length from 56 to 70 nucleotides (5′-map position 6239) were designed such that each contains a central stretch of 20 residues identical to the template (map positions 6195–6214), thereby forming a 20-mer single-stranded DNA bubble when hybridized to M13EBNA1 ssDNA. The “bubble” has equal amounts of ssDNA on each strand. The bubble is flanked by 24 bp on the 5′-side and by 12–26 bp on the 3′-side of the primer. Eight oligonucleotides ranging in length from 65 to 79 nucleotides (5′-map position 6239) were synthesized such that each contains a 29-nucleotide central region composed of two inverted sequences (12 nucleotides long) separated by 5 T residues that form a 12-bp stem-loop (this stem-loop sequence is 5′-GGAAGGCCTTGGTTTTTCCAAGGCCTTCC-3′). Upon hybridization of the oligonucleotides to M13EBNA1 ssDNA, the stem-loop is flanked by 12–26 bp on the 3′-side and by 24 bp on the 5′-side. Annealing of oligonucleotides to ssDNA templates was performed in reactions containing 12.5 pmol of ssDNA template and 250 pmol of primer(s) in 20 μl of buffer A in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The reactions were heated in a 13 × 100-mm test tube containing ∼100 °C water and then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature (≈22 °C, ∼30 min). For templates hybridized with short primers (≤15 nucleotides), 2500 pmol of primer were added to 12.4 pmol of ssDNA circles. Reactions were performed in buffer B in a volume of 100 μl. Exact amounts of DNA and proteins and the concentration of NaCl are indicated in the figure legends. Mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then analyzed (upon adding 20 μl of glycerol) by electrophoresis on a 1.5% native agarose gel prepared with buffer D (containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide) at 100 V for 150 min at 4 °C. A photograph of the UV-induced ethidium bromide fluorescence was obtained, and the gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Reactions were performed in 100 μl of buffer B. Exact amounts of [32P]β or [3H]β, the γ complex or pol III*, and the primed template used in each experiment are detailed in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and applied to 5-ml columns of Bio-Gel A-15m equilibrated in buffer C at 4 °C. Fractions of 180 μl were collected. Aliquots of 150 μl were analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The molar amount of [32P]β in each fraction was calculated from the known specific activity of radioactive β. The seven peak-excluded fractions (typically fractions 10–16) were summed to obtain the total amount of β on DNA. All values presented are normalized for the full 180-μl volume of each fraction. Recovery of total radioactive protein was typically 80–95%. Results were not corrected for recoveries. Templates primed using 5′-EBNA1 block oligonucleotides (242 fmol as circles) were added to 308 fmol of β, 3.6 pmol of EBNA1 (as dimer), and 55 pmol of SSB (as tetramer) in 22 μl of buffer B containing 0.5 mm ATP. In a parallel control experiment, EBNA1 was omitted and replaced with storage buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 300 mm NaCl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 min to allow time for EBNA1 binding. Next, 100 fmol of pol III* were added to each reaction and incubated for 1.5 min at 30 °C. Replication was initiated upon adding 2 μl of 0.75 mm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.25 mm [α-32P]dTTP and then allowed to proceed for 30 s at 30 °C before being quenched with 25 μl of stop solution (1% SDS and 40 mm EDTA). Reactions were spotted onto DE81 paper, and the filters were washed and counted as described (34.Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Templates primed with either the 20-mer bubble oligonucleotides or the 12-bp stem-loop oligonucleotides were replicated with pol III* using the same protocol as with the 5′-EBNA1-blocked templates, except that EBNA1 protein was not included. Previous studies showed that the γ complex assembles β onto the DNA in a supercoiled plasmid DNA preparation (i.e. by gel filtration analysis); however, it was not determined whether β assembled onto the supercoiled plasmid or onto the small amount of nicked plasmid that contaminates supercoiled plasmid preparations (4.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig.1, we more thoroughly examined the ability of the γ complex to assemble β onto a supercoiled plasmid. To detect the presence of β on DNA, a modified form of β was used in which a 6-residue kinase recognition motif was placed on the C terminus, allowing it to be radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using cAMP-dependent protein kinase (referred to herein as [32P]β). [32P]β was incubated with a supercoiled plasmid, the γ complex, and ATP, and then the reaction was divided. One half was treated with BamHI to linearize the DNA, and the other half was treated with BamHI storage buffer. The reactions were then analyzed on a 1.5% native agarose gel to resolve the different forms of DNA, followed by autoradiography to detect the presence of [32P]β on the DNA. In Fig. 1 A, the UV-induced ethidium bromide fluorescence shows a small amount of nicked DNA in the supercoiled DNA preparation (lane 1), andlane 2 shows that linearization of the supercoiled DNA was complete. The corresponding autoradiogram (right panel) shows that [32P]β was present on both the nicked plasmid and the supercoiled plasmid (lane 1), whereas no detectable [32P]β was observed on the DNA after linearization (lane 2). Therefore, the γ complex can assemble β onto supercoiled DNA. The fact that [32P]β dissociates from the DNA upon linearization demonstrates that the β clamp is topologically bound to these circular DNAs. The observation that the γ complex assembles β onto supercoiled DNA is somewhat surprising, as this is not a template with a 3′ terminus for DNA synthesis. Perhaps superhelical tension produces unwound regions (i.e. bubbles), thereby providing ssDNA/dsDNA junctions upon which the γ complex may assemble β. This predicts that the reaction will be highly sensitive to ionic strength, as salt should have the effect of stabilizing the duplex, thus replacing regions of unwound DNA in the supercoiled plasmid with a concomitant increase in the writhe (the number of times the helix axis crosses over itself). This prediction was tested by repeating the experiment in the presence of low amounts of NaCl, 0, 10, 20, or 30 mm (Fig.1 B). The result demonstrates that assembly of [32P]β onto supercoiled DNA is highly salt sensitive; at just 30 mm NaCl, practically no [32P]β was observed on supercoiled DNA, whereas the inverse held for assembly of β onto the nicked circular DNA present in the plasmid preparation. Therefore, γ complex action on supercoiled DNA is significantly more sensitive to ionic strength than activity on nicked DNA, with the result that the γ complex directs its clamp loading activity to the nicked plasmid as the ionic strength is raised. The γ complex activity was not significantly affected over this narrow range of NaCl concentration, as the total amount of β clamps assembled onto DNA remained constant. The oligomeric stability of the β clamp is not affected by this difference in salt concentration (β remains a dimer even in 2 mNaCl). 2Z. Kelman and M. O'Donnell, unpublished data. The sensitivity to ionic strength of γ complex action on supercoiled DNA is consistent with the hypothesis that a supercoiled plasmid has regions of unwound DNA that act as a substrate for the γ complex. Alternatively, the γ complex may utilize fully duplex DNA as a substrate for β at very low ionic strength, but not at slightly higher ionic strength. A test to distinguish between these possibilities is provided in the next experiment. Supercoiled plasmid DNA has inherent torsional strain that may unwind DNA (i.e. forming bubbles), providing a substrate for the γ complex. This torsional strain may be released upon treatment with topoisomerase to remove the supercoils. If the γ complex can assemble β onto fully duplex DNA at low ionic strength, then the γ complex should assemble [32P]β onto a relaxed closed plasmid (form IV DNA) at low ionic strength. However, if the γ complex requires the plasmid to have torsional stress, possibly pro"

Here we show that syncollin has a cleavable signal sequence and can be removed from granule membranes by washing with sodium carbonate. When membranes were subjected to Triton X-114 partitioning, syncollin was found predominantly in the aqueous phase, indicating that it is not sufficiently hydrophobic to be embedded in the membrane. Syncollin has intramolecular disulfide bonds and was accessible to water-soluble cross-linking and biotinylating reagents only when granules were lysed by sonication. These results indicate that syncollin is tightly bound to the luminal surface of the granule membrane. In situ, syncollin was resistant to proteases such as trypsin. When granule membranes were solubilized in ionic detergents such as deoxycholate, this trypsin resistance was maintained, and syncollin migrated on sucrose density gradients as a large (150 kDa) protein. In contrast, in non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100, syncollin became partially sensitive to trypsin and behaved as a monomer. Syncollin in alkaline extracts of granule membranes was also monomeric. However, reduction of the pH regenerated the oligomeric form, which was insoluble. We conclude that syncollin exists as a homo-oligomer and that its ability to self-associate can be reversibly modulated via changes in pH. In light of our findings, we reassess the likely role of syncollin in the pancreatic acinar cell.

Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). The proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, transported via the Golgi apparatus, and ultimately packaged into zymogen granules. Secretagogues such as acetylcholine and cholecystokinin act on receptors at the basolateral pole of the acinar cells to cause a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (2.Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 3.Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This leads, in turn, to the fusion of the zymogen granules with the apical domain of the plasma membrane and the release of digestive enzymes into the acinar lumen (1.Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). In recent years, several of the steps involved in stimulus-secretion coupling have been studied in great detail. For example, the link between receptor activation and the cytoplasmic Ca2+ signal has been extensively characterized. However, it is still unclear how Ca2+ mediates exocytotic membrane fusion. In particular, the identity of the Ca2+ sensor and the mechanism by which it communicates with the membrane fusion machinery are still unknown. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that all intracellular fusion events are mediated by a common group of proteins referred to as SNAREs1 (4.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar, 5.Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These proteins are small and mostly membrane-anchored molecules that spontaneously form tight complexes, which are reversibly disassembled by the chaperone N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein in conjunction with cofactors. The neuronal variants are among the best characterized: they include the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as vesicle-associated membrane protein) and the plasma membrane proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1. Based on the identity of a highly conserved amino acid in the center of the complex, SNARE proteins are classified as R-SNAREs (synaptobrevin, vesicle-associated membrane proteins, and relatives) and Q-SNAREs (SNAP-25 and syntaxin families) (5.Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). For fusion, Q- and R-SNAREs need to cooperate to form a tight complex (6.Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic acinar cell, synaptobrevin 2 is so far the only R-SNARE known to be present on the zymogen granule membrane (7.Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). At least three syntaxin isoforms are also present: syntaxin 2 on the apical plasma membrane, syntaxin 4 on the basolateral membrane, and syntaxin 3 on the granule membrane (9.Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SNAP-23, the non-neuronal isoform of SNAP-25, is found on the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane (10.Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Wong P.P.C. Klip A. Trimble W.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By testing the effects of botulinum neurotoxin C1 on zymogen granule-plasma membrane fusion and granule-granule fusion in vitro, we have shown that syntaxin 2 is the isoform that mediates fusion between zymogen granules and the apical plasma membrane, whereas syntaxin 3 mediates homotypic fusion of granules (8.Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, experiments with tetanus toxin showed that synaptobrevin 2 was responsible for only a minor component of fusion between zymogen granules and plasma membranes, leaving open the identity of the major R-SNARE on the granule membrane (7.Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a novel zymogen granule protein, syncollin, through its high affinity binding to syntaxin 1A (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Syncollin binds to syntaxin in a Ca2+-sensitive manner and inhibits zymogen granule-plasma membrane fusion, making it a candidate for a Ca2+-dependent regulator protein in pancreatic exocytosis. Syncollin is a small protein (molecular mass of 16 kDa) that is specifically expressed in exocrine secretory cells and highly enriched in zymogen granule membrane fractions. The protein is tightly associated with the granule membrane, but the nature of this interaction and the membrane orientation of syncollin have not so far been established. In this study, we have used a variety of approaches to examine the membrane association and biochemical properties of syncollin. In contrast to our previous conclusions, we now report that the N-terminal domain of syncollin represents a cleavable signal sequence rather than a membrane anchor domain. In agreement with this finding, the protein is associated with the luminal rather than the cytoplasmic side of the granule membrane. Furthermore, the protein in its native state appears to exist as a large homo-oligomer. In light of these data, the role of the protein in the pancreatic acinar cell needs to be reconsidered. Antibodies used were as follows: FG3, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against an internal peptide sequence from syncollin (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); 87.1, a mouse monoclonal antibody against recombinant syncollin; 69.1, a mouse monoclonal antibody against synaptobrevin 2 (12.Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar); 77.1, a mouse monoclonal against α-SNAP (13.Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); and anti-procarboxypeptidase, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the appropriate band excised from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of zymogen granule proteins. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany) by semidry blotting. Blots were probed with primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:500–1:1000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce & Warriner, Chester, United Kingdom). Zymogen granules were isolated as described previously (14.Nadin C.Y. Rogers J. Tomlinson S. Edwardson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2801-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 17 μg/ml benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml bacitracin). Granule membranes were prepared by lysing granules for 1 h in 170 mm NaCl and 200 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.8) (1:3); membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Coupled transcription/translation reactions were performed with the TNT T7 transcription system and a rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). A typical reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 55% TNT T7 reticulocyte lysate, 0.25 units of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 mm amino acid mixture without l-cysteine, 10 μCi ofl-[35S]cysteine, 10 units of RNasin, 1 μg/μl DNA substrate in TNT reaction buffer, and dog pancreas microsomes (Promega) where appropriate. Incubations were for 90 min at 30 °C. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. The method used was essentially that of Bordier (15.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zymogen granule membranes, in Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 1 mmCa2+, were solubilized in 1% Triton X-114 (Pierce & Warriner) by incubation for 15 min at 4 °C with agitation. Unsolubilized material was pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was heated to 30 °C for 5 min. The supernatant, which was now cloudy, was layered onto a warmed sucrose (6%) cushion containing 0.06% Triton X-114 and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min. The detergent (lower) and aqueous (upper) phases were recovered separately, and proteins were precipitated with 50% acetone. Zymogen granules were isolated and either left undisturbed or sonicated briefly to cause lysis. Granules were incubated with trypsin (1.2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the proteolytic reaction was then terminated by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (3 mg/ml). Granules were incubated with the water-soluble cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (4 mm; Pierce & Warriner) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the cross-linking reaction was then terminated by addition of excess Tris/glycine. Granules were incubated with the biotinylating reagent biotinN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (biotin-NHS; 4 mm; Pierce & Warriner) for 30 min at 4 °C. After quenching with excess Tris/glycine, granule proteins were solubilized in Triton X-100 and incubated with monomeric avidin immobilized on agarose beads. The beads were washed extensively, and biotinylated proteins were eluted with excess free biotin (1 mg/ml). In all cases, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the initial molecular cloning of syncollin (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the protein was digested with Lys-C, and two internal peptide sequences were obtained. Based on one of these sequences, polymerase chain reaction primers were designed and used to amplify a sequence from a λZAP rat pancreatic cDNA library. This sequence was then used to isolate a full-length clone from the library. The open reading frame predicted an amino acid sequence 145 residues long, with a hydrophobic domain close to the N terminus. Surprisingly, however, when the protein was excised from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to N-terminal amino acid analysis, the sequence began at residue 33. This result indicates that the hydrophobic sequence at the N terminus, rather than acting as a membrane anchor as we originally proposed (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), acts in fact as a signal sequence (Fig. 1 A). In support of this idea, the amino acids at positions −1 and −3 relative to the putative signal peptidase cleavage site are both small residues, as expected (16.Von Heijne G. Nature. 1998; 396: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DNA sequence upstream of the second (but not the first) methionine conforms perfectly with the Kozak sequence predicted to represent the initiation of translation (Fig.1 A) (17.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 5: 8125-8149Crossref Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the authentic N terminus of the protein begins at residue 12 of the original sequence, with the first 21 amino acids acting as a signal sequence. The authentic processed protein will then be 113 residues long. To confirm that syncollin has a cleavable signal sequence, we used the original cDNA clone to direct a coupled transcription/translation reaction with and without dog pancreas microsomes. As shown in Fig.1 B, a protein product with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa was generated in the absence of microsomes. In the presence of microsomes, the protein was ∼2 kDa smaller, as expected. When pancreatic homogenates are fractionated, syncollin is found only in the zymogen granule membrane fraction and not in the high speed supernatant, which contains significant amounts of granule content proteins (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hence, syncollin is tightly associated with the granule membrane. Except for the signal sequence, syncollin does not contain a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids that could serve as a transmembrane domain. To gain more insight into the type of membrane anchorage, we subjected zymogen granule membranes to three conditions that are commonly used to remove peripherally bound proteins: 1 m sodium chloride, 0.6m potassium iodide (9.Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and 0.1 m sodium carbonate (18.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, syncollin remained largely (but not exclusively) associated with the membrane pellet after NaCl and KI washing. However, washing of membranes with carbonate buffer at pH 11.5 removed most of the syncollin into the supernatant. In contrast, the integral membrane protein synaptobrevin 2 remained bound to the membrane under all three conditions. To examine further the conditions required to remove syncollin from the membrane, we incubated granule membranes in carbonate solutions of varying pH values. We found that syncollin resisted dissociation from the membranes until the pH exceeded 10.0 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the secretory protein amylase was partially removed from the membranes even at pH 7.6 and was almost completely removed at pH 10.0. We also tested the partitioning of syncollin during phase separation of Triton X-114 (15.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only proteins with hydrophobic domains large enough to bind detergent micelles such as transmembrane domains or hydrophobic side chains will accumulate in the detergent phase after phase separation. Zymogen granule membranes were solubilized in Triton X-114, and proteins in the aqueous and detergent phases were precipitated with 50% acetone. It was clear from both a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and an immunoblot that syncollin partitioned predominantly into the aqueous phase (Fig. 3), indicating that it does not contain a hydrophobic membrane anchor domain. Syncollin contains seven cysteine residues. If the protein is indeed exposed on the luminal side of the zymogen granule membrane, it is likely that at least some of these cysteines will be disulfide-bonded to each other. To test this possibility, we looked for a change in the mobility of syncollin on SDS-PAGE after treatment with the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. Zymogen granule membranes were solubilized in sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol (10%), incubated at 25 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. On a Coomassie Blue-stained gel, some of the proteins in the “minus β-mercaptoethanol” lane migrated as diagonal bands, presumably because of reduction of disulfide bonds by β-mercaptoethanol diffusing out of the “plus” lane (Fig. 4 A). The corresponding immunoblot shows that syncollin is one of these diagonally migrating bands and is therefore likely to be disulfide-bonded. To check that disulfide bond formation was not occurring during the preparation of the zymogen granule membranes, a second experiment was carried out in which 100 mm N-ethylmaleimide was included throughout. As shown in Fig.4 B, the presence of N-ethylmaleimide did not affect the mobility shift seen with β-mercaptoethanol. Hence, syncollin does indeed appear to have intramolecular disulfide bonds. If syncollin is associated with the luminal face of the zymogen granule membrane, syncollin in intact granules should be inaccessible to water-soluble protein-modifying reagents that cannot penetrate membranes. In a preliminary experiment to monitor granule integrity, we determined the sensitivity of three proteins to trypsin. We found that during an incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the content protein procarboxypeptidase remained resistant to cleavage unless the granules had been sonicated, whereas the cytoplasmically oriented SNARE synaptobrevin 2 was cleaved by trypsin in both unsonicated and sonicated granules (Fig. 5 A). Hence, the unsonicated granules are extremely stable. As expected from previous studies (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), syncollin was resistant to proteolysis under all circumstances. We then tested the accessibility of syncollin to the cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate and the biotinylating reagent biotin-NHS. Zymogen granules were isolated and either left undisturbed or sonicated briefly to cause lysis. They were then incubated with either bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate or biotin-NHS for 30 min at 4 °C. As shown in Fig. 5 B, syncollin could be cross-linked to form higher order adducts only when the granules had been sonicated. The major adducts seen had molecular masses of ∼40 and 60 kDa, consistent with the formation of syncollin trimers and tetramers (see below). In a similar experiment (Fig. 5 C), syncollin was precipitated by immobilized avidin only when biotin-NHS had access to the interior of the granule as a result of prior sonication. We showed previously that syncollin on intact granule membranes is resistant to trypsin and that even when the membranes are solubilized in Triton X-100, trypsin is able to remove only a 2-kDa fragment (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We analyzed the trypsin sensitivity of the protein in a number of different detergents: three non-ionic detergents, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, and octyl glucoside; two anionic detergents, deoxycholate and SDS; and the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS. Zymogen granule membranes were incubated with detergent (1%) for 5 min at 37 °C and then treated with trypsin (1 mg/ml) for an additional 15 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of an excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. As shown in Fig.6 (upper panel), trypsin cleaved a 2-kDa fragment from syncollin in the three non-ionic detergents and also in the zwitterionic detergent. In contrast, syncollin remained completely resistant to trypsin in the ionic detergents. In the same experiment, the granule membrane-associated protein α-SNAP was completely cleaved by trypsin in all of the detergents used (Fig. 6, center panel). Finally, a Coomassie Blue-stained gel corresponding to the immunoblot showed that there was no significant difference in the overall trypsinization pattern among the different detergent samples (Fig. 6, lower panel). Hence, the effect of detergents on the trypsinization of syncollin is not attributable to an effect of the detergents on the protease itself. To investigate the characteristics of trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant syncollin, we tested the behavior of syncollin on sucrose density gradients. We compared the properties of syncollin solubilized in either Triton X-100 or deoxycholate. Zymogen granule membranes were solubilized, and the detergent extracts were layered onto linear 5–15% sucrose gradients, also containing detergent. Following overnight centrifugation at 180,000 × g, fractions were collected from the gradient and analyzed by immunoblotting. Molecular masses were judged by comparison with the mobilities of molecular mass marker proteins. As shown in Fig.7, syncollin in Triton X-100 ran as a monomer, but syncollin in deoxycholate ran as a much larger species, with a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa. The proteins synaptobrevin 2, α-SNAP, and amylase ran identically in the two detergents (data not shown), indicating that the detergent-dependent change in sedimentation is specific to syncollin. Analysis of the material washed from zymogen granule membranes by incubation in sodium carbonate at pH 10.5 indicated the presence of a number of proteins, including syncollin (data not shown). When the alkaline supernatant from a granule membrane preparation was dialyzed overnight against Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.6), a milky precipitate was seen to form. When the suspension was centrifuged and the precipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, it was found to consist of almost pure syncollin. This protocol was refined by the inclusion of a membrane wash with 0.6 m KI before the carbonate wash. This eliminated minor protein contamination, resulting in a syncollin preparation that was at least 95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 8 A). Purified syncollin could be readily dissolved in taurodeoxycholate (which, like deoxycholate, does not render syncollin sensitive to trypsin) (data not shown). When the solubilized protein was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described above, it again behaved as a large protein, with a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa (Fig.8 B). Hence, syncollin appears to exist as a homo-oligomer, perhaps consisting of eight subunits. The cross-linked adducts seen in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5 might represent the partial stabilization of such an oligomer. In contrast, syncollin in the form that was removed from the granule membrane at a pH of 10.5 behaved as a monomer (Fig. 8 B). We have previously reported that syncollin, a major constituent of the zymogen granule membrane, binds to syntaxin 1A in a Ca2+-sensitive manner (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In fact, under appropriate conditions, syncollin binds most strongly to syntaxin 2, the major syntaxin isoform that is involved in exocytosis in the pancreas. 2S. J. An and J. M. Edwardson, unpublished observations. Thus, it is likely that the interaction of syncollin with syntaxin 2 is able to prevent this Q-SNARE from forming core complexes with its (still unknown) SNARE partners, a prerequisite for fusion. This effect would explain the ability of syncollin to inhibit the in vitro fusion of zymogen granules with pancreatic plasma membranes (11.Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although these properties are entirely consistent with a regulatory role of syncollin in SNARE complex formation, the data reported here question the physiological significance of the interaction of syncollin with syntaxin. It is now clear that syncollin possesses a signal sequence that directs the protein through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and is then cleaved. Syncollin acquires intramolecular disulfide bonds, which may explain, at least in part, its resistance to proteolytic breakdown. The protein eventually becomes tightly associated with the luminal surface of the zymogen granule membrane, where it is protected from exogenous water-soluble modifying reagents. The conformation of syncollin is clearly affected by detergent treatment in a differential manner. Furthermore, the protein forms higher order oligomers under certain conditions, suggesting that it may assemble into large complexes in the granule membrane. The balance of the evidence at present suggests that syncollin is more likely to have a role within the zymogen granule (perhaps in the processing, maturation, and concentration of granule content proteins) than in the control of exocytotic membrane fusion. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that syncollin is a highly unusual protein. The dramatic changes in the structure and properties of the protein in response to changes in pH are of particular interest. Consequently, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that under particular circumstances, syncollin is able to embed itself into the membrane to the extent that it can still interact with syntaxin 2, for instance at the point of exocytosis. There are precedents for such behavior. Annexin V, for example, inserts into membranes at low pH (19.Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or at neutral pH in the presence of peroxide (20.Kubista H. Hawkins T.E. Patel D.R. Haigler H.T. Moss S.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to form a Ca2+channel. Further work is clearly needed to clarify the role of syncollin in the pancreatic acinar cell.

This finding suggested that only the former pathway is active in E. coli. Structure 1During our screening search for vitamin B6 overproducers, we found that Rhizobium meliloti IFO 14782 produced higher amounts of vitamin B6 in the culture (11.Tazoe M. Ichikawa K. Hoshino T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1378-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of pyridoxol in R. meliloti with regard to the following points: 1) formation of pyridoxol from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and 4-hydroxy-l-threonine, 2) formation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose from pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde, and 3) formation of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine from glycine and glycolaldehyde. The organism used in this study were R. meliloti IFO 14782, E. coli IFO 13168,Pseudomonas andropogonis ICMP 2809, and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis ATCC 9080 for quantitative determination of vitamin B6. The following labeled compounds were purchased from Isotec Inc.: [2,3-13C2]pyruvate (99%13C per C atom), [1,2,3-13C3]pyruvate (99% 13C per C atom), [1-15N,2-13C]glycine (99%15N and 13C per N and C atoms), [1-15N]glycine (99% 15N per N atom), and [15N]NH4Cl (99% 15N per N atom). 4-(Dimethylamino)azobenzene-4′-sulfonyl chloride (DABS)1 was used for determination of amino acids. 13C and 1H NMR experiments were performed with a Jeol JNM GSX-400 spectrometer, and all compounds were dissolved in D2O. Chemical shifts are shown with external reference to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionic acid-d 4 sodium salt (0 ppm). FAB-MS experiments were carried out with a Jeol SX-102/102 mass spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett Packard Apollo Series 400 data system.m-Nitrobenzyl alcohol was used as the liquid matrix for the FAB-MS experiments. 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose was prepared by an enzymatic reaction using the cell-free extract of E. coliIFO 13168 by the procedure reported by Yokota and Sasajima (12.Yokota A. Sasajima K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 149-158Google Scholar). 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose thus obtained had the following physicochemical properties: [α]D = +23.2° (c = 1.0, H2O) (literature [α]D of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose, [α]D = +26.2° (c = 1, H2O)). The 13C NMR spectrum of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose was observed as a mixture of three isomers: an open form and two closed hemiketal α- and β-furanose forms. The NMR spectrum was: 13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O). Open form δ values were 28.5, 65.0, 74.2, 80.0, and 215.8. α- and β-furanose forms gave many low signals. 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose has been reported to give signals derived from three forms in the 13C NMR spectrum (13.Lois L.M.

[1,2-13C2]1-Deoxy-d-xylulose was also prepared in the same way as mentioned above by using [2,3-13C2]pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde as substrates. The NMR spectrum of the compound was: 13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O). Open form δ values were 28.5 (d, J = 41.2 Hz, C-1) and 215.8 (d, J = 41.2 Hz, C-2). Two closed hemiketal α- and β-furanose forms gave four low signals attributed to C-1 and 2. 4-Hydroxy-l-threonine was isolated from a culture broth ofP. andropogonis ICMP 2809 according to the procedure of Mitchell et al. (14.Mitchell R.E. Frey E.J. Benn M.H. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 2711-2715Google Scholar). 1H NMR (400 Hz, D2O) δ values were 3.57 (1H, dd, J = 5.5 Hz), 3.58 (1H, dd, J = 4.5 Hz), 3.64 (1H, d,J = 3.5 Hz), and 4.02 (1H, mult.). FAB-MS (negative) was 134 (M − H)−. [15N]4-Hydroxy-l-threonine was also prepared by culturing P. andropogonis ICMP 2809 in chemically defined medium in which 15N-labeled ammonium chloride was used. FAB-MS (negative) was 135 (M − H)−. The amount of vitamin B6 was quantified by the turbidity method with S. carlsbergensis ATCC 9080 (15.Atkin L. Schultz A.A. Williams W.L. Frey C.N. Ind. Eng. Chem. Anal. Ed. 1943; 15: 141-144Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Pyridoxol formation was detectable by bioautogram of thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Silica gel 60, Merck, CHCl3/MeOH = 3/1) using the microorganism as an indicator strain. R. meliloti IFO 14782 was cultured in a medium consisting of 4% glucose, 2% peptone, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05% MnSO4·5H2O, and 0.001% FeSO4·7H2O (pH 6.8) at 28 °C. Cells of R. meliloti IFO 14782 were harvested from 3-day culture broth by centrifugation, washed twice with sterile 0.85% saline, and suspended in a small amount of sterile water. In a tube, 10 ml of the following mixture (2 mg each of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and 4-hydroxy-l-threonine, 0.425% NaCl, and washed cells (final A 600 = 20)) was prepared and incubated on a reciprocal shaker (285 rpm) at 28 °C. After shaking for 24 h, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and then vitamin B6 in the supernatant was assayed with S. carlsbergensis ATCC 9080. To isolate vitamin B6 synthesized from labeled substrates, 20 tubes (total volume: 200 ml) containing the reaction mixture with 2 mg each of [1, 2-13C2]1-deoxy-d-xylulose and [15N]4-hydroxy-l-threonine, 0.425% NaCl, and washed cells were shaken on a reciprocal shaker at 28 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture containing vitamin B6 of 10.2 μg/ml was centrifuged, and the vitamin produced was purified from the supernatant through column chromatography with Amberlite CG-120 (H+) cation exchange resin (1.2 cm in diameter and 15 cm in length) developed by 5% ammonium solution. Fractions containing a vitamin B6 peak were pooled, concentrated under reduced pressure, and subjected to 13C NMR structural analysis.13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O) δ: 18.0 (d,J 1 = 48.9 Hz), 146.6 (dd,J 1 = 48.9 Hz, J 2 = 12.2 Hz). Cells ofR. meliloti IFO 14782 were harvested from 200 ml of 3-day culture broth by centrifugation. The pellet was washed first with 100 ml of saline and subsequently with 100 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm thiamine diphosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and finally suspended in 20 ml of the same buffer (final A 600 = 150). The cells were disrupted with a French press homogenizer. After centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 60 min, the supernatant was used as the cell-free extract for the following enzyme reaction. The reaction mixture containing 100 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 mmd-glyceraldehyde, 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm thiamin diphosphate, 2 mm EDTA, and the cell-free extract (5.6 mg of protein) in a total volume of 1 ml was incubated at 37 °C. After incubation for 1, 2, 3, or 4 h, the reaction mixture was heated in a boiling bath for 3 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. One microliter of the supernatant was loaded onto a TLC plate of Silica gel 60 (Merck, ethyl acetate/pyridine/H2O = 90/5/3) and developed. The 1-deoxy-d-xylulose formed was detected by staining the plate with alkaline-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. To isolate the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose synthesized from labeled substrate, the enzyme reaction was carried out by incubating a tube containing the following reaction mixture (7.5 ml) at 37 °C: 100 mm [2, 3-13C2]pyruvate, 100 mmd-glyceraldehyde, 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmthiamin diphosphate, 2 mm EDTA, and the cell-free extract of R. meliloti IFO 14782 (42 mg of protein). After incubation for 4 h, a 5-fold volume of methanol was added to the mixture, and then it was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was concentrated under reduced pressure, dissolved in a small amount of methanol, and then chromatographed on a column (2.3 cm in diameter and 25 cm in length) of Silica gel 60 with ethyl acetate/pyridine/H2O = 90/5/3. 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose was followed by TLC on Silica gel 60 plates, and the fractions containing 1-deoxy-d-xylulose were collected and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in a small amount of water and further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) under analytical conditions as follows: column, Daisopack SP-120–5-ODS-BP (Daiso Co., Japan); mobile phase, H2O; flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; detector, RI. Fractions containing 1-deoxy-d-xylulose were collected and concentrated under reduced pressure. Physicochemical properties of the obtained 1-deoxy-d-xylulose were as follows. [α]D26.5° (c = 1, H2O),13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O): open form δ; 28.5 (d,J = 41.2 Hz), 215.8 (d, J = 41.2 Hz) and two closed hemiketal α- and β-furanose forms; four low signals. Cells ofR. meliloti IFO 14782 were prepared by the same procedure as described under “Formation of Vitamin B6 .” Formation of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine was carried out by shaking a tube containing 10 ml of the following mixture: 40 mm glycolaldehyde, 32 mm glycine, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and washed cells (finalA 600 = 20) on a reciprocal shaker (285 rpm) at 28 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, adjusted to pH 8.5 with 5% ammonium solution, and passed through an anion exchange column (Dowex 1X4) to remove Tris in the buffer. 4-Hydroxy-l-threonine was eluted with 0.2 n HCl solution, and the effluent was concentrated under reduced pressure and derivatized with DABS (16.Chang J.-Y. Knecht R. Braun D.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was analyzed by reversed-phase TLC on a silica C8 plate (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Japan; acetonitrile/H2O/acetic acid = 5/5/0.4). The DABS derivative of the formed 4-hydroxy-l-threonine was observed as an orange spot having an RF value of 0.42. Alternatively, the spot was extracted from the TLC plate by using CHCl3/MeOH (3:1) and analyzed by mass spectrometry. FAB-MS (negative) was 421 (M − H)−. Isolation of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine from labeled substrate was done as follows. Ten tubes each containing 10 ml of the following mixture: 40 mm glycolaldehyde, 32 mm[1-15N, 2-13C]glycine, 100 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and the cells of R. meliloti IFO 14782, were shaken on a reciprocal shaker at 28 °C for 24 h. The total reaction mixture (100 ml) was passed through a Dowex 1X4 column by the same method as described in the previous paragraph and derivatized with DABS. The DABS derivative of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine was purified by reversed-phase TLC with C8 silica plates. A band having the sameRF value as 4-hydroxy-l-threonine was extracted by using a solvent mixture of CHCl3/MeOH (3:1) and then subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. FAB-MS (negative) was 423 (M − H)−. To isolate the vitamin B6 formed from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose, glycine, and glycolaldehyde, an intact cell reaction was done as described below. Ten tubes each containing 10 ml of the mixture of 1.5 mm[1,2-13C2]1-deoxy-d-xylulose, 32 mm [1-15N]glycine, 40 mmglycolaldehyde, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and the cells of R. meliloti IFO 14782 (finalA 600 = 20) were shaken on a reciprocal shaker at 28 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture (100 ml) containing vitamin B6 of 8.6 μg/ml was centrifuged, and the produced vitamin was purified from the supernatant by chromatography through an Amberlite CG-120 (H+) column (1.2 cm in diameter and 15 cm in length) developed by 5% ammonium solution. Fractions containing a vitamin B6 peak were collected, concentrated under reduced pressure, and subjected to 13C NMR structural analysis:13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O) δ: 18.0 (d,J 1 = 48.0 Hz), 146.6 (dd,J 1 = 48.0 Hz, J 2 = 12.5 Hz). Vitamin B6 formation from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and 4-hydroxy-l-threonine as substrates was examined by an intact cell system of R. meliloti IFO 14782. As shown in TableI, vitamin B6 was formed only when both of the substrates were present. The vitamin B6formed in the reaction mixture was analyzed by TLC of silica gel 60, and identified as pyridoxol. Further, an incorporation test of the stable-labeled substrates, [1,2-13C2]1-deoxy-d-xylulose and [15N]4-hydroxy-l-threonine, into a pyridoxol molecule was done and analyzed by 13C NMR spectrometry. The13C NMR spectrum of authentic pyridoxol showed eight signals: 155.5, 145.5, 143.3, 139.5, 132.5, 60.9, 59.7, and 17.2 ppm, which were assignable to C-3, -2, -4, -5, -6, -4′, -5′, and -2′ of the skeleton, respectively (Fig.1 A). On the other hand, the13C NMR spectrum of the 13C- and15N-isotopically enriched pyridoxol showed only two signals, 146.6 and 18.0 ppm, which were assigned to be C-2 and -2′ of the skeleton, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The former signal appeared as a double doublet (J 1 = 48.9 Hz,J 2 = 12.2 Hz), due to13C,15N enrichment in contiguous two carbon and one nitrogen atoms, C2′-C2-N1 of pyridoxol skeleton (Fig.1 B-1) and the latter as a doublet (J 1= 48.9 Hz), due to 13C enrichment in adjacent two carbon atoms, C2′-C2 of the skeleton (Fig. 1 B-2). This result indicates that the double-labeled carbon bond,13C1-13C2 of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose, and 15N of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine were incorporated into the C2′-C2-N1 bond of the pyridoxol skeleton. This suggests that the C5 unit of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and the NC3 unit of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine enter the C5 (C-2′, -2, -3, -4, and -4′) and NC3(N-1, C-6, C-5, and C-5′) units, respectively, of the pyridoxol skeleton.Table IFormation of vitamin B6 from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and 4-hydroxy-l-threonine by intact cells of R. meliloti IFO 14782SubstrateFound vitamin B6μg/mlNone01-DX0HT01-DX + HT9.8The abbreviations used are: 1-DX, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose; HT, 4-hydroxy-l-threonine. Open table in a new tab The abbreviations used are: 1-DX, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose; HT, 4-hydroxy-l-threonine. Formation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose was examined for the enzyme system of R. meliloti IFO 14782 by using pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde as substrates. The time course of the reaction was analyzed by TLC on a Silica gel 60 plate, and a purple spot having the same RF value as 1-deoxy-d-xylulose was observed in 1, 2, 3, or 4 h of incubation by staining with alkaline-tetrazolium chloride (Fig.2). Further, incorporation of stable-labeled pyruvate into 1-deoxy-d-xylulose was elucidated by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The bulk production of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose was carried out by using [2,3-13C2]pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde as substrates. After the reaction, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose was purified by column chromatography in Silica gel 60, followed by HPLC, and then it was subjected to13C NMR structural analysis. The 13C NMR spectrum of authentic 1-deoxy-d-xylulose showed five signals of the open form, 215.8, 80.0, 74.2, 65.0, and 28.5 ppm, which were assignable to C-2, -3, -4, -5, and -1, respectively, of the skeleton (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, the 13C NMR spectrum of the13C-isotopically enriched 1-deoxy-d-xylulose showed only two signals of the open form, 215.8 and 28.5 ppm, which were attributed to C-2 and -1, respectively, of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose skeleton (Fig. 3 B). In expanded spectra of 215.4–216.5 and 28–30 ppm spectral regions (Fig.3, B-1 and 2), two signals were observed as doublet peaks having the same coupling constant (J = 41.2 Hz) due to 13C enrichment in the contiguous carbon atoms, C1-C2, of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose skeleton. This result indicates that the double-labeled carbon bond,13C2-13C3, of pyruvate was incorporated into the C-1 and -2 carbons of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose skeleton. Furthermore, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose isolated from the reaction mixture using [1,2,3-13C3]pyruvate showed a similar spectrum of 13C NMR to that isolated from the reaction mixture using [2,3-13C3]pyruvate (the spectrum not shown). This indicates that C-2 and -3 of pyruvate were incorporated into C-1 and -2 of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose skeleton without the incorporation of C-1 of pyruvate. These results suggest that the C2 (C-1 and -2) and C3 (C-3, -4, and -5) units of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose skeleton are derived from C-3 and -2 of pyruvate and C-1, -2, and -3 ofd-glyceraldehyde, respectively. This result is consistent with the proposal of Yokota and Sasajima (17.Yokota A. Sasajima K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 2517-2524Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) that 1-deoxy-d-xylulose is formed from pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde through decarboxylation of pyruvate.Figure 313 C NMR spectra of unlabeled 1-deoxy-d-xylulose (A) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose isolated from the enzyme reaction with [2,3-13C2]pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde (B), and the expanded spectra of 21650–21760 Hz (215.4–216.5 ppm) (B-1) and 2810–3015 Hz (28.0–29.5 ppm) (B-2) spectral regions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Formation of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine was studied in the intact cell system of R. meliloti IFO 14782 with glycolaldehyde and glycine as substrates in Tris-HCl buffer. The reaction product was identified by comparing it with a DABS derivative of authentic 4-hydroxy-l-threonine. With this derivatization, 4-hydroxy-l-threonine can be separated from the glycine used as one of the substrates. The reaction mixture was analyzed by reversed-phase TLC on a C8 silica plate, and an orange spot having the same RF value as 4-hydroxy-l-threonine was observed on the plate as shown in Fig. 4. Further, incorporation of labeled glycine into 4-hydroxy-l-threonine was elucidated by mass spectrometry. Then, the formation of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine in the intact cell system was carried out by using [1-15N, 2-13C]glycine instead of glycine as the substrate. After incubation for 24 h, the reaction mixture was passed through a Dowex 1X4 column, derivatized with DABS, and purified by reversed-phase TLC on C8 silica plates. The mass spectrum of the DABS derivative of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine enriched with labeled glycine and glycolaldehyde had a 423 m/z corresponding to the molecular ion minus 1 (Fig.5 B, lower spectrum), whereas the DABS derivative of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine had a 421 m/zcorresponding to the molecular ion minus 1 (Fig. 5 A,upper spectrum). These results indicate that a nitrogen and a carbon label of [1-15N, 2-13C]glycine were incorporated into the 4-hydroxy-l-threonine molecule, and that the 4-hydroxy-l-threonine might be constructed from the NC unit of glycine and the C2 unit of glycolaldehyde.Figure 5FAB-MS (negative) spectra of unlabeled 4-hydroxy-l-threonine (A) and 4-hydroxy-l-threonine isolated from the intact cell reaction with [1-15N,2-13C]glycine and glycolaldehyde (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recently, Lam and Winkler (6.Lam H.-M. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6518-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have proposed that 4-hydroxy-l-threonine would be formed fromd-erythrose 4-phosphate by four stepwise reactions as the major pathway in E. coli, and that activity of the first enzyme, d-erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase, on the pathway was found in the cell-free extract of an E. colistrain (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, when we attempted to determine the presence of this enzyme activity in the cell-free extract of R. meliloti IFO 14782 according to the method they reported, we were unable to detect this enzyme activity (data not shown). In other experiments, we have isolated a vitamin B6-requiring mutant derived from R. meliloti IFO 14782 that is defective in formation of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine from glycine and glycolaldehyde (data not shown). These results support that R. meliloti IFO 14782 synthesizes 4-hydroxy-l-threonine from glycine and glycolaldehyde, but not from d-erythrose 4-phosphate. Accordingly, we conclude that the biosynthetic pathway of 4-hydroxy-l-threonine in R. meliloti is different from that in E. coli. Incorporation of glycine into the pyridoxol molecule was studied in an intact cell system of R. meliloti IFO 14782 with [1,2-13C2]1-deoxy-d-xylulose, [1-15N]glycine, and glycolaldehyde as substrates. Formed pyridoxol was purified from the supernatant of the reaction mixture by cation exchange column chromatography and then analyzed with the13C NMR spectrometer. The spectrum was similar to that of pyridoxol formed from [1,2-13C2]1-deoxy-d-xylulose and [15N]4-hydroxy-l-threonine. The result indicates that the labeled nitrogen of glycine enters the N-1 position of pyridoxol, and that the NC (N-1 and C-6) unit of pyridoxol would be derived from the NC unit of glycine. In conclusion, the biosynthetic pathway of vitamin B6 inR. meliloti is summarized as follows. Pyridoxol is synthesized from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and 4-hydroxy-l-threonine; the former is from pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde through decarboxylation of pyruvate, and the latter is from glycolaldehyde and glycine."
https://openalex.org/W2056274266,"Yeast ornithine acetyltransferase has been purified from total yeast extracts as a heterodimer of two subpeptides (Liu, Y., Van Heeswijck, R., Hoj, P., and Hoogenraad, N. (1995)Eur. J. Biochem. 228, 291–296), confirmed to derive from a single ARG7-encoded precursor (Crabeel, M., Abadjieva, A., Hilven, P., Desimpelaere, J., and Soetens, O. (1997)Eur. J. Biochem. 250, 232–241). By Western immunoblotting, we show that Arg7p is also present as two subpeptides in isolated mitochondria, but that processing occurs before targeting to the mitochondria: deletion of the N-terminal leader peptide results in cytosolic accumulation of N-Arg7p, whereas C-Arg7p partially reaches the organelle by itself. When artificially co-expressed from separate genes, the two subpeptides can complement an arg7 mutation; ornithine acetyltransferase activity is measurable. Maturation of Arg7p occurs at threonine 215 (N-side), in the region most conserved among the 17 ornithine acetyltransferases characterized. Changing this conserved residue to alanine completely abolishes maturation. Furthermore, Arg7p is both processed and active in Escherichia coli, a heterologous background, and is also cleaved in vitro when produced by coupled transcription/translation in a reticulocyte lysate. Together, these data suggest classic autoproteolysis initiated by threonine 215. Most importantly, maturation is required for the enzyme to be functional, since the T215A substitution mutant is catalytically inactive and incapable of genetic complementation, despite its correct targeting to the mitochondria."

In the first part of this paper, the uncoupling Q42E substitution has been introduced into the second loop of thec 2 dimer or the third loop of thec 3 trimer.

In the second section of this paper, we report on the effect of substitution of the proton translocating Asp61 in every second helical hairpin of thec 2 dimer, or in every third hairpin of thec 3 trimer. Based upon the precedent of V-type ATPases, where the c 2 dimer occurs naturally with a single proton translocating carboxyl in every second hairpin, these modified versions of the E. coli c 2 andc 3 fused proteins were predicted to have a functional H+-transporting ATPase activity, with a reduced H+/ATP stoichiometry, but to be inactive as ATP synthases.

Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In an alternative hypothesis, the γ and ε subunits were proposed to move from one subunit c to the next as a consequence of sequential conformational changes at the c-γε interface brought about by proton binding and release through each subunitc (19.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.-I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we constructed genetically fused functional dimers and trimers of subunit c based upon the precedent of the subunit c in vacuolar (V-type) ATPases. The functional fusion proteins provided a novel experimental system to test whether a functional polar loop was required in each subunit c of the oligomer, as would be expected if the γε subunits sequentially moved from one c subunit to the next in the process of rotation. The cQ42E polar loop substitution had been shown to “uncouple” H+ translocation from ATP synthesis or hydrolysis (33.Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a phenotype that could be suppressed by second site substitutions in Glu31 of subunit ε (34.Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show the cQ42E substitution can be introduced into every second loop of the c 2 dimer or every third loop of the c 3 trimer without altering function. The result is clearly consistent with the suggestion that thec-γε interface remains fixed during rotary catalysis (6.Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The c subunits of V-ATPases are composed of four transmembrane helices and seem to have evolved by gene duplication of an F0 type progenitor gene (35.Cross R.L. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). They have a single H+ transporting carboxylate in the fourth transmembrane helix or second helical hairpin. In this study, we have studied the effect of removal of one of the essential aspartates in the F-typec 2 dimer or c 3 trimer to test the hypothesis that the enzyme might still function but as a V-type, H+-pumping ATPase with a reduced H+/ATP stoichiometry (35.Cross R.L. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We were unable to replace any of the transmembrane Asp in a variety of substituted dimers or trimers without complete loss of function. The plasmids used in this study are derivatives of plasmid pDF163, which contains the wild typeuncBEFH genes (bases 870–3216 1The unc DNA numbering system corresponds to that used by Walker et al.

The plasmids carrying the wild type c 1 monomer (pNOC) and fused c 2 dimer (pPJC2),c 3 trimer (pPJC3), and c 4tetramer (pPJC4) were derived from plasmid pNOC, which has a C21S substitution in subunit b, a mutation which has no effect on function (4.Jones P.C.

These plasmids and the derivatives described below were expressed in the recA chromosomal ΔuncBEFHdeletion strain JJ001 (pyrE41, entA403, argHI, rspsL109, supE44, ΔuncBEFH), recA56, srl::Tn10) (4.Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Complementation of the unc (succinate minus) phenotype was tested by transferring transformant, ampicillin-resistant colonies to minimal medium 63 plates (38.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 22 mm succinate, 2 mg/liter thiamine, 0.2 mm uracil, 0.2 mml-arginine, 20 μm dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Plasmid pC1Q42E was generated by subcloning a PstI/BstEII fragment containing the cQ42E substitution from the wholeunc operon plasmid pYZ186 (34.Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the respective sites of plasmid pDF163 and the cloning was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid pC1Q42E was subsequently used to generate plasmids pC2Q42E, pC3Q42, and pC4Q42E, carrying, respectively, genes for a subunit c dimer (c 2) and trimer (c 3) and tetramer (c 4) harboring in each case the Q42E substitution in the last polar loop. A single AvaI site is present in the plasmid pC1Q42E at bases 1976–1981 in theuncE gene in codons for amino acid residues 31 and 32 of subunit c. In plasmid pPJC2 encoding the fusedc 2 dimer, the AvaI fragment cloned between two AvaI sites encodes the C-terminal segment from residues 31 and 32 of the first subunit, the linking peptide, and the N-terminal segment to residues 31 and 32 of the second subunit. This AvaI fragment was cloned into the AvaI site of the cut and alkaline phosphatase-treated plasmid pC1Q42E to generate plasmid pC2Q42E. Similarly, plasmids pPJC3 or pJC4 were partially digested with AvaI and the appropriate, largeAvaI fragment purified from an agarose gel and cloned into the AvaI site of pC1Q42E to generate pC3Q42E and pC4Q42E. All constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The c 2 dimeric constructs with Asp61 substitutions in the first or N-terminal unit were constructed using the PCR2 strategy described in Jones and Fillingame (4.Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) wherein a plasmid encoding the substitution (D61N, D61G, or D61S) was used to generate the PCR product B. The substitutions generated by this method werec 2(D61N), c 2(D61G), andc 2(D61S). 3In the text, the repeated residues are designated by ′, ′′, and ′′′ to indicate the second, third, or fourth hairpin repeat. For example, c 2 dimers with an Asp → Asn substitution in the first or second hairpin are designatedc 2(D61N) or c 2(D61′N), respectively. Plasmids bearing the c 3(D61′N),c 3(D61′G), and c 3(D61′S) substitutions were generated by cloning the AvaI fragment from the aforementioned substituted c 2 plasmids into an incomplete AvaI digest of plasmid pPJC2. Plasmids bearing the c 2(D61′N),c 3(D61′′N, andc 4(D61′′′N) were generated by the previously cited PCR strategy (4.Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using plasmid encoding the D61N substitution to generate PCR product A. Wild type AvaI fragments from pPJC2 were cloned into partial AvaI digest of thec 2(D61′N) plasmid product to generate plasmids bearing c 3(D61′′N) and c 4(D61′′′N). Each of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Membranes were prepared and stored in TMDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) at 20 mg/ml after passage of cells through a French press (33.Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity and protein were determined as described (33.Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-driven ACMA quenching and NADH-driven quinacrine quenching assays were carried out in HMK assay buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl) as described (33.Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized for SDS electrophoresis by dilution of samples into SDS sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCI, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and incubation for 1 h at room temperature immediately before electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using the Tris-Tricine buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow (39.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10400) Google Scholar) with a 0.75-mm-thick 15% acrylamide slab gel (14.5% acrylamide, 0.45% N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide), and proteins transferred from the gel electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (40.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44628) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was carried out using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit antiserum to subunit c was pretreated as described (41.Girvin M.E. Hermolin J. Pottorf R. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4340-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and diluted 1:10,000 prior to use. A Q42E mutation was introduced into the last polar loop in the c 2dimer, c 3 trimer, and c 4tetramer to generate subunits c 2(Q42′E),c 3(Q42′′E), andc 4(Q42′′′E), respectively. The modifiedc subunits were expressed from a plasmid that also encoded the a, b, and δ subunits of F0F1 in the recA, ΔuncBEFH chromosomal deletion strain JJ001. Subunits α, β, γ, and ε are expressed from the chromosome of this strain. Growth of transformants was tested on succinate minimal medium, where growth depends upon a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. As described previously, the cQ42E mutant was unable to grow on succinate. However, mutants expressing thec 2(Q42′E)- andc 3(Q42′′E)-substituted proteins grew similarly to strains expressing the wild type version of thec 2 dimer or c 3 trimer (Table I). Strains expressing thec 4(wild type) orc 4(Q42′′′E) protein did not grow on succinate minimal medium. Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed at roughly comparable levels, as indicated by the immunoblot shown in Fig.1 A. The anti-cserum used had previously been shown to be directed to residues in the polar loop (41.Girvin M.E. Hermolin J. Pottorf R. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4340-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the lighter band for c 1Q42E membranes may reflect reduced antibody binding to the substituted polar loop. Although several of the bands run as doublets for reasons that we do not understand, the immunoblots give no indication that the fused proteins are degraded to smaller units, and seem to rule out proteolysis as a possible explanation for the observed function.Table IGrowth of cells expressing Q42E c2 and c3 fusion proteins by oxidative phosphorylation on succinate minimal mediumVersion of subunitc aSubunit c derivatives or fusion proteins were expressed from a pNOC-like plasmid in ΔuncBEFH(a,c,b,δ) chromosomal background strain JJ001 (recA), except as noted.Growth on succinate (colony size)bColony size after 72 h of incubation at 37 °C.mmc 1 (wild type)cExpressed in strain JWP109 (ΔuncBEFH,recA +).2.0–3.0c 2 (wild type)1.5–1.8c 3 (wild type)0.8–1.0c 4 (wild type)0c 1 (Q42E)0c 2 (Q42′E)1.2–1.6c 3 (Q42“E)0.8–1.0c 4 (Q42‴E)0a Subunit c derivatives or fusion proteins were expressed from a pNOC-like plasmid in ΔuncBEFH(a,c,b,δ) chromosomal background strain JJ001 (recA), except as noted.b Colony size after 72 h of incubation at 37 °C.c Expressed in strain JWP109 (ΔuncBEFH,recA +). Open table in a new tab The ATPase activity of membranes prepared from these cells is shown in Table II. The LDAO-activated ATPase activity is the best indicator of the total amount of F1bound to the membrane (42.Dunn S.D. Tozer R.G. Zadorozny V.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4335-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In wild type membranes, LDAO results in a 3–4-fold activation of membrane-bound F1 ATPase. The low LDAO-activated ATPase activity of the c 1Q42E membranes may indicate significant loss of F1 ATPase from the membrane during cell rupture and membrane preparation, although the amount of F0 in these membranes could also be somewhat reduced based upon the immunoblotting (Fig. 1). The extent of loss of F1 ATPase from the chromosomal Q42E mutant had previously been shown to be strain-dependent (36.Fraga D. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thec 2 and c 3 membranes (wild type or Q42E) show similar extents of activation by LDAO. Less F1 ATPase activity seems to be lost during preparation of the c 2(Q42′E) andc 3(Q42′′E) membranes than fromc 1Q42E membranes. In thec 4 mutant membranes (wild type or Q42E), the membrane-bound ATPase is more extensively inhibited and, when treated with LDAO, activated approximately 8-fold.Table IIATPase activity of membranes containing F0F1 with c2, c3, and c4 fusion proteinsDescriptionATPase activityaActivity ± S.D. of n determinations on a single membrane preparation.Minus LDAOPlus LDAOμmol · min −1 · mg −1c 1 (wild type)0.530 ± 0.029 (8)1.79 ± 0.08 (8)c 2 (wild type)0.249 ± 0.024 (5)1.16 ± 0.06 (5)c 3 (wild type)0.377 ± 0.032 (8)1.38 ± 0.08 (8)c 4 (wild type)0.120 ± 0.008 (3)0.88 ± 0.01 (3)c 1(Q42E)0.094 ± 0.013 (8)0.50 ± 0.12 (8)c 2 (Q42′E)0.263 ± 0.074 (5)1.07 ± 0.20 (5)c 3 (Q42“E)0.238 ± 0.006 (5)0.95 ± 0.02 (5)c 4(Q42‴E)0.098 ± 0.010 (3)0.80 ± 0.02 (3)c 1 (D61N)0.061 ± 0.007 (3)1.32 ± 0.04 (3)c 2 (D61N)0.074 ± 0.002 (3)1.07 ± 0.05 (3)c 2(D61′N)0.041 ± 0.005 (3)1.33 ± 0.02 (3)c 3 (D61“N)0.036 ± 0.005 (3)1.30 ± 0.01 (3)c 4 (D61‴N)0.066 ± 0.007 (3)1.70 ± 0.05 (3)c 2(D61G)0.069 ± 0.010 (3)1.07 ± 0.13 (3)c 3 (D61′G)0.051 ± 0.005 (3)1.24 ± 0.02 (3)c 2 (D61S)0.044 ± 0.005 (3)0.87 ± 0.02 (3)c 3(D61′S)0.042 ± 0.001 (3)1.38 ± 0.05 (3)a Activity ± S.D. of n determinations on a single membrane preparation. Open table in a new tab The ATP-driven ACMA quenching response of these membrane vesicles is shown in Fig. 2. As reported previously, the c 1(Q42E) mutant shows virtually no activity, whereas quenching activity comparable to that seen for the wild type dimer and trimer was observed for c 2(Q42′E) andc 3(Q42′′E) membranes. As we have reported previously (4.Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the c 3 trimeric protein promotes better ATP-driven proton pumping, as measured by ACMA quenching, than does the c 2 dimer. This is clearly unusual since strains expressing the c 2 dimer grow better by oxidative phosphorylation on succinate minimal medium (Table I). ATP-driven ACMA quenching had not previously been tested with the membranes from the c 4 tetramer (4.Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As shown here (Fig. 2), mutant membranes from either thec 4(wild type) orc 4(Q42′′′E) show a significant quenching response even though the activity is insufficient to support growth by oxidative phosphorylation (Table I). The cQ42E mutant was described as being “uncoupled” because its plasma membrane vesicles, containing normal amounts of bound F1, were permeable to protons (34.Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was reflected by a reduction in the NADH-driven quinacrine quenching response, caused by partial collapse of the H+electrochemical potential due to proton transport through F0. Membrane vesicles of thec 1(Q42E) transformant strain exhibit this uncoupled phenotype as illustrated in Fig.3. In comparison toc 1(wild type), thec 1(Q42E) membrane vesicles exhibit a significantly reduced NADH-driven quinacrine quenching response, which on DCCD treatment to block proton permeation via F0 was restored to wild type levels. In contrast, this uncoupled phenotype was not apparent with the c 2(Q42′E) andc 3(Q42′′E) mutant membranes. The passive proton permeability of the mutant membrane vesicles was also examined after removal of F1 from the membrane (Fig.4). The c 1membrane vesicles (wild type and Q42E) exhibited a high proton permeability, as indicated by the small NADH-driven quinacrine quenching response, which was greatly enhanced by DCCD treatment to block proton transport by F0. In contrast, stripping of F1 from the c 2 membranes (wild type or Q42E) only marginally increased the proton permeability, suggesting perhaps that the c 2 dimeric proton channel was less stable. The response of c 3 membrane vesicles (wild type or Q42E) was close to that seen withc 1 membranes. This more active passive transport capacity may relate to the greater ATP-driven H+ transport activity seen in c 3 versus c 2 membrane vesicles. Based upon the precedent of eucaryotic V-type ATPases, one might expect to be able to substitute one of the multiple Asp61 carboxylates of the E. coli fused subunit c and retain ATP-driven proton pumping activity with a reduced H+/ATP ratio. We generated a variety of Asp61-substituted fused proteins to test this hypothesis (Table II). Each of the mutated fused proteins was expressed, as shown by immunoblotting (see Fig. 1 B for examples). None of the transformant strains expressing these proteins proved capable of growth on succinate minimal medium, which indicated a loss of oxidative phosphorylation activity. The membrane ATPase activity of all of the Asp61-substituted strains was very low (Table II), and the very low activity can be attributed to inhibition of the F1 ATPase in the membrane-bound state. This is indicated by the 15–35-fold activation caused by LDAO treatment (Table II). The Asp61 substitutions made all seem to totally abolish ATP-driven proton pumping as assayed in the ACMA quenching assay (Fig.5). The following combinations were tested. In direct analogy to the vacuolar ATPase proteolipid, the Asp in the first hairpin of the dimer was replaced by Asn, Ser, and Gly (Fig. 5 B). An Asp → Asn substitution was also tried in the second hairpin of the c 2 dimer (Fig.5 B). Gly"

A number of positive-regulatory zinc finger transcription factors have been found to interact functionally with this region of the PDGF-B promoter, including Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 (13.Khachigian L.M.

Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Negative regulation of PDGF-B gene expression at the level of transcription is poorly understood. To date, ZNF174 is the only known transcriptional repressor with the capacity to down-regulate the activity of the PDGF-B promoter (20.Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here, we used a variety of approaches to search the PDGF-B promoter for additionalcis-acting silencer elements. Using gel shift, mutational, decoy, and transient transfection analysis, we have identified a novel negative regulatory element in the PDGF-B promoter that mediates repression of the promoter in a sequence-specific and MEK/ERK-dependent manner. Pup SMCs (WKY12–22) were cultured in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cultures were passaged every 4–5 days in 75-cm2 flasks. Cells seeded for preparation of nuclear extracts were grown to 80–90% confluency, and nuclear extraction was performed. Pup SMCs were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture plates for 48 h before transfection. When approximately 60–70% confluent, the cells were transfected with 8 μg of the indicated promoter-reporter plasmids. Transfections were performed using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A precipitate was formed using 3 μl of FuGENE/μg of transfected DNA, and the transfection mix was made up to 1 ml with serum-free Waymouth's medium. After incubation at 22 °C for 10 min, the DNA/FuGENE mixture was added to cells containing 4 ml of complete Waymouth's medium. Two days post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared for assessment of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity as described (13.Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of protein in the cell lysates were assessed using the BCA protein assay kit and used to correct CAT reporter activity. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Pacific Oligos. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dATP (GeneWorks) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified by centrifugation using Chromaspin-10 columns. A mutant form of plasmid d18 (13.Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), md18Am1, was constructed using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions by cloning oligonucleotide BAm1 (sense orientation only) into the −230/−200 region of the PDGF-B promoter (relative to the TATA box). All other PDGF-B promoter constructs have been described previously (13.Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SMCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and removed from the culture dish by scraping. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min and 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and the suspension was transferred to Eppendorf tubes. The cells were repelleted by spinning at 18,000 × g for 20 s at 4 °C. The cells were lysed by resuspending the pellet in an ice cold Buffer A, which consisted of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol , 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mm sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. The samples were incubated on ice for 5 min followed by recentrifugation. The nuclei were lysed in ice-cold Buffer C, which consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the crude nuclear extract was combined with an equal volume of ice-cold Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) binding reactions for gel shift assays were performed in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and 5 μg of nuclear extract (determined by BCA protein assay). Binding reactions involving Sp1/Egr-1 binding conditions have been previously described (18.Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated for 35 min at 22 °C. In supershift studies 0.5 μl of the appropriate affinity-purified antipeptide polyclonal antibody was incubated with the binding mix for 10 min before the addition of the probe. Bound complexes were separated from free probe by loading samples onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 100 V for 3.5 h. The gels were vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography overnight at -80 °C. Oligonucleotide decoy strategy pup SMCs were transfected with 8 μg of construct d18, either alone or in combination with 100 nmor 1 mm Oligo BA or Oligo BAm1. Transfections were performed using FuGENE6, as described above. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared for assessment of CAT activity. To ascertain that the oligonucleotide decoys reached the nucleus, radioactivity in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments was assessed at various times following transfection with 500 fmol (1 × 106 cpm) of32P-Oligo BA or 32P-Oligo BAm1. WKY12–22 pup SMCs, which express PDGF-B mRNA (21.Seifert R.A. Schwartz S.M. Bowen-Pope D.F. Nature. 1984; 311: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with a series of CAT reporter constructs driven by various-sized fragments of the PDGF-B promoter (Fig. 1, upper panel). Basal CAT activity was readily detectable and not significantly different in SMCs transfected with constructs d77 and d26, bearing 82 and 153 bp of PDGF-B promoter sequence (relative to the TATA box), respectively (Fig. 1, lower panel). In contrast, construct dNco (−227), which bears an additional 74 bp of PDGF-B promoter sequence upstream (Fig. 1, upper panel) was, like construct d18 (Fig. 1, upper panel), virtually inactive (Fig. 1, lower panel). These data contrast with our previous observations using serial 5′ deletion analysis in bovine aortic endothelial cells, where no major difference was observed in CAT activity driven by these reporter vectors (13.Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of construct dNco to mediate basal PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression in SMCs prompted us to explore the apparent negative regulatory role of this region in the promoter. We next performed EMSA to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of the PDGF-B promoter. Since the preceding findings demonstrated that the putative repressor site is located between the 5′ PDGF-B promoter end points in constructs dNco (−227) and d26 (−153), we synthesized a series of overlapping double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning this region (Table I). These32P-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extracts of pup SMCs, and the adducts were resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. 32P-Oligo BA (bp −230/−201) produced a single, discrete nucleoprotein complex (Fig.2 A, arrow) that was virtually absent when the probe was substituted with32P-Oligo BB (bp −205/−176) and32P-Oligo BC (bp −180/−151) (Fig.2 A).Table IPDGF-B promoter oligonucleotides used in EMSAWild type oligonucleotides Oligo BA−230-gtccatggtcactgtgctgaggggcgggac-201 Oligo BB−205-gggacggtgggtcacccctagttctttttt-176 Oligo BC−180-tttttccccagggccagattcatggactga-151Mutant oligonucleotides Oligo BAm1−230-gtcacgttgaactgtgctgaggggcgggac-201 Oligo BAm2−230-gtccatggtcaagtgtaggaggggcgggac-201 Olgio BAm3−230-gtccatggtcactgtgctgcttttatggac-201Sequences are shown in 5′ → 3′ direction (sense strand only).

Numbering indicates nucleotide position upstream of transcriptional start site. Mutant sequences are underlined. Competition experiments were performed to determine whether the interaction between nuclear protein and oligonucleotide was specific. A 35-fold molar excess of unlabeled Oligo BA abrogated the formation of the nucleoprotein complex (Fig. 2 B, third lane). In contrast, the same fold molar excess of two unrelated oligonucleotides, Oligo A (22.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and Oligo LKSSREm3 (19.Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), had no effect (Fig. 2 B). The PDGF-B promoter sequence between the 5′ end points in d26 and dNco bears a consensus binding element for Sp1. Previously, we determined that Sp1 as well as Sp3 and Egr-1 interact with a second site (bp −30/−13) located downstream in the promoter, which positively regulates basal PDGF-B expression (18.Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Supershift analysis was performed with 32P-Oligo BA using antibodies with specificity directed to these nuclear factors. However, the nucleoprotein complex was unaltered by the presence of either antibody (Fig. 3 A). To confirm the lack of a direct physical association of Sp1 with 32P-Oligo BA, we performed EMSA and supershift analysis using binding conditions suited to Sp1 (22.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These conditions did not support the formation of a nucleoprotein complex involving 32P-Oligo BA and Sp1 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, multiple nucleoprotein complexes were observed using a second oligonucleotide,32P-Oligo A (Fig. 3 B), as described previously (18.Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating the presence of Sp1 in the nuclear extracts. To ascertain the specific site in the PDGF-B promoter bound by the repressor, we designed a series of oligonucleotides bearing transversion mutations in Oligo BA. Mutations were created in three different regions: bp −227/−221(Oligo BAm1), −219/−213 (Oligo BAm2), and −211/−205 (Oligo BAm3) (Table I).32P-Oligo BA and the three mutant32P-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with pup SMC nuclear extracts before EMSA. Although the nucleoprotein complex was observed with 32P-Oligo BA (Fig.4), it was completely abolished using32P-Oligo BAm1 (Fig. 4) and was only faintly observed using 32P-Oligo BAm2 (Fig.5). In contrast, Oligo BAm3 was unable to affect the appearance of this nucleoprotein complex (Fig. 4). These findings demonstrate the requirement of bp −227/−221 (5′-CATGGTCA-3′) in the repressed region of the PDGF-B promoter for optimal nucleoprotein complex formation.Figure 5Mutation of the −227/−221 element in construct d18 rescues the PDGF-B promoter from repression. Pup SMCs were transiently transfected with constructs d26, d18, or md18Am1. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and CAT activity was normalized to the concentration of protein. The data are representative of two independent determinations. Error barsrepresent S.E. of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the functional consequence of the −227/−221 mutation in the PDGF-B promoter, this sequence was introduced into construct d18 before transient transfection analysis in pup SMCs. CAT activity in SMCs transfected with construct d18 was negligible (Fig. 5) and readily detectable when construct d26 was used, consistent with earlier findings (Fig. 1, lower panel). Construct md18Am1, bearing the −227/−221 mutation, was basally active and produced CAT activity at levels even higher than construct d26 (Fig. 5). These data provide functional evidence for the existence of a negative regulatory element at position −227/−221 in the PDGF-B promoter. An oligonucleotide decoy strategy was used to confirm our observations using the mutant PDGF-B promoter. Pup SMCs were cotransfected with construct d18 plasmid and either unlabeled Oligo BA, which binds to the repressor in a specific manner (Figs. 2, A and B, and 4), or Oligo BAm1, which is unable to bind to the nuclear protein (Fig.4). Transfection experiments revealed that transfection of Oligo BA increased CAT activity generated by construct d18 (Fig.6 A), whereas Oligo BAm1 failed to influence reporter activity (Fig.6 A). These findings demonstrate the sequence-specific nature of transcriptional repression at the −227/−221 site in the PDGF-B promoter. The wild-type oligonucleotide serves as a decoy that competes with the authentic site in the promoter for interaction with the repressor. To ensure that both oligonucleotides localized to the nucleus of these cells independently of differences in sequence, we traced32P-labeled Oligo BA or Oligo BAm1after transfection over time in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Both oligonucleotides demonstrated a similar spatial and temporal pattern of cellular localization, entering the cytoplasm before localizing in the nucleus shortly thereafter (Fig. 6 B). After 12 h, the majority of each oligonucleotide had localized in the nucleus (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, whereas both oligonucleotides reached the nuclear compartment with similar kinetics, only Oligo BA, which bound the repressor (Fig.3 A), rescued the PDGF-B promoter from transcriptional repression. Previous examination of the PDGF-B promoter by our group in vascular endothelial cells revealed no difference in CAT activity driven by a series of PDGF-B promoter-reporter constructs bearing or not bearing the negative regulatory element (23.Khachigian L.M. Chesterman C.N. Peptides. 1994; 15: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Indeed, in contrast to findings in pup SMCs, no significant difference was observed in activity generated by construct d18 or md18Am1 (Fig.7 A). Given the present data, we hypothesized that the lack of repression via this site in endothelial cells may be the consequence of low expression or complete absence of the repressor in this cell type. We assessed whether 32P-Oligo BA could support nucleoprotein complex formation with endothelial nuclear extracts in EMSA. Pup SMC extracts, as expected, formed the nucleoprotein complex (Fig. 7 B). However, this complex was completely absent when endothelial nuclear extracts were used (Fig. 7 B). To ensure that these findings were not merely the consequence of unequal protein loading or degradation of the endothelial extract, we performed EMSA with each extract using 32P-Oligo A (Fig. 7 C). This produced an identical electrophoretic pattern of shifted complexes in both cell types, entirely consistent with previous observations (18.Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,22.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These data indicate the cell-specific nature of −227/−221-directed repression and the capacity of this element to interact with nuclear protein(s). Previous studies have determined that certain transcriptional repressors are regulated by MAP kinases. For example, the repressor activity of the Ets family member, GETS-1, is abrogated by overexpression of Ras/MAP kinase or by mutation of Ser-405 MAP kinase phosphorylation site in GETS-1 (24.Goldman D. Sapru M.K. Stewart S. Plotkin J. Libermann T.A. Wasylyk B. Guan K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similarly, MAP kinase phosphorylation of repressor protein, Bcl-6, leads to its rapid degradation via the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway (25.Niu H. Ye B.H. Dalla-Favera R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1953-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 is basally active in pup SMCs (data not shown). We investigated whether repression of the PDGF-B promoter via the −227/−221 site was dependent upon ERK. PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1/2, the upstream activator of ERK, was incubated with SMCs transfected with construct d18. The flavone rescued reporter activity driven by the PDGF-B promoter (Fig. 8 A), as previously observed using the wild-type oligonucleotide decoy (Fig.6 A). In contrast, PD98059 had no effect on higher basal expression generated by construct md18Am1 (Fig. 8 A). To demonstrate the involvement of ERK in PDGF-B transcription, we overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant form of ERK1 in transient transfection setting with construct d18. CAT activity generated by construct d18 increased upon cotransfection with dominant negative ERK1 (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, the PDGF-B promoter was unaffected when an identical amount of the backbone control, pcDNA3, was used (Fig. 8 B). Thus, unlike the paradigm of GETS-1 (24.Goldman D. Sapru M.K. Stewart S. Plotkin J. Libermann T.A. Wasylyk B. Guan K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Bcl-6 (25.Niu H. Ye B.H. Dalla-Favera R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1953-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), repression of the PDGF-B promoter conferred by the −227/−221 element requires active Raf/MEK/ERK (Fig.8 B). In this paper, we have identified a novel negative regulatory element in the PDGF-B promoter, located 227/221 bp upstream of the TATA box, that binds nuclear proteins in a specific fashion and inhibits PDGF-B promoter-dependent gene expression in a Raf/MEK/ERK-dependent manner. Gel retardation and supershift assays excluded the direct association of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 with this element. Repression of the PDGF-B promoter was rescued by (i) mutation of the −227/−221 site that ablates nucleoprotein complex formation, (ii) cotransfection with double-stranded oligonucleotide decoys, and (iii) pharmacological and dominant negative inhibitors of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Comparative binding and transient transfection studies in endothelial cells revealed that repression of the PDGF-B promoter via this element is cell type-specific. These findings thus define a key negative regulatory element in the PDGF-B promoter. The −227/−221 repressor element in the PDGF-B promoter does not fit the consensus motif for any known transcription factor. Competition studies by EMSA in vitro and decoy experiments in vivo illustrate the specific nature of this element. That mutation ablates nucleoprotein complex formation and rescues the promoter from inactivity suggests that the repressor may function by active rather than passive means. For example, active transcriptional repressors that directly contact DNA include the human Kruppel-related factor YY1 (26.Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), the Wilms' tumor gene product (WT1) (27.Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 252: 1550-1553Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and the human bZIP protein E4BP4 (28.Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The repressor may also inhibit PDGF-B expression by inhibiting the activity of positive transcriptional regulators such as Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1, whose sites are located downstream in the proximal region of the promoter. This may involve protein-protein interactions while bound to the promoter in a three-dimensional setting. The MAP kinase dependence of repression via this site demonstrates that phosphorylation is a key event in the regulation of PDGF-B transcription. ERK may directly phosphorylate the repressor in the nucleus and/or modulate its stability or cellular localization. Isolation and characterization of this cell-restricted repressor should provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms negatively regulating PDGF-B transcription in vascular cells.
