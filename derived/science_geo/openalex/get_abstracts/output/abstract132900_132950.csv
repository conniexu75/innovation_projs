https://openalex.org/W2086629747,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and digital imaging microscopy were modified to allow detection of single RNA molecules. Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were synthesized with five fluorochromes per molecule, and the light emitted by a single probe was calibrated. Points of light in exhaustively deconvolved images of hybridized cells gave fluorescent intensities and distances between probes consistent with single messenger RNA molecules. Analysis of β-actin transcription sites after serum induction revealed synchronous and cyclical transcription from single genes. The rates of transcription initiation and termination and messenger RNA processing could be determined by positioning probes along the transcription unit. This approach extends the power of FISH to yield quantitative molecular information on a single cell."

Here, the protein conductin was found to form a complex with both beta-catenin and the tumor suppressor gene product adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Conductin induced beta-catenin degradation, whereas mutants of conductin that were deficient in complex formation stabilized beta-catenin. Fragments of APC that contained a conductin-binding domain also blocked beta-catenin degradation. Thus, conductin is a component of the multiprotein complex that directs beta-catenin to degradation and is located downstream of APC. In Xenopus embryos, conductin interfered with wnt-induced axis formation."

The catalysts are platinum complexes derived from the bidiazine ligand family that are stable, active, and selective for the oxidation of a carbon-hydrogen bond of methane to produce methyl esters. Mechanistic studies show that platinum(II) is the most active oxidation state of platinum for reaction with methane, and are consistent with reaction proceeding through carbon-hydrogen bond activation of methane to generate a platinum-methyl intermediate that is oxidized to generate the methyl ester product."
https://openalex.org/W2088702036,The Kondo effect arises from the quantum mechanical interplay between the electrons of a host metal and a magnetic impurity and is predicted to result in local charge and spin variations around the magnetic impurity. A cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope was used to spatially resolve the electronic properties of individual magnetic atoms displaying the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic measurements performed on individual cobalt atoms on the surface of gold show an energetically narrow feature that is identified as the Kondo resonance—the predicted response of a Kondo impurity. Unexpected structure in the Kondo resonance is shown to arise from quantum mechanical interference between the d orbital and conduction electron channels for an electron tunneling into a magnetic atom in a metallic host.

Evolutionarily related to the flagellar assembly machinery, this system is also present in other pathogenic bacteria, but its organization is unknown. Electron microscopy revealed supramolecular structures spanning the inner and outer membranes of flagellated and nonflagellated strains; such structures were not detected in strains carrying null mutations in components of the type III apparatus. Isolated structures were found to contain at least three proteins of this secretion system. Thus, the type III apparatus of S. typhimurium, and presumably other bacteria, exists as a supramolecular structure in the bacterial envelope."
https://openalex.org/W2028534114,"It was demonstrated that polymeric supramolecular nanostructures with several length scales allow straightforward tailoring of hierarchical order-disorder and order-order transitions and the concurrent switching of functional properties. Poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (P4VP) was stoichiometrically protonated with methane sulfonic acid (MSA) to form P4VP(MSA) 1.0 , which was then hydrogen-bonded to pentadecylphenol. Microphase separation, re-entrant closed-loop macrophase separation, and high-temperature macrophase separation were observed. When MSA and pentadecylphenol were complexed to the P4VP block of a microphase-separated diblock copolymer poly[styrene- block -(4-vinyl pyridine)], self-organized structures-in-structures were obtained whose hierarchical phase transitions can be controlled systematically. This microstructural control on two different length scales (in the present case, at 48 and 350 angstroms) was then used to introduce temperature-dependent transitions in electrical conductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2000093730,"Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax are members of the Bcl-2 family that play important roles in apoptosis regulation. These proteins are believed to be membrane-bound and to regulate apoptosis through formation of homo- and heterodimers. However, we recently found by subcellular fractionation that whereas Bcl-2 is predominantly a membrane protein as previously reported, Bax and a significant fraction of Bcl-XL are soluble in thymocyte and splenocyte extracts. In addition, we have demonstrated that the ability of Bax to form dimers appears to be a detergent-induced phenomenon that coincides with a detergent-induced conformational change. We have further investigated the tertiary and quaternary states of Bax in the presence of various detergents. Detergents such as Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 readily enable Bax hetero- and homodimerization. However, other detergents such as polydocanol, W-1, octyl glucoside, dodecyl maltoside, Tween 20, and sodium cholate allow varying degrees of Bax hetero- and homodimerization. Detergents such as 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (Chaps) and Brij 35 allow neither hetero- nor homodimer formation. Immunoprecipitation analysis with the conformation-sensitive antibody uBax 6A7 revealed that whereas Triton X-100 readily exposes the N-terminal Bax epitope (amino acid 13–19), only limited exposure of the epitope occurs in Triton X-114, polydocanol, dodecyl maltoside, and sodium cholate, and no exposure of this epitope was observed in W-1, Chaps, octyl glucoside, Tween 20, and Brij 35. Moreover, we could not detect any proteins associated with the cytosolic form of Bax based on immunopurification of this protein. Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration chromatography analysis of the cytosolic Bax indicated that this protein is monomeric and displays an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. Induction of apo-ptosis which causes the insertion of the soluble form of Bax into membranes did not result in appreciable Bax/Bcl-XL, Bax/Bcl-2 or Bax/Bax dimer formation as determined by cross-linking studies. Further analysis of Bax after apoptosis induction by immunoprecipitation in the presence of Chaps also revealed no significant heterodimer formation. In conclusion, Bax displays several distinct states in different detergents that expose defined regions of the protein. In addition, these results suggest that mechanisms other than the simple dimerization among members of the Bcl-2 family may be required for the regulation of apoptosis.

In conclusion, Bax displays several distinct states in different detergents that expose defined regions of the protein. In addition, these results suggest that mechanisms other than the simple dimerization among members of the Bcl-2 family may be required for the regulation of apoptosis. Apoptosis is a natural cell elimination process that occurs widely among multicellular organisms. Members of the Bcl-2 family including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax represent some of the most well known regulators of this process. Bax was first described as a pro-apoptotic protein that can bind and counteract the pro-survival function of Bcl-2 (1Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bax in transfected mammalian cells in many cases makes the cells more susceptible to apoptosis induced by external stimuli (for reviews see refs. 2Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J.

Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), whereas only in some isolated cases it suppresses cell death (4Middleton G. Nuñez G. Davies A.M.

Expression of Bax in fission yeast, however, has been reported to directly induce either growth arrest or cell death (6Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B.

Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Like Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, Bax has three highly conserved regions known as BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains. The BH3 domain of Bax has been reported to be crucial for dimer formation (11Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Based on yeast two-hybrid select systems and/or immunoprecipitation studies, it has been reported that Bax can form homodimers (1Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar) or heterodimers with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bid (1Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and herpesvirus saimiri-encoded Bcl-2 homolog ORF16 (18Nava V.E. Cheng E.H.-Y. Veliuona M. Zou S. Clem R.J. Mayer M.L. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4118-4122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not with a Bcl-2 homolog KSbcl-2 encoded by herpesvirus 8 (19Cheng E.H.-Y. Nicholas J. Bellows D.S. Hayward G.S. Guo H.-G. Reitz M.S. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition to these dimerization domains, Bax also has a predicted membrane spanning segment at its C-terminal end. In Bcl-2, this C-terminal hydrophobic region is responsible for anchoring this protein to membranes of various organelles including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei (20Hockenbery D. Nuñez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar, 21Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C.

Based on the presence of this hydrophobic region and the propensity of Bax to form heterodimers with Bcl-2, it was believed that Bax co-localizes with Bcl-2 in membranes. However, recently, several studies have shown that Bax is predominantly a soluble protein in thymocytes, splenocytes, and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (23Hsu Y.-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar,24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of Bax by knock-out studies indicate that this protein is essential for spermatogenesis (25Knudson C.M. Tung K.S.K. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 26Rodriguez I. Ody C. Araki K. Garcia I. Vassalli P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In a double knock-out system, a deficiency in Bax prevents an increased cell death in the immature neurons of Bcl-XL knock-out mice (27Shindler K.S. Latham C.B. Roth K.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bax has been also implicated in anti-viral defense in promoting cell death in virally infected cells (28Brauweiler A. Garrus J.E. Reed J.C. Nyborg J.K. Virology. 1997; 231: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, Bax has been described as a tumor suppressor (29Yin C. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Van Dyke T. Nature. 1997; 385: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and in certain cases of human colorectal cancer, frameshift mutations were found in the gene encoding Bax (30Rampino N. Yamamoto H. Ionov Y. Li Y. Sawai H. Reed J.C. Perucho M. Science. 1997; 275: 967-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar,31Yamamoto H. Sawai H. Perucho M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4420-4426PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologically, Bax plays the role of sensitizing cells to apoptosis. However, little is known about the molecular basis by which Bax promotes cell death. One hypothesis, known as the dimer rheostat model, suggests that the formation of Bax homodimers promotes cell death, and in healthy living cells, the formation of Bax homodimers were prevented by Bax heterodimerization with the prosurvival factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (1Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar, 32Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). However, several recent mutagenesis studies show that dimerization may not be essential for the regulation of apoptosis (33Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 34Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nuñez G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we found that the cytosolic Bax in murine thymocytes undergoes a detergent-induced conformational change that is associated with the propensity of this protein to form either homodimers or heterodimers with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In this paper we have explored the epitope exposure and dimerization of the cytosolic and membrane-bound Bax and identified several different conformational states of this protein in the presence of various types of detergents. Synthetic peptides were purchased from Peptide Technologies Corp. Imject maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin was obtained from Pierce. PEG 4000, fetal bovine sera, and hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. Iscove's medium was from Biofluid. Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) 1The abbreviations used are: DSG, disuccinimidyl glutarate; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) cross-linkers were from Pierce.

Sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugate and ECL Western blotting detection kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bolton-Hunter reagent was from NEN Life Science Products. Immobilon membranes were from Millipore. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. New anti-Bax monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing mice with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated to peptides corresponding to amino acids 3–16 of rat Bax (CGSGDHLGGGGPTSS) and amino acids 43–62 of mouse Bax (PELTLEQPPQDASTKKLSEC). Splenocytes from immunoreactive mice were fused by PEG 4000 to murine NS-1 myeloma cells and selected with hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 36Molday L.L. Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18690-18695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-rat and species-independent Bax antibodies were designated as α rBax 1D1 and α uBax 2C8, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies α mBax 5B7, α hBax 1F6, and α uBax 6A7 were purified from ascites fluids by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE fractionation (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The purified antibodies were immobilized onto CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B at 2.5 mg of protein/ml packed beads (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 37Hsu Y.-T. Molday R.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For the detergent-dependent Bax heterodimerization and uBax 6A7 antibody binding studies, murine thymocytes were subjected to hypotonic lysis and Dounce homogenization at a cell density of 5 × 107/ml essentially as described previously (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Soluble protein extracts prepared from high speed centrifugation (130,000 × g) were adjusted to 150 mm NaCl either in the absence of detergent or in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100, Triton X-114, polydocanol, W-1, Chaps, octyl glucoside, dodecyl maltoside, Tween 20, Brij 35, or sodium cholate. The soluble extract (4.5 ml) was mixed with 150 μl of α mBax 5B7 or α uBax 6A7 antibody beads either in the absence or in the presence of appropriate detergents and allowed to incubate for 2 h. The unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads twice with 10 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl or with the same buffer containing 0.2% of the appropriate detergent. The bound proteins were then eluted off the beads with 180 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The acid eluants were neutralized with 30 μl of 1m Tris, pH 8.0. For the study of Bax homodimerization, murine and rat thymocytes were hypotonically lysed at a cell density of 1 × 108/ml. The soluble proteins from the two cell types were prepared as described above. The soluble extracts were mixed 1:1 and used for the immunoprecipitation studies using the α mBax 5B7 antibody Sepharose beads in the presence of various detergents as described above. Alternatively, immunoprecipitation of Bax was carried out from detergent-solubilized whole cell lysate. Murine thymocytes were solubilized in 10 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, Triton X-114, polydocanol, Chaps, octyl glucoside, or dodecyl maltoside or 0.5% W-1 at a cell density of 5 × 107/ml. The lysate was spun at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall SA 600 rotor for 15 min to pellet the nuclei and unsolubilized material. Bax complex was then immunoprecipitated from 4.5 ml of the detergent-solubilized lysate with 150 μl of the α mBax 5B7 antibody beads as described above. For the study of Bax heterodimerization in dexamethasone-treated thymocytes, murine thymocytes (7.5 × 107/ml) in Iscove's medium were subjected to treatment with 2 μmdexamethasone for 4 h. The cells were then collected, spun down, and solubilized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl containing 1% Triton X-100 or Chaps. Immunoprecipitation of Bax was carried out as described above. For the above immunoprecipitation studies, all lytic, solubilization, and washing buffers contain proteolytic inhibitors (25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) as described previously (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Soluble protein extracts from murine thymocytes were prepared as described above except that the lysate was prepared at a cell density of 1 × 108/ml. One hundred and eighty ml of the extract in the presence of 38 mm NaCl was loaded onto a 20-ml AF-heparin-650M column. Flow-through from the column was collected and then loaded onto a 15-ml Fractogel EMD TMAE-650M anion exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing the column with 3 column volumes of the lysis buffer, Bax was eluted off the column with 3 column volumes of the elution buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 125 mm NaCl). The eluant was then incubated with 0.5 ml of α mBax 5B7 antibody beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, and the bound Bax was eluted off the beads with 0.1 m acetic acid containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Six fractions of 0.3-ml samples were collected and neutralized with 40 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. The relative molecular weight of the cytosolic Bax was determined by gel filtration over a Sephacryl S-100 column. Murine thymic soluble extract (1 × 108/ml) was loaded onto a TMAE 650M anion exchange column as described above to concentrate the Bax. Half a ml of the 0.125m NaCl eluant was then loaded onto the gel filtration column (74 ml) equilibrated in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. One-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting with α uBax 2C8 antibody. The peak fraction containing murine Bax was assigned as the elution volume (V e) for the purpose of calculating its molecular weight. Blue dextran (2 × 103 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) were run separately as molecular weight standards. For whole cell cross-linking of dexamethasone-treated thymocytes using membrane-permeable cross-linkers, thymocytes were treated with 2 μmdexamethasone for 4 h (23Hsu Y.-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in PBS at a cell density of 2.5 × 107/ml. Ten ml of the cell suspension were then incubated with 1 mmDSP or DSG for 30 min on ice. The reaction was quenched with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 100 mm glycine buffer. The cells were then spun down, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 1% SDS. The samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by Western blotting. Ten micrograms of anti-murine Bax 5B7, anti-human Bax 1F6, and anti-universal Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibodies were iodinated with Bolton-Hunter reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Murine thymocytes were treated with dexamethasone for 4 h and subjected to hypotonic lysis and Dounce homogenization at a cell density of 5 × 107/ml as described above. The lysate (0.5 ml) was adjusted to 150 mm NaCl and incubated with 50 ng (2 μCi/μg) of iodinated antibodies either with or without the presence of 50 μg of cold antibodies for 30 min on ice. The samples were then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 61,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA 120.1 rotor. The radioactivity of the membrane pellets was then determined with a gamma counter. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% polyacrylamide gel unless specified) and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting analysis, the blots were probed with either α mBax 5B7 (1:10 diluted culture fluid), α uBcl-XL 2H12 (1:10 diluted culture fluid), α mBcl-2 10C4 (1:10 diluted culture fluid), α rBax 1D1 (1:10 diluted culture fluid), or α uBax 2C8 (1:20 diluted culture fluid) diluted in the blocking buffer for 45 min. The blots were then washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated in blocking buffer containing 1:7000 diluted sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin peroxidase for an additional 30 min. The blots were again washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and then in PBS and visualized by ECL Western blotting detection kit. The N-terminal epitopes of several anti-Bax monoclonal antibodies were determined by peptide mapping (SPOTs) analysis of a nested set of peptides corresponding to the N-terminal segments of Bax used for the generation of antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, the binding specificity of α mBax 5B7, α hBax 1F6, and α rBax 1D1 monoclonal antibodies lies within amino acids 7–14. The first 4 amino acids within this particular region are distinct between mouse, human, and rat and appear to account for the species specificity of these antibodies. The epitope for the α uBax 6A7 monoclonal antibody, produced against a peptide sequence (amino acids 12–24) common to murine, human, and rat Bax, was found within amino acids 13–19 which partially overlaps with epitopes of the above-described species-specific antibodies. The propensity of Bax to form Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-XL heterodimers in the presence of nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) led us to investigate the effect of other detergents in the induction of this process. Murine thymocytes were solubilized in either Triton X-100, Triton X-114, polydocanol, W-1, Chaps, octyl glucoside, or dodecyl maltoside. Immunoprecipitation of Bax was then carried out in the presence of these detergents using α mBax 5B7 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2). Detergents such as Tween 20, Brij 35, or sodium cholate failed to efficiently solubilize the thymocytes, and therefore they were excluded from this experiment. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting with α uBax 2C8, α mBcl-2 10C4, and α uBcl-XL 2H12 monoclonal antibodies for the detection of murine Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, Triton X-100 and its related homolog Triton X-114 readily enable Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-XL heterodimer formation. Other detergents such as octyl glucoside mediate Bax/Bcl-XL heterodimer formation but allow much less Bax/Bcl-2 heterodimer. Meanwhile, detergents such as polydocanol, W-1, and dodecyl maltoside enable only Bax/Bcl-XL formation with a clear absence of Bax/Bcl-2 heterodimer. Finally the zwitterionic detergent Chaps allows neither Bax/Bcl-2 nor Bax/Bcl-XL heterodimer formation. Addition of 0.1% SDS to the Triton X-100 solubilization buffer disrupts Bax/Bcl-2 heterodimer formation but does not affect Bax heterodimerization to Bcl-XL (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between Bax and Bcl-XL is comparably stronger than that of Bax and Bcl-2. Based on this study, it appears that different detergents may induce different sets of conformational changes in Bax, and perhaps in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL as well, to facilitate the differential heterodimerization of Bax with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. We have previously reported that Bax homodimerization, like heterodimerization, appears to be a detergent-dependent process (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Since we find Bax heterodimerization to be dependent upon the type of detergent present, we set out to examine the effect of different detergents on Bax homodimerization. Bax was immunoprecipitated from a mixture of the soluble protein extracts of murine and rat thymocytes either in the absence of detergent or in the presence of Triton X-100, Triton X-114, polydocanol, W-1, Chaps, octyl glucoside, dodecyl maltoside, Tween 20, Brij 35, or sodium cholate. Murine Bax was immunoprecipitated from the mixture by α mBax 5B7 monoclonal antibody to examine its propensity to dimerize with rat Bax. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-murine Bax 5B7 and anti-rat Bax 1D1 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3,top and middle). As revealed by Western blotting, α mBax 5B7 antibody immunoprecipitated murine Bax under all conditions. Homodimerization of murine Bax to rat Bax, as determined by Western blotting with anti-rat Bax 1D1 antibody, occurs most readily in Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 (Fig. 3, middle, lanes e and f) and is reduced in the presence of polydocanol and dodecyl maltoside (Fig. 3, middle, lanes g and k). Bax homodimers do not form in the absence of detergent (Fig. 3,middle, lane d), as expected, nor in the presence of W-1, Chaps, octyl glucoside, Tween 20, Brij 35, and sodium cholate (Fig. 3,middle, lanes h, i, j, l, m, and n). To determine if Bax heterodimerization with Bcl-XL occurs under similar conditions, the above-described immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting with α uBcl-XL 2H12 antibody. The results indicate that Bax can differentially form heterodimers with Bcl-XL in the presence of most of these detergents with the exception of Chaps and Brij 35 (Fig. 3,bottom, lanes i and m). In the absence of detergent, as previously reported (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), Bax does not heterodimerize with Bcl-XL (Fig. 3, bottom, lane d). These results suggest that the Bax homodimerization state is not only dependent upon the type of detergent but also appears to be distinct from its heterodimerization state. We have previously described the exposure of an N-terminal epitope of Bax (amino acids 12–24), which contains the binding site for the α uBax 6A7 antibody, in the presence of Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In order to further investigate the conformation-dependent exposure of this epitope that correlates with Bax hetero- and homodimerization and competes for Bax-Bcl-XL heterodimer formation, we extended the immunoprecipitation study with α uBax 6A7 antibody in the presence of various detergents. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting with α mBax 5B7 monoclonal antibody for the detection of murine Bax bound to the 6A7 antibody. Whereas the α uBax 6A7 antibody binds strongly to Bax in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 4, top, lane c), a decreased affinity was observed in the presence of Triton X-114, polydocanol, and sodium cholate (Fig. 4, top, lanes d, e and l), and only trace binding was observed in the presence of dodecyl maltoside (Fig. 4, top, lane i). Bax did not bind to the uBax 6A7 antibody either in the absence of detergent or in the presence of W-1, Chaps, octyl glucoside, Tween 20, and Brij 35 (Fig. 4,top, lanes b, f, g, h, j, and k). Thus, the epitope for the 6A7 antibody (now mapped to amino acids 13–19), which is normally buried, apparently adapts the exposed conformation only in the presence of selected detergents. We have also previously reported that the 6A7 antibody binding site competes with heterodimer formation (24Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol"

Ultrasoft x-rays were used to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in defined subnuclear volumes of human fibroblasts and DNA repair was visualized at those sites. The DSBs remained in a fixed position during the initial stages of DNA repair, and the DSB repair protein hMre11 migrated to the sites of damage within 30 minutes. In contrast, hRad51, a human RecA homolog, did not localize at sites of DNA damage, a finding consistent with the distinct roles of these proteins in DNA repair."

Previous research has shown an association between the stimulation of cell growth and increased activity of the PPP that occurs over hours to days. For example, 1) kidney hypertrophy due to a variety of growth stimuli (e.g. unilateral nephrectomy or diabetes mellitus) is associated with an increased activity of the PPP due to increased G6PD activity (7Farquhar J.K.

Research from our laboratory and others have shown that, in addition to the long term stimulation of G6PD by growth factors, there is a stimulation of G6PD activity that occurs within seconds to minutes following exposure to growth factors (13Tian W.-N.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20931-20937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, our laboratory has shown that following stimulation of rat renal cells to grow using epidermal growth factor (EGF), an increase in the activity of G6PD was observed within seconds, maximal at 1 min, and back to base-line level in 60 min (14Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C. Zimmerman E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12442-12448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a search for the mechanism of this rapid activation of G6PD, we discovered that G6PD, an enzyme thought to exist unbound in the cytoplasm, is probably bound to an intracellular structure and translocates following growth factor stimulation (13Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C. Zimmerman E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12442-12448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a permeabilized cell system, we demonstrated that EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulate the release of G6PD from permeabilized cells (13Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C. Zimmerman E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12442-12448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), We have further shown that the PDGF stimulation of G6PD translocation is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (13Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is likely mediated by the signal transduction proteins phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase C-γ (13Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previous work implies that there may be a mechanistic relationship between cell growth and G6PD activity. This report is designed to more directly assess the importance of G6PD activity on cell growth. The effects of both increases in G6PD activity via overexpression of G6PD and decreases in G6PD activity via the use of a G6PD inhibitor were used to address the importance and possible roles that G6PD may play in cell growth. The data suggest that proper G6PD activity is important for regulation of intracellular redox level during cell growth. The data further suggest that G6PD activity is important for proper cell anchorage and growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. [3H]Thymidine (85 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN.

Swiss 3T3, Balb/c 3T3 A31 fibroblasts, and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. RIN5mAF cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum and 5% horse donor serum. TRMP cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Penicillin-streptomycin (1%) was present in all culture medium. FLAG is a hydrophilic octapeptide sequence (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) to which a monoclonal antibody is available (18Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). The Flag-containing G6PD construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The Flag sequence was cloned to the C terminus of cG6PD. The cDNA of G6PD was a generous gift from Dr. Ye-Shih Ho (Institute of Chemical Toxicology, Detroit, MI). To prepare the Flag-G6PD fusion protein, G6PD-Flag cDNA was directionally cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The proper location and orientation of the construct was verified by restriction mapping. For certain studies, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3 vector containing FLAG-G6PD using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (19Ausubel F.M. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 16.13.1-16.13.7Google Scholar). As a control, the pcDNA3 vector alone was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. The expression of epitope-tagged G6PD was confirmed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against the Flag epitope, a polyclonal antibody against G6PD, and by measuring enzyme activity in cell lysates. Immunofluorescence staining was done using a monoclonal antibody to the Flag epitope to determine the efficiency of Flag-G6PD expression. Enzyme activity assays were performed as described previously (13Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH catalyzed by the two dehydrogenase enzymes in the PPP was measured by the increase of absorbance at 341 nm due to the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH by either G6PD or by the second enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD). G6PD catalyzes the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to 6-phosphogluconate (the substrate for PGD). Thus, to obtain accurate enzyme activities for G6PD and PGD, both PGD activity alone and total dehydrogenase activity (G6PD + PGD) were measured separately. G6PD activity was calculated by subtracting the activity of PGD from total enzyme activity. To obtain the total dehydrogenase activity, substrates for both dehydrogenase enzymes were added to a cuvette. In another cuvette, substrates for the second enzyme, PGD, were added to obtain the activity of this enzyme. Substrate concentrations were (mm): glucose 6-phosphate (0.2), 6-phosphogluconate (0.2), and NADP+ (0.1). Samples were added to a cuvette containing buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.1). The increase of absorbance was determined in a Hitachi U-2000 dual beam spectrophotometer. Data are expressed in arbitrary absorption units. This was performed as described previously (13Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies are described in the figure legends. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates, grown for 24 h in serum-containing medium. The cells were serum-starved for 48 h, and then individual wells were treated with either growth factors or serum (specified under “Results”) in the absence or presence of 100 μm DHEA for 12 h. At this time, 0.2 μCi of [3H]thymidine (85 Ci/mmol) was added and cells were incubated for another 12 h. At the end of the experiment, medium was removed and cells were extracted with 5% trichloracetic acid. Cells were then washed twice and then solubilized in 0.1m NaOH. Aliquots were analyzed for 3H radioactivity by scintillation counting. Alkaline extraction of cells was performed as previously reported by Stocchi et al. (20Stocchi V. Cuchiarini L. Magnani M. Chiarantini L. Palma P. Crescentini G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), slightly modified. Before any treatment, cells were cultured in serum-containing medium. After two washes with PBS, cells were then treated for 1 h with either DMEM alone, or plus 200 μm H2O2 or 100 μm DHEA in the absence or presence of serum. Cells were then harvested and spun down. Since alkaline condition preserves the reduced form of nucleotides, cells were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing KOH (pH 9). The Nonidet P-40 allows the release of cellular components without breaking down cell nuclei, which may cause high background in the final analysis. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was immediately spun with Amicon Centrifree microfilters for 30 min at 4 °C, and then the filtered extract was collected for the measurement of nucleotides. The ratio of NADPH/NADP in samples prepared under these conditions were stable for many days at −20 °C. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed with a 5-mm C-18 (25 cm) analytical column (Rennin) on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 HPLC. The mobile phase consisted of two eluants: 0.1 m KH2PO4 solution, pH 6.8 (Buffer A), and CH3OH (Buffer B). The chromatographic conditions were the following: 2 min at 100% Buffer A, 20 min up to 25% Buffer B. The gradient was then returned to Buffer A in 2 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Retention time and peak areas were simultaneously monitored at 254, 260, and 280 nm with a UV detector. Integration of peak areas at 254 nm was obtained for the quantitation of NADPH and NADP. Nucleotide standards include both α and β forms of NADP and NADPH. Quantitation of reduced and oxidized nucleotides were calculated as the sum of α and β forms. Confluent and quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated in DMEM in the absence or presence of G6PD inhibitor DHEA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were given 5 ng/ml PDGF for 10 min. Cells were then lysed using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 100 μmNa3VO4, and the cell lysates were boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and fractionated on SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred onto membranes and blotted with anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody. Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with either 10% calf serum or 10 ng/ml PDGF in DMEM in the absence or presence of G6PD inhibitor DHEA. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Incubation with monoclonal antibodies was carried out for 60 min using anti-Tyr(P) in 5% dry milk. After several washes with PBS, cells on coverslips were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG for another 30 min. After final wash, the coverslips were mounted with moviol mountant containing p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml), an antibleach agent. For the assessment of cell detachment, Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on 48-well plates for 24 h, rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated with DMEM in the absence and presence of G6PD inhibitor DHEA, 100 μmH2O2 or menadione. Cell detachment was observed under light microscope. For the statistical analysis, Student's t test was used. It has been reported that G6PD activity increases in growing cells (4Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K.W. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 7Farquhar J.K. Scott W.N. Coe F.L. Proc. Soc. Exp.

To confirm this, quiescent Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were compared with serum-stimulated cells, and to actively growing cells. Adding 10% calf serum for 1 h stimulated G6PD activity up to 60% as compared with serum-starved cells. G6PD activity in actively growing cells was 3–4-fold higher as compared with serum-starved cells (Fig. 2 A). This result suggests that both the stimulation of growth and being in the cell cycle increase the activity of G6PD. To determine whether the increase in G6PD activity was due to an increased expression of G6PD protein, Western blot analysis was done. Fig. 2 B shows that the expression of G6PD protein in the proliferating cells during the time course of the experiment was similar to slightly increased over that seen in quiescent cells, suggesting that the higher G6PD activity in proliferating cells was likely due to both stimulation of preexisting G6PD enzyme as well as to modest increases in G6PD expression. If G6PD activity is important for cell growth, we hypothesized that changes in G6PD activity should affect cell growth. The following experiments were designed to test this hypothesis. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an endogenous steroid (21Gordon G.B. Shantz L.M. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1987; 26: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,22Farquharson C. Milne J. Loveridge N. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although DHEA has multiple actions, it is known to be an inhibitor of G6PD (23Gordon G. Mackow M.C. Levy H.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that DHEA can inhibit cell proliferation (21Gordon G.B. Shantz L.M. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1987; 26: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Farquharson C. Milne J. Loveridge N.

Life Sci. 1986; 38: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, other than a report in osteoblasts and osteosarcoma cells using insulin-like growth factor I (22Farquharson C. Milne J. Loveridge N. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), no one has determined the effect of DHEA on peptide growth factor stimulated cell growth. Initially, it was determined if DHEA inhibited G6PD activity in cultured cells. After incubating cells with or without DHEA for 24 h, cells were lysed and the enzyme activity was assayed from the cell lysate. Incubation with DHEA decreased the activity of G6PD in all cell lines tested. The average inhibition by 100 μm DHEA ranged between 40 and 70% depending on the cell line. Representative results are shown in Fig. 3 A from Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. DHEA inhibited the activity of G6PD in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 of 4 μm. The data also show that DHEA did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of PGD, the second enzyme in the PPP. Fig. 3 B shows that DHEA inhibited growth factor-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporations in a dose-dependent manner. Note that the dose-dependent inhibition of G6PD activity by DHEA (Fig. 3 A) was closely correlated with the DHEA-induced suppression of growth factor-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporations (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 C shows that the decreased G6PD activity by DHEA was not caused by decreased expression level of G6PD protein, as indicated by an immunoblot using a specific antibody to G6PD. To test the inhibitory effect of DHEA on cell proliferation, we examined [3H]thymidine incorporations following growth stimulation of serum-starved cells in a number of cell lines (Table I). PDGF, EGF, and serum increased [3H]thymidine incorporation by 1.3–7.6-fold increase over control (Table I). (Control level of [3H]thymidine incorporation is the level of [3H]thymidine incorporation in the quiescent cells in the absence of growth factor and in the absence of DHEA.) DHEA suppressed the growth factor stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation in all cell lines tested. Specifically, DHEA abolished the PDGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in Swiss 3T3 and Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. DHEA inhibited EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in TRMP cells (a dog kidney epithelial cell line that expresses EGF but not PDGF receptors (13Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). DHEA also abrogated EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in PC12 cells. In addition, DHEA suppressed serum-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in PC12 cells and in RiN5mAF, an insulin-secreting cell line.Table IDHEA-abrogated [3 H]thymidine incorporation stimulated by growth factors and serumCell type controlnMitogen[3H]Thymidine incorporation of− DHEA+ DHEA+ DHEA alone-foldBalb/c 3T36PDGF3.7 ± 0.90.2 ± 0.02**0.2 ± 0.05Swiss 3T36PDGF7.6 ± 2.70.9 ± 0.23*0.5 ± 0.08TRMP/PDGFR5PDGF2.3 ± 0.50.7 ± 0.32*0.7 ± 0.16Balb/c 3T33EGF2.3 ± 0.60.2 ± 0.06*0.1 ± 0.07TRMP5EGF2.2 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.23**0.3 ± 0.11PC124EGF1.3 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.20**0.2 ± 0.12RIN5mAF3Serum2.3 ± 0.50.4 ± 0.12*0.3 ± 0.06PC124Serum1.7 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.21**0.3 ± 0.13 Open table in a new tab As noted above, this inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporations by DHEA was dose-dependent. A representative dose-response curve is shown in Fig. 3 B (EC50 = 2 μm). If G6PD activity is important for cell growth, cells overexpressing G6PD should have a higher level of [3H]thymidine incorporation as compared with cells expressing endogenous levels of G6PD. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either vector alone or with a construct of G6PD tagged with an epitope. Using indirect immunofluorescence on intact cells and Western blotting, it was determined that approximately 30–50% of the cells expressed FLAG-G6PD. After 3 days of transfection, the cells expressed 2–3-fold higher G6PD levels as detected by Western blot analysis using both a monoclonal antibody against the Flag epitope and a polyclonal antibody against G6PD (Fig. 4 A). This level of Flag-tagged G6PD expression gave rise to an almost 3-fold higher enzyme activity (Fig. 4 B). No significant increase in the activity of PGD, the next enzyme in the PPP, was observed in COS-7 cells overexpressing G6PD. Fig. 4 C (compare the −cG6PD column with the +cG6PD column that was not exposed to DHEA) shows that the COS-7 cells overexpressing G6PD had a significantly higher serum-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation as compared with cells transfected with vector alone, indicating that overexpression of G6PD can increase cell proliferation. If the elevated [3H]thymidine incorporations observed in the cells overexpressing G6PD are a result of the increased G6PD activity, then the G6PD inhibitor DHEA should suppress this elevation in [3H]thymidine incorporations. Fig. 4 C shows that the elevated [3H]thymidine incorporation observed in COS-7 cells overexpressing G6PD was suppressed by 100 μmDHEA to almost the same level as detected in COS-7 cells transfected with vector alone. This level of inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation by DHEA is much less than that seen in cells expressing only endogenous levels of G6PD (Fig. 3 B). Since the COS-7 cells that overexpress G6PD (Fig. 4 C) are actually a mixed population containing both cells that overexpress G6PD (30–50% of the total) and cells that express endogenous levels of G6PD, the level of inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation caused by 100 μm DHEA is the sum total of the affect of DHEA on both overexpressing cells and cells expressing wild type levels of G6PD. It thus seems likely that overexpressing cells require a significantly higher concentration of DHEA to inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporations as compared with cells expressing wild type levels of G6PD. Of note, DHEA inhibited the [3H]thymidine incorporation of cells transfected with vector alone are inhibited by DHEA in a manner similar to untransfected cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the activity of G6PD plays an important role in cell growth. The next series of experiments were designed to determine what is the critical product of G6PD activation that is required for cell proliferation. There are two principal end products of G6PD activation, NADPH, and via the PPP, ribose 5-phosphate. Deficiency of either separately or both together could account for the DHEA-suppressed cell growth. Similarly, increases in both or either alone could be required for enhancement of cell growth. R5-P does not readily cross cell membranes. Thus, to provide R5-P, Balb/c 3T3 cells were incubated with the combination of four ribonucleosides, or four deoxyribonucleosides. The nucleosides are metabolized to R5-P intracellularly. This method has been routinely used to increase intracellular R5-P (22Farquharson C. Milne J. Loveridge N. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Dworkin C.C. Gorman S.D. Pashko L.L. Cristofalo V.J. Schwartz A.G. Life Sci. 1986; 38: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this experiment, cell growth was measured by determining total protein content since the measurement of DNA synthesis by specific incorporation of [3H]thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine could be interfered with by the high concentration of nonlabeled thymidine. Fig. 5 shows that neither ribonucleosides nor deoxyribonucleosides rescued cells from DHEA-suppressed growth. Activation of G6PD and PGD lead to the production of NADPH. Thus, inhibition of G6PD by DHEA should lower intracellular NADPH levels and render cells more susceptible to oxidative stress. To assess whether NADPH is the critical PPP product required for cell growth, we took the following two approaches. First, we evaluated the intracellular levels of NADPH and NADP by HPLC analysis. Fig. 6 shows results from cells that were exposed to vehicle, 200 μmH2O2, or 100 μm DHEA for 1 h in the presence or absence of serum. The figure shows the effects of the treatments on the NADPH/NADP ratio. The NADPH/NADP ratio in the treated cells were compared with the NADPH/NADP ratio in control cells and expressed as a percentage of the control. Consistent with our data showing that G6PD activity is decreased by serum withdrawal, the data show that the NADPH/NADP ratio was decreased by serum withdrawal. In the absence of G6PD inhibitors, the NADPH/NADP ratio was not affected by a modest concentration of H2O2. This would be expected for cells that can properly defend against oxidative stress. Importantly, the data clearly show that in the presence and absence of serum, DHEA caused a 30–40% decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratio. This decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratio may be detrimental to cell growth. Next, we designed an experiment to evaluate whether the inhibition of G6PD and the subsequent decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratio would affect cell growth under oxidative stress conditions. As previously noted, studies have shown that cells with low levels of G6PD activity have increased sensitivity to oxidative stress as compared with cells with normal levels of G6PD activity (5Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 26Martini G. Ursini M.V. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that low concentrations of H2O2 can stimulate cell growth (1Wiese A.G. Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J. Arch.

https://openalex.org/W2089934847,"Glyphosate is a potent herbicide. It works by competitive inhibition of the enzyme 5-enol-pyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which catalyzes an essential step in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. We report the genetic engineering of herbicide resistance by stable integration of the petunia EPSPS gene into the tobacco chloroplast genome using the tobacco or universal vector. Southern blot analysis confirms stable integration of the EPSPS gene into all of the chloroplast genomes (5000–10,000 copies per cell) of transgenic plants. Seeds obtained after the first self-cross of transgenic plants germinated and grew normally in the presence of the selectable marker, whereas the control seedlings were bleached. While control plants were extremely sensitive to glyphosate, transgenic plants survived sprays of high concentrations of glyphosate. Chloroplast transformation provides containment of foreign genes because plastid transgenes are not transmitted by pollen. The escape of foreign genes via pollen is a serious environmental concern in nuclear transgenic plants because of the high rates of gene flow from crops to wild weedy relatives."
https://openalex.org/W1997873483,"The ability of bacteria to acquire and disseminate heterologous genes has been a major factor in the development of multiple drug resistance. A gene, intI4, was identified that encodes a previously unknown integrase that is associated with a ""gene-VCR"" organization (VCRs are Vibrio cholerae repeated sequences), similar to that of the well-characterized antibiotic resistance integrons. The similarity was confirmed by IntI1-mediated recombination of a gene-VCR cassette into a class 1 integron. VCR cassettes are found in a number of Vibrio species including a strain of V. metschnikovii isolated in 1888, suggesting that this mechanism of heterologous gene acquisition predated the antibiotic era."

We now show that progesterone regulates transcription of the p21 promoter by an unusual mechanism. This promoter lacks a canonical progesterone response element. Instead, progesterone receptors (PRs) interact with the promoter through the transcription factor Sp1 at the third and fourth of six Sp1 binding sites located downstream of nucleotide 154. Mutation of Sp1 site 3 eliminates basal transcription, and mutation of sites 3 and 4 eliminates transcriptional up-regulation by progesterone. Progesterone-mediated transcription is further prevented by overexpression of E1A, suggesting that CBP/p300 is required. Indeed, in HeLa cells, Sp1 and CBP/p300 associate with stably integrated flag-tagged PRs in a multiprotein complex.

Since many signals converge on p21, cross-talk between PRs and other factors co-localized on the p21 promoter, may explain how progesterone can be either proliferative or differentiative in different target cells. Progesterone is a paradoxical hormone having either growth stimulatory effects or growth inhibitory and differentiative effects, depending on the tissue in question and the dose and treatment regimen (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 2Graham J.D. Clarke C.L. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4502-4519Google Scholar). In the uterus for example, progesterone inhibits epithelial growth and has differentiative effects (3Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It is therefore used to counteract the proliferative and carcinogenic effects of unopposed estrogens in women prescribed hormone replacement therapy (4Colditz G.A. Hankinson S.E. Hunter D.J.

In the breast, the role of progesterone is more complex. The hormone is required for terminal growth and differentiation of the mammary gland (2Graham J.D. Clarke C.L. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4502-4519Google Scholar). Therefore, mice lacking progesterone receptors (PRs) 1The abbreviations used are: PR, progesterone receptor; PRE, progesterone response element; TGF-β, transcription growth factor-β; MEM, Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salts; nt, nucleotides; bp, base pair(s). exhibit incomplete mammary gland ductal branching and failure of lobulo-alveolar development (5Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Funk C.R. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). In animal models of mammary carcinogenesis, progesterone, depending on the regimen used, can either inhibit or promote tumor formation (2Graham J.D. Clarke C.L. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4502-4519Google Scholar). On the other hand, in animals with established PR-positive mammary tumors, progesterone is usually proliferative, and progesterone antagonists inhibit tumor growth (6Horwitz K.B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, in humans, second-line high dose progestin therapy effectively suppresses the growth of hormone-dependent PR- and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers that have acquired resistance to the antiestrogen tamoxifen (6Horwitz K.B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar). How can these contradictory effects of progesterone be reconciled? Recent studies have dealt with the effects of progesterone on mitosis and key cell cycle regulatory proteins in cultured human breast cancer cells (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E.

Studies focusing on the initial growth stimulatory component show that progestin-induced entry of cells into S-phase is accompanied by transient increases of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 activity (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.

Indeed, cyclin D1 is a critical component of the mitogenic response to progestins, and its overexpression in transgenic mice produces lobulo-alveolar changes in the mammary gland usually associated with progestational effects in pregnancy (8Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Growth stimulation by progestins is restricted to one cycle, however, and is followed by growth arrest at the G1/S boundary of the second cycle (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E.

Cells then enter a period of resistance to growth regulatory effects of additional progesterone, accompanied by hypophosphorylation and profound down-regulation of pRb, loss of cyclins D, A, and B, and sequential increases first, in the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p21Waf1, Cip1, Kip1, Sdi1 ) followed by increases in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (1Groshong S.D.

The control of proliferation and differentiation by many hormones and growth factors is linked by events that occur at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (10Pardee A.B.

In each case, the differentiating agents were also shown to induce transcription in a p53-independent manner from the p21 promoter fused to a reporter gene. We therefore asked whether the up-regulation of p21 protein levels induced by progesterone involves transcriptional regulation of the p21 promoter. We find that this promoter lacks a canonical progesterone response element (PRE). Instead, progesterone activates the gene through a novel mechanism that involves interactions between PRs and CBP/p300, with the transcription factor Sp1, at Sp1 DNA binding sites lying just upstream of the TATA box. Since other agents, such as phorbol esters, butyrate, Ca2+, BRCA-1, and TGF-β also induce p21 from this region of the promoter (13Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

T47D breast cancer cells (1 million) were plated and grown in 100-mm cell culture plates in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Transfection of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate coprecipitation was usually performed 24 h after plating using 3 μg of the luciferase-fused reporter construct (23Estes P.A. Suba E.J. Lawler-Heavner J. Wei L.L. Toft D.O. Horwitz K.B. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), 3 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid PCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to correct for transfection efficiency, and BluescriptTM carrier plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for a total of 20 μg of DNA as described previously (23Estes P.A.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 16 h later, transfection was completed when the medium was aspirated, and the cells shocked at room temperature for 2 min with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% glycerol. Cells were washed twice with serum-free MEM to remove the glycerol, then 10 ml of MEM containing 5% fetal calf serum were added per dish either with 30 nm progesterone or ethanol vehicle. Cells in duplicate plates were harvested 48 h later in 250 μl of lysis solution (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI), and 100 μl of lysate was analyzed for luciferase activity using the Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit and a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI) as described by the manufacturer. A further 100 μl of lysate was assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (25Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) to normalize for transfection efficiency. In Fig. 1, T47D cells were treated with progesterone or ethanol for 48 h prior to transfection, then re-treated with progesterone or ethanol for a second 48-h period as shown. HeLa cell transfection was carried out as above with the exception that 90,000 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes in 5% charcoal-stripped phenol red-free MEM. HeLa cells were not glycerol shocked and were harvested for analysis 24 h after hormone treatment. HeLa cells were stably transfected with flag epitope-tagged PR B (f:PRB) or A (f:PRA) or the wild-type PR isoforms. In the presence of transiently transfected PRE2-TATAtk-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter and the synthetic progestin R5020, the flag-tagged and wild-type receptors produce equal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (not shown). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa f:PR cells or PR-negative HeLa cells treated with or without 100 nm R5020 for 1 h. The PRs were immunoprecipitated using an anti-flag M2 affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Co.), washed twice with TEDG (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), twice with 0.3 m KCl in TEDG, twice with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in TEDG and then eluted from the gel using 0.2 mg/ml flag peptide (Kodak). The PRs and associated eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the antibodies against PRs, Sp1, or CBP/p300 described above. The protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). We recently demonstrated that in PR-positive T47D breast cancer cells, a pulse of progesterone induces one round of cell division. The cells then enter a period of prolonged growth arrest, during which they are resistant to the proliferative effects of a second dose of progesterone (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cells are not resistant to other mitogenic signals, however, because they can reenter the mitotic cell cycle in response to epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, during the arrested state the cells express functional PRs, which following treatment with a second dose of progesterone can activate transcription of a synthetic promoter/reporter (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and can promote cellular differentiation and accumulation of lipid vesicles (26Horwitz K.B. Wei L.L. Sedlacek S.M. D'Arville C.N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1985; 41: 249-316PubMed Google Scholar). Cells arrested by one dose of progesterone express high levels of p21, and the levels rise further following a second dose of progesterone given 48 h after the first (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To determine whether progesterone regulates p21 transcriptionally, a luciferase reporter gene driven by 2320 nt of the p21 promoter (Fig. 1 A) was transfected into PR-positive T47DCO cells that had been pre-treated with ethanol or 30 nm progesterone for 48 h, then re-treated with ethanol or progesterone for another 48 h (Fig. 1 B). Luciferase activity increased 2.3-fold in cells harvested 48 h after progesterone treatment, and 11.7-fold in cells receiving two sequential 48 h progesterone treatments. If progesterone is removed after 48 h, but the cells are not harvested for another 48 h, luciferase transcription continues and rises to 6.3-fold above controls. Since the half-life of progesterone is 3–4 h (27Horwitz K.B. Pike A.W. Gonzalez-Aller C. Fennessey P.V. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and of luciferase is 90 min (28Willard S.T. Faught W.J. Frawley L.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4447-4450PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that secondary signals prolong p21 transcription. Similarly, in PR-negative HeLa cells transfected with an expression vector encoding PR A, 24 h of progesterone increases luciferase activity driven by the proximal 2320 nt of the p21 promoter, 2–3-fold (Fig. 2). To map the progesterone-responsive region, a set of sequentially truncated promoter constructs driving the luciferase gene was transfected into HeLa cells transiently expressing PR A and treated with progesterone for 24 h (Fig. 2). Progressive 5′-truncation led to a decrease in basal activity, but the 2–3-fold induction by progesterone was maintained through a construct that retained only 154 nt at the 3′-end of the promoter. However, when sequences between −154 and −61 were deleted, the progesterone response was abolished, suggesting that PR effects are mediated from this region. The region between −154 and the transcription start site lacks PREs or AP-1 binding sites, through which progesterone responses could in theory be transmitted (29Bamberger A.-M. Bamberger C.M. Gellerson B. Schulte H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6169-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this region contains four consensus Sp1 binding sites, and downstream of −61 there are two more Sp1 sites and a TATA box (Fig. 3). Since PR responsiveness maps downstream of −154, this region was analyzed in detail using a series of 60-bp constructs, spanning nt −93 to −33 of the promoter (p21P93-S, WT), in which 10-bp blocks were progressively mutated (Fig. 3; p21P93-S, mut 1–6) (16Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The wild-type construct retains progesterone sensitivity narrowing the PR-responsive region to the 32 nt lying between −93 and −61 (Fig. 3). Mutations that destroy the Sp1-3 and Sp1-4 binding sites within this region (p21P93-S, mut 2 and 3) abolish progesterone induction. Mutation of Sp1-3 (p21P-S, mut 2) appears to produce a general loss of basal transcriptional activity. Therefore this site, coupled with Sp1-4 (p21P-S, mut 3) located between nt −70 and −65, encompass the PR-responsive element. Interestingly, neither mutation of the Sp1-5 or Sp1-6 sites further downstream nor mutation of the TATA box, eliminate the progesterone response. TATA box-independent transcription of the p21 promoter has been previously reported (21Datto N.B. Yu Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We find, however, that fusion of nt −117 to −61, which contains the progesterone-responsive region, directly upstream of the luciferase transcription start site, produces an inactive promoter (not shown), suggesting that proper spacing between the upstream Sp1 sites and the transcription start site must be maintained, as shown also by Prowse et al. (19Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and/or that along with the Sp1 sites, the proximal 34 nt of the promoter are necessary for PR function. Recently, Missero et al. (30Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) demonstrated that keratinocyte differentiation associated with an increase in p21 levels is abolished by overexpression of the E1A oncoprotein. E1A binds CBP/p300, therefore titration of CBP/p300 into the keratinocytes restored p21 expression (30Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To determine whether CBP/p300 is important in the induction of p21 by progesterone, HeLa cells were cotransfected with empty-, wild-type E1A-, or mutant E1A-containing expression vectors, the −2320 bp or the truncated −154 bp p21 promoter, and the PRA expression vector, and the cells were treated with vehicle or progesterone (Fig. 4). In the absence of excess E1A, progesterone induces luciferase transcription, but when wild-type E1A is overexpressed, progesterone-regulated transcription is abolished from either promoter. In contrast, an E1A mutant (E1A del 2–36; Ref.30Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) lacking the N-terminal region required to bind CBP/p300, cannot block progesterone-regulated transcription from the −2320 bp promoter. This mutant also increases basal transcription of the p21 promoter, which is similar to its effects on p15 promoter activity previously described (31Datto M.B. Hu P.P.-C. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type E1A also abolishes progesterone regulation of the PRE2-TATAtk promoter, yet fails to alter progesterone-regulated transcription of the Sp1-Luc (32Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) promoter (not shown). This suggests that the ability of E1A overexpression to block progesterone-induced transcription is promoter specific and not necessarily Sp1-dependent. Since the PR-dependent induction of p21 involves Sp1 and CBP/p300 in a region of the p21 promoter lacking a PRE, we postulated that PRs are tethered to the promoter through Sp1 and/or CBP/p300. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were stably transfected with expression vectors encoding flag-tagged PR A or B. The cells were treated or not with the progestin R5020, and nuclear extracts were prepared. PRs and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts with an anti-flag M2 affinity gel, then eluted from the resin with a flag peptide, and detected by immunoblotting. Fig. 5 A(top) shows expression of the PR A- or B-isoforms in nuclear extracts from untreated or R5020-treated PR-positive HeLa cells. Low levels of A receptors can be immunopurified from nuclear extracts with anti-flag resin even in the absence of ligand (lane 2), and the levels increase further after ligand addition (lane 1). In the absence of ligand, no B receptors can be precipitated from nuclear extracts (lane 4), but high levels are purified following ligand treatment (lane 3). Fig. 5 A (bottom) shows that Sp1 co-immunoprecipitates with the anti-flag antibody and is eluted by the flag peptide only from extracts that contain PRs. Similarly, no Sp1 is present in immunoprecipitates of nuclear extracts from PR-negative HeLa cells (not shown). Interactions between PRs and CBP/p300 are shown in Fig. 5 Busing R5020-treated PR-negative HeLa cells, or HeLa cells expressing flag-tagged PR B. Nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CBP/p300 antibody or the anti-flag resin-bound antibody, and copurified proteins were detected with anti-CBP/p300 or anti-PR antibodies. CBP (p265) and p300 can be immunoprecipitated with the anti-CBP/p300 antibody from PR-negative HeLa cells, but PR B are absent (lane 1), and no nonspecific binding is seen with the anti-flag antibody control (lane 2). However, in HeLa cells expressing flag-tagged PR B, high levels of B receptors co-immunoprecipitate with the anti-CBP/p300 antibody (lane 3) and in the reciprocal assay, p300 is co-immunoprecipitated with B receptors using the anti-flagantibody (lane 4). In breast cancer cells, a transient pulse of progesterone has biphasic effects; it accelerates proliferation in the first cell cycle then arrests cells at the G1/S boundary of the second cycle (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5032-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second dose of progesterone prolongs the growth arrest. We have proposed that the arrested cells are poised to enter a proliferative or differentiative pathway, depending on the nature of other cellular signals. This model calls for the convergence and integration of signals from the cell surface and cytoplasm with those in the nucleus. Since the progesterone-induced growth arrest is accompanied by a 10–15-fold increase in the levels of p21 (1Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and this protein is a key player in determining cell fate (12Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar), we speculated that integration of divergent signals occurs at the p21 promoter. To that end we sought to understand the mechanisms by which progesterone regulates the levels of p21. We show here that a transient pulse of progesterone increases transcription from the p21 promoter 2–3-fold (Figs. 1 and 2), which rises to approximately 12-fold in cells receiving a second hormone dose (Fig. 1). The progestin-responsive element maps to the Sp1-3 and Sp1-4 sites located between −84 and −65 nt. This suggests that progesterone induction is p53-independent, since the two p53 binding sites are located much further upstream at −1.4 and −2.3 kilobases (33El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). This also rules out involvement of sites for two other nuclear receptors in the progestin response, the retinoid-sensitive region, which maps to −1.2 kilobases (14Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31723-31728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and the vitamin D site at −770 nt (15Liu M. Lee M.-H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The proximal p21 promoter contains six Sp1 binding sites and a TATA box. The region comprising Sp1-1 and Sp1-2 is involved in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-mediated p21 induction in U937 cells (13Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and in BRCA-1-mediated p21 induction in SW480 colon cancer cells (20Somasundarum K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.-X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The region comprising Sp1-3 is required for p21 induction by TGF-β (21Datto N.B. Yu Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), butyrate (16Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ (19Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Butyrate sensitivity also requires Sp1-5 and Sp1-6 in conjunction with Sp1-3, with Sp1-3 being critical. We have mapped the progesterone-responsive region to 20 nt comprising Sp1-3 and Sp1-4 and show, furthermore, that Sp1-3 is required for basal promoter activity in HeLa cells. This explains the data of Biggs et al. (13Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that deletion of −120 to −61 (which includes Sp1-3) from the full-length promoter abolishes 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate- and p53-mediated induction. This would be expected if basal promoter function is destroyed. We conclude that if Sp1-3 is required for basal promoter activity, then progesterone response specificity requires Sp1-4, but clearly both sites are important. To our knowledge, no other p21 regulator has been mapped to Sp1-4. The mechanisms underlying Sp1-mediated induction of p21 transcription are unknown. Phosphorylation of the protein is unaffected by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or butyrate treatment (13Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and footprinting studies demonstrate that Sp1 is constitutively bound to the DNA (13Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We find that deletion of the TATA box does not abolish the response to progesterone, an observation also reported by Dotto et al. (21Datto N.B. Yu Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) in mapping the TGF-β-responsive element. Sp1 is known to interact with the N terminus of the TATA-binding protein-associated factor dTAF110 in the TFIID complex, and this interaction may account for the ability of Sp1 to activate transcription from TATA-less promoters (34Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 35Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 36Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DNA binding domain of PRs interacts with dTAF110 at its C terminus (37Schwerk C. Klotzbucher M. Sachs M. Ulber V. Klein-Hitpass L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21331-21338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, PRs and Sp1 may bind dTAF110concurrently as shown in Fig. 6 and suggests a mechanism for PR regulation of the p21 promoter. CBP/p300 may be a similar coregulator. It is necessary for p21-dependent differentiation of keratinocytes (30Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 31Datto M.B. Hu P.P.-C. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and p21-dependent cell cycle arrest and differentiation of muscle cells induced by MyoD (17Puri P.L. Avantaggaiti M.L. Balsano C. Sang N. Graessmann A. Giordano A. Levrero M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although CBP/p300 was originally identified as a cAMP-response element binding protein, recent reports have demonstrated that many transcription factors including steroid receptors bind this protein (38Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that PRs can bind CBP/p300 and that, in conjunction with Sp1, CBP/p300 is required for induction of the p21 promoter by progesterone. This suggests that CBP/p300 is an integral component of the basal transcription machinery of this promoter and/or that PRs recruit CBP/p300 to this transcription complex (Fig. 6). The former is more likely since p21 promoter regulation by TGF-β in keratinocytes is also CBP/p300-dependent (31Datto M.B. Hu P.P.-C. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sum, we have demonstrated a novel mechanism by which PRs can regulate gene transcription through a promoter that lacks canonical PREs. Instead, we suggest that PRs are brought to the DNA by binding to Sp1. It is possible that other Sp1-responsive genes (39Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40Porter W. Saville B. Hoivik D. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) can be similarly regulated. Furthermore, we have demonstrated this unusual regulation using the promoter of the p21 gene. This cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor is a key intermediary protein in the pathway that determines whether cells proliferate or differentiate (10Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 11Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. El-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar), and it is therefore a target of regulation by multiple signaling molecules. We speculate that the proliferative versus differentiative fate of progesterone target cells is controlled by interactions between PRs and other transcription factors colocalized on the p21 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1985710832,"Cdc45p, a protein essential for initiation of DNA replication, associates with chromatin after “start” in late G 1 and during the S phase of the cell cycle. Binding of Cdc45p to chromatin depends on Clb-Cdc28 kinase activity as well as functional Cdc6p and Mcm2p, which suggests that Cdc45p associates with the prereplication complex after activation of S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). As indicated by the timing and the CDK dependence, binding of Cdc45p to chromatin is crucial for commitment to initiation of DNA replication. During S phase, Cdc45p physically interacts with minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins on chromatin; however, dissociation of Cdc45p from chromatin is slower than that of MCMs, which indicates that the proteins are released by different mechanisms."

The crystal structure of an enzyme with editing activity in translation is presented here at 2.5 angstroms resolution.

For this two-step substrate selection, a ""double-sieve"" mechanism has already been proposed. The present crystal structures of the synthetase in complexes with L-isoleucine and L-valine demonstrate that the first sieve is on the aminoacylation domain containing the Rossmann fold, whereas the second, editing sieve exists on a globular beta-barrel domain that protrudes from the aminoacylation domain."

To enable this speed, the retrieval of distinct types of linguistic knowledge has to be orchestrated with millisecond precision. The nature of this orchestration is still largely unknown. This report presents dynamic measures of the real-time activation of two basic types of linguistic knowledge, syntax and phonology. Electrophysiological data demonstrate that during noun-phrase production speakers retrieve the syntactic gender of a noun before its abstract phonological properties. This two-step process operates at high speed: the data show that phonological information is already available 40 milliseconds after syntactic properties have been retrieved."
https://openalex.org/W1963995727,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily comprises classical MAPK (also called ERK), c-Jun amino-terminal or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK or SAPK), and p38. Although MAPK is essential for meiotic processes in Xenopus oocytes and the spindle assembly checkpoint in Xenopus egg extracts, the role of members of the MAPK superfamily in M phase or the spindle assembly checkpoint during somatic cell cycles has not been elucidated. The kinase p38, but not MAPK or JNK, was activated in mammalian cultured cells when the cells were arrested in M phase by disruption of the spindle with nocodazole. Addition of activated recombinant p38 to Xenopus cell-free extracts caused arrest of the extracts in M phase, and injection of activated p38 into cleaving embryos induced mitotic arrest. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with a specific inhibitor of p38 suppressed activation of the checkpoint by nocodazole. Thus, p38 functions as a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint in somatic cell cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2025764746,"Affinity-driven selection of B lymphocytes within germinal centers is critical for the development of high-affinity memory cells and host protection. To investigate the role of the CD21/CD35 coreceptor in B cell competition for follicular retention and survival within the germinal center, either Cr2+ or Cr2null lysozyme-specific transgenic B cells were adoptively transferred into normal mice immunized with duck (DEL) or turkey (TEL) lysozyme, which bind with different affinities. In mice injected with high-affinity turkey lysozyme, Cr2null B cells responded by follicular retention; however, they could not survive within germinal centers. This suggests that CD21 provides a signal independent of antigen that is required for survival of B cells in the germinal center."
https://openalex.org/W2047682144,"Considerable attention has recently been focused on the role played by different kinase cascades in the control of apoptosis. The triggering of stress-activated kinases concomitant with the inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has been observed in a number of cell systems undergoing programmed cell death. In addition, the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-Akt signaling cascade has been shown to protect from apoptosis. Here we have explored the potential role played by the inhibition of ERK in the activation of the stress kinases as well as the possible cross-talk with the PI 3-kinase pathway in HeLa cells. We show that the simple inhibition of ERK basal activity is sufficient to trigger apoptosis and p38 activation with no changes in Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase. This is a process dependent on the caspases and is completely abrogated by serum. The incubation with wortmannin or the transfection of dominant negative mutants of p85 or Akt block the inhibitory function of serum, suggesting the involvement of the PI 3-kinase-Akt system. Consistent with this, expression of active mutants of PI 3-kinase and Akt inhibits p38 activation and apoptosis. We also show here that the inhibition of ERK triggers the caspase system, which is abolished by serum in a wortmannin-dependent manner. Collectively, these results demonstrate a link between ERK and the p38 apoptotic pathway that is modulated by the survival PI 3-kinase-Akt module, acting upstream the caspase system.

Signal transduction pathways controlled by kinase modules regulate critical cellular functions such as cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Three major kinase cascades have recently been identified that culminate in the activation of three different sets of mitogen-activated protein kinases: the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; CPP32, caspase-3 or cysteine protease 32; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MKK3/6, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; Par-4, prostate apoptosis response 4; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling. 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; CPP32, caspase-3 or cysteine protease 32; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MKK3/6, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; Par-4, prostate apoptosis response 4; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling. JNK/SAPK, and p38 (1Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The three have been implicated in the control of apoptosis. ERK is activated by mitogens and survival factors, whereas JNK/SAPK and p38 are stimulated by stress signals (1Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). A number of findings indicate that the activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 may play decisive roles in the control of cell death. Thus, the JNK/SAPK pathway is critical during ceramide and stress-induced apoptosis (3Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Also in favor of a role of JNK/SAPK and p38 in apoptosis are the results reported by Xia et al. (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 126-131Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the transfection of a constitutively active mutant of MKK3/6 (the physiological activator of p38) along with p38 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in PC-12 cells. In addition, transfection of dominant negative mutants of MKK3/6 in PC-12 cells or of p38 in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts dramatically inhibits apoptosis by nerve growth factor withdrawal (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 126-131Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) and UV irradiation (8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), respectively. Consistent with this notion is the lack of excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis in the hipocampus of JNK3 knock-out mice (9Yang D.D. Kuan C. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). However, the simple transient activation of the stress kinase cascades may not always be sufficient to induce apoptosis, because, for example, tumor necrosis factor α promotes a significant induction of JNK/SAPK but does not invariably induce apoptosis (10Liu Z. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). In this regard, the concomitant inactivation of survival signals may be a prerequisite for JNK/SAPK and p38 to induce cell death (11Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; : 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deprivation of neurotrophic factors in PC-12 or UV-irradiation of NIH-3T3 cells not only activates the stress kinase cascades but also leads to a dramatic inhibition of the ERK pathway (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 126-131Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant because ERK has been shown to be required for survival signaling in response to fibroblast growth factor (12Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (13Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overexpression of ERK in NIH-3T3 cells impairs a large part of the UV-induced apoptotic response (8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the ability of a cell to die or survive may be dictated by a critical balance between the ERK and the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways (11Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; : 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the role of PI 3-kinase as a source of survival signals. Yao and Cooper (14Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) have shown that inhibition of PI 3-kinase in PC-12 cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis. PI 3-kinase also plays a critical role in anoikis and apoptosis induced by myc and UV irradiation (15Kaufmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 16Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J.

Interestingly, the expression of permanently active mutants of PI 3-kinase or Akt (a target of PI 3-kinase) is sufficient to inhibit apoptosis (15Kaufmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 17Kulik G.A. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

Collectively, these results suggest that the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway is required and sufficient for cell survival. However, this does not seem to always be the case. Thus, for example, inhibition of PI 3-kinase does not induce apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons maintained in serum and K+-rich medium (18Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenber M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PI 3-kinase only has an impact in this system when cells are incubated in serum-free low K+ medium in the presence of insulin-like growth factor 1, which partially supports neuron survival (18Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenber M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). In addition, and consistent with these observations, the inhibition of PI 3-kinase is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in superior cervical neurons (20Philpott K.L. McCarthy M.J. Klippel A. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), although the overexpression of active mutants of PI 3-kinase or Akt can support survival of these cells in the absence of nerve growth factor (20Philpott K.L. McCarthy M.J. Klippel A. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that multiple pathways are important for cell survival and that the comprehension of the cross-talk existing between these cascades will greatly help in the understanding of this important pathophysiological process. In the present study, we have addressed the role that the inhibition of ERK plays in the activation of the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways as well as the possible cross-talk between this and the PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling cascade. The pCDNA3 and pCMV-βGal have previously been described (Diaz-Meco et al. (21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar)). The p38 expression vectors (pCMV5-Flag-p38 and the dominant negative pCMV5-Flag-p38AGF) were provided by Dr. Roger Davis. pRK5rCD2p110myc, containing a permanently active mutant of PI 3-kinase was a gift from Dr. Cantrell (ICRF, London). The pCDNA3-myc-Δp85 is a myc-tagged version of plasmid pRSΔp85, generously provided by Dr. Kasuga. The FADD dominant negative (pCDNA3AU1FADDDN) was provided by Dr. Dixit (Genenteck, San Francisco). The expression vectors for the permanently active and the kinase defective mutants of Akt were a gift from Dr. Julian Downward (ICRF, London). The pGEX-2TK-Elk-1 construct was transformed into Escherichia coli JM101, and the expression and purification of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose was carried out according to the manufacturer's procedures. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Subconfluent cells were transfected with different plasmid DNAs by the calcium phosphate method (CLONTECH, Inc.). Some experiments were performed in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem), the interleukin 1β converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Bachem), actinomycin D (Sigma), or wortmannin (Sigma). HeLa cells either untreated or incubated with different stimuli were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors), and cellular extracts (20 μg) were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gels. Afterward, they were electrophoretically transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with the specific antibodies: ERK (Pharmingen); p38, phospho-specific ERK, phospho-specific p38, and JNK/SAPK (New England Biolabs); anti-Fas ligand (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-FADD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Flag (Eastman Kodak Co.); anti-CPP32 (Tansduction Laboratories); or anti-myc. The bands were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham). For the p38 assay, HeLa cells transfected with Flag-p38 were extracted with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (2 μg/mg of protein extract). The activity was determined by phosphorylation of 3 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Elk-1 in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The kinase reaction was terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphorylation of the substrate protein was examined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by exposure and quantitation in an InstantImager (Packard). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis was performed by using an in situ cell death detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The β-galactosidase co-transfection assays for determination of cell death was performed as described previously (21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We initially determined whether the simple inhibition of ERK leads to the activation of p38 and JNK/SAPK. HeLa cells cultured either in the presence or in the absence of serum were incubated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, and the activity of ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38 was determined by immunoblot analysis with antibodies that recognized the activated phosphorylated forms of the three kinases in cell extracts obtained at different times. The levels of phospho-ERK were very similar in cells that were incubated either with or without serum (Fig. 1), indicating that the basal levels of ERK are not dramatically affected by the presence of serum when cells are cultured asynchronously. The addition of the MEK inhibitor rapidly and profoundly reduced the phospho-ERK signal with no effect on ERK protein levels (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the reported ability of this drug to inhibit the MEK-ERK pathway. This inhibition was detected in cells maintained both in serum-containing and in serum-free media (Fig. 1). Interestingly, subsequent to the inhibition of ERK, there is a dramatic activation of p38 in cell cultures kept in serum-free media, as determined by immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig. 1) or in anti-p38 immunoprecipitates (not shown). This effect takes place with no changes in p38 protein levels (Fig. 1). This increase in p38 activity is detectable at 2 h after ERK inhibition and remained elevated at least until 12 h, the maximum time point measured (Fig. 1). These changes in ERK and p38 activities took place with little or no effect on the activity or levels of JNK/SAPK (not shown). Therefore, the inhibition of ERK leads to the activation of p38 in cell cultures maintained in serum-free media. However, the presence of serum, although unable to affect the inhibition of ERK by the MEK inhibitor, completely abrogated the stimulation of p38 (Fig. 1). This indicates that signals activated by the presence of serum blocked, in an ERK-independent manner, the ability of p38 to be activated by the inhibition of the ERK cascade. Consistent with the notion that ERK may provide survival signals are the results of Fig. 2 A, demonstrating that the incubation of HeLa cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 induces apoptosis in cell cultures maintained in the absence of serum. The presence of serum or the incubation with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD, completely inhibited that effect. This suggests that the mechanism whereby the inhibition of the MEK-ERK cascade induces apoptosis involves the caspase system and that the presence of serum not only inhibits the activation of p38 but also the induction of apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis of parallel extracts demonstrate that the MEK inhibitor actually blocked the ERK pathway and activated CPP32 in a serum-inhibitable and z-VAD-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). The loss of CPP32 represents cleavage and activation of the caspase. In the next series of experiments we determined whether the stimulation of p38 is mediated by the caspase system. Thus, HeLa cells maintained in serum-free medium for 24 h were incubated or not with the MEK inhibitor either in the absence or in the presence of z-VAD. Results of Fig. 3 Ademonstrate that the activation of p38 is completely blocked by the inhibition of caspases. Recent evidence indicates that the stimulation of apoptosis by UV irradiation or myc expression involves the activation of the Fas signaling cascade (22Hueber A.O. Zörnig M. Lyon D. Suda T.

To determine whether the activation of p38 by the inhibition of Erk may depend on the expression of Fas ligand, HeLa cells were incubated with PD98059 either in the absence or in the presence of actinomycin D. Results of Fig. 3 B demonstrate that inhibition of transcription has no effect on p38 activation. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis demonstrate that Fas ligand levels were unaffected upon the stimulation of HeLa cells with PD98059 (not shown). It is possible that the ability of PD98059 to activate p38 is due to the stimulation of the Fas system with no increase in the level of Fas ligand (22Hueber A.O. Zörnig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Fas binds to FADD, which connects the receptor to the caspase pathway through FADD-like interleukin-1β converting enzyme (FLICE) (25Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C.

Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of FADD, which contains just the death domain, not only inhibits the ability of Fas to induce apoptosis but also that of tumor necrosis factor α (25Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next determined whether the activation of p38 by the inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway is mediated by the FADD signaling cascade. Thus, Flag-p38 was transfected along with an expression vector for dominant negative FADD in HeLa cells that were subsequently incubated in the absence of serum and activated with PD98059. Of note, expression of dominant negative FADD has no effect on PD98059-induced p38 (Fig. 4), indicating that the activation of p38 by ERK inhibition is independent of the FADD-mediated Fas and tumor necrosis factor α-signaling pathways. We next explored whether the blockade by serum of p38 activation depends on PI 3-kinase. HeLa cells were maintained either in the absence or in the presence of serum and were incubated with the MEK inhibitor either with or without wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase). Results of Fig. 5 Ashow that the ability of serum to block the activation of p38 by PD98059 is completely abrogated by wortmannin, which has little or no effect on cells incubated in the absence of serum. This suggests that PI 3-kinase is required for the effects of serum on p38 stimulation. The following experiments confirm these findings. Transfection of an active PI 3-kinase mutant inhibited the activation by the MEK inhibitor of a co-transfected Flag-tagged p38 construct (Fig. 5 B). Transfection of an active mutant of Akt also inhibits the activation of p38, suggesting that Akt activation accounts for the inhibitory effects of serum and PI 3-kinase on p38 activation. Consistently, transfection of the kinase-inactive mutant of Akt abrogates the inhibitory effect of serum on the activation of p38 by the MEK inhibitor. Likewise, expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase produces the same effect (Fig. 5 B). To position the PI 3-kinase negative effects on the PD98059-triggered p38 pathway, we initially determined whether the inhibition of the ERK cascade actually activated the caspase pathway. To this aim, the cleavage of CPP32 was determined in HeLa cell cultures triggered with PD98059 either in the absence or in the presence of serum. This treatment promoted the cleavage of CPP32 in a time-dependent manner that was completely inhibited by the presence of serum (Fig. 6 A). The CPP32 cleavage was reproducibly detectable at 10–30 min after ERK inhibition and was maximal at 2 h (Fig. 6 A). Of note, wortmannin abrogated the inhibitory effects of serum (Fig. 6 B), indicating that PI 3-kinase acts upstream in a pathway leading to activation of the caspases, which are required for p38 stimulation by PD98059. Consistent with the above results are the data of TableI showing that the reduction in cell viability induced by the inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway is not only blocked by transfection of dominant negative p38 but also by expression of active mutants of PI 3-kinase and Akt. This again demonstrates the existence of a functionally relevant cross-talk between the MEK-ERK and PI 3-kinase pathways to control p38 activation and apoptosis.Table IEffect of different kinase mutants on cell death induced by the inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathwayNumber of blue cells/wellControlP38AGFPI 3-kinaseAktControl2200 ± 1802100 ± 2002600 ± 4002250 ± 220PD98059790 ± 851880 ± 1502500 ± 3202200 ± 170 Open table in a new tab The role played by different signal transduction molecules in the control of cell survival is the subject of intense discussion. The stress-activated kinase cascades, which include the JNK/SAPK and the p38 pathways, are activated in response to different apoptotic stimuli and seem to play a decisive role in this process (3Verheij M.

Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Thus, the simple activation of p38 by its physiological stimulant, MKK3/6, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in transfected cells (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 126-131Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of MKK3/6 or p38 dominant negative mutants blocked apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 126-131Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) and UV irradiation (8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are two major kinase pathways involved in the induction of cell survival: the ERK and the PI 3-kinase cascades. Inhibition of ERK activity correlates with the activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 as well as with the induction of apoptosis in nerve growth factor-deprived PC-12 cells and UV-irradiated mouse fibroblasts (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 126-131Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Also, the inhibition of ERK below a basal threshold level triggers apoptosis, suggesting that, in addition to its well established role in cell cycle progression, ERK also controls survival. The balance between the activity of the stress kinases to that of ERK has been proposed to determine the cell fate (11Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; : 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This is consistent with results demonstrating the antagonistic effects of ceramide versus sphingosine 1-phosphate. The former potently activates the stress kinases, whereas the latter inhibits them and activates ERK (28Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). This, again, suggests a link between both types of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Our own data shows that UV irradiation or the inhibition of the atypical PKCs leads to an increase in p38 activity and a decrease in ERK activity (8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We show here that the simple inhibition of the ERK basal activity is sufficient to trigger p38 activation in a caspase-dependent manner. This effect is blocked by the presence of serum through the PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway that acts upstream of the caspase system. Recent evidence suggests that the mechanism whereby certain stimuli induce apoptosis may involve the activation of the Fas pathway (22Hueber A.O. Zörnig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this case, however, we demonstrate that the blockade of this pathway has no effect on the ability of the inhibition of ERK to activate p38. Because the strategy employed here (the use of a FADD dominant negative mutant) not only blocks Fas but also tumor necrosis factor α signaling to cell death (25Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F.

Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), we conclude that neither of these systems is involved in the activation of p38 by PD98059. We have recently shown that the inhibition of the atypical isoforms of PKC (ζPKC and λ/ιPKC) is required for the induction of apoptosis and the activation of p38 in mouse fibroblasts (8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This involves the interaction of ζPKC and λ/ιPKC with the protein Par-4, whose expression is sufficient to induce apoptosis in fibroblasts incubated under low serum conditions (8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L.

Interestingly, the ability of Par-4 to induce apoptosis is a caspase-dependent process that correlates with a decrease in ERK activity concomitant with an increase in p38 activity (8Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). What we show here is that there is a link between the inhibition of ERK, the activation of the caspase system, and the stimulation of p38. These results are consistent with the model depicted in Fig. 7, according to which an apoptotic stress signal such as UV irradiation produces at least two actions, one that by inducing Par-4, inactivates the atypical PKCs, which leads to the inhibition of ERK, triggering the caspase system that stimulates p38. Another action blocks PI 3-kinase, which allows the caspase system to be operative. The fact that the atypical PKCs are activated by PI 3-kinase products (30Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S-I. Mizuno K. Hirai S-I. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 31Herrera-Velit P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) indicates that these PKCs are subjected to a double control mechanism in stress-activated cells: the interaction with Par-4 and the inactivation of PI 3-kinase. From all these results, at least three important issues arise for future studies. One is the mechanism whereby Akt inhibits p38. Because the caspase activation is required for p38 stimulation by PD98059, we are tempted to speculate that Akt may be affecting either directly or indirectly the caspase system. The recent finding that Akt phosphorylates and inactivates Bcl-XL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter (34Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar, 35Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nuñez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar) coupled with the existence of a link between Bcl-2 and the caspases (36Golstein P. Science. 1997; 275: 1081-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 37Vaux D.L. Cell. 1997; 90: 389-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) may explain why PI 3-kinase has to be inhibited for p38 to be activated. The second issue, concerning the mechanism whereby PI 3-kinase may be inhibited by UV irradiation, is less clear and will need further work to be solved. However, the recent discovery that PI 3-kinase is blocked by c-Abl in the genotoxic stress response (38Yuan Z.M. Utsugisawa T. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23485-23488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) opens new possibilities for investigation. Finally, the mechanism whereby p38 is activated in response to ERK inhibition remains to be determined. We show here that the caspase system is essential, and preliminary results demonstrate that it is mediated by MKK3/6. 2E. Berra and J. Moscat, unpublished observations. Because the upstream activator of MKK3/6 has not been established yet, it is very difficult to address the link existing between this kinase and the caspases. However, other evidences support a connection between the caspases and the stress-activated kinases. Thus, Frisch and co-workers have recently demonstrated that MEK kinase 1 activation during anoikis requires the cleavage of the kinase by caspases, which seems critical for cell death (39Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar).

However, it is unclear whether N-syndecan would possess independent signaling capacity in neurite growth or in related cell differentiation phenomena. In the present study, we have transfected N18 neuroblastoma cells with a rat N-syndecan cDNA and show that N-syndecan transfection clearly enhances HB-GAM-dependent neurite growth and that the transfected N-syndecan distributes to the growth cones and the filopodia of the neurites. The N-syndecan-dependent neurite outgrowth is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and PP1. Biochemical studies show that a kinase activity, together with its substrate(s), binds specifically to the cytosolic moiety of N-syndecan immobilized to an affinity column. Western blotting reveals both c-Src and Fyn in the active fractions. In addition, cortactin, tubulin, and a 30-kDa protein are identified in the kinase-active fractions that bind to the cytosolic moiety of N-syndecan. Ligation of N-syndecan in the transfected cells by HB-GAM increases phosphorylation of c-Src and cortactin. We suggest that N-syndecan binds a protein complex containing Src family tyrosine kinases and their substrates and that N-syndecan acts as a neurite outgrowth receptor via the Src kinase-cortactin pathway.

Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) have suggested interaction of matrix-associated HB-GAM with a cell surface receptor. Furthermore, HB-GAM is expressed at the surface of developing muscle cells and is suggested to play a role in the development of nerve/muscle contacts (10Peng H.B. Ali A.A. Dai Z. Daggett D.F. Raulo E. Rauvala H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3027-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Szabat E. Rauvala H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Daggett D.F.

N-syndecan (syndecan-3) has recently been isolated from detergent extracts of perinatal rat brain as a receptor or co-receptor for HB-GAM using recombinant HB-GAM as an affinity matrix (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-syndecan is localized at the surface of neurites and their growth cones in rat primary neurons growing on HB-GAM-coated matrix in vitro(13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HB-GAM and N-syndecan are spatiotemporally co-expressed in developing rat brain (14Nolo R. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cell surface N-syndecan interacts with HB-GAM through its heparan sulfate chains (15Kinnunen T. Raulo E. Nolo R. Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2243-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This interaction is enhanced by assembly of the heparan sulfates in the protein moiety and is specific, as soluble N-syndecan and N-syndecan-derived glycosaminoglycans, in contrast to several other glycosaminoglycans, inhibit HB-GAM-induced neurite outgrowth in vitro (15Kinnunen T. Raulo E. Nolo R. Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2243-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Anti-N-syndecan antibodies also inhibit specifically the interaction of HB-GAM with brain neurons (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-syndecan is a member of the syndecan gene family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are expressed in cell- and development-specific patterns (16Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The four syndecans (syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4) have structurally variable extracellular domains, but a high degree of conservation is found on their cytoplasmic domains (for reviews, see Refs. 17Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 18Jalkanen M. Elenius K. Rapraeger A.

Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The highly conserved cytoplasmic domain suggests an important function for it. This could occur either by association of syndecans directly with the cytoskeleton or with second messenger pathways. The core protein of syndecan-1 has been shown to colocalize with actin in syndecan-1-transfected Schwann cells (21Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and syndecan-4 has been shown to localize to focal contacts (22Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The functions of cell surface proteoglycans and their interactions with the extracellular matrix have been widely studied (for reviews, see Refs. 23Gallagher J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1201-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 25Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we study the HB-GAM-induced signals mediated by N-syndecan to the cytoplasm. We have transfected N18 neuroblastoma cells with an N-syndecan cDNA and show that cells expressing N-syndecan respond to HB-GAM by growing neurites, whereas the parental cells or mock-transfected cells respond weakly if at all. We have purified proteins from detergent extracts of rat brain and show that kinase activity together with substrate(s) associates with the N-syndecan cytosolic domain. Biochemical studies show that a protein complex containing Src family kinases (c-Src and Fyn) and their substrate(s) binds to N-syndecan. Cell-biological studies show that phosphorylation of both c-Src and cortactin is increased when N-syndecan is ligated by HB-GAM. We suggest that N-syndecan associates with the Src-cortactin pathway and thus mediates neurite outgrowth induced by extracellular matrix-bound HB-GAM. N-syndecan cDNA was isolated from a rat hippocampal cDNA library (Stratagene), using a fragment of N-syndecan cDNA produced by polymerase chain reaction as a probe (14Nolo R. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A cDNA of 5.5 kilobases was isolated and confirmed by sequencing to correspond to an N-syndecan sequence (26Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A 1.8-kilobase EcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment containing a 47-base pair leader, the complete 1329-base pair coding sequence, and a 419-base pair 3′-untranslated region was ligated into the pHβA-pr1-neo vector (27Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), which was cut with EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes. pHβA-pr1-neo contains human β-actin promoter, which drives a strong ubiquitous expression and a neomycin resistance gene. N18 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected by lipofection using Transfectam reagent (IBF Biotechnics). G418 (600 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the medium after 48 h to select for stably transfected clones. Individual G418-resistant clones were picked and screened for N-syndecan expression by Northern blotting as described (14Nolo R. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using the 1.8-kilobase N-syndecan cDNA as a probe. Two clones having the highest level of expression were chosen for further study. Control cells were transfected with vector only, and two G418-resistant clones were chosen randomly. N-syndecan-transfected and mock-transfected clones have been cultured under identical conditions. Subconfluent N18 cultures were used for neurite outgrowth assay. Assays were done essentially as described before (28Rauvala H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were detached by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min followed by vigorous pipeting with a Pasteur pipette. Microtiter wells were coated by incubating with HB-GAM solution (5 μg/ml) for 20 h at +4 °C. Cells were plated on HB-GAM-coated wells (5 × 103 cells/well) and grown in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 24 h and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min. Proportion of neurite-bearing cells was counted with inverted microscope using phase contrast. Cell processes longer than two cell diameters were counted as neurites. For microphotography, the cells were seeded on microscope coverslips coated with HB-GAM. Cells were grown on coverslips as in neurite outgrowth assays for 24 h. They were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-N-syndecan antibodies (5 μg/ml; Ref. 14Nolo R. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution. Binding of the antibodies was detected with TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Olympus Provis 70 microscope with a 60 × apochromat objective was used for microscopy. Micrographs were taken using a Photometrics SenSys CCD camera. The peptide corresponding to the cytosolic domain of rat N-syndecan with an N-terminal cysteine (CRMKKKDEGSYTLEEPKQASVTYQKPDKQEEFYA) was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (ABI 433) and purified with high performance liquid chromatography. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the purified peptide confirmed the sequence expected from the chemical synthesis. The peptide was coupled to Thiopropyl Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual active groups of thiopropyl-Sepharose were blocked by reaction with 2-mercaptoethanol at low pH (4.5) at which the aliphatic disulfides that link the protein with the gel remain intact. Forebrains from 4- to 6-day-old rats were homogenized in ice-cold extraction buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, with 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4 as phosphatase inhibitors, and 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.6 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin as protease inhibitors. The homogenate was extracted for 1 h and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was precleared with HiTrap heparin affinity column (Pharmacia) and applied to the peptide affinity column. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of the extraction buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 column volumes of the extraction buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing 2% bovine serum albumin, followed by washing with 5 column volumes of the extraction buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The column was further washed with 10 column volumes of each 0.2 m and 0.3m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with 2.5 column volumes of 1 mg/ml of the peptide corresponding to full-length cytosolic domain of rat N-syndecan (NS-1). In some experiments, the column was eluted in parallel with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the membrane proximal region of the syndecan cytosolic domain (NS-2, 1 mg/ml, RMKKKDEGSYC; Multiple Peptide Systems) in the extraction buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. As a control, the column was eluted with a peptide corresponding to the cytosolic domain of rat receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE, Ref. 29Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y-C.E. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and GenBank accession numberL33413; CRKRQPRLEERKAPESQEDEEERAELNQSEEAEMPENGAGGP). After elution with the peptide, the column was further washed with 1 and 2m NaCl. In some experiments, a blank Sepharose matrix column was run in parallel and analyzed for binding components. N-syndecan and coeluting proteins were purified by HB-GAM affinity chromatography as described (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide affinity fractions were concentrated with Microcon microconcentrators (Amicon) and dissolved in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol. 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) in 75 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm cold ATP was added to the fractions, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. An aliquot of the kinase reaction was diluted with kinase buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-cortactin antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight at +4 °C. The samples were then incubated with protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at +4 °C. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with the kinase buffer; the bound immunocomplexes were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples from the kinase activity assay and immunoprecipitations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Proteins of the peptide affinity fractions were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins of interest were excised from the gel, cut to 1 × 1-mm pieces, destained, and dehydrated by washing twice with acetonitrile and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Proteins were reduced by rehydrating the gel pieces in 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.1 mNH4HCO3 for 30 min at 56 °C. The dithiothreitol solution was removed, and the proteins were alkylated by addition of 55 mm iodoacetamide in 0.1 mNH4HCO3. Excess iodoacetamide was removed by washing with 0.1 m NH4HCO3, followed by dehydration with acetonitrile, and the samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The proteins were digested by rehydrating the gel pieces with 10 μl of lysyl endopeptidase (40 ng/μl) in digestion buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 9.2, containing 10% acetonitrile). Digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C and stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid, a final concentration of 1%. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed in the delayed extraction mode with a BIFLEX mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Germany), using a 337-nm nitrogen laser. A thin layer matrix preparation with saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone was used (30Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar). 0.5 μl of matrix was deposited on a stainless steel target plate, and 0.5 μl of sample was added on top of the matrix. External calibration was performed with angiotensin 2 and ACTH clip (Sigma). For N-terminal sequence analysis, the peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with two 30-min washes with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile and concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge. Extracted peptides were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using LCPackings 1 × 150-mm C8 column (packed with Vydac C8 300 Å, 5-μm material) on Pharmacia SMART system with a trifluoroacetic acid-acetonitrile solvent system. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed with an Applied Biosystems PROCISE494 sequencer. Fractions eluted from the N-syndecan peptide column were separated on 10–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Immunoblotting was done essentially as described (1Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Monoclonal antibody against cortactin, 4F11 (anti-p80/85), and monoclonal antibody to c-Src, GD11, were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal antibody to Fyn (FYN-15) and polyclonal antibody to c-Src (SRC-2) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Monoclonal antibody to class III β-tubulin (SDL.3DID) was from Sigma. N-syndecan was immunoblotted with polyclonal N-syndecan antibodies (14Nolo R. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as described (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-syndecan-transfected and mock-transfected N18 cells were cultured on HB-GAM-coated Petri dishes as described above. At times indicated, the cells were lysed with extraction buffer (see above) and centrifuged briefly to remove debris. The supernatant was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) overnight at +4 °C. The agarose beads were washed twice with the extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to gradient SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. N18 mouse neuroblastoma cells were transfected with an N-syndecan expression vector, which contains N-syndecan cDNA under the control of human β-actin promoter (27Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Single G418-resistant clones were picked, and the level of N-syndecan expression was studied by Northern hybridization. Two clones (II/7 and II/8) having the highest expression level were chosen for further analysis (Fig. 1 A). Two separate G418-resistant clones of N18 cells transfected with vector without cDNA were chosen as controls. Extraction of the transfected cells with detergent and analysis using HB-GAM affinity chromatography showed that binding of the transfected N-syndecan to HB-GAM was similar to the binding of the endogenous protein (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that it was reversed at about 0.5 m NaCl. The core protein size of about 120 kDa was detected for the transfected N-syndecan (Fig. 1 B), as was previously found for the brain N-syndecan (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of the 120-kDa core protein band was 2.5-fold higher in the clone (II/7) found to express N-syndecan at a higher level in Northern blotting as compared with the clone having a lower expression level (II/8). N18 neuroblastoma cells can be induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells by serum starvation (31Seeds N.W. Gilman A.G. Amano T. Nirenberg M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). They respond strongly to extracellular matrix molecules such as laminin and fibronectin by spreading and growing processes. On HB-GAM, they spread poorly and grow only very few processes. N18 cells express very little, if any, N-syndecan (Fig. 1). To study the effect of N-syndecan expression on neurite growth, the parental cell line and the mock-transfected and the N-syndecan-transfected cell lines were grown for 24 h on HB-GAM-coated surfaces. Phase contrast microscopy revealed an obvious difference in the N-syndecan-transfected cells as compared with the nontransfected or mock-transfected cells. In particular, the transfected cells with a higher N-syndecan expression level grew long neurites extending several diameters of the cell soma (Fig. 2). Most of the neurite-extending cells were mono- or bipolar. The N-syndecan-expressing clones had approximately three and nine times more neurite-bearing cells as compared with the parental and mock-transfected cells (Figs. 2 and3), depending on the level of N-syndecan expression. The number of adherent cells after the 24-h culture did not vary between clones (not shown).Figure 3Neurite outgrowth in the different cell clones on HB-GAM-coated matrix in the absence and presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Proportions of neurite-bearing cells in parental (wt), mock-transfected (I/1 and I/2), and N-syndecan-transfected (II/8 and II/7) clones were measured. Cells were grown for 24 h on HB-GAM-coated culture wells (black bars). Neurite outgrowth in the N-syndecan-transfected clones is inhibited by 1 μm herbimycin A (gray bars) and by 1 μm PP1 (white bars). The data represent mean values (+S.E.) from four independent experiments (black bars) and mean values (+S.E.) from three independent experiments for inhibition assays (gray and white bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As neurite growth is known to be regulated by phosphorylation, effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A on N18 cells was tested. Herbimycin A at the concentration of 1 μm had no effect on the proportion of neurite-bearing cells in parental and vector-transfected cells but reduced HB-GAMinduced neurite outgrowth in N-syndecan expressing clones almost to the background level (Fig. 3). As biochemical experiments suggested that Src-kinase(s) interact with N-syndecan (see below), a selective inhibitor of the Src family kinases (PP1; Ref. 32Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar) was also tested. PP1 also inhibited N-syndecan-dependent neurite outgrowth virtually completely (Fig. 3). To evaluate N-syndecan expression at the plasma membrane level, N-syndecan was immunostained in different cell clones using affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies that bind to the N-terminal sequence of the core protein. The expression level of N-syndecan at the cell surface apparently correlated to the expression level detected by Northern blotting (compare Figs. 1 and 4). N-syndecan was detected in the cell body and in neurites, especially in growth cones and in filopodia (Fig. 4). To detect possible kinase activity that binds to N-syndecan, crude extracts of postnatal rat brain were analyzed using an affinity column to which the cytosolic moiety of N-syndecan had been coupled (Fig. 5 A). The affinity column was extensively washed, after which the components binding specifically to the column were displaced using the cytosolic peptide in the elution buffer. An intrinsic kinase activity was consistently detected in the fractions displaced from the column by the free peptide (Fig. 5 A). The activity remained bound to the column that was washed from a physiological to a somewhat higher salt (0.3m) concentration but was displaced by the free peptide in a buffer containing physiological salt. Some remaining activity was eluted from the column by a high salt concentration (Fig. 5 A). The major phosphorylated component in the N-syndecan-binding, kinase-active fractions migrated at 80 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A). As Src family tyrosine kinases occur in the same fractions (see below), this phosphorylated band might be due to cortactin (p80/85) that has been identified as a major substrate of pp60src (33Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that cortactin indeed is the major phosphorylated component in the fractions containing intrinsic kinase activity (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that a kinase activity, together with its substrate(s), associates with the cytosolic domain of N-syndecan. The HB-GAM-induced neurite outgrowth from N-syndecan-transfected N18 cells was inhibited by herbimycin and PP1 (see above). This suggests involvement of tyrosine kinase(s) in the N-syndecan-mediated neurite growth. The major non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the growth cones (where N-syndecan is expected to mediate neurite growth (see above)) belong to the Src family kinases (34Maness P.F. Aubry M. Shores C.G. Frame L. Pfenniger K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5001-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 35Bixby J.L. Jhabvala P. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3421-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting of the fractions that bind to the cytosolic moiety of N-syndecan detected both c-Src and Fyn in the kinase-active fractions (Fig. 6). Both c-Src and Fyn peak in the fractions eluting with the peptide, but their interaction with the affinity column can be partially reversed already at 0.3 mNaCl (Fig. 6). The substrate sites of the kinases thus seem to bind more tightly to the affinity column because in the intrinsic kinase assay the activity associates more rigorously to the fractions that are displaced by the N-syndecan peptide (compare with Fig. 5 A). Coomassie Blue staining of the fractions binding specifically to the affinity column detected consistently three major proteins. A major protein migrating at about 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE, a doublet migrating at about 30 kDa, and an 80-kDa protein eluted specifically with the peptide (Fig. 7). Sequ"

The transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 also plays a critical role in protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 core protein directly interacts with and potentiates PKCα activity, and it can directly interact with the phos- phoinositide PIP2. We, therefore, investigated whether the interaction of inositol phosphates and inositol phospholipids with syndecan-4 could regulate PKC activity. Data from in vitro kinase assays using purified PKCαβγ show that in the absence of phosphatidylserine and diolein, PIP2 increased the extent of autophosphorylation of PKCαβγ and partially activated it to phosphorylate both histone III-S and an epidermal growth factor receptor peptide. This activity was dose-dependent, and its calcium dependence varied with PKC isotype/source. Addition of the cytoplasmic syndecan-4 peptide, but not equivalent syndecan-1 or syndecan-2 peptides, potentiated the partial activation of PKCαβγ by PIP2, resulting in activity greater than that observed with phosphatidylserine, diolein, and calcium. This study indicates that syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain may bind both PIP2 and PKCα, localize them to forming focal adhesions, and potentiate PKCα activity there.

The control of cellular adhesion status is complex, involving several signaling mechanisms (1Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 304-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H.

PIP2 may control actin polymerization by regulating the binding of actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin to actin (5Machesky L.M. Pollard T.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Schafer D.A. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 497-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PIP2 may also interact with α-actinin and vinculin (7Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and regulate their association with the cytoskeleton (8Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The level of PIP2 decreases upon detachment of cells from the substratum and increases upon reattachment to fibronectin (1Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 304-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The difference in the levels of PIP2 is probably due to different rates of phosphorylation of phosphatidyl 4-phosphate to PIP2 by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase is stimulated 3–4-fold by adhesion of cells to fibronectin (1Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 304-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), probably through interactions with the small GTP-binding proteins Rac and Rho, the latter of which has also been implicated in the regulation of assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (9Ridley A.J.

It can be hydrolyzed by phospholipase Cγ to generate two intracellular messengers: inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which mobilizes Ca2+, and diacylglycerol, which is a physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC). It can be further phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which has been proposed to regulate numerous activities including cytoskeletal organization (14Wennstrom S. Hawkins P.T. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L.R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and vesicle trafficking (15Shepherd P.S. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PIP2 can also be dephosphorylated via the 5-phosphatase to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (16Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). PIP2 may also directly activate several proteins including PKC. PIP2 is a potent activator of conventional PKC isotypes (α, βI, βII, and γ) in the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) and calcium (17Chauhan V.S.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Chauhan A. Brockerhoff H. Winsniewski H.M. Chauhan V.S.P. Arch. Biochem.

Indeed, PIP2 is more potent than diacylglycerol in stimulating PKCin vitro (20Pap E.H.W. Bastiaens P.I.H. Borst J.W. van den Berg P.A.W. van Hoek A. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Visser A.J.W.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13310-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it stimulates the translocation of conventional PKC from the soluble to the particulate fraction (18Chauhan A. Brockerhoff H. Winsniewski H.M. Chauhan V.S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, PIP2 may itself be a primary activator of PKCin vivo, both activating it and inducing its association with the plasma membrane (19Lee M. Bell R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activity is needed for matrix-induced cell spreading (22Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the later stage of focal adhesion assembly (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans have critical role(s) in PKC signaling in focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Höök M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 25Woods A.

Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cell attachment and spreading can be promoted through integrin interactions with the cell binding domain of fibronectin (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, normal anchorage-dependent fibroblasts require an additional signal(s) to form focal adhesions, which occur after binding of a heparin binding domain of fibronectin or a peptide from this domain to a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Höök M.

Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These interactions may stimulate PKC activity, since PKC inhibitors prevent focal adhesion formation, and pharmacological activation of PKC can substitute for stimulation through heparin binding moieties (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is one of four mammalian transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that share a high degree of similarity, and it is selectively concentrated in focal adhesions in numerous cell types (27Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It may transduce the signal(s) generated on binding of heparin binding moieties to cells. A unique region of its cytoplasmic domain (LGKKPIYKK) can potentiate PKCα activity in vitro, and PKC interacts with its core protein in vivo and in vitro, and with synthetic peptides of the LGKKPIYKK sequence (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The interactions between PIP2 and several PIP2-binding proteins may be through their pleckstrin homology domains (20Pap E.H.W. Bastiaens P.I.H. Borst J.W. van den Berg P.A.W. van Hoek A. Snoek G.T.

Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9859-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic sequence of syndecan-4 bears some similarity to pleckstrin homology domains, and the LGKKPIYKK peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 can interact with the phosphoinositides PIP2 and inositol hexaphosphate (IP6). 2J. R. Couchman, A. Woods, E.-S. Oh, G. Prestwich, and A. W. Theibert, unpublished observations. 2J. R. Couchman, A. Woods, E.-S. Oh, G. Prestwich, and A. W. Theibert, unpublished observations. Since syndecan-4 can bind PIP2 and activate PKC, we investigated whether PIP2 and syndecan-4 act synergistically to activate PKC, representing an alternative pathway to those previously described. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the whole cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 (4L) and to the central, unique region of syndecan-4 (4V), -2 (2V), or -1 (1V), a peptide having the scrambled sequence of 4V (Scr), and one where the proline was substituted with alanine (4VPA) were synthesized and sequenced by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center Peptide Synthesis and Analysis Shared Facility (Table I). PKCαβγ purified from rabbit brain and recombinant PKCα were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). An alternate source of recombinant PKCα was Life Technologies, Inc., and similar results were obtained for both. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The peptide representing the phosphorylation site in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and P81 phosphocellulose paper were obtained from Biomol Research (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Whatman (Fairfield, NJ), respectively. Phosphoinositides PIP2, IP6, and inositol tetraphosphate (IP4), histone III-S, myelin basic protein, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. PIP3 was synthesized by Dr. Roy Gigg (National Institute of Medical Research, London, UK).Table IThe amino acid sequences of peptides derived from the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4, -2, and -1PeptideSequence4LRMKKKDEGSYDLGKKPIYKKAPTNEFYA4VLGKKPIYKK4PALGKKAIYKKScrKYKGKIPLK2VCGERKPSSAAYQK1VCANGGAYQ Open table in a new tab The standard reaction mixture (total 20 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 3 mmmagnesium acetate, PKCαβγ (3 ng) or PKCα (1 ng), and 4 μg of histone III-S or myelin basic protein as a substrate. 0.2 mg/ml PS and 0.02 mg/ml diolein (DL) were added as required, and different amounts of phosphoinositides were added as detailed in the text. CaCl2 was added as indicated in the figure legends and text, and 0.25 mg/ml each of synthetic peptides were present. Reactions were started by the addition of 200 μm ATP (0.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and separated by 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylated histone III-S or myelin basic protein was detected by autoradiography and quantified by Bio-Rad Model GS-670 imaging densitometer. In assays using 0.1 mg/ml EGF receptor peptide of the sequence RKRTLRRL as an alternate substrate (33Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), the reaction was stopped by spotting the whole reaction mixture onto phosphocellulose filters (Whatman, p81, 2.1 cm) and dropping these into 75 mm phosphoric acid. Filters were washed 3 × 10 min, immersed in 95% ethanol for 5 min, dried, and counted with 4 ml of scintillation mixture in a scintillation counter (Wallac Model 1409). Reaction mixtures prepared as described above with 50 μm PIP2or IP6 in the absence of any activators (PS/DL, calcium) or substrate were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min and stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. We first investigated whether phosphoinositides could elevate the activity of a mixture of PKCαβγ in vitro. In the absence of PS and DL, phosphoinositides increased the activity of PKCαβγ to phosphorylate histone III-S (Fig. 1 A) or myelin basic protein (data not shown). PIP2 addition resulted in the highest level of PKCαβγ activity (approximately 4-fold over control levels; compare lanes 1 and 2). The same concentrations of PIP3 and IP6 (lanes 3 and 5, respectively) also increased activity (approximately 3-fold), whereas the effect of inositol tetraphosphate (lane 4) was not significant. The activation of PKCαβγ by PIP2 was approximately 60% of the maximal activity by conventional stimulation (refer to Fig. 6 A) by PS/DL (0.2 mg/ml PS and 0.02 mg/ml DL) and calcium. When PS/DL was present, PIP2, PIP3, IP4, and IP6 had no significant effect on the ability of PKCαβγ to phosphorylate histone III-S (data not shown). The effect of IP6 on the phosphorylation of histone III-S by PKCαβγ was dose-dependent and maximal at 50 μm IP6 (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation of PKCαβγ by PIP2 was also dose-dependent, with half maximal stimulation at 30 μm and a maximum at 50 μm PIP2 (Fig. 1 C).Figure 6Effect of syndecan-4 peptides and calcium on PIP2-induced activation of PKCαβγ and recombinant PKCα. A, autoradiographs show the basal level of phosphorylation by PKCαβγ of histone III-S in the absence of PS/DL (PL) and 750 μm calcium (lane 1) and normally maximal phosphorylation in their presence (lane 2). Phosphorylation by PKCαβγ is even higher in the presence of PIP2 and peptide 4L (lane 3) or 4V (lane 4), with lower levels in the presence of PIP2 alone (lane 5). B, recombinant PKCα is not activated in the presence of 25 μm calcium (lane 1), but this is sufficient to allow activation by peptide 4L (lane 2) or PIP2 (lane 3) and potentiation of activity with a combination of PIP2 and 4L peptide (lane 4). C, peptide 4PA (proline substituted by alanine) does not activate recombinant PKCα ± 25 μmcalcium (compare lane 1 with 2 and 3). PIP2 activation of PKCα requires the presence of 25 μm calcium (compare lanes 4 and 5) and is not increased in the presence of peptide 4PA (lanes 6and 7). Maximal phosphorylation is seen in the presence of PS/DL (PL) and 750 μm calcium (lane 8).D, the activation of PKCαβγ by PIP2 and 4L or 4V is calcium-independent, since 1 mm EGTA has little effect (compare lanes 3 and 6 with 2and 5), and high calcium (100 μm) does not increase activation (lanes 4 and 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since PKCαβγ are known as calcium-dependent enzymes and PIP2 interacts with PKC through its regulatory domain (18Chauhan A. Brockerhoff H. Winsniewski H.M. Chauhan V.S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Chauhan A. Chauhan V.S.P. Deshmukh D.S. Brockerhoff H. Biochemistry. 1991; 28: 4952-4959Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we investigated whether calcium affected the increased activity of PKCαβγ in the presence of PIP2 and IP6 (Fig. 2). In contrast to that observed with PS/DL, no effect was seen at physiological intracellular calcium levels (50–100 nm; Refs. 35Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 36Takahashi Y. Yoshida T. Takashima S. J. Gerontol. 1992; 47: 65-70Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Banyard M.R. Tellam R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1985; 51: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) on the activation of PKCαβγ by either PIP2 or IP6, indicating calcium-independence. Minor increases in phosphorylation were seen with PIP2 and IP6 at 1–30 μm calcium, but at concentrations above 30 μm, calcium significantly inhibited the activity. This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating the inhibition by calcium of PIP2-induced potentiation of the activity of PKCβ1, -ε, and -ζ in mixed micelles (38Palmer R.H. Dekker L.V. Woscholski R. Le Good J.A Gigg R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22412-22416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, PhosphorImager analysis of autoradiographs with recombinant PKCα indicated calcium dependence, with 25 μm causing a 2.7- and 3.5-fold increase in phosphorylation of histone III-S in the presence of PIP2 and IP6, respectively (not shown, but see Fig. 6). Phosphoinositides such as PIP2 and IP6 are highly negatively charged, whereas histone III-S and myelin basic protein are positively charged. It was possible, therefore, that increased phosphorylation of substrate by PKCαβγ was due to either increased PKCαβγ activity or increased accessibility of the substrate to PKCαβγ. We therefore investigated whether PIP2 or IP6 could increase autophosphorylation of PKCαβγ in the absence of PS/DL (Fig. 3). PIP2 increased autophosphorylation of PKCαβγ over that seen in the absence of PIP2 (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, autophosphorylation of PKCαβγ in the presence of IP6 was not increased (compares lanes 3 and 4). Thus, IP6 may increase PKCαβγ phosphorylation of basic substrates by charge interactions that increase substrate accessibility. In contrast, PIP2 may directly affect PKCαβγ. To substantiate this hypothesis, PKCαβγ assays were performed in the presence of PIP2or IP6 using a peptide substrate from the EGF receptor (Fig. 4). PIP2 increased PKCαβγ phosphorylation of this substrate approximately 3-fold (compare lanes 1 and 3), whereas no increase was seen with IP6 (compare lanes 1 and 9). Although this activation was less than that seen using histone III-S as substrate, it was statistically significant (p < 0.001). As seen with histone III-S phosphorylation, PIP3, but not IP4, also increased the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor peptide approximately 2.5-fold (compare lanes 1 and 5).Figure 4The effects of phosphoinositides and syndecan-4 peptide on the ability of PKCαβγ to phosphorylate the EGF receptor peptide in the absence of calcium. Phosphoinositides were added at 50 μm and peptide at 250 μg/ml. Results are the mean activity relative to phosphorylation in the absence of any agent (lane 1), quantified by densitometric analysis of autoradiographs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous studies showed that syndecan-4 could directly activate recombinant PKCα and potentiate its activation by phospholipid through a defined region of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Further experiments determined whether syndecan-4 could also affect the PIP2-induced activation of PKCαβγ using EGF receptor peptide (Fig. 4) or histone III-S (Fig. 5) as substrates. The results for both were similar. Peptide 4V from the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 potentiated the activity of PKCαβγ to phosphorylate the EGF receptor peptide in the presence of PIP2 from approximately 3-fold to 7-fold (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 4with 1). It had no effect, however, on activity in the presence of PIP3 (compare lanes 5 and 6), IP4 (compare lanes 7 and 8), or IP6 (compare lanes 9 and 10). Similar results were obtained monitoring histone III-S phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). PIP2 alone increased the activity of PKCαβγ to phosphorylate histone III-S approximately 5-fold (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1and 3). Peptide 4V in the absence of inositol lipid or phospholipid showed a direct activation, as seen previously (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but to a smaller (approximately 1.5-fold) extent (lane 2). The presence of both PIP2 and 4V potentiated the activation of PKCαβγ to approximately 11 times that of control levels (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 1). However, 4V did not further increase phosphorylation of histone III-S by PKCαβγ in the presence of IP6 (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 3 and 4), again suggesting that IP6 and PIP2 act through different mechanisms. To investigate whether the potentiation of PIP2-induced PKC activity by syndecan-4 could be significant in vivo, we compared the maximal activity of PKCαβγ or PKCα in the presence of both PIP2 and syndecan-4 peptide with that of PKC induced by other physiological PKC phospholipid activators (Fig. 6). As seen previously (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), basal levels of phosphorylation were detected in the absence of phospholipid and calcium (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). PS/DL in the presence of 750 μm calcium normally induced maximal phosphorylation (lane 2), as seen in our assays (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and by others (39Kikkawa U. Takai Y. Minakuchi R. Inohara S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13341-13348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 50 μm PIP2and the syndecan-4 peptide 4L or 4V, there was even greater activity of PKCαβγ, even in the absence of PL and calcium (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 2). Again PIP2 alone induced some activation of PKCαβγ in the absence of PS/DL, peptide, or calcium (lane 5). With recombinant PKCα (Fig. 6 B), similar results were seen, although low levels of calcium were required. Calcium alone did not activate PKCα (lane 1) but peptide 4L (lane 2) or PIP2 (lane 3) did, and a further increase was seen in the presence of both 4L and PIP2(lane 4). An additional control was that the altered 4V peptide (proline substituted with alanine), which had no effect in potentiating PS/DL-mediated PKCα activity (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), also had no effect on PIP2-mediated activation (Fig. 6 C). Neither 25 μm calcium (lane 1) nor the 4PA peptide ± calcium (lanes 2 and 3) activated PKCα. PIP2 activation of PKCα was dependent on the presence of 25 μm calcium (compare lanes 4 and 5). Again, 4PA peptide did not increase the activity seen with PIP2 alone ± calcium (compare lanes 6and 7 with lanes 4 and 5). Lane 8 shows the maximal activity of PKCα in the presence of PS/DL and 750 μm calcium. Activation of recombinant PKCα by PIP2 appears to be dependent on at least 25 μm calcium (Fig. 6 C, lanes 4 and 5), whereas that of purified PKCαβγ is not (Fig. 6 A, lane 5). This was confirmed (Fig. 6 D) by the fact that potentiation of PIP2-induced PKCαβγ phosphorylation of histone III-S (lane 1) by the syndecan 4L (lanes 2–4) and 4V (lanes 5–7) peptides was virtually unaffected by the presence of 10 μm (lanes 3 and 6) or 100 μm (lanes 4 and 7) calcium or even 1 mm EGTA (lanes 2 and 5). Since all syndecans have high homology in 2 regions of the cytoplasmic domain with intervening variable sequences (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we determined whether the potentiation of PIP2-induced PKC activity was unique to syndecan-4 (Fig. 7). We used synthetic peptides corresponding to the whole cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 (4L), the unique regions of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecans-4 (4V), -2 (2V) or -1 (1V), and a peptide where the normal sequence of 4V was scrambled (Scr) in assays monitoring phosphorylation of histone by PKCαβγ in the presence of PIP2. Synthetic peptides 4L (lane 1) and 4V (lane 2) potentiated PIP2-induced activity of PKCαβγ, but Scr (lane 4) and 2V (lane 5) or 1V (lane 6) had no effect. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4, but not those of syndecan-1 or syndecan-2, can potentiate PKCαβγ activation by PIP2. A variety of evidence implicates PKC activity (22Vuori K. Ruoslahti E.

Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In most cases, the isoform of PKC is unknown, though a role for PKCα emerges from its presence in focal adhesions of normal, but not transformed, cells (45Hyatt S.L. Klauck T. Jaken S. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). PKCαβγ have been characterized as calcium and phospholipid-dependent isozymes, requiring both cofactors for activity. We have previously shown that a peptide sequence from the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 can directly activate PKCα. In the absence of PS/DL and calcium, a modest increase is observed (1.5-fold), whereas addition of syndecan-4 peptide in the presence of PS/DL/Ca2+ produces a large enhancement of the PS/DL/Ca2+-stimulated activities, leading to an 11-fold stimulation over basal activity (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Similar to published reports, the present studies show that a phosphoinositide previously implicated in transmembrane signaling (16Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 47Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), PIP2, partially activates PKC in the absence of PS/DL, and this is increased by the syndecan-4 peptide. Previous studies by Toker et al. (48Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have investigated the activation of PKC isotypes by phosphoinositides. In the presence of 10 μm phosphatidylserine and 40 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, most phosphoinositides, including PIP2, did not significantly activate PKCα. They also failed to detect any significant activation of PKCα by 10 μm PIP2 in the absence of phospholipid (48Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments show that PKCαβγ requires 50 μmPIP2 for maximum activation in the absence of PS/DL to phosphorylate three different substrates: histone III-S, myelin basic protein, and the EGF receptor peptide. In platelets, the concentration of PIP2 may be as high as 140–240 μm (49Machesky L. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), supporting physiological activation of PKC by PIP2. In contrast to published reports, we report here that there is little or no calcium dependence for PIP2 stimulation of PKCαβγ in the presence of 50 μm PIP2and absence of PS/DL, although activation of recombinant PKCα is dependent on low levels of calcium (25 μm). This may be due to differences in preparation of PKCαβγ and recombinant PKCα, leading to varying degrees of phosphorylation (50Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of intracellular PKC isoforms is not clear. IP3, which activates intracellular calcium channels, is known to be produced by the hydrolysis of PIP2 by phospholipase Cγ after ligand binding to receptors (8Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). It is, however, not entirely resolved whether or not calcium transients accompany integrin ligation and are required for focal adhesion assembly. Although several cell types undergo a transient increase of intracellular calcium levels during integrin-mediated adhesion or integrin cross-linking with antibodies (1Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 304-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), others only show this response during adhesion through a subset of integrins (35Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 51Leavesley D.I. Schwartz M.A. Rosenfeld M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The PKCαβγ activity in vitroinduced by the combination of syndecan-4 and PIP2, even in the absence of calcium, was greater than that maximally induced by the conventional PKC activators PS and DL in the presence of high calcium concentrations. It, therefore, appears that PIP2, in conjunction with the PKC-binding protein syndecan-4, can regulate PKCαβγ activity through a novel calcium-independent pathway and that PKCα activation requires only low levels (25 μm). Indeed, this pathway has one extremely exciting feature; it overcomes the requirement for the nonphysiologically high calcium levels normally required in vitro. The transient increase in calcium levels in response to some integrin stimulation may be more involved in the translocation of conventional PKC isotypes, especially PKCα to the plasma membrane at the sites of focal adhesion formation (45Hyatt S.L. Klauck T. Jaken S. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). During focal adhesion formation, when cells adhere to an extracellular matrix molecule such as fibronectin, PIP2 levels increase, and this may be an important regulatory factor for actin polymerization and stress fiber and focal adhesion formation (11Chong L.D. Kaplan A.T. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 12Ren X. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition, PIP2 and PKC activation are both required for focal adhesion and stress fiber formation (24Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Höök M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 52Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have previously shown (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) that PKCα copatches when syndecan-4 is patched by the addition of ectodomain antibodies to spreading fibroblasts, and they can be coimmunoprecipitated. Moreover, PKCα, once activated by phospholipid or phorbol esters, can interact in vitro with the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 through the sequence LGKKPIYKK, and this potentiates PKCα activity (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide of the same sequence also interacts with PIP22, and this promotes oligomerization of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (53Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The fact that PIP2 in the presence of syndecan-4 can together give rise to high PKC activity suggests that ternary interactions between PIP2, syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain, and PKCα may be the most relevant activation of PKCα in the regulation of focal adhesion and stress fiber formation. This would not require an involvement of any other second messenger signaling mechanism such as phospholipase Cγ-dependent calcium fluxes or diacylglycerol production. However, it is not yet known whether interactions of two of the three components, syndecan-4, PIP2, and PKCα, influences further binding of the third to form a ternary complex. Our previous data suggest that syndecan-4 core protein interacts with the catalytic domain of PKCα (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), whereas PIP2 probably binds the regulatory domain of PKCα (19Lee M. Bell R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Höök M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) even more strongly than diacylglycerol (20Pap E.H.W. Bastiaens P.I.H. Borst J.W. van den Berg P.A.W. van Hoek A. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Visser A.J.W.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13310-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both PKCα and PIP2 appear to interact with the same region of syndecan-4, namely the central V region (LGKKPIYKK). The binding of PIP2 and PKC to this region is not mutually exclusive. Although PIP2 or 4V alone modestly up-regulate PKC-mediated phosphorylation of substrates, the addition of both agents leads to a synergistic stimulation of kinase activity. In addition, only oligomeric forms of syndecan-4 stimulate PKC activity (53Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore syndecan-4 has multiple copies of the 4V region present when interacting with and activating PKC. This activity is unique to syndecan-4, which is the only syndecan that is widespread in focal adhesions (27Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 52Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The three other mammalian syndecan core proteins and the Drosophila homolog all lack the essential V region sequence, and PKC activity is not regulated by 2V and 1V (3V has a sequence closely similar to 1V and, therefore, probably also lacks activity; Ref. 54Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Our binding data indicates that IP6 can also interact with syndecan-4. However, in contrast to PIP2, IP6could activate PKCαβγ only when phosphorylating histone III-S as a substrate, not when using the EGF receptor peptide as a substrate. Experiments examining the autophosphorylation of PKCαβγ indicate that IP6 may not directly activate the enzymes but rather increase the apparent activity by changing substrate accessibility. Since most experiments investigating PKC activation by phosphoinositides have used highly basic substrates including myelin basic protein, any increased phosphorylation seen may be due to either or both increased activity or substrate accessibility. One further experiment also supports the hypothesis that PIP2 rather than IP6 is the active participant in a signaling complex. Although IP6 can also bind the syndecan-4 peptide, PIP2, but not IP6, will promote the oligomerization of full-length syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (4L), with a concomitant stimulation of kinase activity of PKCαβγ by the oligomeric peptide (53Oh E.-S.

Here, we characterized the basal, parathyroid hormone regulatory regions of the rat collagenase-3 gene and the proteins involved in this regulation. The minimal parathyroid hormone-responsive region was observed to be between base pairs −38 and −148. Deleted and mutated constructs showed that the activator protein-1 and the runt domain binding sites are both required for basal expression and parathyroid hormone activation of this gene. The runt domain site is identical to an osteoblast-specific element-2 or acute myelogenous leukemia binding sequence in the mouse and rat osteocalcin genes, respectively. Overexpression of an acute myelogenous leukemia-1 repressor protein inhibited parathyroid hormone activation of the promoter, indicating a requirement of acute myelogenous leukemia-related factor(s) for this activity. Overexpression of c-Fos, c-Jun, osteoblast-specific factor-2, and core binding factor-β increased the response to parathyroid hormone of the wild type (−148) promoter but not with mutation of either or both the activator protein-1 and runt domain binding sites. In summary, we conclude that there is a cooperative interaction of acute myelogenous leukemia/polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein-2-related factor(s) binding to the runt domain binding site with members of the activator protein-1 transcription factor family binding to the activator protein-1 site in the rat collagenase-3 gene in response to parathyroid hormone in osteoblastic cells.

In addition to kidney, its major target tissue is bone, the body's main calcium store. While PTH increases serum calcium partly by activating osteoclasts, these cells do not display PTH receptors. Instead, PTH exerts a direct effect on osteoblasts, causing them to cease synthesis of type I collagen (2Kream B.E. Rowe D. Gworek S.C. Raisz L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5654-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Partridge N.C. Dickson C.A. Kopp K. Teitelbaum S.L. Crouch E.C. Kahn A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the major organic component of bone. Most relevant to the current study, we and others have demonstrated that, in vitro, PTH can stimulate the osteoblastic synthesis of interstitial collagenase, the enzyme that specifically degrades fibrillar collagens (4Heath J.K. Atkinson S.J. Meikle M.C. Reynolds J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Partridge N.C. Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S. Teitelbaum S.L. Fliszar C. Welgus H.J. Kahn A.J. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 1956-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although collagenase synthesis and secretion by osteoblasts has been well documented, the signaling mechanism through which PTH stimulates its expression in this cell type is not fully understood. We have employed the UMR 106-01 (UMR) rat osteosarcoma cell line to investigate PTH regulation of collagenase-3 gene expression in osteoblasts. This cell line displays classical osteoblastic markers including PTH receptors, type I collagen, and high alkaline phosphatase expression. Most importantly to the present study, UMR cells decrease collagen synthesis and begin production of interstitial collagenase in response to PTH treatment. Previously, we reported that UMR cell collagenase induction by PTH is due to an increase in transcription and is a secondary response since it requires de novo protein synthesis (6Scott D.K. Brakenhoff K.D. Clohisy J.C. Quinn C.O. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2153-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have dissected the minimal PTH-responsive region of the rat collagenase-3 gene. This was achieved by transiently transfecting 5′-deleted and internally mutated rat collagenase-3 promoter constructs into UMR cells to assess the effect of PTH on each region within this gene. These constructs revealed that the minimum PTH regulatory region is within 148 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. This region contains several consensus transcription factor recognition sequences including C/EBP, runt domain binding sequence (RD site), p53, PEA-3, activator protein (AP)-2, and AP-1. The following report describes concurrent participation of the AP-1 and RD sites, which are both necessary for PTH induction of the collagenase-3 gene, and shows that the AP-1 site is a basal element. We also identify the families of proteins associated with those sites. By overexpression studies, we confirm a functional requirement of both the native AP-1 and RD sites and the AP-1 and AML-related protein(s) as involved in PTH regulation of the collagenase-3 promoter. It is likely that the signaling mechanism we describe for PTH-induced collagenase transcription is specific to osteoblasts and therefore provides a relevant contribution to the current understanding of bone biology. Parathyroid hormone (rat PTH 1–34) was purchased from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases were products of Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), and radionuclides were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX). Radiolabeled [14C]chloramphenicol was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Tissue culture media and reagents were obtained from the Washington University Tissue Culture Center (St. Louis, MO). Fetal bovine serum was a product of JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS) and was also purchased through Washington University. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Anti-Fos and anti-Jun antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-CREB and anti-phospho-CREB antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-AML-1B and anti-CBF-β antisera were kindly provided by Dr. S. Hiebert (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Primer extension was carried out using a modified procedure of Boorstein and Craig (7Boorstein W.R. Craig E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A 21-mer synthetic oligonucleotide, representing the complement of nucleotides 23–43 of the rat collagenase cDNA (8Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was radiolabeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of 1 × 108 cpm/μg. Five nanograms of the probe was annealed at 58 °C for 45 min with 5 μg of poly(A+) RNA extracted from cells treated with PTH (10−8m) for 4 h. The annealing mixture (250 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm EDTA) was cooled slowly; primer extension was initiated by the addition of reverse transcriptase (200 units of SUPERSCRIPT II, Life Technologies, Inc.) in reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 75 mm KCl; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 3 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm each of dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and dTTP; 0.13 mg/ml actinomycin D; 450 units/ml of RNasin); and incubation was continued at 42 °C for 1 h. Following the primer extension, the reaction mixture was precipitated with ethanol, centrifuged, dried, resuspended in 10 μl of loading buffer, and electrophoresed on an 8% denaturing sequencing gel beside a sequencing ladder. The sequencing reaction was carried out by the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the same primer and rat collagenase-3 genomic clone 600−10 DNA. Previously in this laboratory, Dr. Cheryl Quinn cloned and characterized the rat collagenase genomic clone 600-10, which contains the 5′-end of the gene (9Rajakumar R.A. Quinn C.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). From this, using convenient restriction sites, the longest collagenase promoter constructs were subcloned upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in pBluescript SK (Stratagene). The shorter collagenase promoter fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and linked to the bacterial CAT gene in the reporter plasmid pSV0CAT (Promega). All fragments were linked to the CAT gene at a site that was 28 base pairs 3′ to the transcriptional start site. Two synthetic oligonucleotides were designed as right and left primers for each deletion mutant. Three nucleotides, GAC, of a palindromic six-base SalI restriction site were added to the 5′-end of each primer in order to engineer SalI linkers at each end of the PCR product. The conditions for PCR were as follows: left and right primers (50 μm each), DNA template (10 ng), dNTPs (2.5 mm each), 10× amplification buffer (10 μl) (500 mm KCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4), MgCl2 (2.5 mm), Taq polymerase (2.5 units), and H2O to a total volume of 100 μl in a thin walled PCR tube. Mineral oil (100 μl) was added to the top of the solution. The initial temperature for PCR was 94 °C (2 min) and then 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (55 °C, 1 min), and elongation (72 °C, 1 min). The final extension was at 72 °C (5 min), and then refrigeration was at 4 °C. The PCR products were purified and precipitated by the QIAquick-spin PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Extra 3′-A were filled with Klenow and dNTPs (2.5 mm), concatemerized with T4 DNA ligase, and digested with SalI to obtain the desired fragments. The final product was then ligated into SalI-digested pSV0CAT and transformed into Escherichia coli (DH-5α). The sequence and orientation of each construct was confirmed using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutations were introduced into desired constructs using the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A set of selection and mutagenic oligonucleotide primers was designed and synthesized for each mutant. The AP-1 site TGACTCA was changed by mutating G to A at the second base or TGA to ACT at the first three bases (10Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The PEA-3 site consensus sequence AGGAAGT was altered to AAAAAGT (11Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar), and the runtdomain binding sequence (RD site) AACCACA was changed to ACTAACA (12Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The selection primer was designed to change a BamHI restriction site in pSVOCAT vector into a BanI site. The identity of the mutants was confirmed by the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). UMR 106-01 cells were cultured as described previously (13Omura T.H. Noguchi A. Johanns C.A. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24994-24998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment medium was Eagle's minimal essential medium (with Earle's salts) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 2% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm diameter Petri dish and transiently transfected the following day using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method modified from Rosenthal (14Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were transferred to 10 ml of fresh maintenance medium 3 h before DNA application. DNA was added to 550 ml of a 0.25 mCaCl2 solution and mixed dropwise into 550 ml of 2 × HEPES-buffered saline solution (280 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.1) per dish. When a cloudy precipitate was visible, the solution was added to the culture dishes, which were incubated in 8% CO2 for 4 h. Following glycerol shock, the cells were returned to maintenance medium overnight and then treated with the appropriate agent(s). A preliminary time course indicated that maximal collagenase promoter activity was detectable after 24 h of PTH treatment. Therefore, all treatments were for this duration. To harvest, the cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of TEN (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cell lysis was achieved by three freeze-thaw cycles. Endogenous acetylases were inactivated by incubating samples at 60 °C for 10 min (except samples to be assayed for β-galactosidase activity), and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was assayed for CAT activity by a modification of the Seed and Sheen (15Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) procedure as described below. Separate plates were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid to verify transfection uniformity from experiment to experiment. This was done because cotransfecting this plasmid with other constructs had previously been shown to result in squelching (data not shown). Expression of the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector was assayed as described below. Background was defined as the activity of the promoterless, enhancerless vector, pSV0CAT. The pSV2CAT plasmid was transfected into separate plates as a positive control in all experiments. All experiments were done 3–7 times with duplicate samples in each. Overexpression of transcription factors into UMR cells was done using LipofectAMINE as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.) in six-well plates (seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well). CAT activity was measured by reacting 25 or 50 (six-well plate) μl of cell lysate in duplicate in a 100-μl reaction volume consisting of final concentrations of 250 μm n-butyryl-coenzyme A and 23 μm [14C]chloramphenicol (0.125 μCi/assay). The reaction volume was adjusted to 100 μl with 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and reacted for 2 h at 37 °C. Butylated chloramphenicol was removed by pre-extraction with 200 μl of mixed xylenes (Aldrich). The xylene phase was back extracted with 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Butylated chloramphenicol retained in the final organic layer was determined by scintillation counting. The values were normalized to protein as determined by the Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) dye binding (Bio-Rad reagent) method. A standard curve using purified CAT was conducted every experiment to determine the linear range of the enzyme assay. Experimental CAT activity was always within the linear range. Cell lysate (150 μl) was incubated with 150 μl of 2× assay buffer (120 mmNa2HPO4, 80 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside) at 37 °C until a yellow color developed. The reaction was terminated with 500 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, and the absorbance was read at 420 nm. Readings were compared with a standard curve made from the reaction product, o-nitrophenol. Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and PTH-treated UMR 106-01 cells as described (17Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated in a volume of 20 μl containing binding buffer (final concentrations: 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 100 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and antisera or competitor DNA at room temperature for 15 min. 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the reaction immediately following the above reagents. The incubation was carried out for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10× gel loading dye. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in TGE buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 1.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). The protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The sequences of the oligonucleotide probes were as follows (RD, AML-1, and AP-1 sites are underlined, and mutations are in boldface type).

This program predicts secondary structure formation and T m allowing stable hybridization. The AML-1 consensus binding site has been previously reported (12Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 18Merriman H.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Since the cDNA we obtained for rat collagenase was not full-length (8Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we needed to identify the transcription start site of the gene. It should be noted that there are three human collagenase genes, known as human collagenase-1, -2, and -3 (or MMP-1, -8, and -13). In rat and mouse, only one interstitial collagenase has been identified (8Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Henriet P. Rousseau G.G. Eeckhout Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which is homologous to human collagenase-3. Thus, we have adopted this nomenclature to describe the rat collagenase promoter as that for rat collagenase-3. Using primer extension, we detected three major primer-extended products of 86, 87, and 88 nucleotides, corresponding to A, G, and G, respectively (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence of the missing preproenzyme not described in our previous work is included and is 17 nucleotides (8Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rajakumar R.A. Quinn C.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By comparing the sizes of the cDNA, the genomic DNA, and the primer-extended products, we concluded that the transcription start site is 26–28 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site. Since the major transcription start site appears to be 28 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site, we have used this to number all of the regulatory region constructs. The rat collagenase-3 promoter region includes consensus binding sites for several DNA-binding proteins, C/EBP, RD, p53, PEA-3, AP-2, and AP-1 (Fig. 2 A) and is shown in comparison with the human and mouse collagenase-3 promoters (Fig. 2 B) (20Schorpp M. Matte M.G. Herr I. Gack S. Schaper J. Angel P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Pendás A.M. Balbı́n M. Llano E. Jimenéz M.G. López-Otı́n C. Genomics. 1997; 40: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). There are four consensus sites, namely an AML/PEBP2/runt (or OSE2 or RD) site, a p53 site, a PEA-3 site, and an AP-1 site, which are highly conserved both in sequence and location in all of these collagenase-3 promoters. In order to determine which region is necessary for PTH to activate transcription, we deleted regions of the rat collagenase-3 promoter from the 5′-end and placed the resulting promoter sequences 5′ of the CAT gene. The deletion constructs were transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells and then treated with or without PTH and assayed for CAT activity. The results indicate that CAT activity increased as the constructs decreased until only 148 base pairs remained, and all constructs retained PTH-responsiveness (data not shown). Our major interest was the PTH-responsive elements, which are all contained within the first 148 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. In order to more precisely determine the minimal PTH-responsive region in the rat collagenase-3 promoter, we further deleted the WT(−148) construct. For instance, WT(−54) contains the AP-1 and C/EBP sites, while WT(−38) retains only a C/EBP site and TATA box. The ability of PTH to activate these shortened promoter regions was then assessed. In comparison with the WT(−148) construct, both WT(−54) and WT(−38) had very little basal expression and almost no PTH response (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the minimal PTH-responsive region lies within 148 base pairs 5′ of the transcription start site of the collagenase-3 gene, and major basal elements reside between −148 and −54. During the preceding work we considered the possibility that our results could be affected by the transient transfection procedure. We addressed this possibility by comparing the effect of PTH on a stably versus transiently transfected WT(−6500). We observed no difference in promoter activity (basal or PTH-induced) due to the type of transfection (data not shown). It should be noted that basal transcription is considerably higher with both the transient and stably transfected cells compared with the endogenous gene (6Scott D.K. Brakenhoff K.D. Clohisy J.C. Quinn C.O. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2153-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It suggests that either a “silencer” exists elsewhere in the gene or the transfection process up-regulates basal expression. The latter has been observed for all the matrix metalloproteinase promoters (11Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, an activator region in the endogenous gene may be masked by nuclear matrix resulting in reduced basal expression. Since deletion to −54 decreased basal expression so substantially, it was difficult to assess the role of the AP-1 site. In order to understand the role of the AP-1 motif in PTH regulation of the collagenase-3 gene, we mutated this element in several constructs and measured the ability of the mutants to drive CAT activity. One or three nucleotides of the consensus AP-1 sequence were mutated (10Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have altered the second nucleotide in the AP-1 sequence in the WT(−148) construct from a G to an A (position −47) and referred to this construct as M(−148A1). The first three nucleotides in the consensus AP-1 site were also mutated from TGA to ACT in the WT(−148) and WT(−54) constructs. The mutations destroyed the first half-site of the AP-1 palindrome sequence and were named M(−148A3) and M(−54A3), respectively. The CAT activity obtained when UMR cells were transfected with these constructs in the presence or absence of PTH is shown in Fig. 4. The PTH response or stimulation is represented as -fold stimulation over the control. In comparison with WT(−148), M(−148A1) had reduced basal CAT activity. Previous work has shown that the single base mutation is analogous to a mutation in the human collagenase-1 AP-1 sequence that prevents binding of the Fos-Jun heterodimer (10Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Significantly, this mutation did not abolish the PTH response in rat UMR 106-01 osteoblastic cells, indicating that the AP-1 sequence was not absolutely required for the response to PTH. A triple mutation M(−148A3) showed a lesser basal CAT activity compared with M(−148A1) but still did not abolish the PTH response; however, mutation of the AP-1 motif greatly affected the basal expression of the rat collagenase-3 promoter constructs. Since the PEA-3 (polyomavirus enhancer activator-3) site at −77 to −71 had been shown to be a contributory element in other metalloproteinase promoters (11Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar), we mutated this site in the WT(−148) construct. The consensus PEA-3 sequence, AGGAAGT, was altered to AAAAAGT and named M(−148P2). This construct had increased PTH response and basal expression compared with WT(−148), and it suggested that this may be a silencer element. Combined mutation of AP-1 and PEA-3 sites gave essentially the same result as with AP-1 mutation alone; basal expression was decreased, but PTH response was not abolished (Fig. 5). The sequence AACCACA has recently been identified as an osteoblast-specific element (OSE2) in the mouse osteocalcin gene promoter (22Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Merriman et al.(18Merriman H.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have also shown the same consensus element, ACC(A/G)CA as an AML-1 consensus binding sequence in the rat osteocalcin gene promoter and shown that it binds a member of the AML-1/PEBP2/runt domain transcription factor family. The same AACCACA sequence, the RD site, lies between −132 and −126 in the rat collagenase-3 promoter. Other studies have shown that mutation of ACC/TGG into CTA/GAT in this consensus sequence results in a failure of these proteins to bind and pinpoints the importance of the ACC/TGG motif (12Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 18Merriman H.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we mutated the same three nucleotides in the RD site of the rat collagenase-3 promoter. To determine the importance of cooperativity with the AP-1 site, we made several constructs: WT(−125), which lacks the RD site; M(−125A3), which lacks the RD site and has a mutation in the AP-1 site; M(−148R3), which has a mutation in the RD site; and M(−148A3R3), which has mutations in both the RD site and the AP-1 site. All of the above constructs were transfected into UMR cells and assayed for CAT activity (Fig. 6). The absence of the RD site, WT(−125), resulted in reduced basal activity as well as a slight decrease in PTH response; but deletion of the RD site together with mutation in the AP-1 site, M(−125A3), essentially reduced both basal expression and PTH responsiveness to background activities.

We have pursued the mechanism of growth arrest in PC-3-M cells, a p53-null human prostate carcinoma cell line. Lovastatin treatment increased protein and mRNA levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, increased binding of p21 with Cdk2, markedly inhibited cyclin E- and Cdk2-associated phosphorylation of histone H1 or GST-retinoblastoma protein, enhanced binding of the retinoblastoma protein to the transcription factor E2F-1 in vivo, and induced the activation of a p21 promoter reporter construct. By using p21 promoter deletion constructs, the lovastatin-responsive element was mapped to a region between −93 and −64 relative to the transcription start site. Promoter mutation analysis indicated that the lovastatin-responsive site coincided with the previously identified transforming growth factor-β-responsive element. These data indicate that in human prostate carcinoma cells an inhibitor of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway can circumvent the loss of wild-type p53 function and induce critical downstream regulatory events leading to transcriptional activation of p21.

The p21 protein negatively regulates cell cycle progression by inhibiting Cdk catalytic activity and by inhibiting proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is required for DNA synthesis (10Waga S.

By inhibiting the activity of G1cyclin-Cdk complexes, p21 blocks phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB).

The study presented here investigates the mechanism by which lovastatin induces cell cycle arrest in the androgen-independent prostate carcinoma line PC-3-M, which is lacking both p53 alleles (18Issacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar). The data show that lovastatin treatment caused a marked shift of pRB to its underphosphorylated form and enhanced the in vivo binding of pRB and E2F-1. In addition, lovastatin inhibited Cdk activity, and this inhibition was associated with elevated protein and RNA expression of the Cdk inhibitor p21, similar to the induction of p21 by lovastatin in human breast cells (19Gray-Bablin J. Rao S. Keyomarsi K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 604-609PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the mechanism of lovastatin-induced p21 expression using p21 promoter-reporter assays. Lovastatin treatment induced transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter as indicated by increased activity of a p21 promoter-luciferase reporter construct, and this transcriptional response did not require the p53 response element. All effects of lovastatin were completely reversed by addition of mevalonic acid. These data demonstrate a link between the mevalonate pathway and activation of the promoter of the critical cell cycle-regulatory protein p21. To begin to understand the mechanism of lovastatin-induced transcription, promoter deletion and mutation studies were performed. This analysis demonstrated that lovastatin responsiveness is mediated by a promoter-proximal region that coincides with the recently identified transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-responsive element.

Invest. 1992; 89: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to cyclin E, Cdk2, Cdk4, and monoclonal anti-E2F-1 (clone 20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-pRB antibody (clone G3–245) and monoclonal anti-p21 antibody were purchased from PharMingen. Cells were fixed in 50% ethanol and incubated with RNase A and the DNA intercalating dye propidium iodide, and cell cycle phase analysis was performed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACStar flow cytometer and Becton Dickinson Cell Fit software. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (22Schnier J.B. Nishi K. Goodrich D.W. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5941-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Cdk2 polyclonal antibody, anti-E2F-1, or normal rabbit serum. The immunocomplex was collected on protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with primary antibody, and immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and resuspended in kinase assay mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and GST-RB or histone H1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as substrate. The GST-RB fusion protein containing amino acids 379–928 of human pRB (25Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pallas D.C. Decaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. Frederic Kaye, NCI, National Institutes of Health. The proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and bands were detected by autoradiography. Drs. Bert Vogelstein and Todd Waldman, The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, provided the full-length 2.4-kb human p21 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs as well as p21 promoter deletion constructs, in which 300 base pairs were progressively removed from the 3′ terminus. Three constructs were tested as follows: a 2.4-kb p21 promoter fragment containing the p21 transcription initiation start site at its 3′ end and a p53 response element at the 5′ end, a 2.1-kb fragment consisting of the 2.4-kb fragment from which 300 base pairs, including the p53 response element, had been deleted from the 5′ end, and a 0.3-kb fragment consisting of the 300 base pairs most proximal to the transcription start site (9Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). The original chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs were digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into the HindIII-XhoI sites of the luciferase reporter vector pGL2-basic (Promega Corp.), to create p21 promoter-luciferase constructs. The deletion constructs p21P 93-S (0 to −93), p21P Sma Δ1 (0 to −63) p21P Sma Δ2 (full-length p21 promoter from which the region −64 to −110 was deleted) and p21P (0 to −100), and the p21P 93-S mutants were created as described previously (26Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). PC-3-M cells were co-transfected with the p21 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and with the β-galactosidase reporter vector pCMVβ (Promega) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. Following transfection the cells were incubated for 6 h; the medium was exchanged, and the cells were incubated for an additional 36 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm lovastatin. The cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity in the lysates was assayed using a Dynatech ML1000 luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity which was assayed using the β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega). 24 h after 10 μm lovastatin addition there was an increase in the percent of PC-3-M cells in G1. By 48 h following lovastatin addition greater than 90% of the PC-3-M cells were arrested in G1 (Table I). Cell viability was consistently greater than 75% in cells treated for 48 h, after which there was a marked loss of viability, culminating in cell death (data not shown).Table IEffect of lovastatin on cell cycle distribution in PC-3-M cellsTimeG1SG2/Mh02049312476717489145 Open table in a new tab In cells treated with lovastatin pRB appeared as a single band on Western blot analysis, migrating in the position characteristic of unphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated pRB (27DeCaprio J.A.

The position of pRB after lovastatin coincided with the position of pRB detected with an antibody specific for the un- or hypophosphorylated form (Pharmingen clone G99–549, data not shown). Association of pRB with the transcription factor E2F-1 was almost undetectable by co-immunoprecipitation analysis of the untreated log phase cells (Fig. 1 B). However, 36 h after addition of lovastatin there was a strong increase in the association of pRB and E2F-1. The G1/S transition is regulated by D-type cyclins which bind to and activate Cdk4 and Cdk6 and cyclin E, which activates Cdk2. Because lovastatin arrests PC-3-M cells in G1, we tested whether lovastatin decreased protein levels of Cdk4, Cdk2, or cyclin E, and as demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, there was little detectectable change in the level of these proteins, even after 48 h of exposure to lovastatin. It should be noted, however, that the actual effects of lovastatin on these proteins may be larger than is apparent in the Western blot because of the nonlinearity of the chemiluminescence detection system. Cdk2- and cyclin E-associated kinase activity were reduced to undetectable levels after 36 h treatment with lovastatin (Fig. 2 B). These results indicated that the inhibition of Cdk2- and cyclin E-associated kinase activity might involve binding of a Cdk inhibitor protein to the Cdk2-cyclin E complex. Western blot analysis showed that lovastatin induced a marked increase in the level of the Cdk inhibitor p21 (Fig. 3 A). We next asked whether the p21 protein induced by lovastatin treatment was associated with Cdk2in vivo. As shown in Fig. 3 B, p21 was detected in anti-Cdk2 immunoprecipitates from lovastatin-treated cells and not in immunoprecipitates from untreated cells. Thus lovastatin induced the association of p21 with Cdk2, suggesting that lovastatin-induced p21 blocks Cdk2 kinase activity by direct binding to the cyclin-Cdk2 complex. To examine the mechanism by which lovastatin induces p21 we performed Northern blot analysis of the effect of lovastatin on the level of p21 mRNA. The 2.4-kb p21 transcript was increased in PC-3-M cells as early as 12 h after lovastatin treatment (Fig. 4). The kinetics of induction were consistent with the time course of inhibition of Cdk activity. The increase in p21 mRNA induced by lovastatin was blocked by actinomycin D (data not shown), suggesting that lovastatin may be regulating p21 mRNA levels through an effect on p21 transcription. p53 acts at the transcriptional level to increase p21 expression in response to DNA damage (9Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). In PC-3-M cells the p53 gene has been reported to be truncated and p53 protein absent (18Issacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar). As a control we performed Western and Northern blot analysis for p53 and found no evidence of p53 expression in control or lovastatin-treated cells (data not shown). These data demonstrate that lovastatin is regulating the level of p21 mRNA through a p53-independent mechanism. To test for transcriptional regulation of p21 by lovastatin p21 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into PC-3-M cells, and luciferase activity was measured in the presence and absence of lovastatin. The full-length 2.4-kb promoter construct containing a p53 response element was activated 3–4-fold by lovastatin (Fig. 5 A). Activation was not seen with a control vector consisting of the pGL2-basic luciferase reporter vector alone, and activation of the p21 promoter by lovastatin was completely blocked by incubation of the cells with 5 mm mevalonic acid, demonstrating that the ability of lovastatin to activate the p21 promoter is mediated by a component of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway (data not shown). A 2.1-kb construct lacking the p53 response element was activated by lovastatin to the same extent as the full-length promoter (Fig. 5 A). Constructs consisting of 300 base pairs and 100 base pairs proximal to the transcription start site were fully activated by lovastatin when compared with the 2.4-kb promoter. Thus, the lovastatin-responsive site is localized to the promoter proximal region between 0 and −100 base pairs. Three deletion constructs were employed to further map this region of the p21 promoter. A construct consisting of 0 to −93 base pairs was fully responsive to lovastatin (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, a construct consisting of the region from 0 to −63 was non-responsive to lovastatin. A deletion construct consisting of the full-length promoter minus the region −64 to −110 was also non-responsive to lovastatin. These data localize the region responsive to lovastatin to the sequences between −64 and −93 base pairs. The region between −64 and −93 contains two Sp1 binding sites. The second of these sites, between −78 and −84, has been identified as both the TGF-β-responsive element (TβRE) and the butyrate-responsive element (28Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To test whether the lovastatin-responsive element coincides with this Sp1 binding site, we tested two constructs of the 0 to −93 region in which the Sp1 site was mutated. Mutant 1, containing 10 consecutive mutated base pairs, did not respond to lovastatin (Fig. 6). Mutation of bases −78 and −79 also resulted in loss of lovastatin responsiveness. These data localize the lovastatin-responsive region and suggest that Sp1 may play a critical role in the activation of p21 transcription in response to lovastatin.

Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9839) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that mutations in cell cycle genes are the most common genetic change in tumor cells (32Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although inactivation or deletion of the RB gene itself is limited to a subset of human tumors (33Horowitz J.M. Park S.H.

Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and that the final common target of the genetic changes in G1regulatory proteins is the functional inactivation of pRB (13Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Passage from G1 to S phase is regulated by D-type cyclins and their cognate kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6, which act by phosphorylating and inactivating pRB prior to the restriction point at which cells commit to DNA synthesis (34Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar), and by cyclin E-Cdk2, which acts later in G1 (35Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Genetic changes associated with G1cyclins and their Cdks in human cancers include overexpression of cyclin D1, overexpression or mutation of Cdk4, loss of expression of the cyclin D-directed Cdk inhibitor p16, mutation or deletion of p53 and RB, and overexpression of cyclin E (36He J.

The data presented here demonstrate that in the human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3-M, the mevalonate pathway inhibitor lovastatin induces G1 arrest, blocks pRB phosphorylation, and increases in vivo binding of pRB to E2F-1, consistent with restoration of the growth-regulatory activity of pRB. Furthermore, lovastatin blocks cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity, in association with enhanced expression of the Cdk inhibitor p21. Lovastatin has been shown previously to increase the protein level of the Cdk inhibitor p27KIP1 in HeLa cells, HL60 cells, and normal fibroblasts (40Hengst L. Dulic V. Slingerland J.M. Lees M. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 41Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). There was no effect on p27KIP1 in the PC-3-M cells (data not shown), and thus G1 arrest appears to be independent of p27KIP1 in the prostate cancer cells studied. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway has many ramifications including loss of the protein isoprenylation modifications farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, loss of sterol synthesis, and potential perturbation of N-linked glycosylation through inhibition of dolichol synthesis (42Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar). To begin to map the target of lovastatin action within the mevalonate pathway, we incubated PC-3-M cells with the squalene synthase inhibitor zaragozic acid (43Bergstrom J.D. Kurtz M.M. Rew D.J. Amend A.M. Karkas J.D. Bostedor R.G. Bansal V.S. Dufresne C. Van Middlesworth F.L. Hensens O.D. Liesch J.M. Zink D.L. Wilson K.E. Onishi J. Milligan J.A. Bills G. Kaplan L. Nallin Omstead M.

A. 1993; 90: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We found that zaragozic acid treatment had no effect on p21 levels or cell cycle distribution (data not shown). Because lovastatin effects on the cell cycle were completely reversible by mevalonate and not mimicked by zaragozic acid, the critical point in the mevalonate pathway appears to be between HMG-CoA reductase and squalene synthase. One possible mechanism of lovastatin action is through Ras inactivation due to inhibition of Ras isoprenylation. Evidence suggesting that Ras may not be the mediator of the lovastatin response was presented by De Clue et al. (44DeClue J.E. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that lovastatin arrests the growth of Ras-transformed cells even when the transforming Ras protein utilizes a myristate-dependent rather than farnesyl-dependent membrane-targeting moiety, and thus is not dependent on the mevalonate pathway. These data do not, however, eliminate Ras inactivation as the mechanism of lovastatin-induced G1 arrest, and further experimental approaches, including studies with specific farnesyltransferase inhibitors, will be required. Although lovastatin itself may not be the optimal HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for cancer treatment, it has been shown to induce growth arrest and cell death in tumor cells in vitro and in athymic mice in vivo (44DeClue J.E.

A phase I study of lovastatin was completed recently at the National Cancer Institute, in which it was demonstrated that doses as high as 25 times the standard anti-hypercholesterolemic dose were well tolerated (48Thibault A. Samid D. Tompkins A.C. Cooper M.R. Figg W.D. Hohl R.J. Trepel J.B. Liang B. Patronas N. Venzon D.J. Reed E. Myers C.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar). More precise identification of the target of lovastatin action would aid in developing new anticancer drugs that act through perturbation of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. In addition to p53, recent studies have demonstrated activation of the p21 promoter by TGF-β (49Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation by vitamin D3 and STAT1 occurs more than 500 base pairs upstream of the lovastatin-responsive region (51Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 55Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.-C.S. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In the U937 myeloid leukemia cell line, it has been demonstrated that activation of p21 transcription by phorbol esters and okadaic acid is mediated by the promoter region between −154 and +16 and that Sp1 plays a critical role in this response. In K562, SW480, and HepG2 cells the activation of p21 transcription by phorbol ester was mapped to the region between −95 and −121, and AP2 was shown to act as a positive regulator of the phorbol ester response. The TβRE is located between −71 and −86 relative to the p21 transcription start site (49Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 50Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We found that the lovastatin response region maps between −64 and −93. Furthermore, mutation of the TβRE abrogated lovastatin-induced p21 promoter activation. Thus the lovastatin response site corresponds with the TβRE. One possible mechanism for the induction of p21 by lovastatin in PC-3-M cells would be induction of TGF-β by lovastatin and activation of p21 transcription by TGF-β. It is likely, however, that lovastatin effects on p21 are unrelated to TGF-β because PC-3-M cells have an attenuated response to TGF-β, and direct addition of TGF-β1 to PC-3-M cells did not activate the p21 promoter reporter construct (data not shown). Recently it was reported that butyrate activates the p21 promoter and that this response maps to the TβRE (28Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N.

Sp1 is required for p21 promoter activation in response to both TGF-β and butyrate (28Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T.

We have shown that mutation of an Sp1 binding site also blocks lovastatin activation of the p21 promoter. Several studies have shown that Sp1 is a critical factor in regulating transcriptional responses to pRB. Sp1 binds to the pRB-responsive element, and Sp1 binding is required and sufficient for promoter activation in response to pRB (56Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y. Martin K.H.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although the overall level of pRB protein decreases in PC-3-M cells in response to lovastatin, that decrease is predominantly or entirely in the hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 1 A and data not shown), and there is a substantial increase in active pRB as assessed by the markedly enhanced E2F-pRB binding in the in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that both pRB and Sp1 may play a role in lovastatin-induced activation of the p21 promoter. The data presented here demonstrate that lovastatin induces p21 transcription in the absence of wild-type p53. The most frequently mutated tumor suppressor in human cancer is p53. Therefore, p53-independent induction of p21 presents an attractive target for anticancer drug development (59Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 49-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

Here we demonstrate that singlet oxygen modifies Cat-1a, giving rise to a sequential shift in electrophoretic mobility, similar to the one observed in vivo. Purified Cat-1a was modified with singlet oxygen generated from a photosensitization reaction; even when the reaction was separated from the enzyme by an air barrier, a condition in which only singlet oxygen can reach the enzyme by diffusion. Modification of Cat-1a was hindered when reducing agents or singlet oxygen scavengers were present in the photosensitization reaction. The sequential modification of the four monomers gave rise to five active catalase conformers with more acidic isoelectric points. The pI of purified Cat-1a-Cat-1e decreased progressively, and a similar shift in pI was observed as Cat-1a was modified by singlet oxygen. No further change was detected once Cat-1e was reached. Catalase modification was traced to a three-step reaction of the heme. The heme of Cat-1a gave rise to three additional heme peaks in a high performance liquid chromatography when modified to Cat-1c. Full oxidation to Cat-1e shifted all peaks into a single one. Absorbance spectra were consistent with an increase in asymmetry as heme was modified. Bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal catalases were all susceptible to modification by singlet oxygen, indicating that this is a general feature of the enzyme that could explain in part the variety of catalases seen in several organisms and the modifications observed in some catalases.

Photosynthetic evolution of dioxygen into the atmosphere and its subsequent accumulation led to formation of an ozone layer in the stratosphere, which permitted the dispersal of microorganisms around earth by absorbing damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun (1Schopf J.W. Earth's Earliest Biosphere, Its Origin and Evolution. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1983Google Scholar, 2Kastings J.F. Science. 1993; 259: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Atmospheric dioxygen also led to the evolution of adaptation mechanisms to live with a poisonous gas (3Fridovich I. BioScience. 1977; 27: 462-466Crossref Google Scholar, 4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar).The electron affinity of O2 makes it a reactive compound. Furthermore, dioxygen generates more reactive intermediates in its sequential univalent reduction to water. Likewise, singlet oxygen, excited states of O2, are highly reactive species. They arise upon absorption of radiation by O2, either directly or through prevalent cellular compounds such as tetrapyrrols, flavins, pterins, chlorophylls, and retinoids. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviation used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PB, phosphate buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high- performance liquid chromatography; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 5-ASA, 5-acetyl salicilic acid. 1The abbreviation used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PB, phosphate buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high- performance liquid chromatography; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 5-ASA, 5-acetyl salicilic acid. are inevitably produced in cells under aerobic or microaerobic conditions (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar).Primeval cells, which originated in an anoxic environment (2Kastings J.F. Science. 1993; 259: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), had either to hide from O2, or to evolve mechanisms for efficient reduction of entering O2, disposal of ROS, and sequestering of transition metals, which participate in reducing O2 into ROS. Respiration gave early aerobic heterotrophs a new source of energy, but more than anaerobes made them depend on the availability of reduced carbon, indispensable for O2reduction. Thus, since the generation of an oxidant atmosphere, the threat of damaging effects caused by ROS has been prevalent for all organisms. This threat was further utilized by some species that developed devices for the controlled production of ROS, as seen in many host-parasite relationships (5Daub M.E. Leisman G.B. Clark R.A.

Hydrogen peroxide is formed mainly from dismutation of superoxide, which is generated by O2capturing an electron, usually from electron transport chains. Hydrogen peroxide is also a product of some oxidases. Being uncharged and not very reactive, it can diffuse between cell compartments. Its toxicity is traced to the formation of the hydroxyl radical upon capture of an electron, for instance, from Fe(II) or Cu(I). The hydroxyl radical, one of the most reactive species known, reacts immediately with almost any cellular compound giving rise to alterations, such as modified or broken proteins and nucleic acids (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Thus, it is understandable why catalases are one of the most efficient enzymes known (31Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It is so efficient that it cannot be saturated by H2O2at any concentration.Catalases are prevalent in most organisms (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed.

L., Natvig, D. O., Abstracts of the 18th Fungal Genetic Conference, March 21–28, Asilomar, CA, 1995, 31.Google Scholar). It codes for a homotetramer of 320-kDa molecular mass. Cat-1 is present in the whole vegetative life cycle of N. crassa. 3 The cat-2 gene, assigned to complementation group VIIR, has not been cloned. It is expressed under stress conditions and transiently during the formation of conidia.3Catalase-specific activity increases stepwise with each morphogenetic transition of the N. crassa conidiation process.3 Cat-1 was modified in these transitions and under stress conditions.3 Since we have demonstrated enzyme inactivation due to ROS-specific oxidation under cell differentiation and stress conditions (24Aguirre J.

Modification could be traced to a three-step reaction of the heme with singlet oxygen. Catalases from different organisms were similarly modified by singlet oxygen, indicating a general feature of the enzyme that could explain in part the variety of catalases seen in several organisms (47Loewen P.C.

Photosynthetic evolution of dioxygen into the atmosphere and its subsequent accumulation led to formation of an ozone layer in the stratosphere, which permitted the dispersal of microorganisms around earth by absorbing damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun (1Schopf J.W. Earth's Earliest Biosphere, Its Origin and Evolution. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1983Google Scholar, 2Kastings J.F. Science. 1993; 259: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Atmospheric dioxygen also led to the evolution of adaptation mechanisms to live with a poisonous gas (3Fridovich I. BioScience. 1977; 27: 462-466Crossref Google Scholar, 4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The electron affinity of O2 makes it a reactive compound. Furthermore, dioxygen generates more reactive intermediates in its sequential univalent reduction to water. Likewise, singlet oxygen, excited states of O2, are highly reactive species. They arise upon absorption of radiation by O2, either directly or through prevalent cellular compounds such as tetrapyrrols, flavins, pterins, chlorophylls, and retinoids. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviation used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PB, phosphate buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high- performance liquid chromatography; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 5-ASA, 5-acetyl salicilic acid. 1The abbreviation used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PB, phosphate buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high- performance liquid chromatography; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 5-ASA, 5-acetyl salicilic acid. are inevitably produced in cells under aerobic or microaerobic conditions (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Primeval cells, which originated in an anoxic environment (2Kastings J.F. Science. 1993; 259: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), had either to hide from O2, or to evolve mechanisms for efficient reduction of entering O2, disposal of ROS, and sequestering of transition metals, which participate in reducing O2 into ROS. Respiration gave early aerobic heterotrophs a new source of energy, but more than anaerobes made them depend on the availability of reduced carbon, indispensable for O2reduction. Thus, since the generation of an oxidant atmosphere, the threat of damaging effects caused by ROS has been prevalent for all organisms. This threat was further utilized by some species that developed devices for the controlled production of ROS, as seen in many host-parasite relationships (5Daub M.E. Leisman G.B. Clark R.A.

Because dioxygen and its unavoidable ROS have been of such importance for survival, cells developed mechanisms to exquisitely detect the presence of O2 and ROS for regulation of metabolism and antioxidant responses (8Farr S.B.

Hydrogen peroxide is formed mainly from dismutation of superoxide, which is generated by O2capturing an electron, usually from electron transport chains. Hydrogen peroxide is also a product of some oxidases. Being uncharged and not very reactive, it can diffuse between cell compartments. Its toxicity is traced to the formation of the hydroxyl radical upon capture of an electron, for instance, from Fe(II) or Cu(I). The hydroxyl radical, one of the most reactive species known, reacts immediately with almost any cellular compound giving rise to alterations, such as modified or broken proteins and nucleic acids (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Thus, it is understandable why catalases are one of the most efficient enzymes known (31Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It is so efficient that it cannot be saturated by H2O2at any concentration. Catalases are prevalent in most organisms (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Many microorganisms have more than one catalase, and in some a catalase is related to cell differentiation (32Loewen P.C. Triggs B, L. J.

https://openalex.org/W2060779138,"High-resolution observations obtained with the Doppler On Wheels (DOW) mobile weather radar near the point of landfall of hurricane Fran (1996) revealed the existence of intense, sub-kilometer-scale, boundary layer rolls that strongly modulated the near-surface wind speed. It is proposed that these structures are one cause of geographically varying surface damage patterns that have been observed after some landfalling hurricanes and that they cause much of the observed gustiness, bringing high-velocity air from aloft to the lowest observable levels. High-resolution DOW radar observations are contrasted with lower-resolution observations obtained with an operational weather radar, which underestimated peak low-level wind speeds."

Previously, we showed the surface association of pro-MMP-9 in human breast epithelial MCF10A cells. Here, we have characterized the binding parameters of pro-MMP-9 and show that the enzyme binds with high affinity (K d ∼22 nm) to MCF10A cells and other cell lines. Binding of pro-MMP-9 to MCF10A cells does not result in zymogen activation and is not followed by ligand internalization, even after complex formation with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). A 190-kDa cell surface protein was identified by ligand blot analysis and affinity purification with immobilized pro-MMP-9. Microsequencing and immunoblot analysis revealed that the 190-kDa protein is the α2(IV) chain of collagen IV. Specific pro-MMP-9 surface binding was competed with purified α2(IV) and was significantly reduced after treatment of the cells with active MMP-9 before the binding assay since α2(IV) is hydrolyzed by MMP-9. A pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex and MMP-9 bind to α2(IV), suggesting that neither the C-terminal nor the N-terminal domain of the enzyme is directly involved in α2(IV) binding. The closely related pro-MMP-2 exhibits a weaker affinity for α2(IV) compared with that of pro-MMP-9, suggesting that sites other than the gelatin-binding domain may be involved in the binding of α2(IV) to pro-MMP-9. Although pro-MMP-9 forms a complex with α2(IV), the proenzyme does not bind to triple-helical collagen IV.

The gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) are two members of the MMP family that have been shown to play a central role in many normal and pathological conditions involving ECM degradation, including wound healing, angiogenesis, embryogenesis, arthritis, and tumor metastasis (3Matrisian L.M.

Like other members of the MMP family, the gelatinases are produced in a latent form (pro-MMP) 2Latent enzyme will be referred to as “pro-MMP” and active enzyme as “MMP.” 2Latent enzyme will be referred to as “pro-MMP” and active enzyme as “MMP.” that requires activation to become proteolytically active. Thus, activation is a critical step in the regulation of MMP-dependent proteolytic activity. Considerable evidence has associated the gelatinases with the ability of tumor cells to metastasize due to their ability to degrade basement membrane collagen IV and to their elevated expression in malignant tumors (5Liotta L.A.

Coussens, personal communication. In recent years, much information has been gained on the cell surface association of pro-MMP-2. It has been shown that pro-MMP-2 binds to the cell surface via membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP), a subclass of MMPs bound to plasma membranes (14Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L.

Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of pro-MMP-2 to MT1-MMP requires the participation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) (14Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). The trimer complex allows for pro-MMP-2 activation on the cell surface, possibly by another MT1-MMP molecule. A later study suggested that the cell surface association of pro-MMP-2 can also occur through the binding of the C-terminal domain of the enzyme to integrin αvβ3 (16Brooks P.C. Stromblad S.

Thus, several mechanisms may play a role in the surface localization of pro-MMP-2.Pro-MMP-9 is structurally similar to pro-MMP-2, with both enzymes containing three tandem copies of a 58-amino acid residue fibronectin type II-like module (17Wilhelm S.M.

Furthermore, both latent enzymes can bind a TIMP molecule in the C-terminal domain of the zymogen with pro-MMP-9 binding to TIMP-1 (17Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pro-MMP-2 to TIMP-2 (4Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 5Liotta L.A. Steeg P.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-9 also contains a 54-amino acid proline-rich extension of unknown function that is similar to the α2(V) chain of collagen V and in addition is a glycosylated enzyme (17Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to pro-MMP-2, little is known about the interactions of pro-MMP-9 with the cell surface, yet pro-MMP-9 has been found to be present on the cell surface. Recent studies by Partridge et al. (22Partridge C.A. Phillips P.G. Niedbala M.J. Jeffrey J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L813-L822PubMed Google Scholar) showed that pro-MMP-9 is present in the plasma membrane and focal contacts of cultured endothelial cells. Pro-MMP-9 was also detected in the plasma membranes of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (23Ginestra A. Monea S. Seghezzi G. Dolo V. Nagase H. Mignatti P. Vittorelli M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17216-17222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the enzyme could be activated by a plasmin-dependent mechanism (24Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that, upon induction with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, pro-MMP-9 binds to the surface of human breast epithelial MCF10A cells (25Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we further examined the binding of pro-MMP-9 to a variety of cell lines and demonstrated the existence of a single high affinity (K d ∼22 nm) binding site. Using immobilized pro-MMP-9, ligand blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments with surface biotinylated cells, we have identified the α2(IV) chain of collagen IV as the major pro-MMP-9-binding protein. These studies provide novel evidence on the interactions of pro-MMP-9 with α2(IV) that may play a role in the localization of zymogen at cell-matrix contacts and degradation of basement membranes.DISCUSSIONPreviously, we have shown the surface association of pro-MMP-9 in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated MCF10A cells (25Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have described the presence of pro-MMP-9 on plasma membranes of HT1080 cells (23Ginestra A. Monea S. Seghezzi G. Dolo V. Nagase H. Mignatti P. Vittorelli M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17216-17222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and in focal contacts of endothelial cells (22Partridge C.A. Phillips P.G. Niedbala M.J. Jeffrey J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L813-L822PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have characterized the binding parameters of pro-MMP-9 and demonstrated that the proenzyme binds with high affinity (K d ∼20–30 nm) to the surface of a variety of cell types. In MCF10A cells, internalization studies demonstrated that binding of pro-MMP-9, free or in complex with TIMP-1, is not followed by ligand internalization. Furthermore, under the experimental conditions, surface binding of pro-MMP-9 does not result in zymogen activation, possibly due to the lack of activators in the cell culture system. However, recent studies demonstrated that surface-associated pro-MMP-9 can be activated by a plasmin-dependent mechanism (23Ginestra A. Monea S. Seghezzi G. Dolo V. Nagase H. Mignatti P. Vittorelli M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17216-17222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the surface association of pro-MMP-9 is not directly associated with activation and/or internalization but plays a role in confinement of proenzyme in areas of cell-matrix contacts, where it could become the target for potential pro-MMP-9-activating proteinases.We identified a 190-kDa cell surface protein in various cell lines that specifically bound to a pro-MMP-9-affinity matrix and formed a co-precipitable complex with pro-MMP-9. Microsequencing of the affinity-purified protein revealed a complete sequence homology to the α2(IV) chain of human collagen IV (39Hostikka S.L. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19488-19493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, immunoblot analysis with chain-specific antibodies (30Sado Y. Kagawa M. Kishiro Y. Sugihara K. Naito I. Seyer J.M. Sugimoto M. Oohashi T. Ninomiya Y. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 104: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) corroborated that the 190-kDa protein is α2(IV). Several observations indicate that the cell surface association of pro-MMP-9 is mediated by α2(IV). (i) Preincubation of pro-MMP-9 with affinity-purified α2(IV) significantly inhibited ligand binding. (ii) Pretreatment of MCF10A cells with MMP-9 reduced by 80% the binding of proenzyme, likely due to the degradation of surface-associated α2(IV) as observed in experiments with soluble α2(IV) and MMP-9. Accordingly, treatment of cells with MMP-9 and TIMP-1 resulted in the recovery of the majority of ligand binding; (iii) Binding of pro-MMP-9 to the cells exhibited an affinity (K d ∼22 nm) that was in close agreement with the affinity (K d ∼45 nm) of the enzyme for purified α2(IV). In addition, there was a good correlation between the number of pro-MMP-9 binding sites determined in the binding assays and the level of expression of surface-associated α2(IV). For example, the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells that exhibited 10-fold less binding sites than MCF10A cells showed undetectable levels of surface-associated α2(IV). The reason for the low levels of α2(IV) on the surface of these malignant cells is unknown but may be related to their inability to retain α2(IV) on the cell surface since α2(IV) was detected intracellularly. Thus,in vitro, the surface association of pro-MMP-9 would depend on the ability of each cell type to express and retain α2(IV) on the cell surface. Whether pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2 bind also to monomeric α1(IV) is yet unknown and remains to be determined. However, the fact that only a single polypeptide, α2(IV), was specifically and consistently co-precipitated with pro-MMP-9 or bound to immobilized proenzyme suggests a unique and preferential interaction between pro-MMP-9 and α2(IV).Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using a pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex or MMP-9 demonstrated that neither the C-terminal nor the N-terminal domains of pro-MMP-9 appeared to be critical for interactions with α2(IV). However, we could not precipitate the α2(IV)/pro-MMP-9 complex with gelatin-agarose beads, suggesting a role for the gelatin-binding domain. In this regard, it was interesting to observe that pro-MMP-2, when compared with pro-MMP-9, exhibited a lower affinity for α2(IV) as determined by the co-immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments. Since pro-MMP-2 contains a similar gelatin binding domain (41Murphy G. Crabbe T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), this suggests that the interactions of α2(IV) with pro-MMP-9 are also influenced by sites/domains other than the gelatin binding domain and/or by the three-dimensional conformation of pro-MMP-9. It would be of interest to determine whether the 54-amino acid proline-rich α2(V)-like extension that is uniquely present in pro-MMP-9 (17Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Murphy G. Crabbe T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), plays any role in the binding of the enzyme to α2(IV). In the cell binding assays, pro-MMP-2 slightly competed with pro-MMP-9 binding, suggesting that surface-associated α2(IV) is also available for pro-MMP-2 binding. However, given the lower affinity of pro-MMP-2 for α2(IV) and the existence of alternate high affinity surface binding sites for pro-MMP-2 (14Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), this enzyme would be expected to bind to the cell surface via a different mechanism (14Strongin A.Y.

Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar).The binding of gelatinases to collagen IV has been examined in previous studies (21Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 42Allan J.A. Docherty A.J.P. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); however, the sites of interaction were not defined. The results presented here suggest that a major high affinity binding site for pro-MMP-9 in collagen IV must reside within the α2(IV) chain. However, our data also indicate that neither triple-helical collagen IV secreted by MCF10A cells nor EHS collagen IV bound to pro-MMP-9 under conditions of α2(IV) binding. In agreement with these results, we have recently observed a weak affinity (K d = 2.15 μm) of pro-MMP-9 for EHS collagen IV as determined by surface plasmon resonance 4M. Olson and R. Fridman, unpublished results. . Thus, whereas monomeric α2(IV) forms a tight complex with pro-MMP-9 (K d nm), trimeric collagen IV binds pro-MMP-9 with very low affinity (K d μm). This is also consistent with the studies of Steffensen et al. (21Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), who showed a weaker affinity of a recombinant gelatin-binding domain of pro-MMP-2 for trimeric collagen IV compared with that for denatured collagen IV. This has led to the suggestion that binding sites for the gelatin-binding domain in denatured collagen IV may be masked in triple-helical collagen IV (21Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the binding of pro-MMP-9 to α2(IV) is mediated by sites that are cryptic in collagen IV and that are exposed after partial denaturation and/or degradation of the collagen IV molecule. If so, these sites would have to be conserved after partial proteolysis to allow binding of pro-MMP-9. Such a scenario would probably involve a partial degradation of the collagen IV network by a protease(s) other than the gelatinases as the catalytic efficiency of MMP-2 and MMP-9 against native collagen IV has been reported to be limited (43Moll U.M Youngleib G.L. Rosinski K.B. Quigley J.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6162-6170PubMed Google Scholar, 44Okada Y. Morodomi T. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30964-30970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After collagen IV degradation, secretion of pro-MMP-9 by pro-MMP-9 producing-cells in close association with the basement membrane would then facilitate binding of pro-MMP-9 to α2(IV). After activation of the α2(IV)-bound pro-MMP-9, the enzyme would then contribute to the complete degradation of the collagen IV network consistent with its ability to degrade denatured collagens (41Murphy G. Crabbe T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Another possible scenario for the results observed here may involve binding of pro-MMP-9 to a surface-associated α2(IV). Although the origin and binding mechanism of α2(IV) chains to the cell surface remain to be elucidated, our in vitro studies with a variety of cell lines (epithelial, endothelial and fibrosarcoma) clearly show that, although some α2(IV) chains are assembled with α1(IV) into trimeric collagen IV molecules, a portion of single α2(IV) chains are secreted and deposited on the cell surface. The surface-associated α2(IV) chains appear to be stable as determined by surface biotinylation and pulse-chase analysis. Indeed, we have found that α2(IV) chains can be detected in the cellular compartment of both MCF10A and HT1080 cells and in the supernatant of the latter even after a 10-h chase period without any evidence of processing and/or degradation. 5M. Toth and R. Fridman, unpublished results. These findings are in contrast with the general notion that α(IV) chains that fail to form trimeric collagen molecules are unstable and/or rapidly hydrolyzed. This is generally true if active proteinases are present in the experimental system, as they can hydrolyze non-triple-helical collagen chains as shown here with α2(IV) and MMP-9. Thus, the integrity and eventually the detection of α(IV) chains would depend on the presence of active proteinases and/or inhibitors in each particular culture system and tissue. Detection of monomeric α(IV) chains may also depend on the extraction procedures and/or on the antibodies used since some antibodies may only recognize α(IV) chains in triple-helical conformation. Here we have used immobilized pro-MMP-9 and chain-specific mAbs raised against synthetic peptides, which independently allowed for the detection of native and stable α2(IV) chains on the cell surface. Although the processing, localization and stability of monomeric α2(IV) warrants further in vitroand in vivo studies, it is tempting to speculate that surface-associated α2(IV) may anchor pro-MMP-9 on the cell surface after autocrine or paracrine secretion. After activation by pro-MMP-9-activating enzymes, MMP-9 would then play a role in localized surface proteolysis. Since the binding of pro-MMP-9 to the α2(IV) chain is of high affinity and involves the zymogen form, it will be important in future studies to address the activation of pro-MMP-9 and its interactions with TIMP-1 in the context of pro-MMP-9 bound to α2(IV).

Like other members of the MMP family, the gelatinases are produced in a latent form (pro-MMP) 2Latent enzyme will be referred to as “pro-MMP” and active enzyme as “MMP.” 2Latent enzyme will be referred to as “pro-MMP” and active enzyme as “MMP.” that requires activation to become proteolytically active. Thus, activation is a critical step in the regulation of MMP-dependent proteolytic activity. Considerable evidence has associated the gelatinases with the ability of tumor cells to metastasize due to their ability to degrade basement membrane collagen IV and to their elevated expression in malignant tumors (5Liotta L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2077017147,"A novel l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from human brain has been cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized. This enzyme is a homotetramer with a molecular mass of 108 kDa. Its subunit consists of 261 amino acid residues and has structural features characteristic of short chain dehydrogenases. It was found that the amino acid sequence of this human brain enzyme is identical to that of an endoplasmic reticulum amyloid β-peptide-binding protein (ERAB), which mediates neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (Yan, S. D., Fu, J., Soto, C., Chen, X., Zhu, H., Al-Mohanna, F., Collison, K., Zhu, A., Stern, E., Saido, T., Tohyama, M., Ogawa, S., Roher, A., and Stern, D. (1997) Nature 389, 689–695). The purification of human brain short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase made it possible to characterize the structural and catalytic properties of ERAB. This NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible oxidation of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs to form 3-ketoacyl-CoAs, but it does not act on the d-isomers. The catalytic rate constant of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 37 s−1 with apparent K m values of 89 and 20 μm for acetoacetyl-CoA and NADH, respectively. The activity ratio of this enzyme for substrates with chain lengths of C4, C8, and C16 was ∼1:2:2. The human short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene is organized into six exons and five introns and maps to chromosome Xp11.2. The amino-terminal NAD-binding region of the dehydrogenase is encoded by the first three exons, whereas the other exons code for the carboxyl-terminal substrate-binding region harboring putative catalytic residues. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that ERAB involved in neuronal dysfunction is encoded by the human short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This reaction is known to be catalyzed by mitochondrial monofunctional l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and by prokaryotic and eukaryotic multifunctional β-oxidation enzymes that possess an l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase functional domain (2Yang X.-Y.H. Schulz H. Elzinga M. Yang S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6788-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Yang S.-Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1994; 109: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The catalytic residue of this kind of dehydrogenase was recently identified to be a conserved histidine (4He X.-Y. Yang S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9625-9630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and a conserved glutamate residue is also required for high catalytic efficiency (5He X.-Y. Deng H. Yang S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The catalytic residue ofl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was proposed to interact with the conserved glutamate, and this electrostatic interaction seemed to be strengthened by the binding of substrate (5He X.-Y. Deng H. Yang S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, we were surprised to see that a catalytic His-Glu pair is not present in the newly isolated bovine liver type II dehydrogenase (6Kobayashi A. Jian L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Furuta S. Kobayashi A. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is not homologous to any of the known l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases. More interestingly, it was reported that this new type of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was not found in human liver by either Northern blot or immunoblot analysis (6Kobayashi A. Jian L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Furuta S. Kobayashi A. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As a result, several important questions emerged. Do humans have anl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase of this kind? If such a dehydrogenase exists in some human organ(s), what are its possible roles in human cells? Where is the human dehydrogenase gene located, and how is the gene organized? To find answers to these questions, we have cloned the cDNA encoding human brain short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 1This enzyme, which usesl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA substrates of various chain lengths, is a new member of the short chain dehydrogenase family. 1This enzyme, which usesl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA substrates of various chain lengths, is a new member of the short chain dehydrogenase family. and then mapped its gene and analyzed the gene structure as well. Moreover, the enzyme of interest was purified so that the structural and catalytic properties of this human brain dehydrogenase could be successfully characterized. During the preparation of this manuscript, a 262-amino acid ERAB 2The abbreviations used are: ERAB, endoplasmic reticulum amyloid β-peptide-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. 2The abbreviations used are: ERAB, endoplasmic reticulum amyloid β-peptide-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. protein detected by use of the yeast two-hybrid system to screen human brain and HeLa cell cDNA libraries was reported to bind amyloid β-peptide (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A fusion protein, ERAB with a polyhistidine tag (His-ERAB), was generated and used to study the interaction of ERAB with amyloid β-peptide, and this protein was shown to mediate the cellular toxicity of amyloid β-peptide. ERAB, an important factor contributing to the neuronal dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease, was proposed to be a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the structure and organization of the human short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene and the structural and catalytic properties of its gene product. The primary structure of human brain l-3-hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase was found to be identical to that of ERAB, and thus, ERAB proved to be an l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. NAD+, NADH, CoASH, sodiumdl-3-hydroxybutyrate, pig heartl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and all other standard biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. 2-Octynoic acid was purchased from Aldrich. d-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA was provided by Metabolix Co. Acetoacetyl-CoA (9Seubert W. Biochem. Prep. 1960; 7: 80-83Google Scholar) and 2-hexadecynoic acid (10Freund K. Mizzer J. Dick W. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5996-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were synthesized according to published procedures. The CoA derivatives of 2-octynoic acid, dl-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and 2-hexadecynoic acid were synthesized by the mixed anhydride procedure (11Goldman P. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2620-2623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3-Ketohexadecanoyl-CoA was enzymatically prepared from 2-hexadecynoyl-CoA as described previously (12Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human fetal brain Marathon-Ready cDNA and the Advantage cDNA PCR kit were purchased from CLONTECH. The pGEM-T vector and the Wizard Mini Preps DNA purification system were from Promega.Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS was obtained from Novagen. Restriction endonucleases and T4 ligase were supplied by New England Biolabs Inc. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. A full-length cDNA of the short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was cloned from human fetal brain Marathon-Ready cDNA according to the manufacturer's procedures. Primer A was synthesized by simulating the active-site sequence of the bovine liver type II enzyme (7Furuta S. Kobayashi A. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and other primers were designed based on the sequence data obtained in this study. The nucleotide sequences of primers used in the PCR were as follows: primer A, 5′-TTGGAAGCAGAGTATGCAGC-3′; primer B, 5′-CTGCAGGATCCCATATGGCAGCAGCGTGTCGGAGCGTGAAGG-3′; and primer C, 5′-CGGAATTCTATCAAGGCTGCATACGAATGG-3′. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector according to the manufacturer's procedures. The DNA nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar), and base determination was automated by using an Applied Biosystems Model 370A DNA sequencer. The cDNA insert (NdeI-EcoRI) containing the whole coding region of human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was removed from the recombinant plasmid pGEM-T-HBHAD by digestion with proper restriction enzymes and subcloned into the NdeI-EcoRI site of the vector pSBETa (a kind gift from Dr. H.-H. Steinbiß) to yield an expression plasmid designated pSBET-HBHAD. The plasmid pSBET-HBHAD was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS by the one-step transformation method (14Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The transformants were induced by 0.5 mm IPTG for 6 h. The preparation of cell extract and the purification of the dehydrogenase were performed as described previously (15Yang S.-Y. Li J. He X.-Y. Cosloy S.D. Schulz H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2543-2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for the following modifications. The hydroxylapatite column (2.5 × 4 cm) was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.6) containing 10% glycerol and 2 mm mercaptoethanol and developed with a gradient made up of 75 ml of this buffer and 75 ml of 0.5 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.6) containing 10% glycerol and 2 mmmercaptoethanol. Fractions (5 ml) were collected and assayed forl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The recovered enzyme preparation was applied to a smaller hydroxylapatite column (1.5 × 5.5 cm) and eluted with the above-mentioned linear gradient again as a second fractionation step. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gradient gel at pH 8.3 as described previously (17Blackshear P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the purified l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was determined by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column (1 × 50 cm) according to the standard procedure (18Scopes R.K. Protein Purification Principles and Practice. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the Bio-Rad protocol, and then the N-terminal sequence was analyzed by automated Edman degradation (19Strickler J.E. Hunkapiller M.W. Wilson K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 533-566Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems Model 470A gas-phase sequencer. The activity ofl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was determined in the backward direction with acetoacetyl-CoA, 3-ketooctanoyl-CoA, or 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA as substrate according to the published procedure (20Binstock J.F. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The dehydrogenase assay in the forward direction was performed as described previously (21He X.-Y. Yang S.-Y. Schulz H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using l- andd-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoAs as substrates, respectively. Kinetic parameters of the dehydrogenase were estimated by analysis of the kinetic data with the computer program Leonora (22Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The activities of 17β- and 3α,20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases were measured as described previously (23Jarabak J. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 15: 746-752Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Edwards C.A.F. Orr J.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4370-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The enzyme assay was carried out at 25 °C on a Gilford recording spectrophotometer (Model 2600). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate to product/min. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-RACE PCR product (∼0.6 kb) generated from human fetal brain Marathon-Ready cDNA by use of primer A and the adaptor primer 1 was determined by the dideoxy method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar), and then an overlapping 3′-RACE product (∼1 kb) was made by PCR using primer B and the adaptor primer 1. The nucleotide sequence of the 3′-RACE fragment was also determined using the dideoxy method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Thereafter, a cDNA fragment (∼0.8 kb) containing the whole coding region of the gene of interest was created by PCR using a pair of primers B and C that were based on sequence data obtained from the 5′- and 3′-RACE products, respectively. A recombinant plasmid (pSBET-HBHAD carrying this cDNA clone was introduced into E. coliBL21(DE3) pLysS cells. Transformants containing plasmids pSBET-HBHAD and pSBETa were induced by IPTG for 6 h. The specific activity ofl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in transformants containing plasmid pSBET-HBHAD was found to be >2 orders of magnitude higher than that in transformants containing a blank vector. Overexpression of the cDNA clone inserted in plasmid pSBET-HBHAD gave rise to a 27-kDa polypeptide band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The human brain dehydrogenase was purified 6-fold with a recovery of 33% of the original activity by chromatography on hydroxylapatite as summarized in TableI. The purified dehydrogenase was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Since the N-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme determined by Edman degradation perfectly matches the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence (Fig. 2) and since the subunit size determined by SDS-PAGE is very close to the calculated molecular mass of 26,923 Da, it is apparent that the cloned cDNA encodes a novel l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from human brain.Table IPurification of human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS/pSBET-HBHAD induced by IPTGStepTotal activity1-aThe enzyme activities were measured with 27 μm acetoacetyl-CoA as substrate.Total proteinSpecific activityYieldunitsmgunits/mg%Extract56.719.752.87100First hydroxylapatite46.44.0211.5382Second hydroxylapatite18.61.0717.35331-a The enzyme activities were measured with 27 μm acetoacetyl-CoA as substrate. Open table in a new tab Figure 2Sequence of the human short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene. Exon sequences are in upper-case letters, and introns and flanking sequences are in lower-case letters. The first base of the initiation codon is designated as nucleotide 1. Only the nucleotides of exon sequences are numbered. The lengths of introns in base pairs (bp) are shown in parentheses. The deduced amino acid sequence is indicated by standard one-letter abbreviations under the exon sequence. Amino acid residues are numbered beginning with the initiator methionine as position 1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence determined by Edman degradation is underlined, and it is apparent that the first methionine has been removed presumably by a specific peptidase in E. coli. The termination codon is marked by an asterisk, and the putative polyadenylation signal is double-underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Before the human genomic library was screened with a cDNA fragment of the dehydrogenase, the GenBank Data Bank was searched with the Advance Blast program (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) using the human brainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase cDNA sequence as a query sequence. A match with gaps was fortunately found in the human chromosome region Xp11.2. The nucleotide sequence of this 130-kb DNA segment was determined as part of the chromosome X project at the Sanger Center (Hinxton, United Kingdom) and has been submitted by D. Grafham to the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank (accession no. Z97054). However, it was not known that this piece of DNA contains the humanl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene. The exon locations were determined by closely scrutinizing the nucleotide sequence in the particular region where the human short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene was mapped. All exon-intron junctions conform to the GT-AG rule (26Breathnach R. Benoist C. O'Hare K. Gannon F. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4853-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). It was thus found that the direction of transcription of this gene is opposite to that of the KIAA0178 gene and the DNA-binding protein gene, which flank the gene of interest. The human l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene spans ∼4 kb and consists of six exons and five introns (Fig. 3). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the gene product was determined by Edman degradation. The results demonstrated that the first ATG codon in frame is the initial codon, and the 5′-untranslated region has a Kozak consensus sequence (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8131Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sixth exon contains a stop codon (TGA) and a putative polyadenylation signal (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the purified dehydrogenase was determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and found to be 108 kDa (Fig. 4). The subunit of this dehydrogenase consists of 261 amino acid residues (Fig. 2), and its subunit size was estimated to be 27 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Hence, human brainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is a homotetramer. In contrast, mitochondrial l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from pig heart is composed of two identical 33-kDa subunits (28Birktoft J.J. Holden H.M. Hamlin R. Xuong N.C. Banaszak L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Figs.1 and 4). On the basis of certain common structural features, a number of different dehydrogenases constitute the short chain dehydrogenase family (29Persson B. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Of 13 largely conserved residues, 6 residues are strictly conserved in all short chain dehydrogenases (29Persson B. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that the human brain dehydrogenase studied here not only has a size similar to other short chain dehydrogenases, but also has all 13 conserved residues (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is concluded that the l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from human brain is a new member of the short chain dehydrogenase family. The primary structure of the human brain dehydrogenase is homologous to bacterial acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (30Peoples O.P. Sinskey A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 3α,20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (31Marekov L. Krook M. Jörnvall H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with ∼32% identity. The genes of these dehydrogenases are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor gene. Since the homology extends over the full length of the dehydrogenase, it is almost certain that these three dehydrogenases have similar tertiary structures. If so, the subunit of human brain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase would have a single domain with a parallel α/β-structure, as seen in the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Streptomyces exfoliatus 3Formerly Streptomyces hydrogenans. (32Ghosh D. Weeks C.M. Grochulski P. Duax W.L. Erman M. Rimsay R.L. Orr J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Human brain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is structurally distinct from the well documented mitochondriall-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases, e.g. pig heart l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which has a two-domain structure (28Birktoft J.J. Holden H.M. Hamlin R. Xuong N.C. Banaszak L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The human brain dehydrogenase does not have the GXGXXG fingerprint that exists in the NAD-binding domain of pig heart l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and other medium chain dehydrogenases (4He X.-Y. Yang S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9625-9630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Birktoft J.J. Holden H.M. Hamlin R. Xuong N.C. Banaszak L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), but instead has a GXXXGXG glycine-rich sequence as the marker of the N-terminal NAD-binding region (29Persson B. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 32Ghosh D. Weeks C.M. Grochulski P. Duax W.L. Erman M. Rimsay R.L. Orr J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A more remarkable feature of the human brain dehydrogenase is that it does not have the catalytic His-Glu pair identified in otherl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases (4He X.-Y. Yang S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9625-9630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5He X.-Y. Deng H. Yang S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Instead, its C-terminal region contains conserved protic residues, tyrosine 168 and lysine 172, which perhaps play essential roles in the enzyme catalysis similar to tyrosine 152 and lysine 156 of alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila melanogaster (34Chen Z. Jiang J.C. Lin Z.-G. Lee W.R. Baker M.E. Chang S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The conclusions drawn from the analysis of the human brain dehydrogenase are also applicable to bovine liver type II 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (6Kobayashi A. Jian L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Furuta S. Kobayashi A. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys.

Consequently, the bovine liver type II enzyme should also be classified as a short chain dehydrogenase. Based on the structure and organization of the human short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene, it is concluded that the first three exons of this gene encode the amino-terminal NAD-binding region of the dehydrogenase, whereas the other exons code for the carboxyl-terminal substrate-binding region harboring putative catalytic residues (Figs. 2 and 3). The substrate stereospecificity of this novel enzyme is opposite to that of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. The human brain dehydrogenase was found to metabolize only l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, but not thed-isomer (data not shown). Under the assay conditions used, neither 17β- nor 3α,20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was detected (<0.005 unit/mg). The catalytic properties of the purified human brain dehydrogenase were characterized by steady-state kinetic measurements (35Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme System. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). To simplify the measurements, the enzyme was usually assayed in the backward direction with 3-ketoacyl-CoA as substrate. The catalytic rate constant for the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA by NADH at pH 7.0 is 37 ± 1.6 s−1. The apparent K m values for acetoacetyl-CoA and NADH were found to be 89 ± 5.4 and 20 ± 2.8 μm, respectively, and the apparent K m values of the human brain enzyme are 15 ± 1.7 μm for the medium chain substrate and 16 ± 1.0 μm for the long chain substrate (TableII). The kinetic substrate specificity of this enzyme is quite different from those of otherl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases. The activity ratio of this dehydrogenase for substrates with C4, C8, and C16 acyl groups was ∼1:2:2 under standard assay conditions, whereas the activity of a mitochondrial matrix l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with short chain substrate was usually greater than that with longer chain substrates. For example, the ratios of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities with acetoacetyl-CoA to those with 3-ketooctanoyl-CoA were found to be about 20 and 1.2 for the bovine liver type I and II enzymes, respectively (6Kobayashi A. Jian L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that when acetoacetyl-CoA was used as substrate, the apparent K m values of human brainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase for both the substrate and coenzyme were rather high in comparison with those of bovine liver type II 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (6Kobayashi A. Jian L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to pig heart l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase being inhibited by acetoacetyl-CoA at concentrations above 25 μm (21He X.-Y. Yang S.-Y. Schulz H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), no substrate inhibition was observed with human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (data not shown).Table IIKinetic parameters of human brain short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenaseSubstratek catK ms−1μmAcetoacetyl-CoA37 ± 1.689 ± 5.4NADH37 ± 1.620 ± 2.83-Ketooctanoyl-CoA28 ± 1.515 ± 1.7NADH28 ± 1.510 ± 1.93-Ketohexadecanoyl-CoA24 ± 1.016 ± 1.0NADH24 ± 1.05.0 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab During the preparation of this manuscript, a report appeared describing the involvement of a protein called ERAB in neuronal dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). ERAB was identified by the yeast two-hybrid system and was shown to bind to a fusion protein containing amyloid β-peptide (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). More ERAB antigen was found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease than in age-matched normal brains by immunoblotting with anti-ERAB peptide antibody (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of ERAB is not yet known, and ERAB was said to be a 262-amino acid polypeptide (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 36Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Only a His-ERAB fusion protein, but not the native protein, has been obtained (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is clear that the amino acid sequence of human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is identical to that of ERAB and hence that ERAB is composed of 261 amino acid residues, but not 262 as reported previously. On the basis of the results presented here, it is concluded that ERAB, which previously was suggested to be a steroid dehydrogenase, is actually human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Hence, the structural and catalytic properties reported here for this novell-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase should apply to ERAB, which mediates neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 36Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since the molecular mass of human brain short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase determined by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration matches well the value calculated from the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence, this enzyme does not seem to undergo post-translational modification. This finding suggests that this novel l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is synthesized in the cytosol, as are many other β-oxidation enzymes. It was reported that ERAB is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and that the subcellular distribution of ERAB might change in the presence of amyloid β-peptide (8Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, since the N-terminal 16 residues of human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase are identical to those of the bovine liver mitochondrial type II enzyme (7Furuta S. Kobayashi A. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the human brain dehydrogenase of interest may also have a noncleavable mitochondrial targeting signal sequence, as seen in mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (37Arakawa H. Amaya Y. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that this novel l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is transported into mitochondria, as are other β-oxidation enzymes. But it may also be present outside of mitochondria. If so, human brainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase could serve as an intracellular target for amyloid β-peptide (ERAB) and/or function in the elongation of fatty acids at the endoplasmic reticulum. However, we are certain that the newly identified amyloid β-peptide-binding protein is encoded by the human short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene (Figs. 2 and 3). We have demonstrated in rats that brain mitochondria contain a considerable amount of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (38Yang S.-Y. He X.-Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13027-13032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently determining the subcellular distribution of human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. We are grateful to Dr. Marshall Elzinga for critical reading of the manuscript."

Troponin T is necessary for Ca2+-dependent inhibition and activation of actomyosin. Troponin T consists of an extended NH2-terminal domain that interacts with tropomyosin and a globular COOH-terminal domain that interacts with tropomyosin, troponin I, and troponin C. In this study we used recombinant troponin T and troponin I fragments to delimit further the structural and regulatory interactions with the thin filament. Our results show the following: (i) the NH2-terminal region of troponin T activates the actomyosin ATPase in the presence of tropomyosin; (ii) the interaction of the globular domain of troponin T with the thin filament blocks ATPase activation in the absence of Ca2+; and (iii) the COOH-terminal region of the globular domain anchors the troponin C-troponin I binary complex to troponin T through a direct Ca2+-independent interaction with the NH2-terminal region of troponin I.

The binary troponin C-troponin I (TnC·TnI) complex confers little Ca2+ sensitivity to the actomyosin ATPase activity at physiological ratios of actin to Tn, is not stably assembled on the actin filament, and is not capable of activating the ATPase at high Ca2+ levels. Troponin T (TnT) is necessary for full Ca2+ sensitivity of the actomyosin ATPase (9Hitchcock S.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 52: 255-263Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J.

The mechanism through which TnT exerts its role in the regulatory function of the troponin complex is not fully understood. TnT interacts with TnC, TnI, and Tm and holds the TnC/TnI dimer in the thin filament irrespective of the Ca2+ concentration (9Hitchcock S.E. Eur. J.

Each Tm dimer spans seven actins, strongly suggesting that the regulatory function of the troponin complex is transduced through Tm to the actin molecules. TnT is the troponin subunit that most strongly binds to Tm (1Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 2Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Two separate sites of attachment for TnT on Tm have been identified. The first site is near the head-to-tail overlap of sequential Tm molecules along the filament (16Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and interacts with the T1 fragment of TnT (Fig. 1). This interaction is independent of Ca2+ binding to TnC (18Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second site is within fragment T2 of TnT (Fig. 1) which binds near residues 150–180 of the Tm molecule (16Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The T2fragment of TnT also interacts with TnC and TnI in vitro and to Tm in a Ca2+-sensitive manner in the presence of TnC (18Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we used different combinations of TnT and TnI fragments to map the regions involved in both structural and regulatory interactions present in the trimeric troponin complex within the thin filament in the presence and in the absence of calcium.

M13mp18-TnT-3 was mutated with the oligonucleotide 5′-GTTATACCAGTAGCAGACTGA-3′ to change the codon Leu217 into a stop codon (underlined), with the oligonucleotide 5′-GGCGCAAGTAATTGAACATTGA-3′ to change the Pro192 codon into a stop codon, and with the oligonucleotide 5′-AGGCGCAAGCATATGAACATTGACC-3′ to introduce an NdeI site (underlined) at codons 192 and 193. The NdeI-EcoRI fragments of the M13mp18-TnT-3 containing a stop codon at positions 192 or 217 were cloned into the same restriction sites of the pET-3a (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). These vectors express, respectively, the fragments TnT1–216 (the first 216 amino acids of TnT) and TnT1–191 (the first 191 amino acids of TnT). The small NdeI-EcoRI fragment (produced by the second NdeI site, inserted at positions 192 and 193) was subcloned in the same sites of pET-3a, producing a vector for the expression of the fragment TnT194–263 (amino acids 194–263). For the production of the fragment TnT157–263, the NcoI-BamHI fragment of the expression vector pET-TnT* (11Malnic B. Reinach F.C. Eur. J.

Cultures (4 liters) of E. coliharboring the different plasmids grown in 2× YT were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm final) in mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.8) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. For the purification of wild-type TnT, TnT1–216, TnT1–191, and TnT157–263, the cells were recovered by centrifugation at 3,000 × g (15 min), resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 6 murea, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and lysed in a French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The extract was centrifuged (109,200 ×g, 40 min), and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow column (Pharmacia XK16/70), and retained proteins were eluted with a 0–600 mm NaCl gradient. The fractions containing TnT were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA, 6m urea, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose Fast-Flow XK16/40 column equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a 0–600 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m KCl, 1 mm DTT and stored at −20 °C. For the purification of the TnT194–263 fragment the E. coli cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, lysed in the French press at 16,000 p.s.i., and centrifuged at 75,800 × g (40 min). The supernatant was loaded into a CM-Sepharose Fast-Flow XK16/40 column equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and loaded into a DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow column. The protein eluted in the flow-through was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m KCl, 1 mm DTT and stored at −20 °C. One molar KCl is necessary to maintain the TnTs in solution at high concentrations (100 μm). TnT1–191 is soluble in lower salt concentrations. Protein concentrations were determined (28Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4546) Google Scholar), and the samples were analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE. The deletion fragments presented the expected molecular masses: 25.5 kDa (TnT1–216), 22.5 kDa (TnT1–191), 12.5 kDa (TnT157–263), and 8.5 kDa (TnT194–263). Tn subunits (20 μm final of each) were combined in a 1:1:1 molar ratio in 6 m urea, 1 m KCl, 50 mmCaCl2, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT. Successive dialysis (4 °C, 12 h each) against the same buffer containing 4.6 m urea, 2m urea, no urea, 100 mm KCl, and no KCl were used to gradually reduce the urea and salt concentrations. After dialysis the reconstituted complexes were centrifuged (12,000 ×g, 10 min), and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. The actomyosin ATPases were measured as described previously (11Malnic B. Reinach F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. Da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin (4 μm), Tm (0.58 μm), Tn (concentrations are indicated in the figure legends), and myosin (0.2 μm) were combined on ice in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 60 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EGTA. A 6 mm CaCl2 solution was used to obtain the desired pCa (K Ca2+ EGTA = 1.9 × 10−7m). Reactions were initiated by adding 2 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.0, after equilibration at 25 °C. After 15 min inorganic phosphate was determined using a colorimetric assay (29Heinomen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Tn binding to actin/Tm was analyzed using an ultracentrifugation assay. Before each assay, Tn subunits and complexes were centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Actin (20 μm), Tm (2.86 μm), and Tn (2.86 μm) were combined in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (+Ca2+), or in the same buffer with 0.5 mm EGTA replacing the CaCl2 (−Ca2+). The mixtures were centrifuged at 315,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. The pellets were rinsed and resuspended in the original volume. Equivalent volumes of the mixture before centrifugation and of the supernatants and pellets after centrifugation were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE or 12.5% Tricine/SDS-PAGE (30Schaegger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10479) Google Scholar) for the small fragments TnT194–263and TnT157–263. Densitometric quantification was performed using a dual wavelength scanner (Shimadzu CS-9000) at 550 nm. Since TnT and TnI and their fragments have a low solubility at low ionic strength, control experiments in the absence of actin-Tm were performed to ensure that at these relatively low protein concentrations, all the Tn components were soluble. A schematic representation of the TnT mutants is shown in Fig. 1. The precise sites for the insertion of stop codons were chosen so that the predicted α-helices would not be interrupted (Fig. 1). The mutants were expressed as non-fusion proteins and purified to homogeneity. Whole Tn complexes containing wt-TnC, wt-TnI, and wt-TnT or the different TnT fragments were reconstituted from the isolated components. After reconstitution, the TnT mutants became soluble at low ionic strength at high protein concentrations, indicating that they were incorporated into stable complexes. When analyzed by gel filtration in the presence of Ca2+, all complexes eluted as a single peak (data not shown). In the absence of Ca2+, TnT1–216 was dissociated from the ternary complex, which suggests that residues 217–263 in the COOH-terminal region of TnT are necessary for the incorporation of TnT into the trimeric complex in the absence of Ca2+ (see below). We analyzed the regulatory properties of complexes containing the different TnT mutants (Fig. 2 A). Under physiological molar ratios of actin, Tm, and Tn (7:1:1), we confirmed that the control Tn complex containing wt-TnT confers full Ca2+ sensitivity to actomyosin ATPase, i.e. it inhibits the ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+ and activates the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+ (10Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (activation is defined as the ability of troponin, in the presence of Ca2+, to increase the actomyosin/tropomyosin ATPase activity to levels above its activity in the absence of troponin). We also confirmed that the binary TnI·TnC complex was not able to inhibit or to activate the ATPase activity at physiological ratios of actin to troponin (Fig. 2 A) (10Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hitchcock S.E. Huxley H.E. Szent-Gyorgyi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Deletions of the COOH-terminal region of TnT or deletion of the T1region reduces the inhibitory function of the troponin complex (Fig. 2 A): TnT1–216 and TnT157–263complexes inhibit the ATPase activity to about 60% and TnT1–191 complex to about 75%, whereas the wt·TnT complex inhibits to about 35%. The complex containing TnT194–263 conferred no Ca2+ sensitivity to the actomyosin ATPase, a behavior identical to the TnI·TnC binary complex (Fig. 2 A). Since the partial inhibition observed for the TnT mutant complexes could be explained by a lower affinity for the thin filament, we performed ATPase experiments using increasing molar ratios of the troponin complex to actin. We observed full inhibitory activity of complexes containing TnT1–191, TnT1–216, and TnT157–263 at actin:troponin molar ratios of 4:7, 3:7, and 3:7 respectively (data not shown). These results imply that the region shared by these mutants, namely amino acids 157–216, bind to the thin filament and may have an inhibitory role. The complexes containing TnT1–216, TnT157–263, and TnT194–263 were not capable of activating the ATPase activity (Fig. 2 A) even when increasing ratios of Tn to actin were used (data not shown). The complex containing TnT1–191 was the only one capable of activating the ATPase activity like wt-Tn in the presence of Tm (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that the NH2-terminal end of TnT (residues 1–191) contains the region responsible for the activation of the ATPase activity. The evidence presented so far suggests that regions 1–191, 157–216, and 217–263 of TnT participate, respectively, in activation, inhibition/thin filament binding, and TnI/TnC binding. The experiments described below were designed to test and essentially confirm these hypotheses. The direct effects of the different regions of TnT on the inhibition and activation of the ATPase activity was analyzed in the presence of Tm but in the absence of TnI and TnC (Fig. 2 B). TnT1–191 is able to activate the ATPase activity, whereas wt-TnT and the mutants TnT157–263 and TnT194–263 are not. TnT1–216, which is not able to activate the ATPase activity in the context of the ternary complex (Fig. 2 A), is able to activate it in the absence of TnC and TnI, although to a lesser extent than TnT1–191. These results indicate that residues 191–263 of TnT are blocking the ability of region 1–191 to activate the ATPase activity and may explain why no activation is observed with isolated full-length TnT. Since full-length TnT alone does not activate the ATPase, but does so in the presence of TnI/TnC, we determined which regions within TnC/TnI are required for activation. We used TnI103–182, which binds to TnC-Ca2+ and is capable of inhibiting the ATPase activity but does not bind to TnT, and the TnI1–98 mutant, which binds to TnT and TnC but shows no inhibitory ability (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. Da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory properties of the ternary complexes containing TnT, TnC, and the different TnI fragments are shown in Fig. 3 A. Although the complex containing TnI103–182 inhibited the ATPase activity as well as the complex containing TnI, it was not able to activate the ATPase activity. The complex containing TnI1–98 activates the ATPase to the same extent as the complex containing wt-TnI (Fig. 3 A). This activation was independent of the Ca2+ concentration, although slightly higher levels of activation were produced in the absence of Ca2+ as observed previously (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. Da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the NH2-terminal region of TnI but not the COOH-terminal region is necessary for the activation of the ATPase activity. Next we analyzed if the NH2-terminal half of TnI is sufficient to activate the ATPase activity or if TnC is also required. The ATPase activity in the presence of filaments containing the different TnT mutants was titrated with increasing amounts of TnI1–98 in the absence of TnC (Fig. 3 B). TnI1–98 in combination with wt-TnT does not activate the ATPase in the absence of TnC. TnI1–98 in combination with TnT157–263 was also not able to activate. The effects of TnT1–191 and TnT1–216 on the ATPase activity were not altered by the addition of TnI1–98. These results indicate that TnI1–98 requires TnC to produce activation with wt-TnT. In conclusion, our ATPase results show that residues 1–191 of TnT contain an activation domain, whereas the region between residues 191 and 263 has an inhibitory effect. Thus activation can only be observed with intact TnT in the presence of TnC/TnI and Ca2+. Furthermore, the NH2-terminal regions of TnI in conjunction with TnC are necessary for activation by the ternary complex. The interactions between TnT fragments, TnI and TnC, were analyzed in an actin/tropomyosin co-sedimentation assay. The TnC·TnI complex is partially retained in the thin filament in the absence of Ca2+ but remains soluble if Ca2+ is present (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of wt-TnT, all three components of the Tn complex remained in the thin filament, irrespective of the Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 4 B) (15Potter J.D. Gergely J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2697-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31Hitchcock S.E. Huxley H.E. Szent-Gyorgyi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If trimeric complexes containing TnT1–216 and TnT1–191 are incubated with actin/Tm, these two TnT mutants remained associated with the thin filament in the presence or absence of Ca2+ but were not able to retain the TnC/TnI dimer in the thin filament in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4, C and D). These controls confirm the previous observations that TnT is required to anchor the TnC·TnI complex to the thin filament in the presence of Ca2+ (15Potter J.D. Gergely J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2697-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31Hitchcock S.E. Huxley H.E. Szent-Gyorgyi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and that only the T2 region of TnT interacts with the TnC/TnI dimer (16Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results specifically implicate the COOH-terminal half of T2(residues 217–263) in this interaction. It has been previously demonstrated that the NH2-terminal region of TnI (TnI1–98) is required for the incorporation of TnT into the ternary complex (12Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. Da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 E shows that the binary TnC·TnI1–98 complex does not associate with the thin filament in the absence of TnT irrespective of the Ca2+ concentration. In contrast, complexes containing TnC·TnI1–98·wt-TnT are always associated with the thin filament (Fig. 4 F). Since TnT1–216 and TnT1–191 lack residues 216–263 which interact with the TnC·TnI binary complex, they were not expected to, and indeed did not, retain TnI1–98/TnC bound to the thin filament (Fig. 4, G and H). Control complexes containing TnI103–182 (which does not bind TnT) were analyzed. TnI103–182 remained associated with the filament in the absence of Ca2+ and was removed by TnC in the presence of Ca2+, both in the presence and absence of TnT (13, data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the NH2-terminal region of TnI interacts with the region between residues 216 and 263 of TnT and that this interaction is the major point of calcium-independent anchoring of the TnC/TnI dimer to TnT. Since isolated TnC has been shown to interact with TnT in the presence of Ca2+ (reviewed in Refs. 1Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 2Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, and 5Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), we analyzed the binding of the binary TnC·TnT complex (without TnI) to actin/Tm. The amount of TnC associated with the thin filaments was measured as a function of total TnC added in the presence or absence of TnI (Fig. 5). In the absence of TnI, a 10-fold excess TnC (30 μm) had to be used in the sedimentation assay to obtain approximately a 1:1 ratio of TnC:TnT bound to the filament (Fig. 5). In the presence of TnI, a 2-fold excess of TnC (6 μm) was sufficient. This suggests that there are two different sites of interaction between TnC and the thin filament in the presence of Ca2+. The first, through binding to TnI which in turn binds TnT, is a strong binding site (reviewed in Refs. 1Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 2Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, and 5Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The second, through direct interaction of TnC with TnT, is much weaker. In the presence and absence of Ca2+ the affinity of the TnT194–263·TnC·TnI complex for the thin filament is reduced (Fig. 6 B) when compared with the affinity of the TnT157–263·TnI·TnC complex (Fig. 6 A). This result suggests that a binding site to actin/Tm may reside in the NH2-terminal region of TnT157–263 (residues 157–191) and that this binding is influenced by Ca2+ binding to TnC. When the control TnT157–263·TnC complex was incubated with actin/Tm in the absence of Ca2+, TnT157–263 was incorporated into the filament while TnC remained in solution (Fig. 6 C). This confirms previous observations that TnT157–263 itself presents a binding site to actin/Tm (16Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,32Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, both subunits remained in the supernatant indicating that TnC is able to remove TnT157–263 (TnT2) from the thin filament in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6 C). Even though TnT2 fragment alone is able to interact with Tm (18Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with actin/Tm, it is still not clear how strong this interaction is in the context of the ternary troponin complex. Our results do not rule out the possibility that the interaction of TnT157–263 with the thin filament in the absence of Ca2+ is mainly mediated by TnI, which itself binds to the thin filament. To address this question we investigated how the interaction of TnT157–263 with the thin filament is modulated by the TnI fragments (Fig. 6, D and E). The TnT157–263·TnI1–98·TnC and TnT157–263·TnI103–182·TnC complexes were reconstituted, and their ability to be incorporated into the thin filament was analyzed. TnI103–182 binds actin/Tm and TnI1–98 does not (13Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. Da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TnT157–263·TnI1–98·TnC complex was not incorporated into the filament irrespective of the Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6 D). When the trimeric TnT157–263·TnI103–182·TnC complex was incubated with actin/Tm in the absence of Ca2+, TnI103–182 and TnT157–263 were incorporated into the filament, whereas TnC remained in solution (Fig. 6 E). In the presence of Ca2+ the three subunits remained in solution (Fig. 6 E). These results indicate that although Ca2+ binding to TnC was able to remove both TnT157–263 and TnI103–182 from the filament, the interaction of TnI1–98/TnC with TnT reduces the affinity of TnT157–263 for the thin filament irresp"

In this study, using a fully functional green fluorescent protein conjugated PKCβII (GFP-PKCβII), we demonstrate a novel approach to study the dynamic redistribution of PKC in live cells in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation. Agonist-induced PKC translocation was rapid, transient, and selectively mediated by the activation of Gqα- but not Gsα- or Giα-coupled receptors. Interestingly, although the stimuli were continuously present, only one brief peak of PKC membrane translocation was observed, consistent with rapid desensitization of the signaling pathway. Moreover, when GFP-PKCβII was used to examine cross-talk between two Gqα-coupled receptors, angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR) and endothelin A receptor (ETAR), activation of ETARs resulted in a subsequent loss of AT1AR responsiveness, whereas stimulation of AT1ARs did not cause desensitization of the ETAR signaling. The development of GFP-PKCβII has allowed not only the real time visualization of the dynamic PKC trafficking in live cells in response to physiological stimuli but has also provided a direct and sensitive means in the assessment of activation and desensitization of receptors implicated in the phospholipase C signaling pathway.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar, 2Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase C can be triggered by stimulating a wide variety of plasma membrane hormone, neurotransmitter, and growth factor receptors, among which seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) relay extracellular signals to PKC by activating heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) (3Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-protein Linked Receptor Facts Book. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 296-314Google Scholar). G proteins are composed of α- and βγ-subunits, both of which serve as signal moieties and mediate cellular responses by modulating the activity of different effector systems and levels of various second messengers (4Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Gqα is one of the major G protein α-subunits and is coupled to a large number of receptors including angiotensin receptors and endothelin receptors. The activation of Gqα by these receptors triggers the hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids by phospholipase Cβ to form two important second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar, 5Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H.

The binding of IP3 to its intracellular receptor results in a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (7Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). The increased membrane DAG and intracellular Ca2+ lead to the mobilization of PKC to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). The activation of PKC by DAG, Ca2+, and many other lipid mediators such as arachidonic acid has been associated with many important biological functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar, 2Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5758) Google Scholar). In Gqα-coupled receptor signal transduction, PKC activation not only serves to relay the signal from effector phospholipase Cβ to various PKC substrates for initiating downstream cellular responses, but it also exerts feedback effects on the system and is involved in the turning off of signaling from the receptors, an important regulatory process termed desensitization (9Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The ability of PKC to phosphorylate and desensitize a receptor relies on the existence of consensus PKC phosphorylation site(s) at the intracellular domains of the receptors (11Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10341-10344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28712-28719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Since PKC does not discriminate between agonist-occupied and -unoccupied receptors (15Grady E.F. Bohm S.K. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G586-G601PubMed Google Scholar), activation of PKC is believed to be associated with both homologous and heterologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Consequently, exposure of cells to a Gqα-coupled receptor agonist that causes PKC activation potentially results not only in the loss of cellular response to that specific agonist but also the diminution of cellular responses to various other agonists. The current methods of assessing Gqα-coupled receptor signaling and desensitization are based mainly on the generation of IP3 or the increase of intracellular Ca2+ as a result of IP3 generation (16Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Zhang M. Turnbaugh D. Cofie D. Dogan S.

However, neither approach assesses the equally important and independent branch of phospholipase Cβ signaling reflected by the production of DAG and the subsequent membrane translocation and activation of PKC. Although as important as IP3, DAG is rarely used as a measurement in assessing Gqα activation because of its quick turnover (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar) and the lack of techniques to follow its real time cellular distribution or behavior. Moreover, biochemical studies have indicated that the activation of PKC by DAG is also transient and is mainly associated with many cellular events mediated by short term activation of PKC such as hormone secretion and muscle contraction (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar, 2Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters mimic the action of DAG, but they are more potent, and their effects last longer in cells due to their persistence in the cell membrane (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). This has made feasible the study of PKC subcellular localizations before and after activation by phorbol esters by immunofluorescent microscopy in fixed cells (19Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 20Jaken S. Protein Kinase C. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 179-188Google Scholar). However, the same method is not applicable in following the more physiologically relevant redistribution of PKC in response to receptor activation in live cells. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the short term of PKC activation in response to receptor activation is related to the signaling desensitization at the level of receptors. In the present study, we report the development of a green fluorescent protein conjugated PKCβII (GFP-PKCβII) to study PKC mobilization in response to agonist stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors and to assess the activation and desensitization of these receptors. GFP, originally identified in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, displays an inherent green bioluminescence and has been used as a fluorescent reporter molecule in the localization of membrane receptors, cytoplasmic proteins, and secretory proteins (21Cubitt A.B.

When fused to the amino terminus of PKCβII, the resulting fusion protein, GFP-PKCβII, was found to be fully functional in terms of its phospholipid-dependent kinase activity and its ability to translocate from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in response to phorbol ester (PMA) stimulation, similar to that reported for a PKCγ/GFP conjugate (28Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while in PMA-treated cells GFP-PKCβII remained on the plasma membrane, in cells stimulated with physiological signals that activate Gqα-coupled receptors, the translocation of GFP-PKCβII to the plasma membrane was found to be transient, reaching a peak and being reversed within minutes. This provided a real time visual demonstration of the cellular trafficking of a PKC isoenzyme in live cells, revealing a dynamic nature of the interaction of PKCβII with lipid and/or protein molecules on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, since GFP-PKCβII selectively responded to only signals activating Gqα- but not Gsα- and Giα-coupled receptors and such responses were transitory, our results also demonstrate an important analytical role of GFP-PKCβII as a reporter in the study of Gqα-coupled receptor activation and desensitization. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Monoclonal antibody against GFP was fromCLONTECH. Polyclonal rabbit antibody against PKCβII was prepared and extensively characterized as described previously (29Wetsel W.C. Khan W.A. Merchenthaler I. Rivera H. Halpern A.E. Phung H.M. Negro-Vilar A. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vector pBK-CMV and GFP plasmid pEGFP-N1 was from Stratagene and CLONTECH, respectively. Restriction enzymes were from Promega or New England Biolabs. Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphatidylserine and sn-dioctanoyl-glycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Eagle's minimum essential medium, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 1 m HEPES buffer were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Summit Biotechnology Inc. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The human PKCβII cDNA was inserted between BamHI and KpnI sites of pBK-CMV. A unique BssHII restriction site was located three base pairs prior to the start codon (ATG) of PKCβII cDNA. To construct GFP-PKCβII, EGFP cDNA without the stop codon was first amplified from plasmid pEGFP-N1 by polymerase chain reaction using 5′-oligonucleotide primer 5′-GTGAACCGTCAGATCCGCTAG-3′ (based on the sequence of pEGFP-N1 from 575 to 595) and 3′-primer 5′-CCATCTTGCGCGCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′ (with the native sequence of pEGFP-N1 from 1376 to 1396 underlined). The polymerase chain reaction fragment containing EGFP cassette was gel-purified, digested with BamHI and BssHII, and directly inserted between the BamHI and BssHII sites of plasmid pBK-CMV-PKCβII prior to the 5′-end of the PKCβII cDNA (Fig. 1). The sequence of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNAs of AT1AR, ETAR, β2AR, and D2R were subcloned in pcDNA I or pcDNA I/amp mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method with 1–10 μg of plasmid (30Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with EGFP, PKCβII, or GFP-PKCβII. Immunoprecipitation was performed 48 h after transfection as follows. The cells were washed with cold PBS and solubilized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h, and the lysates of EGFP, PKCβII, or GFP-PKCβII transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with PKCβII antibody. Protein A-Sepharose beads were used to absorb immunoprecipitates and were then washed four times with lysis buffer followed by one wash with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2). The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated proteins was analyzed by protein kinase C assay (see below). Cell lysates from HEK 293 cells transfected with EGFP, PKCβII, or GFP-PKCβII were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44919) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk, probed with anti-GFP antibody (1:2500 dilution) or rabbit anti-PKCβII antibody (1:2000 dilution), and exposed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PKC activity was measured using the vesicle assay for PKC as described previously (32Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Standard assay conditions were as follows: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ATP, 10–15 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine/sn-dioctanoyl-glycerol vesicles, and 200 μg/ml histone IIIS as substrate in a final volume of 250 μl at 30 °C for 10 min. 10 mm EGTA was used in determining basal kinase activity. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Transfected cells were seeded on glass coverslips placed in six-well culture dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. For experiments involving phorbol ester treatment, cells were treated with 100 nm PMA for 5 min. The cells were then rinsed briefly in PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. After 1 h of incubation with anti-PKCβII polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution), the cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution) for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted onto the slides, and PKCβII immunofluorescence was observed with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning microscope at 488-nm excitation. HEK 293 cells were transfected with GFP-PKCβII and one or two of the G protein-coupled receptors as described in figure legends. 24 h after transfection, the cells were plated onto 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek) at a density of 1 × 105 and incubated for another 24 h for the cells to attach to glass. The cells expressing GFP-PKCβII (25–40% of the total cell population) were observed under confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 40 × 1.3 NA oil immersion lens. The cells were kept warm during microscopy at 30 °C in culture medium containing 20 mm HEPES on a heated microscope stage. GFP-PKCβII fluorescent signals were collected sequentially using the Zeiss LSM software time series function with single line excitation (488 nm) with a time interval of 20 s between two scannings. Various drugs were applied to the cells during the scanning of GFP-PKCβII transfected cells. Due to its inherent fluorescence and unique compact structure, GFP has been reported in many studies to serve as a valuable reporter molecule in the localization of various proteins without interfering with their biological activity (21Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 33Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). GFP-PKCβII was constructed by fusing EGFP to the 5′-end of PKCβII (Fig. 1). When examined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, GFP-PKCβII was found to express to the same extent in HEK 293 cells as wild-type PKCβII but migrated more slowly due to the added mass of GFP (Fig. 2 A). To compare the biological activity of GFP-PKCβII with that of wild-type PKCβII, both proteins were immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells transiently expressing GFP-PKCβII or PKCβII with an antibody against PKCβII and analyzed for their relative kinase activity using a recently developed PKC assay with histone IIIS as the substrate (32Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the cells transfected with EGFP contained very low kinase activity, but transfection of either GFP-PKCβII or PKCβII significantly increased the phosphorylation of histone IIIS. The ability of GFP-PKCβII to phosphorylate histone IIIS in a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent manner was comparable with that of wild-type PKCβII, indicating that the fusion of the GFP molecule to the N terminus of PKCβII has no significant effect on PKC activity. Phorbol esters such as PMA are well known to mimic the action of diacylglycerol in inducing PKC to translocate from cytosol to the plasma membrane (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar, 34Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of GFP-PKCβII to respond to PMA was also examined (Fig. 2 C, top). Under normal unstimulated conditions, GFP-PKCβII was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and excluded from the nuclei, a distribution exactly reflecting the cellular localization of wild-type PKCβII detected with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2 C,middle). Stimulation with 1 μm PMA triggered redistribution of GFP-PKCβII to the plasma membrane. This membrane translocation was completed within 5 min, and about 90% of GFP-PKCβII fluorescence was mobilized to the plasma membrane, similar to that observed with transfected wild-type PKCβII in fixed HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2 C, top and middle). The distribution of wild-type PKCβII and GFP-PKCβII observed in HEK 293 cells corresponded to the reported distribution of endogenous PKCβII in U937, a cell line expressing endogenous PKCβII (35Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to GFP-PKCβII, unconjugated GFP molecules were distributed throughout the cell body, and their distribution was not affected by PMA (Fig. 2 C, bottom). These results indicate that GFP-PKCβII fusion protein retains the biological activity of wild-type PKCβII with respect to kinase activity as well as cellular localization. Although the redistribution of PKC upon phorbol ester stimulation has been extensively studied with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (19Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 20Jaken S. Protein Kinase C. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 179-188Google Scholar), the kinetics of PKC membrane translocation in response to physiological signals have not been well characterized. One such physiological signal that activates PKC is through activation of G protein-coupled receptors. Therefore, initial studies using confocal microscopy examined the real time cellular distribution of GFP-PKCβII in response to the activation of the Gqα-coupled AT1AR by its physiological ligand angiotensin II (Fig. 3 A). This was done at 30 °C in live HEK 293 cells, which had been transiently transfected to overexpress the AT1AR and GFP-PKCβII. In the absence of receptor activation, confocal microscopy revealed that GFP-PKCβII was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. However, upon agonist activation of the AT1AR, a redistribution of GFP-PKCβII to the plasma membrane and clearance of cytosolic fluorescence occurred and peaked within 40 s. This angiotensin II-induced GFP-PKCβII membrane trafficking was rapid compared with the translocation caused by PMA stimulation, which did not peak until after 2–5 min. More interestingly, unlike PMA-induced translocation in which PKC remained persistently localized on the plasma membrane, the mobilization of GFP-PKCβII to the plasma membrane following AT1AR activation was transient, and the redistributed GFP-PKCβII rapidly returned to the cytoplasm within 1 min after translocation. The time frame for GFP-PKCβII recovery in the cytoplasm in the majority of the cells observed ranged from 20 s to 1 min after GFP-PKCβII membrane translocation. Moreover, even in the continuous presence of angiotensin II for 30 min, only an initial brief peak of PKC membrane translocation was observed (data not shown). These visual results are consistent with biochemical studies indicating a dynamic nature of PKCβII in interacting with molecules on the plasma membrane (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar,34Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Among major groups of G protein-coupled receptors, those coupled to Gqα are directly associated with the activation of phospholipase C, resulting in the generation of diacylglycerol and a rise of intracellular Ca2+, whereas the effector for receptors coupled to Gsα and Giα is mainly adenylyl cyclase associated with the production of cyclic AMP. To examine the specificity and selectivity of agonist-induced PKC trafficking, three additional G protein-coupled receptors were tested for their ability to trigger GFP-PKCβII translocation, including ETAR (coupled to Gqα), β2AR (coupled to Gsα), and D2R (coupled to Giα). In HEK 293 cells, transiently transfected with GFP-PKCβII and ETAR, a rapid PKC membrane translocation was observed in response to the ETAR endogenous agonist endothelin (Fig. 3 B). Similar to that caused by the activation of the AT1AR, this ETAR-promoted redistribution of GFP-PKCβII was transient and readily reversible. In contrast, when cells were transfected to coexpress GFP-PKCβII with either β2AR or D2R, the activation of neither receptor by its cognate ligand affected the distribution of GFP-PKCβII fluorescence (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that the mobilization of GFP-PKCβII in live cells are selectively mediated by receptors activating the phospholipase C signaling pathway including GPCRs coupled to Gqα but not Gsα and Giα. The observation that there was only one brief peak of PKC membrane translocation even in the continuous presence of angiotensin II or endothelin suggests that the transitory nature of PKC trafficking in response to these receptor agonists might be associated with the rapid desensitization of AT1AR or ETAR signaling. To further investigate this phenomenon, HEK 293 cells transfected with GFP-PKCβII and AT1AR were sequentially exposed to two pulses of stimulation by angiotensin II separated by 10 min (Fig. 4 A). Whereas the first exposure resulted in a transient GFP-PKCβII trafficking between the cytoplasm and plasma membrane and GFP-PKCβII returned to the cytoplasm within 1 min following its membrane translocation, there was no apparent PKC mobilization in response to the second angiotensin II stimulation, indicating the AT1AR signaling was turned off as a result of initial receptor activation at a step prior to PKC translocation or at the level of PKC. The possibility that PKC itself might be desensitized and loses its ability to respond to further receptor activation was examined by exposing AT1AR and GFP-PKCβII-containing cells to PMA following agonist activation of the AT1AR. As shown in Fig. 4 B, PMA triggered a second peak of stable GFP-PKCβII redistribution to the plasma membrane in cells preexposed to angiotensin II. The time profile and extent of this PKC translocation were indistinguishable from PMA-induced PKC redistribution in cells untreated with receptor agonist. Similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with GFP-PKCβII and ETAR and pretreated with endothelin (Fig. 4, C and D). These results strongly suggest that the transient nature of PKC trafficking in response to Gqα-coupled receptor activation is a direct consequence of the rapid desensitization of receptor signaling at a step prior to PKC translocation. The AT1AR and ETAR share the same Gqα-mediated signaling pathway in which Gqα activates phospholipase Cβ and results in the hydrolysis of phosphoinositol lipid to generate IP3 and DAG, the latter serving as a second messenger for activation of PKC. To further study the rapid receptor desensitization as well as the relationship between signaling pathways of different receptors, AT1AR and ETAR were cotransfected with GFP-PKCβII into HEK 293 cells, and the effect of their potential cross-talk on the trafficking of GFP-PKCβII was examined and visualized by confocal microscopy. In initial experiments, the cells were prestimulated with angiotensin II to activate the AT1AR and induce PKC response. As described above, the resulting GFP-PKCβII trafficking was transient and GFP-PKCβII returned to the cytoplasm within 1 min following its membrane translocation. No second peak of PKC translocat"
https://openalex.org/W2078683141,"We have investigated the oligomerization process of tenascin-C using a variety of recombinant wild-type and mutant polypeptide chain fragments produced by heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of the structures and assemblies of these fragments indicated a sequential two-step oligomerization mechanism of tenascin-C involving the concerted interaction of two distinct domains and cysteines 64, 111, and 113. First, the sequence between alanine 114 and glutamine 139 initiates hexabrachion formation via a parallel three-stranded coiled coil. Subsequently, the tenascin assembly domain, which is unique to the tenascins, is responsible for the connection of two triplets to a hexamer. The oligomerization of the tenascin assembly domains by the three-stranded coiled coil increases their homophilic binding affinity and is an important prerequisite for tenascin-C hexamerization. Although formation of the characteristic hexabrachion structure involves the covalent linkage of the six subunits by cysteine residues, mutational analysis indicates that hexamer formation is not dependent on intermolecular disulfide bonds. Most interestingly, substitution of glutamate 130 within the coiled-coil domain by leucine or alanine resulted in the formation of parallel four-stranded helix structures, which further associated to dodecamers. Aside from supporting a sequential process of tenascin-C assembly, this finding provides experimental evidence that non-core residues can have profound effects on the oligomerization states of coiled coils.

Cytotactin/hexabrachion/tenascin-C (TN-C) 1The abbreviations used are: TN, tenascin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TA domain, TN assembly domain. exists as a large disulfide-bonded hexamer in extracellular matrices (1Jones F.S. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Depending on the species analyzed and the variant generated by alternative splicing, each subunit has a molecular mass in the range of 190–300 kDa (2Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Experientia (Basel). 1995; 51: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Like many other extracellular matrix components, TN-C is a modular glycoprotein that contains five types of domains (3Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5 (and references therein): 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The N-terminal stretch of ∼110 residues is unique to the TNs. This segment is followed by a short heptad repeat region (putative coiled-coil domain), 13 domains that are homologous to the epidermal growth factor, and a series of fibronectin type III domains. The C-terminal end is well conserved, with homology to the C-terminal domains of β and γ chains of fibrinogen. Similar patterns of domains are present in the other members of the TN family, including TN-R (4Nörenberg U. Wille H. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1992; 8: 849-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), TN-X (5Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and TN-Y (6Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although also TN-R protein isolated from tissues has been found in the form of dimers and trimers (4Nörenberg U. Wille H. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1992; 8: 849-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the biological importance of the multimeric form to this protein family has not been elucidated. TN-C is highly expressed in a large number of developing and regenerating tissues, such as sites of wound healing (7Whitby D.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Development (Camb.). 1991; 112: 651-668PubMed Google Scholar, 8Whitby D.J. Longaker M.T. Harrison M.R. Adzick N.S. Ferguson M.W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 583-586PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it is generally present at low or undetectable levels in the corresponding intact regions in adults. Together with numerous cell culture experiments, these findings implied important roles of TN-C in embryonic development as well as tissue growth and remodeling. In vivo functions of TN-C, however, remain elusive and may be subtle since knockout mice lacking TN-C were reported to develop normally (9Saga Y. Yagi T. Ikawa Y. Sakakura T. Aizawa S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). One of the most impressive characteristics of TN-C is its radially arranged six-armed structure called hexabrachion. As first observed by Erickson and Iglesias (10Erickson H.P. Iglesias J.L. Nature. 1984; 311: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the TN-C hexabrachion appears to consist of two trimers joined at their centers by short linker arms and a central knob. Biochemical and electron microscopic evidences located the oligomerization domains of TN-C at the N-terminal end of the molecule and suggested that flanking Cys residues are involved in hexabrachion formation (11Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, sequence analysis of TN-C revealed the presence of three complete heptad repeats within the N-terminal segment (11Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Heptad repeats of seven amino acid residues denoted a–g (13Sodek J. Hodges R.S. Smillie L.B. Jurasek L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3800-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) are the hallmark of proteins with a potential for coiled-coil formation (15Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar, 16Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The residues at positions a and d are mostly apolar, forming a 3,4-hydrophobic repeat, with charged residues occurring frequently at the e and g sites. Residues at these four positions form the hydrophobic interface between α-helices and can participate in interhelical electrostatic interactions (17Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Since the coiled-coil structural motif is widely used and well suited for the assembly of oligomeric proteins (18Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 19Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it has been speculated that TN-C hexabrachion assembly might involve the formation of a trimer intermediate whose oligomerization is mediated by coiled-coil α-helices (11Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, uncertainty existed about whether the short stretch of α-helix in TN-C actually could form a coiled coil since three to four heptad repeats were reported to be the minimum size requirement of amphipathic peptides to fold into stable coiled-coil structures (20Lumb K.J. Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7361-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Su J.Y. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15501-15510Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 22Fairman R. Chao H.-G. Lavoie T.B. Villafranca J.J. Matsueda G.R. Novotny J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2824-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, pulse-chase experiments have demonstrated that TN-C assembly is surprisingly rapid and suggested that nascent TN-C polypeptide chains assemble to hexamers prior to completion of translation since no intermediates such as monomers, dimers, or trimers could be identified (23Redick S.D. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from these observations, nothing is known about TN-C assembly, raising the question about the mechanism of this process. We have addressed this issue by generating a variety of recombinant TN-C polypeptide chain fragments by heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli. We have analyzed the structures and assemblies of these fragments by SDS-PAGE, CD spectroscopy, and analytical ultracentrifugation. In addition, we have identified by mutational analysis the Cys residues involved in the stabilization of TN-C hexamers. The functional significance of disulfide bond formation in TN-C assembly was assayed by analytical ultracentrifugation measurements of the mutant polypeptide chain fragments. Furthermore, we have investigated by site-specific mutagenesis the role of amino acid residues within the coiled-coil domain that are conserved among known species and members of the TN family. Our data indicate that formation of the TN-C hexabrachion structure is a two-step process involving the concerted interaction of the three-stranded coiled coil and the domain unique to the TNs. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a conserved Glu is a key residue in modulating the oligomeric state of the three-stranded coiled-coil domain, which is essential for the specific formation of TN-C hexabrachions.

It was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA fragments coding for Glu-34 to Gln-139 (designated p1), Glu-34 to Ala-110 (p2), Ala-110 to Gln-139 (p3), and Ala-114 to Gln-139 (p4) of chicken TN-C (11Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primer sets were designed (p1: p1-5′ (5′-CCCGGATCCGAGACTGGGCTCAATGTG-3′) and p1-3′ (5′-CCCGAATTCTTATTACTGCTCCCGGAGGGAGG-3′); p2: p1-5′ and p2-3′ (5′-TATGAATTCTTATTAGGCCCGGCGGGGAATG-3′); p3: p3-5′ (5′-CCCGGATCCGCCTGTGGCTGTGCGGC-3′) and p1-3′; and p4: p4-5′ (5′-CCCGGATCCGCGGCTGCCCCAGACATC-3′) and p1-3′) to obtain a BamHI site at the 5′-end and two translation stop signals (TAA) followed by an EcoRI site at the 3′-end. The amplified products were ligated into the bacterial expression vectors pPEP-T (p3 and p4) (24Brandenberger R. Kammerer R.A. Engel J. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and pHisTrx (p1 and p2). Plasmid pHisTrx is a derivative of pET-32a (Novagen) encoding E. coli thioredoxin (trxA) with an N-terminal 6-His tag and a thrombin cleavage site followed by a unique multiple cloning site. The designed mutant polypeptide chain fragments p1C64S and p2C64S were generated by polymerase chain reaction as described by Ho et al. (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using two sets of primers for each fragment (p1C64S: p1-5′ and pC64S-3′ (5′-CCAGGTCCACAGAAGAAAGGGAGCCAACAGGCAGC-3′), and pC64S-5′ (5′-GTTGGCTCCCTTTCTTCTGTGGACCTGGACGCAGC-3′) and p1-3′; and p2C64S: p2-5′ and pC64S-3′, and pC64S-5′ and p2-3′). Mutant p1C/S was constructed by the same method from p1C64S using the following primer sets: p1-5′ and pC/S-3′ (5′-GGGGCAGCCGCAGAGCCAGAGGCCCGGCGGGGAATGTTG-3′), and p2-3′ and pC/S-5′ (5′-CCCCGCCGGGCCTCTGGCTCTGCGGCTGCCCCAGACATCAAG-3′). Mutant polypeptide chain fragments p1C64S/E130A, p1C64S/E130L, p1C64S/Q139L, p3E130A, p3E130L, and p3Q139L were generated by polymerase chain reaction from p1C64S using p1-5′ and p3-5′, respectively, and the corresponding antisense primer (pE130A, 5′-CCCGAATTCTTATTACTGCTCCCGGAGGGAGGATACCAGCCCAGCCAGCTCCTCCAGTCTGCTCAG-3′; pE130L, 5′-CCCGAATTCTTATTACTGCTCCCGGAGGGAGGATACCAGCCCCAGCAGCTCCTCCAGTCTGCTCAG-3′; and pQ139L, 5′-CCCGAATTCTTATTACAGCTCCCGGAGGGAGGATAC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction and DNA manipulations for cloning were performed according to standard protocols (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. The E. coli JM109 (DE3) host strain (Promega) was used for all expression experiments. Production and purification of 6-His-tagged fusion proteins by immobilized metal affinity chromatography were performed under nondenaturing (p1 and p2) and denaturing (p3 and p4) conditions as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Affinity-purified fusion proteins were dialyzed against thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). Component proteins were generated by proteolytic cleavage for 2 h at room temperature using human thrombin (Sigma) at a concentration of 1 unit/mg of recombinant protein. The quality of cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE (p1 and p2) or Tricine/SDS-PAGE (p3 and p4) analysis. Processed target proteins were separated from their affinity handles by repeating the chromatography step. All recombinant polypeptide chain fragments contained two additional N-terminal residues, Gln and Ser, which originated from the expression plasmids and are not part of the TN-C coding sequence. If not stated otherwise, recombinant TN-C fragments were analyzed at room temperature in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. Cys sulfhydryl groups were completely reduced by incubation of the proteins with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. After precipitation by 75% ammonium sulfate saturation, proteins were redissolved and incubated at room temperature in redox buffer (0.2m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm reduced glutathione, and 5 mm oxidized glutathione) under anaerobic conditions to allow disulfide bond formation and exchange of monomers. Disulfide bond formation was monitored by collecting aliquots at various times and subsequent SDS-PAGE or Tricine/SDS-PAGE analysis. SDS-PAGE and Tricine/SDS-PAGE (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) were performed on 12 × 13-cm slab gels. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Apparent molecular masses were obtained by comparison with low molecular mass markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Sigma). CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. Far-ultraviolet spectra (200–250 nm) were measured in a 1-mm path length quartz cell and represent averages of 10 accumulations. Helix content was calculated by the method of Chen et al. (28Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). CD melting profiles were recorded on a Cary 61 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostatted 1-mm path length quartz cell. Thermal stability was determined by monitoring the change in the mean molar residue ellipticity at a fixed wavelength of 221 nm ([Θ]221) as a function of temperature. A ramping rate of 1 °C/min was used for all experiments. Data reduction analysis was performed with the Jasco (Japan Spectroscopic Co.), LABView (National Instruments), and Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific) software packages. Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with 12-mm Epon double-sector cells in an An-60 Ti rotor. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed at rotor speeds of 56,000 rpm, and sedimenting material was assayed by its absorbance at 234 or 278 nm. Sedimentation coefficients were corrected to standard conditions (water, 20 °C) (29Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliff, NJ1985: 93-136Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium scans were carried out at 11,000–42,000 rpm depending on molecular mass. Average molecular masses were evaluated from ln(absorbance) versus radial distance square plots (29Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliff, NJ1985: 93-136Google Scholar) assuming a partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g for all polypeptide chain fragments. Biochemical and electron microscopic data suggest that the oligomerization sites of TN-C are located at the N terminus of the molecule and that flanking Cys residues are involved in hexamer formation (11Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, sequence analysis of TN-C revealed the presence of three complete heptad repeats within the N-terminal part of the molecule (Fig. 1) (11Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To dissect the mechanism of TN-C assembly, a repertoire of recombinant N-terminal polypeptide chain fragments was generated by heterologous gene expression in E. coli (Figs. 2 A and4 A).Figure 2Recombinant wild-type and designed Cys mutant TN-C polypeptide chain fragments.

Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), fragment p1 is expected to contain all the structural information required for the formation of a disulfide-linked hexamer. Cys-111 and Cys-113 are candidate residues to covalently connect three subunits by interchain disulfide bonds, and Cys-64 possesses the putative function of linking two triplets to the characteristic hexabrachion structure. To confirm the proposed roles of Cys-64, Cys-111, and Cys-113, mutant polypeptide chain fragments were generated in which either Cys-64 (p2C64S and p1C64S) or all three Cys residues (p1C/S) were replaced by Ser (Fig. 2 A). To assay the functional significance of conserved residues within the coiled-coil segment, mutant proteins were designed based on the alignment of known TN sequences (Fig. 1). Specifically, Gln-139 was changed to Leu (p1C64S/Q139L and p3Q139L), and Glu-130 was replaced by either Leu or Ala (p1C64S/E130L, p1C64S/E130A, p3E130L, and p3E130A) (Fig. 4 A). The homogeneity of the affinity-purified recombinant TN-C polypeptide chain fragments was assessed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE and SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Single bands migrating with mobilities corresponding to their respective molecular masses and with no degradation products were detected (Figs. 2 C and4 C). Notably, peptides p3 and p4 could only be visualized as faint bands after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes followed by staining with Amido Black (data not shown). When the wild-type fragments p1 and p2 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions after oxidation with glutathione (see “Experimental Procedures”), the p2 polypeptide chain fragment essentially migrated as a disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), whereas p1 revealed a less defined band corresponding in size to a hexamer (lane 1). In addition, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of higher disulfide-linked p1 aggregates, which did not enter the resolving gel (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). For the TN-C mutant p1C64S, disulfide-linked trimers were the largest species observed (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). As expected from the absence of Cys residues, p1C/S and p2C64S migrated with mobilities corresponding to their apparent monomer molecular masses (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 5). CD spectroscopy was used to test for the secondary structure of the recombinant TN-C fragments (Fig. 3). CD spectra recorded from p4 and disulfide-linked p3 at total chain concentrations of 100 and 36 μm, respectively, were characteristic for α-helical structures showing minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 3 A). [Θ]222 values of −21,000 degrees cm2 dmol−1 indicated degrees of α-helicity of ∼60–70% for both p3 and p4, assuming that values of −32,600 and −33,200 degrees cm2 dmol−1 correspond to a helix content of 100% for 28- and 32-residue peptides, respectively, and correcting for the length dependence of [Θ]222 (28Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). The highly negative values of the mean molar residue ellipticity recorded for p3 and p4 at 222 nm suggests that both peptides form α-helical coiled-coil structures. This conclusion is further supported by thermal transition profiles recorded for both peptides at 221 nm (Fig. 3 B). Fragment p3 exhibited a profile that indicates an incomplete unfolding transition with a half-value at 80 °C, which was independent of concentration (data not shown). In contrast, concentration dependence of the midpoint of thermal unfolding (T m) was observed for p4, where the helical bundle is not connected by disulfide bonds (data not shown). At a total chain concentration of 100 μm, the spectrum showed a T m at 51 °C (Fig. 3 B). The thermal melting profile exhibited a sigmoid shape and was monophasic and reversible, with >95% of the starting signal regained on cooling. Although analysis by CD of p2 indicated proper folding of the domain, the fragment's spectrum was difficult to interpret and most likely represents a mixture of types of secondary structure (Fig. 3 A). The spectrum of p1 was consistent with the average-weighted sum of the spectra recorded for p2 and p3 (Fig. 3 A). Notably, the CD spectra of all mutant TN-C polypeptide chain fragments (data not shown) were identical to those of the wild-type fragments (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the amino acid substitutions did not significantly interfere with the proteins' secondary structure (data not shown). To assay the functional significance of disulfide bond formation in the assembly process of TN-C subunits, wild-type and mutant chain fragments were analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (TableI, part A). Sedimentation equilibrium revealed an average molecular mass of 8.9 kDa for p4 at 37 °C, which was consistent with the formation of trimers (calculated molecular mass of 8.7 kDa). Surprisingly, p4 appeared to form a mixture of dimers and trimers at lower temperatures, revealing a temperature dependence opposite to the direction expected. Disulfide-linked p3 chains exhibited an average molecular mass of 9.8 kDa, indicating the formation of trimeric structures (calculated molecular mass of 9.9 kDa). Depending on rotor speed, molecular masses of 43, 55, and 65 kDa were found for wild-type p2. This suggested that disulfide-linked dimers (calculated molecular mass of 17.4 kDa) associate to larger assemblies, most likely representing a mixture of tetramers, hexamers, and octamers. Conversely, an average molecular mass of 10.2 kDa was obtained for the mutant p2C64S, indicative of the predominance of monomers. Molecular masses of 67, 70, and 68 kDa were obtained for disulfide-linked wild-type p1 and the mutant polypeptide chain fragments p1C64S and p1C/S, respectively. These values were in agreement with hexameric structures (calculated molecular mass of 70 kDa).Table ISedimentation coefficients (s 20,w) and average molecular masses of recombinant wild-type and mutant TN-C polypeptide chain fragmentsFragments 20, wMolecular massObservedCalculated1-aMolecular mass of the monomer based on its amino acid sequence.SkDaA. p13.81-bLow percentage of faster sedimenting material.6711.7p1C64S3.27011.7p1C/S3.61-bLow percentage of faster sedimenting material.6811.7p23.165 (15,000 rpm)8.755 (18,000 rpm)431-cAdditional species of higher molecular mass.

Open table in a new tab Taken together, these findings indicate that TN-C oligomerization is a sequential process involving the concerted interaction of two distinct domains. Considering its oligomerizing function, we propose the term TN assembly (TA) domain for the autonomous folding unit N-terminal to the three-stranded coiled coil. In addition, our results suggest that the heptad repeats are crucial for initiating the specific formation of TN-C hexabrachions. Although Cys-64, Cys-111, and Cys-113 are not necessary for TN-C hexamer assembly, they are most likely involved in the stabilization of the native molecule by interchain disulfide bonds. Comparison of the p3 fragment to homologous coiled-coil regions of known TN sequences from different species and other family members revealed the presence of six absolutely conserved residues (Fig. 1). The preferences for specific amino acids at the core positions a and d in coiled coils can be explained in terms of packing geometry in these structures (30Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Because replacements of these core residues are known to have profound effects on the oligomerization state of coiled coils and have been well studied (30Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 31Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on non-core residues. Interestingly, two of the residues, Arg-125 and Glu-130, could possibly form an interhelical g to e′ attractive ionic interaction (residue i in chain 1 to residue i′+5 in chain 2) (31Harbury P.B.

In this study we have characterized IRS-4 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, where it was originally discovered. IRS-4 was the predominant insulin-elicited phosphotyrosine protein in these cells. Subcellular fractionation revealed that about 50% of IRS-4 was located in cellular membranes, and immunofluorescence indicated that IRS-4 was concentrated at the plasma membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy conclusively established that a large portion of the IRS-4 was located at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane in both the unstimulated and insulin-treated states. IRS-4 was found to be associated with two src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2, the adaptor to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. On the other hand, no significant association was detected with two other SH2 domain proteins, the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 and phospholipase Cγ. Insulin-like growth factor I acting through its receptor was as effective as insulin in eliciting tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4, but interleukin 4 and epidermal growth factor were ineffective.

The IRSs in turn bind SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. The binding of these SH2 domain proteins activates them in various ways and thereby initiates signaling cascades that regulate cell metabolism and proliferation (reviewed in Refs. 1White M.F.

However, in the past year we have isolated and cloned two more members of this family, IRS-3 and IRS-4 (4Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

All four members have a similar architecture, consisting of a NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain followed by a phosphotyrosine binding domain and COOH-terminal portion with tyrosine phosphorylation sites in short motifs that can bind to specific SH2 domains. We discovered IRS-4 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells as a 160-kDa protein that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin (5Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21403-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Other than cloning, there has been no characterization of IRS-4 and comparison of its properties with the other IRSs. The present study describes its subcellular location, association with SH2 domain proteins, and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to other growth factors in HEK cells. Antibodies against Grb2 (SC255), SHP-2 (SC280), and phospholipase Cγ (SC426) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antiserum against the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase (06-195) and antibodies against IRS-2 (06-506) were from Upstate Biotechnology. An antiserum against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of IRS-2, which was kindly provided by Dr. Jacalyn Pierce, National Institutes of Health, was also used for some initial experiments. The preparations of affinity-purified antibodies against Tyr(P) and the carboxyl terminus of IRS-1 were those described previously (6Lamphere L. Lienhard G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2196-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An antiserum against a truncated form of human SHP-2 lacking the SH2 domains (7Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.-T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem,. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the generous gift of Dr. Zhizhuang Zhao, University of Washington; it was used throughout for immunoblotting, whereas the Santa Cruz antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Two types of rabbit antibodies were generated against IRS-4. One was raised against the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of human IRS-4, coupled to hemocyanin via a cysteine at the amino terminus of the synthetic peptide. The antibodies were affinity-purified on the immobilized peptide as described by Lamphere and Lienhard (6Lamphere L. Lienhard G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2196-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This preparation is referred to as anti-IRS-4C. The other antibodies were raised against a GST fusion protein with amino acids 994–1197 of mouse IRS-4. This region of the mouse IRS-4 genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer with an appended BamHI restriction site and a 3′ primer with a XbaI restriction site. The product was ligated into the BamHI/XbaI sites of the pGEX-5X-3 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain HB101 and then purified according to the method described by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The antibodies against the GST fusion protein were affinity-purified from the serum by adsorption of the serum with immobilized GST followed by chromatography on the immobilized GST fusion protein, as described by Keller et al.

This preparation is referred to as anti-IRS-4GST. Both types of antibodies immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted IRS-4 from lysates of HEK cells. Both types of antibodies are against regions of IRS-4 that show little or no homology with IRS-1 or IRS-2 (5Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

HEK cells were cultured as described previously (9Kuhne M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and used upon reaching confluence. Before use cells were put into serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. Unless stated otherwise, insulin treatment was with 1 μminsulin for 10 min. All experiments with HEK cells, except for those in Fig. 5, were performed with a line of HEK cells provided by Dr. Zhizhuang Zhao at the University of Washington. Those in Fig. 5 were performed with a line provided by Dr. Derek LeRoith at the National Institutes of Health. This latter line showed slightly greater insulin stimulation of IRS-4 tyrosine phosphorylation, and its content of insulin and IGF-I receptors has previously been determined (10Beitner-Johnson D.

In this latter set of experiments, 60-mm plates of cells in medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were treated for 10 min with various concentrations of porcine insulin, human IGF-I (Boehringer Mannheim), human IL-4 (R&D Systems), or human EGF (Upstate Biotechnology). The medium was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in 1.5 ml of SDS sample buffer with 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm EP475, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The SDS samples were held at 100 °C for 4 min, and the DNA in them sheared by passage through a syringe needle. Plates (10-cm) of untreated or insulin-treated HEK cells were washed with ice-cold 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and scraped into 2 ml of homogenization buffer (40 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4, with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate) and protease inhibitors (2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm EP475, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin)). The cell suspension was lysed by passage 8 times through a Balch homogenizer with a clearance of 0.011 inch (11Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The homogenates were diluted to 6 ml with homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 1 h to yield the cytosol and a pellet of organelles. The latter was resuspended in 6 ml of homogenization buffer containing 1% C12E9. The resuspended material was centrifuged at 140,000 × gfor 1 h, to yield solubilized membranes and a pellet. The pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer. Plates (10-cm) of untreated or insulin-treated HEK cells were lysed in 6 ml of homogenization buffer containing 1% C12E9. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 1 h. Aliquots of the cleared lysates (0.8 ml containing about 1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of antibodies against IRS-4, SHP-2, Grb2, or irrelevant IgG, or with 5 μl of antiserum against PI 3-kinase at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes were then collected on 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. Tyr(P) proteins were isolated by incubation of 0.8 ml of the cleared lysate with 20 μl of the monoclonal antibody against Tyr(P) 4G10 linked to agarose (Upstate Biotechnology). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) for 2.5 h at 400 mA in 25 mmTris, 190 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 0.005% SDS. Tyr(P) immunoblots were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), and then treated with anti-Tyr(P) at 4 μg/ml in TBS containing 0.2% albumin followed by the secondary antibody in the same buffer. Immunoblots with the other antibodies were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, and then treated with antibodies against IRS-4 at 4 μg/ml or against Grb2 or phospholipase Cγ at 0.5 μg/ml, or antisera against PI 3-kinase or SHP-2 at 1/1000 dilution in 1% milk in TBS and then with the secondary antibody in the same buffer. Membranes were washed with 0.3% Tween 20 in TBS. Blots were developed with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), followed by chemiluminescence detection (Pierce reagent). Immunofluorescence was carried out with subconfluent HEK cells grown on glass coverslips according to the method described previously (12Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this method cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with saponin, and treated first with 5 μg/ml anti-IRS-4GST or, as a control, irrelevant rabbit immunoglobulin, and then with goat antibodies against rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to fluorescein, as well as the DNA stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Anti-IRS-4GST, rather than anti-IRS-4C, was used for both immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy (see below) because it was the more specific reagent. On an immunoblot of a total HEK cell lysate anti-IRS-4GST gave only a single band at 160 kDa, whereas anti-IRS-4C gave both this band and several bands of smaller sizes. Plates (10 cm) of basal and insulin-treated HEK cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h. The cells were washed with this buffer and scraped into 1% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer. Ultrathin cryosectioning and immunogold labeling were carried out as described previously (13Heijnen H.F.G. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Four different labeling experiments were performed with both untreated and insulin-treated cells, and approximately 500 gold particles were assigned to various organelles and counted with a section from each labeling experiment. The percentages of gold particles in the various locations from the four countings agreed with each other within ±3% (S.E.). Labeling associated with the plasma membranes, intracellular vesicles (mainly near the cell surface), and the cytoplasm was observed. In addition, some labeling of the mitochondria and nuclei, which amounted to 15 and 21% of the total, respectively, was found. However, the latter was probably nonspecific, since labeling of human HeLa cells with anti-IRS-4C gave about the same density of gold particles over the mitochondria and nuclei even though HeLa cells had no IRS-4 as assessed by immunoblotting. By contrast, the HeLa cells showed a lower density of labeling over the cytosol and virtually none over the plasma membrane. Consequently, in calculating the percentages of IRS-4 labeling of the plasma membranes, vesicles, and cytosol, we have not included the gold particles over the mitochondria and nuclei. A human RNA master blot containing mRNA samples from 50 human tissues (7770-1) and a human multiple tissue Northern blot (7760-1) were purchased fromCLONTECH. Untreated and insulin-treated HEK cells were fractionated into cytosol and total organelles, and the latter fraction was treated with the nonionic detergent C12E9 to yield solubilized membranes and a pellet that probably consists largely of the cytoskeleton and nuclei. These fractions were immunoblotted for IRS-4, Tyr(P), IRS-1, IRS-2, and PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1). Approximately 50% of the IRS-4 was in the membranes with the remainder equally divided between the cytosol and the pellet. In contrast, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were primarily located in the cytosol. PI 3-kinase was mainly in the cytosol and the membranes. Insulin treatment did not significantly change the distribution of any of the proteins. The predominant Tyr(P)-containing protein in the fractions had the same mobility as IRS-4 (Fig. 1, Tyr(P) blot and data not shown). Several types of experiments lead to the conclusion that this Tyr(P) protein is almost entirely IRS-4. First, immunoprecipitation of approximately 75% of the IRS-4 from C12E9 lysates of basal and insulin-treated HEK cells depleted approximately the same proportion of the Tyr(P) signal (see Fig. 4 A, blots for IRS-4 and Tyr(P),lanes 1–9). Second, immunoprecipitation of approximately 80% of the IRS-1 and IRS-2 from lysates of untreated and insulin-treated HEK cells did not remove a detectable portion of this Tyr(P) protein; moreover, the IRS-1 and IRS-2 isolated by immunoprecipitation from the lysates showed no Tyr(P) upon immunoblotting (Ref. 9Kuhne M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and data not shown). Thus, a significant portion of this Tyr(P) protein is not one of these other two IRSs, which are of approximately the same size. The finding that IRS-1 and IRS-2 were primarily cytosolic, whereas the Tyr(P) protein was primarily in the membranes and pellet (Fig. 1), is further evidence for this conclusion. IRS-4 in untreated cells exhibited significant Tyr(P) content, which increased approximately 3-fold overall in response to insulin (Fig. 1, Tyr(P) blot, total). This increase occurred mainly in the IRS-4 that fractionated with the membranes and pellet; IRS-4 in the cytosol showed little or no increase in Tyr(P) content. Further information about the subcellular distribution of IRS-4 was obtained by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Immunofluorescence showed distinct staining at the boundary of the cell, weaker diffuse staining in the interior, and little or no staining of the nucleus (Fig. 2). Thus, a significant portion of the membrane-bound IRS-4 appeared to be at the plasma membrane. Insulin treatment did not alter the distribution of IRS-4. These results were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Considerable labeling at the inner surface of the plasma membrane was observed (Fig. 3). The proportions of the IRS-4 at the plasma membrane, on the surface of vesicles, and in the cytosol of untreated and insulin-treated HEK cells were estimated by counting gold particles and found to be 39, 16, and 45%, respectively, for cells in both states (see “Experimental Procedures”). This distribution agrees reasonably well with that found by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 1).Figure 3Subcellular localization of IRS-4 in HEK cells by immunoelectron microscopy. Ultrathin cryosections of HEK cells were labeled with anti-IRS-4GST followed by protein A 10-nm gold particles.

Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21403-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether these associations occurred, we immunoprecipitated IRS-4 from C12E9 lysates of untreated and insulin-treated HEK cells and then immunoblotted for PI 3-kinase, SHP-2, Grb2, and phospholipase Cγ, as well as for IRS-4 and Tyr(P) (Fig. 4 A). For comparison, the Tyr(P) proteins were also immunoprecipitated and analyzed in the same way. Immunoprecipitation with irrelevant rabbit IgG served as the negative control (Fig. 4 A). PI 3-kinase was associated with IRS-4 in lysates from both untreated and insulin-treated cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8 and 9); Grb2 was associated with IRS-4 but only in lysates from insulin-treated cells. There was no detectable association of SHP-2 or phospholipase Cγ with IRS-4. The Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates showed the same pattern of associations as IRS-4 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 12 and 13). This outcome is consistent with the observation that IRS-4 is the predominant Tyr(P) protein in HEK cells (see Ref. 9Kuhne M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and above). As expected, the immunoprecipitates with the irrelevant IgG showed none of the proteins (lanes 16 and 17). To confirm the associations found by immunoprecipitation of IRS-4, we immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase, Grb2, and SHP-2 and then immunoblotted the immunoprecipitates for IRS-4, as well as PI 3-kinase, Grb2, and SHP-2 (Fig. 4 B). Under the conditions used, 75% or more of the PI 3-kinase, Grb2, and SHP-2 was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4 B, compare Unb with Total). In agreement with the results from the IRS-4 immunoprecipitation, IRS-4 was found associated with PI 3-kinase and Grb2, but there was little or no association with SHP-2 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 8 and 9, 12 and 13, and 16 and 17, respectively). Approximately the same amount of IRS-4 was associated with PI 3-kinase in the lysates of untreated and insulin-treated cells (lanes 8 and 9), whereas more IRS-4 was associated with Grb2 in the lysate from insulin-treated cells than that from untreated cells (lanes 12 and 13). Finally, some Grb2 was present in the PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitates (lanes 8 and 9), and some PI 3-kinase was present in the Grb2 immunoprecipitates (lanes 12 and 13); in both cases more was present in the immunoprecipitates from the lysate of insulin-treated than untreated cells. Most likely the co-precipitations of Grb2 and PI 3-kinase are due to their simultaneous association with IRS-4 rather than to direct binding of Grb2 to PI 3-kinase. A number of growth factors besides insulin, including IGF-I and IL-4 but not EGF, elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (3Myers M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We examined whether the same was true for IRS-4. In order to allow a direct comparison of IGF-I and insulin, these experiments were performed with a HEK line that was reported to contain about the same number of IGF-I and insulin receptors per cell (approximately 10,000 of each) (10Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 indicates that IGF-I and insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4 by about 4-fold at maximal concentrations, and that the half-maximal effect of each occurred at about 1 nm. Since there is no significant binding of insulin to the IGF-I receptor or of IGF-I to the insulin receptor at concentrations less than 10 nm (14Kjeldsen T. Andersen A.S. Wiberg F.C. Rasmussen J.S. Schaffer L. Balschmidt P. Moller K.B. Moller N.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the two receptors are approximately equally active in tyrosine-phosphorylating IRS-4. The data in Fig. 5 also provide another demonstration that IRS-4 is the predominant Tyr(P) protein elicited by insulin and IGF-I in HEK cells. Since Fig. 5 presents Tyr(P) immunoblots of whole cell lysates, it was remotely possible that the 160-kDa protein, which is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IGF-I, was not IRS-4. However, we have demonstrated by immunoprecipitation that the 160-kDa Tyr(P) elicited by IGF-I as well as by insulin in this experiment was IRS-4. The SDS lysates of the untreated cells and cells treated with 10 nmIGF-I or insulin were made 0.3% in SDS and 1.5% in C12E9, and the IRS-4 was then immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-4C. For all the samples approximately 75% of the IRS-4 and the same proportion of the 160-kDa Tyr(P) protein were immunoprecipitated, as assessed by immunoblotting the total lysates, the lysates after immunoprecipitation, and the immunoprecipitates with anti-IRS-4C and anti-Tyr(P) (data not shown). Fig. 5 also shows that neither IL-4 nor EGF at 10 nmconcentration for 10 min caused detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4. Previous studies have shown that at this concentration and for this time period IL-4 treatment of HEK cells activates the transcription factor Stat6 (15Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and EGF treatment activates the kinase ERK-1 (16Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These studies thus indicate that HEK cells contain functional IL-4 and EGF receptors. However, it is uncertain whether the amounts of these receptors would be sufficient to cause detectable enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4. On the basis of Tyr(P) blotting, there appeared to be more insulin and IGF-I receptors than IL-4 and EGF receptors in the HEK cells. The tyrosine-phosphorylated β subunits of the activated insulin and IGF-I receptors, which migrate at about 100 kDa, were very evident upon longer exposures of the Tyr(P) blot in Fig. 5. However, neither the activated tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of the JAK1 and JAK3 kinases, which are elicited by and complexed with the activated IL-4 receptor and migrate at about 130 kDa (17Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.Q. Blake T.B. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. O'Shea J.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 18Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Lie E.T. Ihle J.N.

Williford J. Wells A. Endocrinology. 1996; 136: 431-439Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were evident (data not shown). As an approach to the human tissue distribution of IRS-4, we attempted to determine the expression of its mRNA. A significant amount of mRNA was not detected in any tissue, and because of this outcome, only a brief description of these experiments will be presented. First, a human mRNA Dot Blot containing mRNA from 50 different human tissues including seven major fetal tissues (100–500 ng/spot) was probed with single-stranded digoxigenin-labeled cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 104–369 (5Lavan B.E.

No significant signal was given by any tissue, even though a positive control of 100 ng of HEK mRNA gave a strong signal. The human Dot Blot was reprobed with a32P-labeled riboprobe corresponding to nucleotides 1428–1896 (5Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this case, all the human tissues gave a very weak signal, whereas the HEK mRNA gave an intense signal. Second, a Northern blot containing mRNAs from eight major adult tissues (2 μg/lane) was probed with the digoxigenin-labeled probe and then with the32P-riboprobe. No mRNA was detected with the digoxigenin-labeled probe. The riboprobe yielded some faint bands of sizes less than that of the IRS-4 mRNA in HEK cells (see below) after 4 days of exposure of the autoradiogram. In contrast, a Northern blot of the same amount (2 μg) of HEK mRNA probed at the same time with the same preparations of each probe yielded two strong bands, at 6 kilobases and greater than 9.5 kilobases (reported in Ref. 5Lavan B.E.

Our results indicate that in HEK cells IRS-4 is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein elicited by the activated insulin and IGF-I receptors. Although the data does not demonstrate direct phosphorylation by the activated receptors, this is almost certainly the case. IRS-4 has a phosphotyrosine binding domain that is highly homologous to the one in IRS-1 that binds to these receptors and accounts in part for its direct phosphorylation (5Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R.

Despite the fact that HEK cells contain IRS-1 and IRS-2 as well as IRS-4, the former showed no tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. We have previously estimated that HEK cells have about 25 times as much IRS-4 as IRS-1 (9Kuhne M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); and from the relative intensities of the IRS-4 and IRS-2 immunoblots (see Fig. 1), it seems likely that there is also a large excess of IRS-4 over IRS-2. In addition, from the nanogra"
https://openalex.org/W2037279230,"Oxidative stress in T cells induces signaling events similar to those initiated by T cell antigen receptor engagement, including tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the critical protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. Distal signaling events such as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and downstream transcription factors are also initiated by oxidative stimuli. In this study P116, a ZAP-70-negative Jurkat T cell line, was used to investigate the role of ZAP-70 in mediating activation of Erk in response to H2O2. Consistent with the hypothesis that ZAP-70 is required for activation of Erk in response to an oxidative stimulus, Erk1 and Erk2 could be rapidly activated in Jurkat cells but not in P116 cells upon addition of H2O2. P116 cells became competent for H2O2-induced Erk activation upon stable transfection with wild-type ZAP-70. An in vivo ZAP-70 substrate, SLP-76, implicated in Erk activation, also became rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in Jurkat cells, but not in P116 cells, upon treatment with H2O2. Surprisingly, although ZAP-70 was required for H2O2-mediated Erk activation, Erk activation in response to T cell antigen receptor engagement did not require ZAP-70. In addition to demonstrating a requirement for ZAP-70 in H2O2-stimulated Erk activation, these results provide the first evidence for the existence of a ZAP-70-independent pathway for Erk activation in T cells.

Naı̈ve, mature T lymphocytes undergo proliferation and acquisition of effector function when they encounter antigen on the surface of specialized antigen-presenting cells that also express required co-stimulatory surface proteins. Our understanding of the molecular signaling pathways that are initiated by these stimulatory events has advanced considerably over the past decade, largely as a result of studies in transformed T cell lines in which T cell antigen receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; ITAM, immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif; GAP, GTPase activating protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; ITAM, immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif; GAP, GTPase activating protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. engagement has been mimicked by agents such as lectins and anti-TCR antibodies, which cause aggregation of the TCR (1Wange R.L.

Oxidants such as H2O2, pervanadate, and ultraviolet light have been found to mimic the intracellular signals initiated by TCR aggregation and have also been used to study this signaling pathway (4Schieven G.L. Ledbetter J.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The earliest detectable event upon TCR engagement is the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of substrates involved in downstream signaling events. These include TCRζ and the γ, δ, and ε chains of CD3, ZAP-70, Itk, phospholipase Cγ1, p95Vav, SLP-76, c-Cbl, p36Lat as well as others (1Wange R.L. Samelson L.E.

The accumulation of these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is the result of a shift in the net balance of competing protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities and results in part from the activation of several PTKs, including members of the Src, Syk/ZAP-70, and Btk/Itk families of PTKs (1Wange R.L.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Three PTKs in particular, Fyn, Lck, and ZAP-70, have been extensively studied, and their involvement in TCR signaling has been demonstrated by a number of different approaches (3Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The cascade of early TCR-proximal signaling events is initiated by the phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) present within the CD3 and TCRζ chains. This event requires the activity of a src-family PTK (5Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar,6van Oers N.S.

Phosphorylated ITAMs act as high affinity binding sites for certain SH2 domain-containing proteins, including ZAP-70, which binds to ITAMs via its two SH2 domains (5Iwashima M.

Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, biochemical analyses have identified a number of proteins that can bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP-70, including c-cbl, p95Vav, p59fyn, p56lck, SHP-1, c-abl, and Ras-GAP (1Wange R.L.

These early TCR-proximal signaling events lead to the activation of several other signaling molecules, including phospholipase Cγ1, protein kinase C, and the low molecular weight G protein Ras (2Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Together, these signals combine to activate multiple transcription factors that contribute toward the production of the essential autocrine growth factor interleukin 2. Activated, GTP-bound Ras contributes to this process by activating the Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/Erk signaling pathway, which is required for the production and activation of the critical transcription factor AP-1 (2Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The importance of the signaling pathway between the TCR and Ras is underscored by the discovery that anergy is the result of a block in this pathway (18Li W. Whaley C.D. Mondino A. Mueller D.L. Science. 1996; 271: 1272-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 19Fields P.E. Gajewski T.F. Fitch F.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1276-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). How the activation of the TCR-proximal protein-tyrosine kinases causes activation of the Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/Erk pathway remains an open question, even though their importance in this pathway was established by studies demonstrating that PTK inhibitors could block TCR-initiated activation of this pathway (20Izquierdo M. Downward J. Graves J.D. Cantrell D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A role for ZAP-70 has also been suggested on the basis of studies in which overexpression of dominant-negative ZAP-70 in Jurkat T cells could block Erk activation and activation of the interleukin 2 promoter in response to TCR cross-linking (10Qian D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). SLP-76, which is an in vivo substrate of ZAP-70 (14Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have reexamined the importance of ZAP-70 in regulating Erk activity in T cells in response to two different stimuli: 1) TCR cross-linking with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, OKT3 and 2) an oxidative stimulus, hydrogen peroxide. Using the ZAP-70-negative Jurkat T cell line, P116, we find that ZAP-70 is required for the activation of Erk1 and 2 in response to H2O2 stimulation. Interestingly, we also find a ZAP-70-independent pathway for the activation of Erk 1 and 2 in P116 cells in response to TCR cross-linking, which is also independent of SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation. The implications of the presence of two pathways for the activation of Erk1 and 2 with differing requirements for ZAP-70 is discussed. E6 Jurkat T cells, the ZAP-70-negative Jurkat cell mutant, P116, and all stably transfected cell lines derived thereof were maintained as described (9Wange R.L. Isakov N. Burke Jr., T.R. Otaka A.

The characteristics of the P116 cells have been described (24Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In brief, they were derived from E6 Jurkat by mutagenesis and selection for inability to flux calcium in response to pervanadate. They lack ZAP-70 protein, and normal signaling capacity is restored by transfection with wild-type ZAP-70. P116 cells express normal levels of other signaling proteins, such as TCR/CD3 chains, Lck, Fyn-T, phospholipase Cγ1, SLP-76, and Erk 1 and 2 (24Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The OKT3 monoclonal antibody to human CD3ε and the polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for ZAP-70 have been described (9Wange R.L. Isakov N. Burke Jr., T.R. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Watts J.D.

The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, and a sheep antiserum against human SLP-76 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Erk2 polyclonal antiserum used for immunoprecipitation was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) monoclonal antibody to Erk2 was used to blot for total Erk2 protein. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific only for Erk phosphorylated at both Thr-183 and the Tyr-185 and therefore specific for activated Erk was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The cDNA encoding full-length, wild-type ZAP-70 fused with a C-terminal 9-amino acid myc epitopic tag was subcloned as a BamHI fragment from the previously described pSXSRα-ZAPmycplasmid (12Wange R.L.

The pBJ-ZAPKDmyc vector, which expresses a kinase-dead, dominant-negative form of ZAP-70, was similarly constructed from ZAP-70 cDNA carrying a K369R mutation, which was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). P116 transfectants stably expressing wild-type or kinase-dead ZAP-70 were prepared as described previously (25Eischen C.M. Williams B.L. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Lynch D.H. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1135-1139PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were serum-starved for 16 h before being harvested and washed in 4 °C RPMI using minimal manipulation of the cells, since it had been noted that extensive manipulation of the cells resulted in high basal Erk activity. The cells were resuspended to 5 × 107 cells/ml in 4 °C RPMI and maintained on ice until stimulated. After equilibration to 37 °C for 5–10 min, the cells were stimulated by the addition of either OKT3 (1:100 of ascites), H2O2 (10 mm, unless otherwise indicated), or 50 ng/ml PMA. The duration of stimulation was 3 min unless otherwise indicated. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 5 volumes of 4 °C lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). After a 30-min incubation on ice, post-nuclear lysates were prepared by a 10-min centrifugation at 21,000 × g at 4 °C. The lysates were then either directly analyzed by immunoblotting or subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting or kinase assay. Immunoprecipitates that were to be analyzed by immunoblotting were washed three times with lysis buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. Those immunoprecipitates that were to be subjected to immune complex kinase assays were washed two times each sequentially with lysis buffer, LiCl wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitated Erk was subjected to an immune complex kinase assay essentially as described previously (26Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Samples to be analyzed by electrophoresis were prepared in NuPAGE sample buffer by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed on NuPAGE 4–12% gradient gels either in MOPS or MES sample buffers and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). Immunoblots were developed by the ECL system of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech according to manufacturer's instructions. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposure of BMR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). H2O2 has been shown previously to cause accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Jurkat T cells (27Schieven G.L. Mittler R.S. Nadler S.G. Kirihara J.M. Bolen J.B. Kanner S.B. Ledbetter J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20718-20726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Whisler R.L. Goyette M.A. Grants I.S. Newhouse Y.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To test the role of ZAP-70 in this process, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in cell lysates from ZAP-70-negative and ZAP-70-replete Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1). Hydrogen peroxide within the concentration range of 1–10 mm did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates in the P116 cells. Normal Jurkat cells, on the other hand, showed a rapid accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in response to incubation with H2O2. The effect of H2O2 was concentration-dependent, and within the concentration range tested (1–10 mm), had a greater effect on tyrosine phosphorylation than that seen with anti-CD3 cross-linking, causing robust phosphorylation of proteins that were only minimally phosphorylated by anti-CD3. OKT3 stimulation of the P116 cells caused only weak tyrosine phosphorylation, with only proteins of 42, 85, and 150 kDa responding. Of note is the absence in both OKT3 and H2O2-stimulated P116 cells of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 36- and 76-kDa proteins that are predominant substrates in normal Jurkat cells and which are likely to correspond to the Grb2-associated p36 protein and SLP-76. These results are consistent with the severe early signaling defect that has been reported for P116 cells (24Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the same experiment, the requirement for ZAP-70 in mediating Erk activation in response to TCR cross-linking or H2O2 was also assessed, using both an immune complex kinase assay and immunoblotting for doubly phosphorylated, active Erk in whole-cell lysates. The presence of equal amounts or Erk2 in the immunoprecipitations and of Erk 1 and 2 in the Jurkat and P116 whole-cell lysates was confirmed by immunoblotting for these proteins (not shown). Erk2 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and was used in an in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate. Stimulation of normal Jurkat cells with either anti-CD3 or H2O2 (1–10 mm) gave an apparent maximal activation of Erk2 (Fig. 2 A). H2O2 was effective in activating Erk2 down to a concentration of 10 μm (the lowest concentration tested) and demonstrated a graded concentration-response relationship between 10 μm and 1 mm (not shown). Activated Erk1 and Erk2 could also be detected in immunoblots of lysates from Jurkat T cells stimulated with H2O2 or OKT3, confirming the results of the kinase assay (Fig. 2 B). However, in the P116 cells, the effect of H2O2 on Erk activation was undetectable by anti-active Erk immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates and only weakly detectable in the immune complex kinase assay. Unexpectedly, although the P116 cells were unable to activate Erk in response to H2O2, they remained capable of activating Erk in response to CD3 cross-linking. Please note that the apparent slower migration of Erk1 and 2 isolated from Jurkat cells as compared with P116 was not a consistent observation of these studies (see Fig. 4). The presence of ZAP-70 in Jurkat cells and its absence in P116 cells was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of ZAP-70 followed by ZAP-70 immunoblotting (Fig. 2 C). A replicate membrane was blotted for phosphotyrosine and showed that both anti-CD3 and H2O2 caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (Fig. 2 D).Figure 4Expression of wild-type, but not K369R ZAP-70 in P116 T cells restores ability to activate Erk in response to H 2 O 2 . Jurkat, P116, P.WT18, and P.DK2 cells were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C as in Fig. 1. A, whole cell lysates (2 × 105 cell equivalents) were immunoblotted for ZAP-70 and activated Erk.B, ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated from 1 × 107 cell equivalents of the same lysates used in (A) and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. C, Jurkat, P116, and P.WT18 cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with the indicated stimuli, and then whole cell lysates (2 × 105 cell equivalents) were immunoblotted for activated Erk (upper band is Erk 1, and lower band is Erk 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having found a dependence upon ZAP-70 for stimulating Erk activation in response to H2O2, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of SLP-76, an in vivo substrate for ZAP-70 that has previously been implicated in Erk activation in response to TCR engagement. In Jurkat cells, anti-CD3 and H2O2caused a striking increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 3). The effect of H2O2 was concentration-dependent and robust. In addition to increased tyrosine phosphorylation, there was also an increase in the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with SLP-76. However, in the ZAP-70-negative P116 cells, neither anti-CD3 nor H2O2 had any effect on SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation or its association with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. If the failure of P116 cells to activate Erk in response to H2O2 is actually due to the absence of ZAP-70, then reconstitution of these cells with wild-type ZAP-70 should correct this loss of signaling capacity. To test this, we compared Erk activation in P116 cells to P116 cells that had been stably transfected with either myc-tagged, wild-type ZAP-70 or myc-tagged, kinase-dead ZAP-70 carrying a K369R mutation. Three independent clones expressing wild-type ZAP-70 (P.WT2, P.WT5, and P.WT18) and two independent clones expressing kinase-dead ZAP-70 (P.DK2 and P.DK33) were analyzed. The clones expressed varying amounts of ZAP-70, as detected by an anti-ZAP-70 immunoblot, and only the results from the clones expressing the highest levels of ZAP-70 are shown (Fig. 4 A). The P.WT18 clone had a similar level of ZAP-70 expression as that seen in Jurkat cells. Wild-type ZAP-70 restored the capacity of P116 cells to activate Erk1 and 2 in response to stimulation by H2O2 while having no apparent effect on OKT3-stimulated Erk activation in these cells. The relative amount of activated Erk detected in the different clones was directly correlated with the relative level of wild-type ZAP-70 expressed (not shown). It should be noted that the slower electrophoretic migration of ZAP-70 in the P.WT18 and P.DK2 clones was due to the myc tag (12Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18730-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As shown previously, stimulation of normal Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 or H2O2 caused rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (Fig. 4 B), which was correlated with the increased activation of Erk. Kinase-dead ZAP-70 did not support Erk activation in response to H2O2in the stably transfected P116 cells, indicating that the kinase activity of ZAP-70 is required for Erk activation in response to H2O2. Surprisingly, the expression of kinase-dead ZAP-70 in P116 cells blocked the ZAP-70-independent activation of Erk1 and 2 that was observed in response to CD3 cross-linking. The ability to block OKT3-mediated Erk activation in K369R-ZAP-70-transfected P116 cells was correlated with the relative expression level of the mutant ZAP-70 (not shown). The ZAP-70 expressed in the P.DK2 cells became strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking despite the absence of its own kinase activity and was only weakly phosphorylated in response to H2O2. In a similar experiment each of the clones was also stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA, which bypasses TCR-proximal events to activate Erk via the activating effects of protein kinase C on Ras (29Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 30Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cantrell D. J. Exp.

Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). This provides a measure of the intrinsic responsiveness of the distal portion of the Erk activation pathway and permits normalization of the responsiveness of Erk to the different stimuli. Erk was maximally stimulated in Jurkat cells by both OKT3 and H2O2, as compared with PMA stimulation (Fig. 4 C). Although the level of Erk activation achieved by OKT3 stimulation of P116 cells was less than was seen with the same stimulus in Jurkat cells, it appeared to be maximal as compared with PMA stimulation in these same cells. The P.WT18 cells, like the Jurkat cells but unlike P116 cells, exhibited maximal activation of Erk1 and 2 in response to H2O2, as compared with PMA stimulation in these cells. Both P.DK2 and P.DK33 exhibited strong activation of Erk1 and 2 in response to PMA, indicating that the distal signaling pathway is intact in these cells (not shown). The studies reported here were initiated to gain a better understanding of the mechanism whereby H2O2 can mimic TCR signaling. It had previously been demonstrated that oxidative stressors such as H2O2 and UV can cause the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, raise the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, and activate NF-κB and AP-1 in Jurkat T cells (27Schieven G.L. Mittler R.S. Nadler S.G. Kirihara J.M. Bolen J.B. Kanner S.B. Ledbetter J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20718-20726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 160-169PubMed Google Scholar). ZAP-70 was found to be among the proteins that became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to UV or H2O2 treatment of Jurkat T cells, resulting in activation of its autocatalytic activity (27Schieven G.L. Mittler R.S. Nadler S.G. Kirihara J.M. Bolen J.B. Kanner S.B. Ledbetter J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20718-20726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These former studies did not, however, examine the role of ZAP-70 in signaling the presence of these agents to downstream signaling events. In this study we demonstrate that ZAP-70 is a key mediator of the signals generated in T cells by oxidative stress. ZAP-70-negative Jurkat T cells showed no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins nor Erk activation in response to H2O2 but could be made competent for H2O2-induced Erk activation by stable transfection with wild-type ZAP-70 cDNA. A cDNA encoding a kinase-dead mutant of ZAP-70 could not restore competence, indicating a requirement for ZAP-70 kinase activity in mediating Erk activation. How ZAP-70 leads to Erk activation in response to H2O2 (or CD3 cross-linking) remains unclear. The principal pathway leading to Erk activation involves activation of Ras, which can be activated either by inhibiting the activity of Ras-specific GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) or by promoting the binding of GTP to Ras by the action of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Although there is evidence that TCR cross-linking results in decreased Ras-GAP activity, the mechanism of this response remains unknown (20Izquierdo M. Downward J. Graves J.D. Cantrell D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that TCR engagement can stimulate the recruitment of Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as SOS to the plasma membrane as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of plasma membrane-associated proteins. As in other cell types, this process appears to involve the adapter protein Grb2, which uses its N-terminal SH3 domain to bind to a proline-rich region of SOS and its SH2 domain to bind tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane proteins. Grb2 can directly bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR ITAMs in vitro (35Osman N. Lucas S.C. Turner H. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Osman N. Turner H. Lucas S. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Eur. J.

Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 401-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This 36-kDa protein has recently been shown to be a specific substrate for ZAP-70 in vitro,2 and it may be that the requirement for ZAP-70 in H2O2-stimulated Erk activation may be for tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein. Alternatively, a second substrate for ZAP-70, SLP-76, has also been suggested to be involved in TCR-stimulated Erk activation (14Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar), and ZAP-70 may be required to phosphorylate SLP-76 in order to get Erk activation in response to H2O2. That SLP-76 may have to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in order to activate Erk is suggested by the fact that overexpression of a truncation mutant of SLP-76, which lacks the prominent sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, fails to augment Erk activation in response to TCR stimulation. This is in contrast to full-length SLP-76, which activates Erk (23Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar). We did observe SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat cells, but not in P116 cells, in response to either TCR cross-linking or incubation with H2O2 despite the presence of equivalent levels of SLP-76 in the two cell lines (not shown). This is consistent with SLP-76 being downstream of ZAP-70 in the pathway leading to Erk activation. However, SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation cannot be an absolute requirement for Erk activation in T cells, since Erk activation could occur in OKT3-stimulated P116 cells in the absence of detectable SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation. How SLP-76 then affects Erk activation remains to be established; however, like p36, it too is able to bind to Grb2. Unlike p36 though, this association is mediated by the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. Whether or not Grb2 can simultaneously engage SOS and SLP-76 remains controversial. In addition to the proline-rich SH3 domain acceptor site, the hematopoietic-specific SLP-76 has a C-terminal SH2 domain and a cluster of N-terminal tyrosines that become phosphorylated upon TCR engagement. SLP-76 thereby forms complexes with many signaling molecules, and activates Erk, NF-AT, and AP-1 when overexpressed in T cells (22Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It seems likely that some of these SLP-76-associated proteins may modulate the activity of proteins involved in Ras activation and that ZAP-70-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate some of these events. The ability of exogenous oxidants such as H2O2to usurp myriad signaling pathways in many different cell types indicates the existence of multiple regulatory molecules that can be controlled at least in part by oxidation-reduction mechanisms, suggesting that endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a role in normal signaling pathways. In fact, it has recently been shown that a number of cytokine and growth factor receptors, including the receptors for interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor α, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, generate reactive oxygen species as second messengers, which are required for the activation of key downstream signaling molecules such as NF-κB and phospholipase Cγ1 (39Meier B.

One mechanism of action of ROS is through the inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases by oxidizing a critical conserved cysteine residue within the active site (reviewed in Ref. 45Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a transient inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases is required in addition to activation of PTKs in order to increase the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of key signaling proteins above a threshold capable of propagating a stimulatory signal. Interestingly, it has been suggested for many years that T cell activation may also require the production of ROS on the basis that treatment of T cells with antioxidants renders them unresponsive to mitogenic stimuli (46Novogrodsky A.

In addition, acute exposure of T cells to H2O2 results in interleukin 2 production and increased proliferation (Ref. 49Los M. Droge W. Stricker K. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar and references therein). Taken together, the above observations lead us to speculate that ZAP-70 may normally be regulated, in part, by an upstream enzymatic activity that produces an ROS. To speculate further, it may be that it is the presence or strength of such an ROS signal that determines whether a given antigen-MHC TCR ligand gives rise to an agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist biochemical response (50Sloan-Lancaster J. Allen P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Perhaps activation of the TCR-proximal PTKs in the absence of ROS production and consequent protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition results in the partial phosphorylation pattern seen with partial agonists and antagonists. The ability of ZAP-70 to activate Erk in response to ROS may also be important at sites of inflammation, where activated neutrophils and monocytes generate large quantities of ROS (51Homan-Muller J.W. Weening R.S. Roos D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1975; 85: 198-207PubMed Google Scholar). This may provide a mechanism for these cells to regulate the proliferative capacity and activity of T cells present at inflammatory sites. The testing of these hypotheses and the identification of the enzyme(s) involved in ROS production is the subject of continuing investigation. The most unexpected finding of these studies was the discovery that TCR cross-linking in P116 cells can initiate a ZAP-70-independent activation of Erk1 and 2. Most current models for TCR-initiated Erk activation invoke ZAP-70 activation as part of this process, and indeed, overexpression of dominant-negative ZAP-70 in Jurkat T cells results in a block in their ability to activate Erk in response to TCR ligation (10Qian D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, these earlier studies may need to be reinterpreted in light of our finding that stable expression of kinase-dead ZAP-70 blocked the ZAP-70-independent activation of Erk in P116 cells. The ability of kinase-dead ZAP-70 to block OKT3-stimulated Erk activation in P116 cells is not due to an inhibitory effect on Syk activation, as there is no Syk present in P116 cells. The P116 cells were derived from the E6.1 Jurkat subclone and are not only ZAP-70-negative but are also negative for Syk protein and mRNA (24Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26533-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We are currently working to understand how Erk is activated in the absence of ZAP-70 in these cells and how it is that dominant-negative ZAP-70 is able to block a signaling pathway that does not involve ZAP-70 or Syk. In conclusion, we have found that two stimuli that are considered to mimic the intracellular signaling events initiated by TCR engagement give completely different responses in a ZAP-70-negative Jurkat T cell line. The oxidative stressor H2O2 demonstrates a requirement for ZAP-70 in mediating Erk activation, whereas OKT3 cross-linking of CD3 can activate Erk in the absence of ZAP-70. This is the first demonstration of a ZAP-70-independent pathway for Erk activation in T cells and adds to the complexity of the signaling pathways that can lead to Erk activation in response to TCR engagement. Further study will be required to determine whether or not this pathway is functionally relevant in normal TCR signaling. We thank Dr. R. Abraham for sharing the P116 cells with us and Drs. N-P. Weng, L. E. Samelson, N. Holbrook, and Y. Liu for critical review of the manuscript and helpful discussions."

Zinc finger transcription factors bind DNA through motifs that contain a zinc atom bound to 4 amino acids, either cysteine or histidine (1Falchuk K.H. Prog. Clin. Biol.

These factors share zinc finger domains at the carboxyl terminus and transactivation domains at the amino terminus. Expression is relatively tissue-restricted based upon Northern blot analysis and RNA in situ hybridization studies. For example, EKLF is found predominantly in erythroid cells of the bone marrow and spleen (4Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar); LKLF is found in the lung epithelium, hematopoeitic organs, and testis (3Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell.

These factors have DNA binding domains that bind the cognate CACCC motif or CACCC-like variants, including CACACCC (3Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell.

EKLF binds the CCACACCCT site in the mouse and human β-globin promoters (10Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A pSG5-EKLF expression vector transactivates a CACCC site-containing reporter in CV-1 cells 13-fold (10Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, LKLF can transactivate a human β-globin promoter (3Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). An emerging theme among the family of Krüppel-like transcription factors is their involvement in potentiating cell differentiation or quiescence. Targeted disruption of LKLF in mouse embryonic stem cells supports the notion that LKLF is critical in maintaining single positive T cells in a state of quiescence (11Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Expression of GKLF is high in growth-arrested fibroblasts and nearly absent in cells in an exponential phase of proliferation (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of GKLF leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The role of GKLF in regulation of cellular growth is further supported by cellular localization studies which indicate that GKLF mRNA is abundant in the middle to upper crypt region of the colonic mucosa, an area in which proliferating cells make a commitment to early differentiation (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Additionally, GKLF localizes to suprabasal cells in skin, tongue, and esophageal squamous epithelial cells (7Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Proliferating basal cells in these epithelia lose this capacity and begin to differentiate in the suprabasal layer where GKLF is expressed. The localization of the GKLF gene on chromosome 9q22 has led to the speculation that dysregulation of GKLF gene expression may play a role in the pathogenesis of squamous epithelium-derived neoplasms which have been shown to have abnormalities in this chromosomal region (12Ah-See K.W. Cooke T.G. Pickford I.R. Soutar D. Balmain A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1617-1621PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gailani M.R. Bale S.J. Leffell D.J. DiGiovanna J.J. Peck G.L. Poliak S. Drum M.A. Pastakia B.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1629-1634PubMed Google Scholar). While it has been demonstrated that EKLF and LKLF transactivate the β-globin promoter, gene targets for GKLF transactivation have yet to be identified. Given the localization of GKLF in the suprabasal esophageal squamous epithelium and the role of the Krüppel-like transcription factors in regulating cellular differentiation and quiescence, we postulated that genes expressed during the transition toward early differentiation may be transactivated by GKLF. Two such candidates are the Epstein-Barr virus ED-L2 (15Baer R. Bankier A.T. Biggin M.D. Farrell P. Gibson T.J. Hatfull G. Hudson G.S. Satchwell S.C. Seguin C. Tuffnell P.S. Barrell B.G.

EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the keratin 4 promoters. Previous work has shown that the ED-L2 promoter is active in esophageal squamous suprabasal cells of transgenic mice (17Wilson J.B. Weinberg W. Johnson R. Yupsa S. Levine A.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 1315-1327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18Nakagawa H. Wang T.C. Zukerberg L. Odze R. Togawa K. May G.W.H. Wilson J. Rustgi A.K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The ED-L2 promoter is basally regulated by a novel zinc-dependent nuclear protein that binds a CACCC-like motif (19Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester leads to enhanced activation of the ED-L2 promoter through the binding of an E-box by upstream stimulatory factor by USF and a zinc-dependent factor that interacts specifically with CACACCC (20Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Keratin 4 is also highly expressed in esophageal squamous suprabasal cells, and its expression is associated with the switch to differentiation that occurs as cells exit the proliferation zone (21Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4533) Google Scholar,22van Muigen G.N. Ruiter D.J. Franke W.W. Achtstatter T. Haasnoot W.H.

Sequence analysis of the keratin 4 promoter (GenBankTM accession number X97566) reveals a GTGTGGG or inverted CACACCC motif in the proximal 5′-untranslated region. We investigated whether ED-L2 and K4, expressed in suprabasal squamous epithelial cells of the esophagus, are transactivated by GKLF, thereby providing a basis for GKLF's role in vivo. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the zinc finger-encoding region of the transcription factor GKLF, yielding an 840-base pair (bp) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product. The oligonucleotide primer sequences are as follows: GKLF-S, 5′-AGTTGGACCCAGTATACATTCCGCCACAGCAGCCT-3′; GKLF-AS, 5′-TTAAAAGTGCCTCTTCATGTGTAAGGCAAGGTGGT-3′. Total RNA was extracted from lysates of subconfluent 293, TE-11, and 3T3 cells with a denaturing solution consisting of 4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% sarcosyl, 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), and 10% volume of 2m sodium acetate (pH 4.0). The cell lysate was mixed with a 5:1 ratio of water-saturated phenol and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (49:1), and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol, and RNA was dissolved in denaturing solution. It was then reprecipitated with ethanol, washed with 80% ethanol, and redissolved in water treated with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate. An aliquot of total RNA was poly(A)-selected (polyAT tract mRNA isolation system III; Promega Corp.). Total and poly(A)-selected RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Perkin-Elmer), with a 3′-sequence-specific primer, random primers, and oligo(dT) primers (Perkin-Elmer). Following a single cycle of reverse transcription at 42 °C for 15 min, the sample was subjected to 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) using GKLF-specific primers. The 840-bp PCR product was ligated into a TA cloning vector (Novagen), and the DNA sequence was confirmed as the zinc finger coding domain of human GKLF. A ZAP express (Stratagene) cDNA library was prepared from TE-11 cell RNA using previously described methods (23Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,24Jerpseth B. Greener A. Short J.M. Viola J. Kretz P.L. Strat. Mol. Biol. 1992; 5: 81-83Google Scholar). EcoRI and XhoI sites were used for directional insertion of the cDNA prepared from poly(A)-selected, reverse transcribed RNA. The TE-11 library contained 3 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml. 1 × 106 plaques were screened in the initial round. Plaques were oriented and lifted on to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were denatured, neutralized, and rinsed, followed by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The 840-bp fragment was radiolabeled (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech megaprime labeling kit) with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Filters were prehybridized for 2 h in a 2× PIPES, 40% formamide buffer containing herring sperm DNA (100 mg/liter) and 0.5% SDS, followed by hybridization in an identical solution containing the radiolabeled GKLF probe for 24 h at 42 °C. Filters were washed sequentially in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 20 min, 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 15 min, and 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Filters were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 72 h. Two subsequent rounds of screening under identical conditions were performed, yielding several positive clones.In vivo excision of the pBK-CMV phagemids containing cDNAs from positive plaques was performed using previously described methods (23Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Jerpseth B. Greener A. Short J.M. Viola J. Kretz P.L. Strat. Mol. Biol. 1992; 5: 81-83Google Scholar). Purified plasmid was obtained from individual colonies using an alkaline lysis plasmid preparation method (Qiagen). 30 plasmids derived from separate positive colonies were sequenced from the 3′- and 5′-ends of the insert cDNA, and sequence analysis was performed using GenBankTM. Approximately 50% of clones yielded sequences identical to the published sequence of human GKLF. One clone containing the apparent full-length sequence was selected and fully sequenced, confirming its identity with GKLF. The pBK-CMV plasmid containing the full-length GKLF cDNA was digested with BamHI to yield a 1.4-kb fragment containing the full-length open reading frame of GKLF. This fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1/His B (Invitrogen) in frame and 3′ to the HIS6 and Anti-Xpress epitope tag coding sequence. The GKLF expression construct is represented in the schematic shown in Fig. 1 A. The GKLF expression plasmid as well as pcDNA3.1/His B and pcDNA3.1/His-lacZ plasmids (Invitrogen) were purified by a modified alkaline lysis method (Qiagen). GKLF-nonexpressing 293 cells were transiently transfected with the different pcDNA3.1/His plasmids, and total RNA was harvested 24 h after transfection, using methods previously described (20Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. 20 μg of total RNA was resuspended in sample buffer consisting of 50% deionized formamide, 6.7% formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and heated at 60 °C for 10 min. Electrophoresis was performed at 20 V for 2 h followed by 40 V for 4 h with buffer consisting of 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The RNA was transferred onto a Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The 840-bp probe used for GKLF cloning was used for Northern blot analysis and was labeled using a random primed labeling method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To assess equivalent loading of RNA samples, equal amounts of 18 S and 28 S RNA were identified in each lane. Northern blot hybridization was carried out using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the conditions described above. For Western blot analysis, lysates from transfected 293 cells were prepared in a lysis buffer with protease inhibitors as described previously (25Nakagawa H. Zukerberg L. Togawa K. Meltzer S.J. Nishihara T. Rustgi A.K. Cancer. 1995; 76: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 100 μg of total protein from each sample was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the protein was transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.) at 10 V for 12 h at 4 °C. The membrane was treated with 5% milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h. The primary antibody (Anti-Xpress, Invitrogen) was used at a 1:4000 dilution, and the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was used at a 1:2500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected with a chemiluminescence system (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human esophageal squamous carcinoma TE-11, 3T3 fibroblast (ATCC), and human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines (ATCC) were cultured under standard conditions with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma). After PCR amplification with primers specific to the ED-L2 and K4 promoter sequences and confirmatory DNA sequencing of PCR products, fragments of the ED-L2 promoter and K4 promoter were agarose gel-purified and directionally ligated into the luciferase reporter gene promoterless vector pXP2 (26Nordeen S.K. Biol. Technol. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) to generate luciferase reporter constructs. The oligonucleotide sequences listed in Table I were used to generate promoter deletion constructs with PCR conditions previously described (20Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The resulting luciferase reporter constructs (ED-L2−144, ED-L2−114, K4−340, K4−140) represent regions of the ED-L2 and K4 promoters that contain the CACCC-like motif. In addition, previously generated mutant reporter constructs of ED-L2−144 were used in transient transfections (20Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA constructs were checked by restriction digestion for correct length, verified by DNA sequencing, and purified by an alkaline lysis method (Qiagen).Table ISequences of oligonucleotides from the Epstein-Barr virus ED-L2 and keratin 4 promoters used for PCR amplification and EMSAsOligonucleotideSequencePositionED-L2-AS5′-GAAGATCTCGAGAGTGAGGCACAGCTG-3′0ED-L2–144-S5′-CGGGATCCTAATCCCTCTCTCACA-3′−144ED-L2–114-S5′-CGGGATCCGCTAGCCCAAAACCTCCA-3′−114K4-AS5′-GAAGATCTGGCTGCAGAGAGCGAGCTG-3′ +59K4–340-S5′-GCGTCGACGTGATGGGGTGTCTTTTCT-3′−340K4–140-S5′-GCGTCGACTAGTGACATGCTCAACGGGT-3′−140ED-L2/GKLF w/t5′-TCTCACACCCAGA-3′ED-L2/GKLF mt5′-TCTACGTAGAAGA-3′K4/GKLF w/t5′-AGTGGGTGTGGGCA-3′K4/GKLF mt5′-ATACTTATGCTCCA-3′ Open table in a new tab Transient transfection of the ED-L2 and K4 constructs in 293 cells was carried out using a calcium phosphate precipitation technique (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.). 293 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/35-mm well and transfected 24 h later with combinations of 2 μg of the GKLF reporter construct, 2 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid, and 2 μg of pGreen Lantern-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), a reporter plasmid encoding a green fluorescent protein. The transfectant mixture consisted of a 250-μl solution of 125 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmKCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 6 mm glucose. In a subset of the transfection experiments, cells were examined under fluorescence microscopy (475-nm excitation peak, 490-nm emission peak) to assess green fluorescent protein production. The percentage of fluorescing cells was determined in each well and was found not to vary within a given transfection experiment, indicating that transfection efficiency was uniform. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (20Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed in triplicate, and results were calculated as the mean ± S.E. values for luciferase activity. Values were expressed as -fold increase compared with a base line established for each set of experiments and represented at least three independent transfection experiments. Following transient transfection of 293 cells with 2 μg of the GKLF expression construct, total cellular protein was harvested after 24 h for purification of the GKLF histidine-tagged fusion protein. Cells were mechanically detached from the plates and resuspended in a total of 4 ml of native binding buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mmNaCl, pH 7.8) with aprotinin (5 μg/ml) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml). Cells were lysed with two cycles of freezing-thawing, followed by passage through an 18-gauge needle four times. ProBond affinity resin columns (Invitrogen) were equilibrated for purification of the histidine-tagged protein according to the manufacturer's specifications. 293 cell lysate was added to the equilibrated affinity column in a volume of 4 ml of native binding buffer. The column was sealed at both ends and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. The column was then packed, and the supernatant was removed. Next, the column was washed twice in wash buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) with aprotinin (5 mg/ml) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (100 mg/ml). The recombinant GKLF fusion protein was eluted by adding 4 ml of elution buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 4.0) with aprotinin (5 μg/ml) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml) and incubating at 4 °C for 15 min with gentle agitation. The final elution volume of 4.0 ml was concentrated to 1.0 ml by vacuum centrifugation at 4 °C. Separation of the affinity column-purified 65- and 34-kDa GKLF fusion proteins was accomplished using gel filtration chromatography (27Rosenberg I.M. Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques. Birkhauser, Boston1996: 265-278Crossref Google Scholar). Bio-Gel P-60 (Bio-Rad) was hydrated for 24 h in elution buffer, suspended in a 2-fold excess of buffer, and degassed for 15 min. A 50% slurry of gel was then allowed to settle in a 7.5-ml column. A 200-μl solution of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) and ovalbumin (40 kDa) in elution buffer (1 mg/ml) was passed through the column to calibrate and confirm the efficiency of size separation of these two proteins. After clearing the column with 5 ml of elution buffer, 200 μl of recombinant GKLF solution was passed over the column and twenty 200-μl fractions were collected. Purified protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric method (Bio-Rad protein assay). Qualitative purity of protein was assessed by a silver stain method (Bio-Rad) after 5 μg of total protein from each fraction was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 1-71Google Scholar). Purified recombinant GKLF protein was prepared as described above for use in EMSAs, except the buffers were supplemented with a mixture of 0.5 μg/ml protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim). 5 pmol of a double-stranded oligonucleotide, synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel electrophoresis, was radiolabeled by the Klenow fill-in reaction in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dGTP, 33 μmdTTP, 0.33 μm [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products), and 1 unit of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The oligonucleotide (sense) sequences derived from the ED-L2 and K4 promoters are shown in Table I with the putative GKLF binding motif in boldface type. The 5′-end of the ED-L2 sense oligonucleotide corresponds to ED-L2 promoter position −135, and that of the K4 oligonucleotide corresponds to K4 promoter position −281. At the 5′-end of each oligonucleotide, a BamHI restriction site was added to facilitate Klenow fill-in labeling. EMSAs were carried out by incubating 10 μg of recombinant GKLF fusion protein with 5 fmol of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 10 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.25× Tris borate gel and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-AR) at −80 °C for 12 h. For competition experiments, the recombinant protein was preincubated with 100-fold excess unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide before the addition of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe. Our previous studies suggest that tissue-restricted zinc-dependent nuclear factors are important in regulating gene expression in the esophageal squamous epithelium (19Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Epstein-Barr virus ED-L2 promoter is highly active in cells derived from this tissue compartment, as a result of transactivation by a zinc-dependent factor designated keratinocyte-specific factor (19Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and a phorbol ester-induced zinc-dependent factor (20Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The recent description of GKLF led us to test the hypothesis that this factor may play a prominent role in the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression in the esophageal squamous epithelium. Prior studies demonstrated that GKLF is expressed in the normal adult murine squamous epithelium (7Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We initially determined whether TE-11 cells expressed GKLF using RT-PCR. In addition, we tested whether 293 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts express GKLF. As previous studies have shown, 3T3 fibroblasts express GKLF as determined by RT-PCR designed to yield an 840-base pair PCR product encompassing the zinc finger domain of GKLF (7Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Concurrent RT-PCR reactions with RNA template from TE-11 and 293 cells yielded positive and negative results, respectively (data not shown). Based on these results, we chose to pursue a cloning strategy designed to obtain the full-length human cDNA of GKLF and any other Krüppel-like factor genes that might share homolo"
https://openalex.org/W1998873842,"We have demonstrated that growth hormone (GH) activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and this activation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of two FAK substrates, paxillin and tensin. The activation of FAK is time-dependent (maximal activation at 5–15 min) and dose-dependent (maximal activation at 0.05 nm). FAK and paxillin are constitutively associated in the unstimulated state, remain associated during the stimulation phase, and recruit tyrosine-phosphorylated tensin to the complex after GH stimulation. Half of the carboxyl-terminal region of the GH receptor is dispensable for FAK activation, but FAK activation does require the proline-rich box 1 region of the GH receptor, indicative that FAK is downstream of JAK2. FAK associates with JAK2 but not JAK1 after GH stimulation of cells. Using FAK-replete and FAK-deficient cells, we also show that FAK is not required for STAT-mediated transcriptional activation by GH. The use of FAK in the signal transduction pathway utilized by GH may be central to many of the pleiotropic effects of GH, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, and/or prevention of apoptosis and gene transcription.

Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It possesses diverse and pleiotropic effects on the growth, differentiation, and metabolism of cells. GH is thought to initiate its biological actions, including induction of a number of RNA species in mammalian tissues, by interaction with a specific membrane-bound receptor (2Kelly P.A. Ali S. Rozakis M. Goujon L. Nagano M. Pelligrini I. Gould D. Djiane J. Edery M. Finidori J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 123-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GH receptor is phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation presumably by the physical association of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase JAK2 (3Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The JAK kinases are linked to transcriptional regulation, and JAK activation results in the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of latent cytoplasmic STAT transcription factors (4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The activated STAT factors bind to their appropriate DNA-responsive elements to activate gene transcription (4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev.

Interestingly, STAT5 is also activated by cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and hormonal activation of STAT5 in mammary epithelial cells is matrix-dependent (11Streuli C.H.

Other diverse actions of GH include the stimulation of chemotaxis and migration of monocytic cells (12Wiedermann C.J. Reinisch N. Braunsteiner H. Blood. 1993; 82: 954-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concordantly, we have demonstrated that GH stimulates the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells with fibroblastic morphology (13Goh E.L.K. Pircher T.J. Wood T.J. Norstedt G. Graichen R. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase (p125 FAK) has been postulated to play a central role in the response of the cell to the ECM (for review, see Ref. 14Guan J.L. Chen H.C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 168: 81-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in cell morphology and motility (for review, see Ref. 15Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of FAK stimulates cell migration (16Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both FAK-deficient endodermal and mesodermal cells migrate slower than their FAK-replete counterparts (17Ilic D. Furuta Y.

Furuta Y. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which GH exerts its effects on the cytoskeleton and cell motility and to determine the point of interaction of the ECM and cytokine receptor pathways, we have examined the response of FAK and its substrates to cellular stimulation with GH. We show that GH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and two of its substrates, paxillin and tensin, and that FAK associates with JAK2 and requires the JAK2 binding site on the GH receptor for its phosphorylation. Interestingly, FAK is not required for GH stimulation of STAT5-mediated transcription, indicative that FAK is not the point of convergence of the cytokine receptor and ECM STAT-mediated transcription.

Rat GH receptor cDNAs were cloned into an expression plasmid containing an SV40 enhancer and a human metallothionein IIa promoter. The cDNAs were transfected into CHO-K1 cells using Lipofectin together with the pIPB-1 plasmid, which contains a neomycin resistance gene fused to the thymidine kinase promoter (19Möller C.

Both cell clones transfected with the full-length receptor cDNA behaved identically for the experiments described here, although by affinity cross-linking the receptor in CHO4–638 cells has an M r of 84,000 compared with the expected M r of 120,000 as observed in CHOA-638 cells (21Wang X.

CHO cells stably transfected with rat GH receptor cDNA were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% v/v fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C as described previously (19Möller C.

MEF were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented as above. CHO cells were grown to confluence, incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium, washed twice in serum-free medium, and stimulated with the indicated dose of hGH for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min with regular vortices. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were collected and protein concentration determined. 800 μg of protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed routinely by incubating lysates with 2–4 μg/ml of the respective antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected either by incubating with 50 μl of protein G-agarose for 1 h (polyclonal antiserum) or by incubating with 5 μg of anti-mouse IgG for 1 h followed by 1-h incubation with protein G-agarose (monoclonal antibodies). Immunoprecipitations were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 2 × SDS-sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to 8% SDS-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard electroblotting procedures. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with either 3% insulin-free bovine serum albumin (for phosphotyrosine immunoblotting) or 5% nonfat dry milk (for other immunoblotting) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at 22 °C. Blots were then immunolabeled overnight at 4 °C with PY20 (1:1,000), anti-FAK mAb (1:1,000), anti-paxillin mAb (1:1,000), anti-tensin mAb (1:1,000), JAK2 antiserum (1:500), or JAK1 antiserum (1:500). Immunolabeling was detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were stripped and reprobed with the same antibodies used for their immunoprecipitation to ensure equal loading of the immunoprecipitated protein. Blots were stripped by incubation for 30 min at 50 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 30 min with several changes of PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. Efficacy of stripping was determined by reexposure of the membranes to ECL. Thereafter, blots were reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. Wild type MEF and MEF deficient in FAK (17Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J.

Transient transfection was performed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with DOTAP according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of reporter plasmid (SPI-GLE1 or c-fos-SIE-CAT) and 1 μg of pSV2-LUC ± 1 μg of GH receptor expression plasmid were transfected per well. Cells were incubated with DOTAP/DNA for 12 h before the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 nm hGH. After an additional 24 h, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer. The protein contents of the samples were normalized, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and luciferase (LUC) assays were performed as described previously (8Wood T.J.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E.

Results were normalized to the level of luciferase to control for transfection efficiency and calculated as the ratio of stimulated to unstimulated (non-hormone-treated) cells. All experiments were repeated at least three times, usually five to seven times. The figures presented for Western blot analyses are representative of multiple experiments. The text under “Results” summarizes the outcome from multiple Western blot analyses; consequently, the text (e.g.description of the time course of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) may not correspond exactly to the actual figure presented. All numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed t test or analysis of variance. To determine if GH could stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK we first treated CHO-GHR1–638 cells for 0–60 min with 50 nm hGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with PY20. SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting for FAK revealed a GH- and time-dependent increase in the level of FAK protein in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A). FAK protein was identified as a single band of 125 kDa. Some basal level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum-deprived cells. The maximal GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was observed between 10 and 15 min after stimulation, with the relative level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. We next immunoprecipitated FAK from cell extracts of CHO-GHR1–638cells stimulated for 0–60 min with 50 nm hGH and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with PY20. We observed the consistent presence of two major time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of 125 and 215 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2 A). The 125-kDa band co-migrated with FAK protein, and the 215-kDa protein co-migrated with tensin protein (see below). Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was apparent at 5 min and was maximal from 10 to 15 min followed by a decline at 60 min. Some basal level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was also evident upon longer exposure of the membrane. Equal amounts of FAK protein were immunoprecipitated at all time points as indicated by the loading control (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p215 was observed first at 5 min, was maximal 10–15 after stimulation, and then declined at 60 min. Some other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of different molecular mass were also present (upon longer exposure of the membranes; data not shown) in the FAK immunoprecipitates, albeit at lower levels than p125 and p215. Such proteins possessed molecular masses of 85 kDa (and may represent the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase (23Chen H.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 128 kDa (see below; identified as JAK2). We also examined the dose dependence of the hGH stimulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore stimulated CHO-GHR1–638 cells with 0, 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 nm hGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated FAK from the cell extracts. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (PY20) of the FAK immunoprecipitates again revealed GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 and p215. Human GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was first observed at 0.005 nm hGH, and maximal tyrosine phosphorylation was observed at 0.05–0.5 nm hGH (Fig. 2 C). Some diminution of the hGH response was observed at higher doses presumably concordant with the receptor dimerization theory of GH signal transduction (24Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar).

Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 26Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To first determine if GH could stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin we treated CHO-GHR1–638 cells for 0–60 min with 50 nmhGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with PY20. SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting for paxillin revealed a time- and hGH-dependent increase in the level of paxillin protein in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B). Paxillin protein was identified as a band of between 66 and 68 kDa. Some basal level of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum-deprived cells. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was observed between 10 and 30 min after stimulation with the relative level of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. We next immunoprecipitated paxillin from extracts of CHO-GHR1–638 cells stimulated for 0–60 min with 50 nm hGH and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with PY20. Because paxillin runs close to the heavy chain of the IgG molecule on SDS-PAGE, we first verified the identity of the paxillin band (Fig. 3 A). Upon GH stimulation of CHO-GHR1–638 cells we observed the appearance of a heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated band at 66–68 kDa in paxillin immunoprecipitates, although basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the 66–68-kDa protein was also evident. No such tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band was evident when a control monoclonal antibody (c-Jun) was used, and use of this control monoclonal antibody allowed identification of the IgG heavy chain as a separate protein from the tyrosine-phosphorylated 66–68-kDa band (Fig. 3 A). Further, the tyrosine-phosphorylated 66–68-kDa protein co-migrated with paxillin, when paxillin immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on the same polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted for paxillin. Also, co-migration of the tyrosine-phosphorylated band at 66–68 kDa with paxillin protein was observed upon stripping of the membrane and subsequent reblotting of the membrane for paxillin loading control (for example, see Fig. 3 B). Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was apparent at 5 min and was maximal from 10 to 30 min followed by a decline at 60 min (Fig. 3 B). Some basal tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was observed in cells in the unstimulated state. When SDS-PAGE was allowed to proceed for a longer time such that the large molecular mass proteins could enter the running gel, the GH- and time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 125 and 215 kDa was observed (Fig. 3 D). The 125-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-migrated with FAK protein. Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was observed first at 5 min, was maximal 10–30 after stimulation, and then declined at 60 min. The 215-kDa protein was identified as tensin (see below). We also examined the dose dependence of the hGH stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the paxillin-associated 125-kDa (FAK) and the 215-kDa (tensin) proteins. We therefore stimulated CHO-GHR1–638 cells with 0, 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 nm hGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated paxillin from the cell extracts. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (PY20) of the paxillin immunoprecipitates again revealed GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 and p215 (Fig. 3 F). Maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was observed at 0.05–0.5 nm hGH. Again, some diminution of the hGH response was observed at higher doses of hGH. We next proceeded to determine the association state between FAK and paxillin. We therefore treated CHO-GHR1–638 cells for 0–60 min with 50 nmhGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated FAK from the cell extracts. Subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis for paxillin revealed a constitutive association between FAK and paxillin (66–68 kDa) which was not dependent upon hormonal stimulation (Fig. 4).Figure 4FAK and paxillin are constitutively associated in CHO-GHR1–638 cells.CHO-GHR1–638 cells were stimulated with 50 nmhGH for the indicated time periods, cell extracts prepared, and FAK protein immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for paxillin protein. The loading control for FAK is shown in B. Paxillin is indicated as a broad protein band of 66–68 kDa. The positions of the molecular mass standards are indicated on the right. The data are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the above experiments hGH stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein band of 215 kDa, observed in both FAK and paxillin immunoprecipitates. This protein is likely to be tensin because tensin is a 215-kDa protein substrate of FAK (27Lo S.H. Weisberg E. Chen L.B. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine first if hGH could stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin we treated CHO-GHR1–638 cells for 0–60 min with 50 nmhGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with PY20. SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting for tensin revealed a GH- and time-dependent increase in the level of tensin protein in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C). Tensin protein was identified as a band of 215 kDa. Some basal level of tensin tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum-deprived cells. The maximal GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin was observed between 10 and 30 min after stimulation with the relative level of tensin tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. We next immunoprecipitated tensin from cell extracts of CHO-GHR1–638 cells stimulated for 0–60 min with 50 nm hGH and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with PY20. We observed the presence of two time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of 125 and 215 kDa, respectively (Fig. 5 A). The 125-kDa band co-migrated with FAK protein as expected, and the 215-kDa protein co-migrated with tensin protein. Paxillin could not be identified definitively because of its proximity to the IgG heavy chain. Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin was apparent at 5 min and was maximal from 10 to 30 min followed by a decline at 60 min. Similarly, increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was observed first at 5 min, was maximal 10 min after stimulation, and then declined to 60 min. We next proceeded to determine the association state between FAK and tensin. We therefore treated CHO-GHR1–638 cells for 0–60 min with 50 nm hGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated FAK from the cell extracts. Subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis for tensin revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of tensin with FAK. Tensin was minimally associated with FAK in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of tensin with FAK was observed between 10 and 30 min (Fig. 5 C). We proceeded to determine the GH receptor regions required for FAK activation. We therefore utilized well characterized CHO cell clones stably express"

The kinetics of prethrombin 2 cleavage was studied to delineate macromolecular substrate structures necessary for recognition at the exosite(s) of prothrombinase. The product, α-thrombin, was a linear competitive inhibitor of prethrombin 2 activation without significantly inhibiting peptidyl substrate cleavage by prothrombinase. Prethrombin 2 and α-thrombin compete for binding to the exosite without restricting access to the active site of factor Xa within prothrombinase. Inhibition by α-thrombin was not altered by saturating concentrations of low molecular weight heparin. Furthermore, proteolytic removal of the fibrinogen recognition site in α-thrombin only had a modest effect on its inhibitory properties. Both α-thrombin and prethrombin 2 were cleaved with chymotrypsin at Trp148 and separated into component domains. The C-terminal-derived ζ2 fragment retained the ability to selectively inhibit macromolecular substrate cleavage by prothrombinase, while the ζ1 fragment was without effect. As the ζ2 fragment lacks the fibrinogen recognition site, the P1-P3 residues or the intact cleavage site, specific recognition of the macromolecular substrate by the exosite in prothrombinase is achieved through substrate regions, distinct from the fibrinogen recognition or heparin-binding sites, and spatially removed from structures surrounding the scissile bond.

The conversion of prothrombin to the serine proteinase, α-thrombin, is pivotal for the maintenance of hemostasis. The specific proteolytic activation of prothrombin is catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex, which assembles through reversible interactions between the trypsin-like serine proteinase, factor Xa, and the cofactor protein, factor Va, on appropriate phospholipid surfaces in the presence of Ca2+ ions (6Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 7Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although factor Xa itself can catalyze prothrombin cleavage, the macromolecular interactions which stabilize prothrombinase lead to a profound increase, by a factor of ∼100,000, in the catalytic efficiency of prothrombin activation (6Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 7Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S.

A major fraction of the increased catalytic efficiency observed upon assembly of factor Xa into the prothrombinase complex likely arises as a result of the influence of factor Va on the catalyst (6Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the ability of factor Va to enhance the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa within prothrombinase is poorly understood as is the basis for the narrow and distinctive macromolecular substrate specificity of factor Xa, despite its high degree of homology with trypsin (6Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 9Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). These two aspects of enzymic function appear closely related since the increased rate of prothrombin activation that results from the incorporation of factor Xa into the prothrombinase complex is not accompanied by changes in the rate of cleavage of synthetic peptidyl substrates, in the reaction with active site-directed reagents or even in the rate constant for inhibition by macromolecular inhibitors such as antithrombin III (10Nesheim M.E.

Suggestions for the importance of specific macromolecular recognition, by prothrombinase, through interactions at extended recognition sites removed from the active site of factor Xa (exosites) were initially derived from studies with tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) 1The abbreviations used are: TAP, recombinant wild type tick anticoagulant peptide; APMSF,p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; ATA-EGR-CH2Cl, acetothioacetyl derivative of EGR-CH2Cl; ATA-EGR-Xa, factor Xa inactivated with ATA-EGR-CH2Cl; EGR-CH2Cl, glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl chloromethylketone; IIa i, thrombin inactivated with APMSF; LMW heparin, low molecular weight heparin (average M r = 3,000); [OG488]-EGR-Xa, adduct of ATA-EGR-Xa and Oregon Green488 iodoacetamide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PC,l-α-phosphatidylcholine; PS,l-α-phosphatidylserine; PCPS, small unilamellar vesicles composed of 75% (w/w) PC and 25% (w/w) PS; S2238, H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginyl p-nitroanilide; SpXa, methoxycarbonyl-cyclohexyl-glycyl-glycyl-arginyl p-nitroanilide; Xa i, factor Xa inactivated with APMSF; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; TPCK, tosyl-l-1-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (13Krishnaswamy S. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7897-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Work with a mutant derivative of TAP suggested that the selective modulation of such exosite interactions following the assembly of factor Xa into prothrombinase could lead to large changes in affinity and kinetic mechanism in the interaction of the enzyme with macromolecules (14Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the significance of these findings toward prothrombin activation by prothrombinase has required documentation by appropriate functional studies. The interpretation of kinetic studies of prothrombin activation is complicated by the fact that the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin involves the cleavage of two peptide bonds and is the sum of two consecutive enzyme-catalyzed reactions (6Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 15Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, kinetic interpretations are simplified by the use of prethrombin 2 as a substrate analog, which requires cleavage at a single site to yield thrombin (16Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The kinetics of recognition and cleavage of this bond in prethrombin 2 are established to be indistinguishable from the cleavage of the same site in intact prothrombin (15Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with reversible inhibitors targeting the active site of factor Xa have provided evidence for a significant contribution from exosite interactions within prothrombinase in the recognition of prethrombin 2 (17Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Active site-directed reversible inhibitors as well as oligopeptidyl alternate substrates are classical noncompetitive inhibitors of macromolecular substrate cleavage by prothrombinase despite their established ability to compete for substrate binding to the active site (17Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, thrombin is a competitive product inhibitor of prethrombin 2 activation but does not interfere with oligopeptidyl substrate cleavage by prothrombinase (17Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the affinity and binding specificity for prethrombin 2 is determined by interactions at exosites rather than by interactions between elements surrounding the scissile bond and the active site of the protease (17Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, competitive inhibition of macromolecular substrate cleavage by thrombin is achieved by competition for the initial exosite interaction between the substrate and prothrombinase. It therefore follows that the structural features of prethrombin 2 that determine substrate affinity, through interactions with the exosite, are spatially distinct from residues surrounding the scissile bond. Following cleavage, the polypeptide sequence N-terminal to the scissile bond is not released, but retained in the two chain product, thrombin, through a disulfide bond (18Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since thrombin competes for prethrombin 2 binding without obscuring access to the active site of prothrombinase, it also follows that the interaction between thrombin and prothrombinase is achieved by product domains spatially distinct from the P1-P3 2Nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (1Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar). residues found in the A-chain of thrombin. We have used proteolytic derivatives of thrombin and prethrombin 2 as well as ligands established to bind to specific sites in the substrate and product, to test these predictions and delineate the regions of the substrate that contribute to binding specificity through interactions with the prothrombinase exosite.

Peptidyl substrates H-d-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg p-nitroanilide (S2238) and methoxycarbonylcyclohexyl-Gly-Gly-Arg p-nitroanilide (Spectrozyme Xa, SpXa) were from Chromogenix (Molndal, Sweden) and American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), respectively. Stock solutions (∼4 mm) of either substrate were prepared in water and concentrations were determined using E 342 = 8270m−1 cm−1 (19Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Polyethylene glycol M r = 8000 (PEG) was obtained from J. T. Baker (Danvers, MA). All kinetic studies were performed in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, pH 7.4 (assay buffer) at 25° C. Phospholipid vesicles (PCPS) composed of 75% (w/w) PC and 25% (w/w) PS were prepared as described previously (20Higgins D.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6503-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of phospholipid was determined after oxidation by a colorimetric phosphate assay and is stated as the concentration of inorganic phosphate (21Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar). The concentration of unfractionated heparin (ESI, Cherry Hill, NJ) was calculated assuming an average molecular weight of 20,000. Low molecular weight heparin (LMW heparin) was obtained from Celsus Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH). The average molecular weight (3,000) of this preparation is consistent with the predominant species being composed of 5 disaccharides. Hirugen™, a synthetic peptide comprising the C-terminal region of hirudin (N-acetyl-Asn-Gly-Asp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr-SO3-Leu) (22Stone S.R. Maraganore J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 312-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), originally manufactured by Biogen (Cambridge, MA) was a gift from Drs. S. R. Hanson and L. A. Harker (Emory University). Prothrombin and factor X were purified from bovine plasma as described previously (23Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8977-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine factor X was converted to factor Xa by using the purified activator from Russell's viper venom and further purified by chromatography using benzamidine Sepharose (24Jesty J. Nemerson Y. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1967; 19: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar), typically yielded 1.12–1.15 mol of active sites/mol of factor Xa. Bovine factor Va was purified using an established procedure (27Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5714-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant TAP was produced and purified as described (28Laroche Y. Storme V. De Meutter J. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Prethrombin 2 and α-thrombin were prepared as described previously (16Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Gel-filtration chromatography of prethrombin 2 on Sephadex G-50 in 20 mm Hepes, 2.5 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4 (16Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), resolved prethrombin 2 from a polymeric form eluting at the void volume. The aggregated species was discarded as it was found to be a potent inhibitor of prethrombin 2 cleavage by prothrombinase. Fibrin-Sepharose was prepared as described and extensively precycled prior to use (29Matthias F.R. Reinicke R. Heene D.L. Thrombosis Res. 1977; 10: 365-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Buffer components of the hirugen preparation were removed by preparative reversed phase HPLC (Aquapore C-18, ABI, San Jose, CA) and elution with a gradient of increasing CH3CN in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Multiple peaks were identified by monitoring absorbance at 215 nm. Heterogeneity in the sample was confirmed by microbore reversed phase HPLC. However, amino acid analysis was consistent with the primary structure of hirugen and the basis for sample heterogeneity could not be determined by further analysis using either laser desorption (MALDI) or electron spray mass spectrometry. As the individual species identified by HPLC could not be adequately resolved on a preparative scale, a single pool was prepared, lyophilized, and dissolved in assay buffer. Peptide content was established by amino acid analysis. Fragments of thrombin and prethrombin 2 were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry and by automated Edman degradation at the Emory University Microchemical facility. For N-terminal sequence analysis, fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE following disulfide bond reduction with dithiothreitol and transferred to Immobilon PSQ membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting in a semidry apparatus (Hoeffer, San Francisco, CA) as described previously (30Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16126-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein sequence was determined from excised membrane fragments. Inactivation of α-thrombin with APMSF to yield α-IIai was performed as described previously (17Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For the preparation of bovine γT-thrombin, α-thrombin in assay buffer (22 μm, 45 ml) was incubated with 0.7 μm trypsin for 3 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 10 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-PO4, pH 5.8, 40 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) PEG for 4 h at 4 °C and applied to a column (1.5 × 12.5 cm) of S-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted (4 ml/min, 120 min) with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl (40–700 mm) in 20 mm Tris-PO4, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, pH 5.8. All fractions containing protein exhibited equivalent specific activities to α-thrombin in the cleavage of S2238. Fractions from the leading peak, containing γT-thrombin with an estimated contamination of 5% undigested material determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, 40 mmNaCl, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, pH 7.4, and subject to affinity chromatography using a 4.5 × 17-cm column of fibrin-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl (40–600 mm) in 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, pH 7.4. The γT-thrombin containing fractions were pooled and reapplied to a second fibrin-Sepharose column with isocratic elution to remove traces of remaining α-thrombin. The flow-through fractions were characterized by the same specific activity as α-thrombin toward S2238 with ∼1% of the specific activity of α-thrombin in a fibrinogen clotting assay (18Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Pooled material was concentrated by ultrafiltration in a stirred cell (YM10, Amicon, Danvers, MA) to a concentration of ∼100 μm, inactivated by the addition of 1 mm APMSF followed by brief incubation at room temperature and dialyzed against assay buffer. The resulting preparation of inactivated γT-thrombin (γT-IIa i) possessed <0.01% catalytic activity when compared with α-thrombin. Protein sequencing of the fragments resolved by SDS-PAGE yielded the expected sequence for bovine γT-thrombin (3Fenton J.W., II Landis B.H. Walz D.A. Finlayson J.S. Fenton J.W., II Lundblad R.L.

In addition, the mass of γT-thrombin was determined by MALDI mass spectrometry and found to be consistent with removal of the undecapeptide (Ile68-Arg77A). 3The residues of α-thrombin have been numbered after the corresponding amino acids in chymotrypsin using the convention of Bode et al. (2Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Cleavage of human α-thrombin by trypsin at Arg67, Arg77A, and Lys149E leads to the loss of the Ile68-Arg77A peptide and yields γT-thrombin (3Fenton J.W., II Landis B.H. Walz D.A. Finlayson J.S.

Tryptic digestion of bovine thrombin results in cleavage at Arg67 and Arg77A but not at Glu149E. We have designated this derivative of bovine thrombin, which lacks a significant part of the fibrinogen recognition site, as γT-thrombin. Bovine ζ-thrombin was prepared by treatment of α-thrombin (27 μm, 15 ml) in 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with 4.2 nm chymotrypsin for 4 h at room temperature. The digest, terminated by addition of 10 μmTPCK, was dialyzed against 20 mm MES, 80 mmNaCl, pH 6.5, and applied to a column (1.5 × 8 cm) of S-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution with a linear gradient (4 ml/min, 130 min) of increasing NaCl (80–800 mm) in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, resulted in the separation of chymotrypsin, undigested thrombin, and two peaks of cleaved material. Protein in the two resolved peaks of cleaved material appeared identical by SDS-PAGE, protein sequencing, and specific activity measured with S2238. The cleaved material was pooled, concentrated, inactivated with AMPSF, and dialyzed into assay buffer as described above. Protein sequence analysis indicated a single cleavage at Trp148 consistent with the expected result for the action of chymotrypsin on human thrombin to yield ζ-thrombin (32Brezniak D.V. Brower M.S. Witting J.I. Walz D.A. Fenton J.W., II Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3536-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On this basis, the resulting inactivated preparation was designated ζ-IIa i. The two chymotryptic fragments of thrombin were isolated by HPLC separation of the products generated following chymotryptic cleavage of α-thrombin. Thrombin (30 mg) treated with chymotrypsin (as above) was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 30% (v/v) CH3CN, pH 9.0, for 4 h at room temperature. Following clarification by centrifugation (50,000 × g, 20 min), aliquots (3 ml) were fractionated by cation exchange HPLC (Aquapore Cation 7 μm, 0.46 × 22.2 cm, ABI). Elution (1 ml/min, 30 min) with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl (0–350 mm) in 20 mm Tris, 30% (v/v) CH3CN, pH 9.0, resolved two peaks corresponding to the two thrombin fragments. Material from each of the peaks accumulated from successive runs was pooled, dialyzed against 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, concentrated by lyophilization, and further purified by reversed phase HPLC. Each of the pools was dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mmNEt3-PO4, pH 2.5) and fractionated in ∼1-mg aliquots using an Aquapore Phenyl column (0.46 × 22.2 cm, ABI). Bound protein was eluted (1 ml/min) with a biphasic gradient of increasing Buffer B (20 mmNEt3-PO4, 80% (v/v) CH3CN, pH 2.5) of 0–24% Buffer B in 25 min followed by 30–37% Buffer B in 80 min. Analysis by SDS-PAGE confirmed quantitative separation of the two fragments which were identified as ζ1-thrombin and ζ2-thrombin based on N-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. Pools were prepared for each of fragments, lyophilized, dialyzed against assay buffer, and clarified by centrifugation (50,000 × g, 20 min). Dialysis resulted in variable amounts of protein loss due to precipitation. The final concentrations were in the range of 15 μm for ζ1-thrombin and 40 μm for ζ2-thrombin. The two chymotryptic fragments of prethrombin 2 were prepared by treating prethrombin 2 (27 μm, 5 ml) in 0.25m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, with 1 nmchymotrypsin for 3 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against Buffer A (above) and fragments were separated by reversed phase HPLC as described above for the thrombin fragments. The resulting peptides were lyophilized, dialyzed against assay buffer, and clarified by centrifugation (50,000 × g, 20 min). The fragments were designated ζ1-prethrombin 2 and ζ2-prethrombin 2 on the basis of SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequence analysis, and mass spectrometry. The purity of all protein preparations was judged by SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients ( E2800.1%): bovine factor Xa, 45,300, 1.24 (34Jackson C.M. Johnson T.F. Hanahan D.J.

The concentrations of the thrombin and prethrombin 2 derivatives were determined using molecular weights determined from the primary structure and extinction coefficients calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (38Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar): γT-thrombin, 34,100, 1.89; ζ-thrombin 37,400, 1.85; ζ1-thrombin or ζ1-prethrombin 2, 23,000, 1.83; ζ2-thrombin or ζ2-prethrombin 2, 12,450, 1.90. Factor Xa with a fluorescent probe tethered to the active site via a peptidyl chloromethyl ketone was prepared using the procedure developed by Bock (39Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the first step, the acetothioester derivative of EGR-CH2Cl was prepared by minor modifications to described procedures (39Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purification of the acetothioacetyl adduct of EGR-CH2Cl (ATA-EGR-CH2Cl) was performed by application to a column (1.5 × 120 cm) of S-Sepharose equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.5, with isocratic elution. The resulting ATA-EGR-CH2Cl was identified, concentrated, and characterized as described (39Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Factor Xa in 0.5 m Tris, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, pH 7.5, was inactivated by sequential additions of ATA-EGR-CH2Cl and the resulting modified factor Xa (ATA-EGR-Xa) was separated from excess unreacted inhibitor by chromatography on a G-25 column (40Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Traces of uninhibited factor Xa were depleted by affinity chromatography using soybean trypsin inhibitor Sepharose (41Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the final step, a fluorophore was incorporated into the active site by reacting ATA-EGR-Xa (60 μm, 3 mg) with 680 μm Oregon Green488 iodoacetamide in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 87 mm NH2OH, pH 7.0, for 75 min at room temperature. Unreacted dye and buffer components were separated from the protein by gel filtration as described previously (40Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), to yield the fluorescent adduct of factor Xa ([OG488]-EGR-Xa). The concentration of the fluorescent adduct was determined with a colorimetric protein assay (BCA assay, Pierce, Rockford, IL) using a standard curve prepared with known concentrations of ATA-EGR-Xa (40Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The initial rate of thrombin formation by the action of prothrombinase on prethrombin 2 was determined as described previously (16Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (290 μl) were prepared in assay buffer containing 25 nm factor Va, 60 μm PCPS, the indicated concentrations of prethrombin 2 and inhibitor at 25° C. Thrombin formation was initiated by the addition of 5"

Responses to CXCR1 are attenuated by prior exposure of neutrophils to either IL-8, a cleavage product of the fifth component of complement (C5a) or n-formylated peptides (formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, fMLP). To characterize the role of receptor phosphorylation in the regulation of the CXCR1, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant, M2CXCR1, was constructed. This receptor, stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells, coupled more efficiently to G protein and stimulated enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis, cAMP production, exocytosis, and phospholipase D activation, and was resistant to IL-8-induced receptor internalization. The rate and total amount of ligand stimulated actin polymerization remained unchanged, but interestingly, chemotaxis was decreased by ∼30% compared with the wild type receptor. To study the role of receptor phosphorylation in cross-desensitization of chemoattractant receptors, M2CXCR1 was coexpressed with cDNAs encoding receptors for either fMLP (FR), C5a (C5aR), or platelet-activating factor (PAFR). Both C5aR and PAFR were cross-phosphorylated upon M2CXCR1 activation, resulting in attenuated guanosine 5′-3′-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding in membranes. In contrast, FR and M2CXCR1 were resistant to cross-phosphorylation and cross-inhibition of GTPγS binding by other receptors. Despite the resistance of M2CXCR1 to cross-phosphorylation and receptor/G protein uncoupling, its susceptibility to cross-desensitization of its Ca2+ response by fMLP and C5a, was equivalent to CXCR1. Regardless of the enhancement in certain receptor functions in M2CXCR1 compared with the wild type CXCR1, the mutated receptors mediated equivalent PLCβ3 phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization by FR, C5aR, and PAFR. The results herein indicate that phosphorylation of CXCR1 regulates some, but not all of the receptors functions. While receptor phosphorylation inhibits G protein turnover, PLC activation, Ca2+ mobilization and secretion, it is required for normal chemotaxis and receptor internalization. Since phosphorylation of CXCR1 had no effect on its ability to induce phosphorylation of PLCβ3 or to mediate class-desensitization, these activities may be mediated by independently regulated pathways.

Activation of either FR or C5aR in co-transfected RBL-2H3 cells, resulted in cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of CXCR1 (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Likewise, C5aR underwent cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization upon CXCR1 activation (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). FR was, however, resistant to cross-phosphorylation, although inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and Ca2+ mobilization were attenuated by a first dose of either C5a or IL-8 (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggested that a shared component(s) distal to receptor/G protein is(are) involved in chemoattractant receptor class desensitization. Chemoattractant receptors have been shown to couple to both PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 to stimulate leukocyte responses (13Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Liu and Simon (15Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have recently shown in Cos-7 cells that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of PLCβ2 prevented its activation by Gβγ. Recent studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that receptors for the chemoattractants PAF, fMLP, and the CXC chemokine SDF1 induced phosphorylation of PLCβ3 via both protein kinase A- and C-activating pathways (16Ali H.

Thus, phosphorylation of PLCβ, subsequent to chemoattractant receptor activation, may play a regulatory role in cross-desensitization. To determine the role of receptor and PLCβ3phosphorylation in CXCR1 regulation, a receptor mutant, M2CXCR1, resistant to heterologous phosphorylation was transfected in RBL-2H3 cells. This mutant was more active than CXCR1 in stimulating G protein activation and some but not all subsequent responses. In this study, we characterize M2CXCR1 regulation and cross-regulation of other chemoattractant receptor and assess the role of phosphorylation in receptor cross-desensitization. The data presented here suggest that class-desensitization of CXCR1 is not regulated by receptor phosphorylation, suggesting a pathway distal to receptor/G protein activation for PLC regulation. Moreover, this IL-8-induced phosphorylation of PLCβ3 may play an important role in class desensitization. [32P]Ortophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol), myo-[2-3H] inositol (24.4 Ci/mmol), [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 125I-labeled IL-8 was obtained from Amersham Corp. IL-8 (monocyte-derived) was purchased from Genzyme. PAF was from Calbiochem. Geniticin (G418) and all tissue culture reagent were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal 12CA5 antibody, protein G-agarose, and protease inhibitors were purchased from Boehringer Manheim.

C5a and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), GDP, GTP, GTPγS, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents are from commercial sources. Nucleotides encoding a nine-amino acid epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted between the N-terminal initiator methionine and the second amino acid of each cDNA by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (7Richardson R.M.

Alanine substitution of serine and threonine residues of the carboxyl terminus of CXCR1 to generate M2CXCR1 was carried out by polymerase chain reaction. RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (19Ali H.

RBL-2H3 cells (1 × 107 cells) were transfected by electroporation with pcDNA3 containing the receptor cDNAs (20 μg) and geneticin-resistant cells were cloned into single cell by fluorescein-activated cell sorting analysis. RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 24-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in growth medium. Cells were then rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated on ice for 2–4 h in the same medium (250 μl) containing 125I-IL-8. Reactions were stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and washed four times with the same buffer. Then cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH (250 μl), dried under vacuum, and bound radioactivity was evaluated by counting in a gamma counter. Nonspecific radioactivity bound was determined in the presence of 300 nm unlabeled IL-8. For internalization experiments, cells were incubated with 100 nm IL-8 for 0–60 min at 37 °C. After the incubation period, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and125I-IL-8 binding was carried out as described above.

RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 96-well culture plates (50,000 cells/well) in inositol-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. The generation of inositol phosphates was determined as reported previously (19Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

For calcium mobilization, cells (3 × 106) were loaded with 1 μm Indo 1-acetoxymethyl ester in the presence of 1 μm pluronic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed and resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer. Intracellular calcium increase in the presence and absence of ligands was measured as described (7Richardson R.M. DuBose R. Ali H.

RBL-2H3 cells (50,000) were incubated at 37 °C with different concentration of IL-8. Chemotaxis was assessed in 48-well microchemotaxis chambers, using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free 5-μm pore size membranes. Migration was allowed to continue for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The membrane was removed, the upper surface was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped, fixed, and stained. The results are represented as chemotaxis index (mean number of cells per high power field for chemokine dilution/mean number of cells per high power field for medium) (23Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A.

The following day the cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the same medium supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/dish) for 90 min to metabolically label the intracellular ATP pool. Then labeled cells were stimulated with the indicated stimulants or vehicle for 5–7 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by placing the cells on ice. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with cold detergent-containing lysis buffer (1 ml/dish) supplemented with appropriate protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The phosphorylated receptors were immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 antibody, analyzed by SDS-electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. PLCβ3 phosphorylation upon agonist stimulation was determined as described above, using a rabbit polyclonal PLCβ3 specific antibody instead of 12CA5 as described previously (16Ali H. Fisher I.

M2CXCR1 was previously expressed in RBL-2H3 cells and it was demonstrated that the mutant bound IL-8 with a dissociation constant (K d) of 2.8 ± 0.7 nm and a B max of 7792 ± 284 receptors/cell. This was similar to that of wild type CXCR1 expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (K d, 2.3 ± 0.3 nm; B max, 8532 ± 152 receptors/cell) or the native receptors in neutrophils (∼1–2 nm) (3Horuk R. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Richardson R.M. DuBose R. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), indicating that mutation of the four amino acid residues which comprise the M2 cluster (7Richardson R.M. DuBose R. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) did not affect ligand binding. However, M2CXCR1-mediated inositol phosphates formation and secretion were ∼5- and ∼10-fold, respectively, higher than the wild type receptor (7Richardson R.M. DuBose R. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). IL-8-induced GTPase activity in membranes, and cAMP production and phospholipase D activity in intact cells were also greater in cells expressing M2CXCR1 than CXCR1 (data not shown). IL-8-induced actin polymerization were similar for both M2CXCR1 and CXCR1-expressing cells (Fig. 1 A). However, cells expressing M2CXCR1 showed a ∼30% decrease in maximal chemotaxis compared with cells expressing CXCR1 (Fig. 1 B). The EC50 (∼0.1 nm), however, remained unchanged. M2CXCR1 was more resistant to IL-8-induced internalization than CXCR1 (∼45 versus ∼80% of 125I-IL-8 binding after 60 min) (data not shown). These results are consistent with the ones reported by Prado et al. (24Prado G.N. Suzuki H. Wilkinson N. Cousins B. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19186-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and indicated that the M2 site play an important role in phosphorylation-mediated down-regulation of the CXCR1. The ability of M2CXCR1 to cross-phosphorylate and cross-desensitize chemoattractant responses was determined. Cells expressing CXCR1 and cells coexpressing M2CXCR1 and receptors for either fMLP (M2CXCR1-FR) or PAF (M2CXCR1-PAFR) were stimulated with either IL-8 (100 nm), fMLP (1 μm), PAF (100 nm), or PMA (100 nm). As shown in Fig. 2, CXCR1 (lane 2, ∼70 kDa), FR (lane 6, ∼65 kDa), and PAFR (lane 11, ∼45 kDa) were homologously phosphorylated by their ligands. CXCR1 and PAFR were also phosphorylated by PMA (lanes 3 and 10, respectively) but not FR (lane 7) and M2CXCR1 (lanes 7 and 10). PAFR was cross-phosphorylated by M2CXCR1 activation (lane 9). Both M2CXCR1 (lanes 6 and 11) and FR (lane 5) were resistant to cross-phosphorylation. Some homologous phosphorylation of M2CXCR1 was detected with longer exposure of the autoradiogram (7Richardson R.M. DuBose R. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Ca2+ mobilization was measured to determine the relationship between cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of receptor-mediated cellular responses. Ca2+ mobilization in response to an EC100 dose of either fMLP (100 nm; M2CXCR1-FR cells), PAF (10 nm; M2CXCR1-PAFR cells) or IL-8 (10 nm; M2CXCR1-FR and M2CXCR1-PAFR cells) was homologously desensitized by a first dose of the same ligand (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, the dose-response of either fMLP (panel A) or PAF (panel C) induced Ca2+ mobilization in M2CXCR1-FR and M2CXCR1-PAFR cells, respectively, was cross-desensitized by pretreatment of the cells with a first dose of IL-8 (10 nm). IL-8-induced Ca2+ mobilization in cells expressing M2CXCR1 was also cross-desensitized by pretreatment of the cells with a first dose of either fMLP (panel B) or C5a (data not shown) but not PAF (panel D). The extent of FR mediated cross-desensitization of M2CXCR1 (∼60%) was equivalent to that of CXCR1 (57%) (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CXCR1 couples to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in neutrophils and RBL-2H3 cells (3Horuk R. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The possibility that the mutation of the carboxyl terminus of CXCR1 to generate M2CXCR1 may cause a switch in the G protein utilized by the mutant receptor was investigated. RBL-2H3 cells expressing the receptors for fMLP and the mutant (M2CXCR1-FR) were treated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) overnight and assayed for IL-8- and fMLP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Treatment with pertussis toxin completely inhibited the ability of both IL-8 and fMLP to stimulate Ca2+ mobilization and, as a consequence, cross-desensitization (data not shown). Peptide chemoattractants have been shown to couple to PLCβ to mediate cellular signals (13Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Both Western blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction indicated that of the four known PLCβ isozymes only PLCβ3 is expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (16Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, both PAF and fMLP have recently been shown to mediate PLCβ3 phosphorylation in RBL-2H3 cells (16Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Ali H. Sozzani S. Fisher I. Barr A. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Google Scholar). The ability of CXCR1 and the M2CXCR1 to mediate PLCβ3 phosphorylation was determined.32P-Labeled cells expressing CXCR1 or M2CXCR1 were stimulated with either IL-8 (100 nm), PMA (100 nm) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (1 mm). As shown in Fig. 4, upon IL-8 stimulation, both the mutant (lane 6) and the wild type receptor (lane 2) mediated phosphorylation of PLCβ3 to a similar extent, 1.81- and 1.77-fold over basal, respectively (panel B). IL-8-induced phosphorylation of PLCβ3 is similar to that of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (panel A, lanes 4 and 8, and panel B), but less than phosphorylation induced by PMA (panel A, lanes 3 and 7, and panel B). The dose response of IL-8- and fMLP-induced phosphorylation of PLCβ3 was evaluated in M2CXCR1-FR cells. fMLP (Fig. 5, panel A) and IL-8 (panel B) induced phosphorylation of PLCβ3 in a dose-dependent manner. As determined by Cerenkov counting of the excised phosphorylated band, fMLP- and IL-8-induced phosphorylation of PLCβ3 with an EC50 of ∼20 nm and ∼2 nm, respectively. Maximum phosphorylation was achieved at ∼100 nm fMLP (panel C) and ∼10 nm IL-8 (panel D) and was ∼2.45- and ∼1.75-fold over basal for fMLP and IL-8, respectively. Pretreatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) markedly inhibited phosphorylation of PLCβ3 induced by both, fMLP and IL-8) (panels A, B, C, and D). Phagocytic leukocytes respond to inflammatory mediators such as IL-8, fMLP, and C5a by migrating to sites of inflammation where they may exert their cytotoxic activities (25Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar). Despite the presence of two receptors for IL-8 in neutrophils (CXCR1 and CXCR2), certain cellular responses to IL-8 are lower in magnitude compared with fMLP and C5a. For example, IL-8 is a weaker stimulator of exocytosis and respiratory burst (26Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Walz A. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 247-263Google Scholar). IL-8 has also been shown to be less effective than fMLP and C5a in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in neutrophils (27Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2832-2838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that responses to IL-8 are modulated by specific phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor as well as a site downstream of G protein activation. A phosphorylation deficient receptor mutant (M2CXCR1) more effectively activated G protein and was more resistant to agonist-mediated desensitization and internalization. Despite the ability of this mutant to up-regulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, cAMP production, and phospholipase D activation and secretion, actin polymerization was not affected, and chemotaxis in response to IL-8 was actually diminished compared with wild type CXCR1 (Fig. 1). These results may distinguish events which are important for leukocyte recruitment from those for cytotoxic functions. Cytoskeletal rearrangement and chemotaxis which are early events in inflammation occur via pathways which require lower doses of agonist to reach maximum responses. Cytotoxic activation such as exocytosis of lysosomal enzymes and superoxide production require higher doses of ligand (25Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these observations may be provided by the findings described here. Prevention of receptor phosphorylation which resulted in enhanced G protein activation at all ligand doses was associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity yet diminished chemotaxis and unchanged cytoskeletal actin assembly. This can be inferred to indicate that cytotoxic activity requires higher G protein turnover than chemotaxis. The finding that chemotaxis to IL-8 decreased in M2CXCR1 cells may be interpreted in two ways. First, that receptor desensitization and/or internalization may be required for normal gradient detection. However, this contention is not supported by the recent findings that chemotaxis may be regulated via receptor phosphorylation-independent pathways (28Kim J.-Y. Soede R.D.M. Schaap P. Valkema R. Borleis J.A. Van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. Hereld D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27313-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Arai H. Montecarlo F.S. Tsou C.-L. Franci C. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25037-25042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Second, since maximal cell migration occurs at doses of agonist lower than those required for Ca2+ mobilization or cAMP production (25Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar), it is possible that the pathway(s) regulating chemotaxis is/are sensitive to second messenger levels and that the up-regulation of phospholipase C activation mediated by M2CXCR1 plays a negative regulatory role in sensing chemical gradients. Supporting this contention is that truncation of the carboxyl tail of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) receptor (CCR2B) which enhanced receptor mediated Ca2+ mobilization and cAMP production, diminished chemotaxis in response to MCP1 (29Arai H. Montecarlo F.S. Tsou C.-L. Franci C. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25037-25042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, chemotaxis of leukocytes was enhanced in PLCβ2 deficient mice in which phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization and superoxide production was decreased (30Jiang H. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7971-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Understanding molecular events underlying cross-desensitization of receptors was facilitated by the availability of M2CXCR1. Phosphorylation of unoccupied receptors by second messenger-dependent kinases activated via different receptors appear to account for cross-desensitization at the level of R/G protein coupling (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our previous studies with FR have revealed that receptor cross-desensitization can also occur independently of receptor phosphorylation and G protein uncoupling. A question addressed in the present study is the role of CXCR1 phosphorylation in the cross-desensitization of cellular responses. M2CXCR1, like FR (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B.

Despite this, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization mediated by M2CXCR1 in response to IL-8 was cross-desensitized by pretreatment of the cells with either fMLP or C5a (12Richardson R.M. Ali H.

These results clearly indicate cross-desensitization of M2CXCR1 at the level of a downstream effector which is independent of receptor phosphorylation or R/G protein uncoupling. This contention is supported by the observation that both PMA and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP which, like fMLP, IL-8, and C5a, caused phosphorylation of PLCβ3 (Fig. 4), desensitized Ca2+ mobilization in response to FR, C5aR, CXCR1, and M2CXCR1 in both neutrophils and transfected RBL-2H3 cells (16Ali H.

These results are in contrast to the ones presented in this work and may well reflect differences between homologous and cross-desensitization. Homologous desensitization requires phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied form of the receptor by a receptor specific kinase and accessory proteins such as arrestin (32Ligget S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D.R. Houslay M.D. Regulation of Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 71-98Google Scholar). Cross-desensitization, in contrast, is agonist-independent. It occurs via pathway(s) triggered by a different, but related, receptor and involve modification of downstream effector(s) and, perhaps, different accessory proteins. Another question addressed in this study is the role of second messenger production in receptor cross-regulation. M2CXCR1 induced greater G protein turnover, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cAMP production than CXCR1. However, M2CXCR1 activation by IL-8 did not result in greater cross-phosphorylation or cross-desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization in response to either FR, PAFR, or C5aR (22–30%) (Fig. 3, data not shown) compared with CXCR1 (20–30%) (12Richardson R.M.

These results suggest that cross-desensitization of receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization occurs via pathways which are independent of receptor phosphorylation or rate of second messenger production measured in the present work. Supporting that contention is that phosphorylation of PLCβ3, which is thought to be one of the target effector for class-desensitization (16Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,17Ali H. Sozzani S. Fisher I. Barr A. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Google Scholar), is mediated by both CXCR1 and M2CXCR1 to the same extent (Fig. 4). This work provides evidence for independent mechanisms for CXCR1 receptor mediated chemotactic versus cytotoxic functions of phagocytic leukocytes. Whereas secretion was enhanced by removal of specific phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, chemotaxis and receptor internalization were inhibited by loss of receptor phosphorylation. In contrast, IL-8 mediated actin polymerization, PLCβ3 phosphorylation, receptor cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of Ca2+ response were not affected. Moreover, the lack of receptor phosphorylation did not affect cross-desensitization of or by M2CXR1 at the level of Ca2+ mobilization. These data further underscore the presence of downstream effector(s) of receptor class-desensitization which appear to be regulated independently of receptor phosphorylation and enhanced G protein turnover. We are grateful to Dr. Michael C. Grimm for helpful advice and assistance in setting up the chemotaxis assay."

Whereas Jak1 associates with IL-2Rβ, Jak3 associates primarily with γc but also with IL-2Rβ. We analyzed four IL-2Rβ mutations that diminish IL-2-induced proliferation and found that each also decreased IL-2-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation. For this reason, and because the mutations were in the IL-2Rβ membrane-proximal region, we investigated and found that each mutation diminished IL-2Rβ association with both Jak1 and Jak3. This suggested that these Jaks might interact with the same region of IL-2Rβ; however, certain IL-2Rβ internal deletions and C-terminal truncations differentially affected the association of Jak1 and Jak3. Interestingly, just as Jak1-IL-2Rβ association is Jak3-independent and functionally important, we show that Jak3-IL-2Rβ association is Jak1-independent and implicate this association as being important for IL-2-induced Stat5 activation. Moreover, Jak1 and Jak3 could associate only in the presence of IL-2Rβ, suggesting that these kinases can simultaneously bind to IL-2Rβ. Thus, our data not only demonstrate that somewhat more distal as well as membrane-proximal cytoplasmic regions of a type I cytokine receptor are important for Jak kinase association but also suggest that two IL-2Rβ-Jak kinase interactions are important for IL-2 signaling.

Three classes of IL-2 receptors exist, binding IL-2 with low (K d = 10−8m), intermediate (K d = 10−9m), and high (K d = 10−11m) affinity. The low affinity receptors contain only the IL-2 receptor α chain (IL-2Rα); intermediate affinity receptors contain IL-2Rβ and the common cytokine receptor γ chain, γc; and high affinity receptors contain all three chains (3Sugamura K.

In addition to its ability to constitutively interact with Jak1, although it is not well appreciated, IL-2Rβ can also associate with Jak3 following IL-2 stimulation of lymphoid cells (10Russell S.M.

Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), but the regions of interaction between IL-2Rβ and Jak3 have not previously been investigated. A number of membrane proximal cytoplasmic point mutants of IL-2Rβ that diminish IL-2-induced proliferation have been identified (18Mori H. Barsoumian E.L. Hatakeyama M. Taniguchi T. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Goldsmith M.A. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Greene W.C. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that these mutants also diminish IL-2-induced STAT protein activation and the association of both Jak1 and Jak3 with IL-2Rβ. This led us to further characterize the regions of IL-2Rβ required for the binding of Jak1 and Jak3, and we demonstrate that membrane distal as well as membrane proximal regions of IL-2Rβ are vital for Jak kinase interaction. Moreover, the association between Jak3 and IL-2Rβ is Jak1-independent and both Jak3 and Jak1 can be coprecipitated only in the presence of IL-2Rβ. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that the association between IL-2Rβ and Jak3 is important for potent Stat5 activation in response to IL-2 and, thus, that more than one IL-2Rβ-Jak kinase interaction is involved in IL-2 signaling. The IL-2Rβ constructs with point mutations in the cytoplasmic chain were prepared using an in vitro mutagenesis kit (5 Prime-3 Prime, Inc.) and wild-type IL-2Rβ as the template. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were as follows (mutant nucleotides are underlined): 5′-AAGTGTAACACCTCAGACCCCTCG-3′ (for P257S); 5′-GTAACACCCCAGCGCCCTCGAAGTTC-3′ (for D258A); 5′-GACGTCCAGAAGGGGCTCTCTTCG-3′ (for W277G); and 5′-CTGGCACCTGAGATATCGCCAGCAGAAGTGCTGGAG-3′ (for L299A). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type IL-2Rβ or IL-2Rβ constructs containing internal deletion or truncation mutations in its cytoplasmic domain (see Fig. 3 A), were cloned in the expression vector, pME18S, in which transcription is directed by the SRα promoter. pME18S also contains the SV40 origin of replication and is expressed at high copy number in either 293T+ or COS-7 cells, both of which express the SV40 large T antigen. Internal deletion mutants of IL-2Rβ (βΔA, βΔS) were generated by loop-out mutagenesis using single-stranded M13 bacteriophage as a template. IL-2Rβ truncation mutants (β379, β371, β362, β350, β330, β313, β300, β290, and β267) were prepared using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify BclI to XbaI fragments of IL-2Rβ with premature termination codons, followed by subcloning into pME18S-IL-2Rβ in which the BclI to XbaI fragment was excised. The IL-2Rβ construct with four tyrosines changed to phenylalanines (βFFFFYY) was described previously (21Friedmann M.C. Migone T.S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rice, National Cancer Institute), and E1C3 cells (Jak1-deficient HeLa cells, provided by Dr. R. Flavell, Yale University) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using either DEAE-dextran (for COS-7 cells) or calcium phosphate (for 293T+ and E1C3 cells) methods. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were transfected in 150-mm dishes using 2–3 μg of each plasmid. Transfectants were harvested 36–48 h later. For experiments in which IL-2-induced STAT DNA binding activity was reconstituted, cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes using 1–2 μg of each plasmid, and nuclear extracts were made 36–48 h later. 32D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% from WEHI-3B cells conditioned medium (WEHI-CM) as a source of IL-3, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Stable transfectants expressing wild-type or mutant forms of IL-2Rβ were created by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 300 V and 960 microfarads. Cells (5 × 106/condition) were cotransfected with linearized IL-2Rβ constructs and pcDNA3neo. 24 h after electroporation, cells were aliquoted into 24-well plates using medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant clones were stained for IL-2Rβ expression with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-p75 (IL-2Rβ) monoclonal antibody (Endogen) and analyzed on a FACSort (Becton-Dickinson).

Immunoblots were performed using antibodies to Jak1 (Transduction Labs and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Jak3, or IL-2Rβ (goat anti-human IL-2Rβ, R&D Systems). COS-7, 293T+, or E1C3 transient transfectants (one 150-mm culture dish) or 32D stable transfectants (5–10 × 106 cells) were harvested by washing with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin). IL-2Rβ-Jak3 or Jak3-IL-2Rβ-Jak1 associations were assessed by immunoprecipitation with hMikβ1 or anti-Jak3 at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Samples were washed four times with lysis buffer, analyzed on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (NOVEX), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), immunoblotted with different antibodies, and developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia biotech or Pierce). Extracts were prepared from 293T+ or COS-7 transfectants (cells from one 100-mm culture dish) or from 32D cells (1 × 107 cells) that were starved of growth factor for 4 h in RPMI 1640 medium and treated with 2 nm IL-2 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26Lin J.-X. Migone T.S. Tsang M. Friedmann M. Weatherbee J.A. Zhou L. Yamauchi A.

For EMSAs, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) was used as a nonspecific competitor and 15,000 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a trimer of the GAS sequence (5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTC-3′) from the β-casein promoter (a motif capable of binding IL-2-activated STAT proteins) was used as the probe. The reactions were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA and autoradiographed. 32D cells were washed and starved of growth factor for 4 h in RPMI medium. Cells were aliquoted at 2–4 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate in triplicate in 200 μl of medium or medium containing 2 nm IL-2 or 5% WEHI-CM. After 20 h of incubation at 37 °C, 1 μCi of 3H-labeled thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested using a cell harvester (Tom Tec), and thymidine incorporation was assayed using a Betaplate 1205 counter (Wallac). For each transfectant, at least three clones with similar IL-2Rβ expression were assayed. Four IL-2Rβ mutants, including P257S (proline 257 replaced by serine), D258A, W277G, and L299A, have been reported to impair IL-2-induced proliferation in Ba/F3 or MOLT4 cells (18Mori H.

We first made stable transfectants of each of these mutants in 32D cells and confirmed similar cell surface expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 A). As expected, we confirmed that these mutants mediated greatly diminished proliferation, as compared with wild-type IL-2Rβ, in 32D cells, which lack IL-2Rβ but can proliferate in response to IL-2 after IL-2Rβ is transfected and expressed (Refs. 21Friedmann M.C.

Moreover, each of these mutations also diminished IL-2-induced STAT binding activity in transfected 32D cells (Fig. 1 C) as well as in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 D).

Given the diminished STAT activation and that each of these mutations are contained in a region of IL-2Rβ where Jak kinase interactions might be affected (Box B1/Box B2 region, see Refs.29Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6523-6530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we tested if these mutations diminished the association of Jak1 or Jak3 as a possible explanation for the decreased IL-2 signaling. Because the IL-2Rβ-Jak3 interaction is only well seen in T cells following IL-2 stimulation, we used an overexpression system to map the regions of IL-2Rβ that mediate association with Jak1 and Jak3. COS-7 cells were transfected with Jak1 or Jak3 and IL-2Rβ mutants, cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with hMikβ1 antibody to IL-2Rβ and then blotted with antibodies to IL-2Rβ (Fig. 2 A), Jak1 (Fig. 2 B), or Jak3 (Fig. 2 C). Jak1 and Jak3 each exhibited less binding to each of the IL-2Rβ mutants than to wild-type IL-2Rβ (Fig. 2, B and C). Because each of the IL-2Rβ point mutations interfered with the association of both Jak1 and Jak3, we hypothesized that the regions of IL-2Rβ that were important for Jak kinase interaction might be similar. To investigate this possibility and to map the regions of IL-2Rβ involved in the binding of both Jak kinases, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with Jak1, Jak3, and wild-type IL-2Rβ or a series of IL-2Rβ truncation mutants (Fig. 3 A). Cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-2Rβ antibody, followed by Western blotting with antibodies to IL-2Rβ (to control for expression and the efficiency of immunoprecipitation, Fig. 3 B), Jak1 (Fig. 3 C), or Jak3 (Fig. 3 D). IL-2Rβ truncation mutants retaining 350 (β350 construct) or more residues (β362, β371, and β379 constructs) could bind efficiently to Jak1 (Fig. 3 C); β330 and β313 bound to Jak1 weakly; whereas β300, β290, and β267 could not bind to Jak1. Therefore, the region between residues 300 and 350 of IL-2Rβ is important for its interaction with Jak1. In contrast, the region between residues 330 and 362 was important for the Jak3-IL-2Rβ interaction, given that there was efficient coprecipitation of Jak3 with β362 but no detectable coprecipitation of Jak3 with β330 even at longer exposure times (Fig. 3 D and data not shown). Wild-type IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rβ mutants retaining the first 362, 371, or 379 amino acids could associate with both Jak1 and Jak3. These results in COS-7 cells were confirmed using 293T+ cells (data not shown). Thus, the 300–350 and 330–362 regions of IL-2Rβ are important for Jak1 and Jak3 binding, respectively (summarized below in Fig. 8). We next tested the effect of internal deletions of the S region (residues 267 to 322) or the A region (residues 313 to 382) on the binding of Jak1 (Fig. 4 A) and Jak3 (Fig. 4 B). Deletion of the S region (βΔS) resulted in a dramatic decrease in IL-2Rβ association with Jak1, consistent with previously reported results (17Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of the A region only modestly decreased Jak1 association (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to the findings for Jak1, deletion of the A region had a much greater effect on the association of Jak3 than did deletion of the S region (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the A region of IL-2Rβ is more important for Jak3 association, whereas the S region is more important for Jak1 association. Consistent with the data in Fig. 3, these data indicate that Jak3 binding extends to a more distal region of the IL-2Rβ cytoplasmic domain than does Jak1. Therefore, the data contained in Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate that Jak1 and Jak3 interact with different, albeit overlapping regions of IL-2Rβ. As the A region contains four tyrosines (Tyr-338, Tyr-355, Tyr-358, and Tyr-361), we evaluated the ability of Jak3 to associate with IL-2Rβ containing mutations in these tyrosines (IL-2RβFFFFYY). As shown in Fig. 4 D, Jak3 efficiently associated with this mutant, indicating that the interaction does not depend on phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Given that Jak1 is ubiquitously expressed, it was possible that the interaction of Jak3 with IL-2Rβ required Jak1. To investigate this possibility, we transfected Jak1-deficient HeLa cells (E1C3 cells) with Jak3 + wild-type IL-2Rβ ± Jak1. Transfected cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with hMikβ1, followed by blotting with an antiserum to Jak3. We found that IL-2Rβ and Jak3 could interact even in the absence of Jak1, and the presence of Jak1 did not enhance this interaction (Fig. 5 A,first two lanes). The uniformity of expression of Jak3, Jak1, and IL-2Rβ was verified by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies (Fig. 5 B). We also used E1C3 cells to map the region of IL-2Rβ required for its interaction with Jak3, and confirmed the findings reported above in Figs. 3 and 4 (data not shown). Because the association between Jak3 and IL-2Rβ was Jak1-independent, and Jak1 could be coprecipitated with IL-2Rβ in the absence of Jak3, we next investigated whether Jak1 and Jak3 could be coprecipitated through IL-2Rβ. COS-7 cells were transfected with Jak1, Jak3, and either pME18S, wild-type IL-2Rβ, or IL-2Rβ deletion constructs (βΔA, βΔS, and β350) that were missing regions important for the interaction of either Jak1 and/or Jak3 (see Figs. 3and 4). Coprecipitation of Jak3 and Jak1 required IL-2Rβ (Fig. 6 A, lane 2 versus lane 1); this association was markedly decreased when the βΔA, βΔS, or β350 mutants were used instead of wild type IL-2Rβ (lanes 3–5), further confirming that the association between Jak1 and Jak3 is dependent on the presence of IL-2Rβ. It has previously been shown that disruption of the Jak1-IL-2Rβ interaction diminished IL-2 signaling (2Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional significance of the association between IL-2Rβ and Jak3, we used Jak3-deficient 293T+ cells in which IL-2-induced Stat5 DNA binding activity could be reconstituted following transfection with IL-2Rβ, γc, Jak3, Stat5a, and Stat5b (Fig. 7 A, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 7 B, lanes 1 and 2). Previous studies indicate the vital role of Jak3 for IL-2-induced STAT activation (24Lin J.-X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10738-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Both IL-2Rβ and γcwere required since little, if any, IL-2-induced Stat5 DNA binding activity was seen in the absence of either γc (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1 and 2) or IL-2Rβ (Fig. 7 A, lanes 3 and 4). However, a truncated form of γc (γc-ΔCT) that is missing 80 of 86 amino acids of the γc cytoplasmic domain and contributes to IL-2 binding (22Noguchi M. Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Ziegler S.F. Tsang M.

This activity was diminished when Jak3 (Fig. 7 B, lanes 5 and 6) was deleted, implicating the IL-2Rβ-Jak3 interaction as being important for STAT activation. IL-2 signaling requires the dimerization of both IL-2Rβ and γc. As Jak1 has been shown to associate with IL-2Rβ and Jak3 with γc, an attractive model has been that each receptor chain associates with a different Jak family kinase in a selective manner and that IL-2-mediated activation of Jak1 and Jak3 initiates a signaling cascade(s). It is well established that the γc-Jak3 interaction (10Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S.

We now provide evidence that Jak3 and IL-2Rβ can associate with each other in a Jak1-independent fashion. The fact that IL-2Rβ provides interaction sites for Jak3 as well as Jak1 (see Figs.8 and 9) suggests that a function of γc might be not only to recruit Jak3 but also to facilitate the “delivery” of Jak3 to IL-2Rβ. Moreover, the ability of Jak3 to associate with both IL-2Rβ and γc suggests that Jak3 might stabilize the receptor complex and promote downstream signaling. Our studies on the reconstitution of IL-2-induced Stat5 activation in 293T+ cells provide evidence that the full activation of Stat5 requires IL-2Rβ association with both Jak1 and Jak3, and that the heretofore poorly appreciated IL-2Rβ-Jak3 association has physiological significance. We have now delineated regions on IL-2Rβ that are important for the interaction of Jak1 and Jak3. We show that four point mutations in the Box B1/Box B2 region of IL-2Rβ that diminished proliferation also decreased the binding of both Jak1 and Jak3. This is consistent with the important role of this region of a number of type I cytokine receptors for Jak interaction (14Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev.

Interestingly, however, analysis of a series of deletion and truncation mutants not only demonstrated differences in the regions of IL-2Rβ that mediate recruitment of Jak1 versus Jak3, but unexpectedly also provided evidence that regions more distal than previously suspected play major roles in the recruitment of the Jak kinases (see Fig. 8). To our knowledge, these data represent the most detailed mapping on a cytokine receptor of the region/residues involved in Jak kinase association. Previously, for all cytokine receptors studied, including IL-2Rβ, only the membrane proximal and Box1/Box2 regions have been shown to be important for the association of Jak kinases; thus, our findings have implications regarding the interaction sites of Jak kinases for other type I cytokine receptors as well. Although some receptor chains, such as γc, appear to be uniquely associated with a single Jak, the gp130 signal transducing receptor component that is shared by the receptors for IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1, can associate with more than one Jak. gp130 has been reported to associate with Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 (35Lutticken C.

Proteins were isolated from control and down-regulated rat ovary and were incubated with in vitro transcribed RNAs corresponding to the full-length LH/hCG receptor, as well as 5'- and 3'-truncated receptor forms. Resultant ribonucleoprotein complexes were analyzed by RNA gel mobility shift. A prominent Mr 50,000 ribonucleoprotein complex was identified with the following characteristics: 1) specificity for LH/hCG receptor open reading frame sequences located between nucleotides 102 and 282; 2) lack of competition by nonspecific RNAs; 3) a 3-fold increase in RNA binding activity during hCG-induced receptor down-regulation; and 4) limited tissue expression. This report describes the first evidence of an LH/hCG receptor mRNA binding protein, which we term LRBP-1, for luteinizing hormone receptor RNA binding protein-1. This protein is a candidate for a trans-acting factor involved in the hormonal regulation of LH/hCG receptor mRNA stability in rat ovary."
https://openalex.org/W2092265778,"Transcription factor C/EBPβ has been known to regulate a wide array of genes including those involved in the acute-phase response. One of the molecular mechanisms underlying transcription activation by C/EBPβ is through protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors. Here we report the identification and characterization of physical and functional interactions between C/EBPβ and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. This interaction results in the repression of C/EBPβ-dependent trans-activation of the agp gene. Footprinting assays indicate that hnRNP K cannot bind to the promoter region of agp gene or interfere with the binding of C/EBPβ to its cognate DNA site. Furthermore,agp gene activation by the synergistic interaction of Nopp140 and C/EBPβ is abolished by hnRNP K. The kinetics of appearance of C/EBPβ-hnRNP K complex in the nuclear extract after initiation of acute-phase reaction indicates that hnRNP K functions as a negative regulator of C/EBPβ-mediated activation of agpgene."

Begley C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5495-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the high levels of soluble LIFRα in mouse serum, its analogue was not detected in human serum (17Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8616-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, a soluble form of gp130 with a M rof 90,000–110,000 has been found in human serum (19Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Ohsugi Y. Fukui H. Koishihara Y. Yancopoulos G. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although gp130 functions as the high affinity converting and signaling subunit in the receptor complexes for IL-6, LIF, OSM, CNTF, cardiotrophin-1, and IL-11, OSM was the only cytokine in this family initially demonstrated to bind to membrane-bound gp130 (3Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), and subsequently, it has been shown that OSM can bind directly to the soluble form of gp130 with low affinity (21Sporeno E.

Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We and others have recently shown that the soluble form of gp130 was able to bind not only directly and specifically to OSM but also to LIF (22Modrell B. Liu J. Miller H. Shoyab M. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using biosensor technology, we were able to determine that the interaction between hLIF and soluble human gp130 was of low affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of approximately 44 nm (23Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This low affinity interaction could explain previous failures in detecting direct binding of LIF to the membrane-bound form of gp130. In this study, we present evidence that there are two distinct truncated forms of gp130 in normal human urine and plasma: a large form with a M r of approximately 100,000, which is similar to that previously described (19Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Ohsugi Y. Fukui H. Koishihara Y. Yancopoulos G. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a previously undescribed small form with a M r of approximately 50,000. Both forms bound LIF specifically and were capable of forming heterotrimeric complexes with soluble hLIFRα in the presence of hLIF. In addition to the soluble forms of gp130, a soluble form of LIFRα was also detected in human urine and plasma. Escherichia coli-expressed hLIF (a gift from Sandoz Pharmaceutical Co., Hanover, Switzerland) was radioiodinated using a modified iodine monochloride method (24Contreras M.A. Bale W.F. Spar I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 277-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Anti-human gp130 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), AM64, GPX22, and GPZ35, which were raised against Chinese hamster ovary cell-expressed extracellular domain of human gp130, were prepared as described previously (10Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 25Saito T. Taga T. Miki D. Futatsugi K. Yawata H. Kishimoto T. Yasukawa K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 163: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A goat anti-human LIFRα polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of human LIFRα was purchased from R & D Systems. A soluble form of human gp130 (shgp130), which consists of the Ig-like domain, hemopoietin domain, and three FN III modules, was expressed in the methylotropic yeast P. pastoris with a FLAGTM epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) at its N terminus and purified on an anti-FLAG M2 affinity column by elution with FLAG peptide as described previously (23Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A short form of soluble human gp130 (sshgp130) was made identically as shgp130 except that the construct lacked all three FN III modules. Protein quantitation for the purified samples was performed by amino acid analysis. To make a soluble form of hLIFRα, a cDNA encoding the hLIFRα (26Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Lock P. Willson T.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was altered at its 5′-end to encode an XhoI site and an in-frame 12CA5 epitope (YPYDVPDYA) (27Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The sequence at the N terminus of the recombinant LIFRα was GAPYPYDVPDYA. The 3′-end was modified to encode an XbaI site and a stop codon was introduced after position 536 (2Gearing D. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) so that the recombinant LIFRα only contained the two hemopoietin domains and the intervening Ig-like domain. The cDNA was subsequently cloned into the yeast expression vector pPIC9 and expressed in P. pastoris as described (23Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The protein was partially purified by gel filtration chromatography and quantified by Scatchard analysis of hLIF binding isotherms (17Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8616-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Male and female normal human urine was collected from volunteers after informed consent, and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide were added. Small scale urine concentration was carried out using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon), and large scale concentration was performed using the Sartorius EasyFlow Device with a cellulose triacetate membrane (molecular weight cut-off of 20,000). Any precipitating materials in urine occurring before or after concentration were removed by centrifugation. Concentrated human urine was applied to a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (0.15 m), pH 7.0, containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide (PBS). Samples were eluted with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of samples were incubated with125I-hLIF in the absence or presence of unlabeled hLIF or antibodies in a final volume of 15 μl for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Then 5 μl of a 12 mm solution of the bifunctional cross-linker BS3 (Pierce) in 20 mmphosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were mixed with 7 μl of 4-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer and analyzed by either 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The gels were dried and visualized by either autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). The rhLIF affinity column was prepared by covalently coupling 1 mg of E. coli-derived rhLIF to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Normal human urine samples were concentrated 100-fold as described above and incubated with 1 ml of hLIF-Affi-Gel 10 resin for 3–5 h at 4 °C. After unbound proteins were removed by centrifugation, the hLIF affinity beads were washed with 16 × 1 ml of PBS followed by additional washes with 8 × 0.3 ml of 10-fold diluted Actisep elution medium (Sterogenes Bioseparations, CA). The bound protein was then eluted with 10 × 0.3 ml of undiluted Actisep elution medium. The affinity column eluates were buffer-exchanged into PBS using NAP-5 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Using the same procedures, LIF-binding proteins were enriched and partially purified on the hLIF affinity column from 50 ml of an outdated normal human plasma sample (obtained from the Royal Melbourne Hospital Blood Bank). Aliquots of buffer-exchanged fractions were analyzed for their ability to bind to 125I-hLIF using the cross-linking protocol described above. Aliquots (20 μl) of the hLIF affinity column eluate, 0.2 μg/ml shLIFRα, or 2 μg/ml shgp130 were incubated with 125I-hLIF (800,000 cpm) in the absence or presence of 50 μg/ml unlabeled hLIF in a final volume of 50 μl for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Then 10 μl of a 12 mmBS3 solution was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After adding 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 50 mm, the cross-linking reactions were incubated for 40 min at room temperature. The cross-linked samples were then mixed with an anti-human LIFRα polyclonal antibody at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the mixtures were added to 30 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose gel slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged, and the protein G-Sepharose beads were washed with 4 × 0.5 ml of PBS. For elution, the beads were mixed with 30 μl of 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer. The supernatants were then analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Protein concentrations of pure recombinant soluble receptors were determined by amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 high performance amino acid analyzer equipped with a model 7000 data analyzer (Beckman). M1 cells (∼107 cells/sample) were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with either 1 ng of hLIF or saline together with either soluble hLIF receptor or soluble hgp130 and then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and proteinase inhibitors. After pelleting insoluble material and protein standardization, approximately 100 μg of total cellular proteins were subjected to 4–15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred to a prewetted polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF-Plus, Micron Separations Inc.). After blocking, the membrane was incubated with an anti-phospho-STAT-3 polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs), followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit Ig polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO, Denmark). The phosphorylated STAT-3 protein was visualized by radiography using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To check the quantity of protein loading, the same membranes were stripped with 0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, for 30–60 min and washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 before reprobing with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to STAT-3 (K-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). To quantify the soluble LIFRα, an aliquot of an outdated normal human plasma sample (obtained from the Royal Melbourne Hospital Blood Bank) was first precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads at a ratio of 1:0.2 (v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein G-absorbed plasma was then incubated in the presence or absence of 2 μg of a goat anti-human LIFRα polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of recombinant shLIFRα at various concentrations was performed in parallel except that the preabsorption step with protein G beads was not included. The immunocomplexes were washed with 3 × 1 ml of PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 and eluted from the protein G beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions for 5 min before being subjected to 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. The Western blotting was performed as described above except that the anti-human LIFRα polyclonal antibody and a rabbit anti-goat Ig polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO, Denmark) were used as the first and second antibodies, respectively. Human urine samples, collected from six healthy individuals (H1–H6) were concentrated and tested for soluble LIF-binding proteins by chemical cross-linking. Analysis of the cross-linking products by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) indicated that 125I-hLIF was cross-linked specifically to two species of proteins in all six samples with M r of approximately 100,000 (here referred to as the “large form”) and 50,000 (here referred to as the “small form”) after subtraction for the M r of the bound unglycosylated hLIF, respectively. The levels of the two hLIF-binding proteins varied in the six samples. This variation was likely to be due to the differences in protein content of these samples (data not shown). To examine whether the two hLIF-binding proteins were part of a preformed complex in urine, concentrated human urine was fractionated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column as shown in Fig. 2 A, and fractions were then analyzed for 125I-hLIF binding by chemical cross-linking. Analysis of column fractions 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 31 by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) after cross-linking showed that the two hLIF-binding proteins were completely separated from each other according to their sizes, suggesting that they do not exist in a preformed complex in human urine. The M restimates of the two proteins by gel filtration were consistent with those obtained above. Also, it can be seen from Fig. 2 B that there was a downward trend in M r for both the large and small forms of the LIF-binding proteins across the fractions being assayed. This may be due to differential glycosylation of the two proteins. In mouse and human serum, the presence of soluble forms of the LIF receptor components, mouse LIFRα and human gp130, respectively, has been described (17Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D.

Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although the affinity was relatively low (23Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Hudson K.R. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11971-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To examine whether the detected125I-hLIF binding activity in human urine was due to the presence of these reported proteins, we first performed competitive cross-linking experiments, as shown in Fig. 3, in which 125I-hLIF was mixed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled hLIF prior to cross-linking to a partially purified urinary LIF-binding protein sample (Fig. 3 A). This was then compared with the same cross-linking to (a) a recombinant form of soluble human gp130 (shgp130; Fig. 3 B), which consists of the Ig-like domain, hemopoietin domain, and three FN III modules with a FLAGTM epitope tag at the N terminus, (b) a recombinant short form of soluble human gp130 (sshgp130; Fig. 3 C) identical to shgp130 except that the construct lacked the FN III modules, or (c) a recombinant form of soluble human LIFRα (shLIFRα; Fig. 3 D). Densitometric analyses of these data (not shown) revealed that half-maximal inhibition of125I-hLIF cross-linking to both the large and small forms of the two urinary binding proteins occurred at approximately 750 ng/ml unlabeled hLIF, similar to the hLIF concentrations required to inhibit 50% of the cross-linking to both shgp130 and sshgp130, whereas an approximately 3-fold smaller amount of hLIF was required to achieve the same inhibition for shLIFRα. These results indicated that the relative binding affinities of 125I-hLIF to the two forms of urinary binding proteins were similar to those of125I-hLIF to recombinant shgp130 and sshgp130, suggesting that the LIF binding activity in human urine might be due to the presence of soluble forms of gp130 with different truncations at the C-terminal ends. To formally test this possibility, the urinary LIF-binding proteins were first purified by a hLIF affinity chromatography step as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The eluates from the hLIF affinity column were then fractionated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column to separate the large and small forms of the LIF-binding proteins (data not shown). The appropriate fractions were subsequently analyzed in cross-linking experiments, in which 125I-hLIF was incubated with the purified large or small form of the urinary LIF-binding protein in the presence of anti-shgp130 mAbs prior to cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4, cross-linking in the presence of mAb AM64 yielded a higher M r complex in addition to the 125I-hLIF·large form complex (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 6 and 8) without a significant effect on 125I-hLIF cross-linking to the small form (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 6 and 8), whereas the addition of mAb GPZ35 in the cross-linking mixture generated higher M r complexes in both cases (Fig. 4 A and B, lanes 10). In contrast, mAb GPX22 completely inhibited the cross-linking of125I-hLIF to the small form (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 6 and 9) but only partially inhibited the125I-hLIF cross-linking to the large form (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 6 and 9). For comparison, these mAbs were also added to the cross-linking mixtures of recombinant shgp130, sshgp130, and shLIFRα. As before, mAb AM64 only affected shgp130 (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) but not sshgp130 (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) cross-linking to125I-hLIF. Unexpectedly, mAb GPZ35 did not significantly affect the cross-linking of 125I-hLIF to either shgp130 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5) or sshgp130 (Fig. 4 B, lane 5) despite being able to produce a higher M r species when added to the cross-linking mixture of the small form (Fig. 4 B, lane 10). This may be due to the possibility that mAb GPZ35 could not recognize Pichia-expressed gp130, suggesting that it recognizes a carbohydrate-related epitope. Alternatively, it may suggest that the FLAG peptide tagged at the N termini of the two recombinant Pichia-gp130 proteins somehow affects the GPZ35 binding. In the case of mAb GPX22, it almost completely inhibited the cross-linking of 125I-hLIF to both shgp130 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) and sshgp130 (Fig. 4 B,lane 4). As expected, these mAbs showed little effect on the cross-linking to shLIFRα (Fig. 4 A, lanes 13–15). By themselves, these mABs did not significantly cross-link to 125I-hLIF (Fig. 4 B, lanes 11–13). Taken together, these results revealed that the small form of the urinary LIF-binding protein was a truncated form of gp130 probably containing only the hemopoietin domain but lacking all or almost all three FN III modules and that the large urinary LIF-binding form contained gp130. Meanwhile, two observations from the antibody analysis experiments also suggested that the LIF binding activity in the purified large form fraction was not entirely due to the presence of soluble gp130. First, mAB AM64 was able to almost completely shift the125I-hLIF·shgp130 complex to a higher M r species (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) but only partially did so to the large form (Fig. 4 A, lane 8). Second, mAb GPX22 could completely inhibit the cross-linking of 125I-hLIF to the recombinant shgp130 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) but could only partially inhibit the 125I-hLIF cross-linking to the large form (Fig. 4 A, lane 9). One possibility was that the purified large form fraction also contained the soluble LIFRα component. Evidence for this also came from a large scale purification (10 liters of human urine were used) of the urinary LIF-binding proteins using hLIF affinity chromatography described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). When eluates from the affinity column were analyzed in cross-linking experiments, the fraction containing the most LIF-binding activity showed an extra higher M r species in addition to the normal large and small forms (Fig. 5, lane 8).

This inhibitory function of CD59 is markedly selective for MAC assembled from human complement components C8 and C9, and CD59 shows little inhibitory function toward MAC assembled from rabbit and many other non-primate species. We have used this species selectivity of CD59 to identify the residues regulating its complement inhibitory function: cDNA of rabbit CD59 was cloned and used to express human/rabbit CD59 chimeras in murine SV-T2 cells. Plasma membrane expression of each CD59 chimera was quantified by use of a 5′-TAG peptide epitope, and each construct was tested for its ability to inhibit assembly of functional MAC from human versus rabbit C8 and C9. These experiments revealed that the species selectivity of CD59 is entirely determined by sequence contained between residues 42 and 58 of the human CD59 polypeptide, whereas chimeric substitution outside this peptide segment has little effect on the MAC inhibitory function of CD59. Substitution of human CD59 residues 42–58 into rabbit CD59 resulted in a molecule that was functionally indistinguishable from native human CD59, whereas the complementary construct (corresponding residues of rabbit CD59 substituted into human CD59) was functionally indistinguishable from rabbit CD59. Based on the solved solution structure of CD59, these data suggest that selectivity for human C8 and C9 resides in a cluster of closely spaced side chains on the surface of CD59 contributed by His44, Asn48, Asp49, Thr51, Thr52, Arg55, and Glu58 of the polypeptide.

The amino acid sequence and solution structure of CD59 conform to those of the Ly6/cardiotoxin protein superfamily in which five internal disulfide bonds stabilize the polypeptide into a discoid structure consisting of a three-stranded β-sheet apposed to a two-stranded β-finger (14Kieffer B.

In CD59, the GPI anchor is attached to the C-terminal Asn77, and Asn18 provides a single site of N-linked glycosylation (14Kieffer B. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Willis A.C. van der Merwe P.A.

The complement inhibitory function of CD59 exhibits marked selectivity for MAC assembled from C8 and C9 of human or primate origin, and CD59 shows little inhibitory function toward these same complement components of rabbit and several other non-primate species (8Hüsler T.

Transplantation (Baltimore). 1994; 57: 1494-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Conversely, whereas rabbit erythrocytes are well protected from lysis by rabbit C5b-9, they are exquisitely sensitive to the lytic action of C5b-9 assembled from human C8 or C9 (24Houle J.J. Hoffmann E.M. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1444-1452PubMed Google Scholar, 25Houle J.J. Hoffmann E.M. Esser A.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 287-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that the CD59 homologue expressed on the surface of rabbit cells is also selective for homologous complement and cannot effectively interact with the human C8 and C9 components to inhibit MAC. We have previously taken advantage of the species selectivity inherent to the interaction of CD59 with C8 and C9 to map the peptide-binding sites within the human C8 and C9 proteins that are recognized by human CD59 (7Lockert D.H.

In those studies, the capacity of human CD59 to inhibit MAC assembly was measured using recombinant human/rabbit chimeras of C8 and C9 in order to identify the residues within the C8α and C9 polypeptides that are specifically required to confer recognition of these complement components by human CD59. Using a similar strategy of functional mapping in human/rabbit CD59 chimeras expressed on the surface of transfected cell lines, we now report the identity of the residues of plasma membrane CD59 that confer its capacity to selectively inhibit the pore-forming activity of human MAC. Rabbit whole blood and chicken whole blood in acid citrate dextrose were from Cocalico Biologics, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). Human serum, rabbit serum, human serum depleted of complement protein C8 (C8D), human complement proteins (C5b67, C8, and C9), and rabbit complement proteins (C8 and C9) were purified and assayed as described previously (8Hüsler T.

Fetal bovine serum, calf serum, cell dissociation buffer, l-glutamate, penicillin, streptomycin, trypsin, and Geneticin were from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Rabbit anti-mouse lymphocyte IgG was the product of Inter-Cell Technologies (Hoewel, NJ). Human CD59 cDNA-pUC18 and murine monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the TAG peptide were generous gifts from Dr. A. L. M. Bothwell (Yale Medical School, New Haven, CT). Silver stain, Coomassie Blue, and BCA protein assay reagents were from Pierce. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. Rabbit erythrocyte ghost membranes were prepared as described previously for human CD59 purification and suspended to a final volume representing 1.5 times the original volume of packed erythrocytes (4Davies A. Simmons D.L. Hale G. Harrison R.A. Tighe H. Lachmann P.J. Waldmann H. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 637-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The ghost suspension was brought to 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1-butanol added slowly to 20% (v/v). Following stirring (3 h at 4 °C) and centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C), the butanol-saturated aqueous phase was collected, and CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) and dialyzed against 0.1% CHAPS and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The dialyzed extract was applied to a 2.5 × 10-cm DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Sigma) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with 500 ml of a linear NaCl gradient (0–400 mm). Fractions were tested for MAC inhibitory function using chicken erythrocyte target cells as described previously, substituting rabbit C8 and C9 for human C8 and C9 (10Rollins S.A. Sims P.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3478-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing rabbit MAC inhibitory activity were pooled, and NaCl was added to final concentration of 300 mm. The pool was applied to a 1.6 × 8-cm phenyl-Sepharose column (Sigma) equilibrated with 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% CHAPS, and 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Following washing with the same solution, protein was eluted with a linear gradient representing 0.05–1% CHAPS and 300 to 0 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The active fractions were pooled and further purified on a 0.5 × 5-cm Mono Q HR column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) using a gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in 0.5% CHAPS and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Active fractions were concentrated by step elution on a Mono Q column and further purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% NuPAGE gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) run under nonreducing conditions. The protein band at 20 kDa (∼8 μg of total protein from the original 300 ml of packed rabbit erythrocytes) was eluted from the gel slice into 0.1% CHAPS and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and the inhibitory activity of the eluted protein toward rabbit MAC was confirmed by functional assay. All column chromatography procedures were performed at room temperature on a BioCAD 20 perfusion chromatography workstation (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). N-terminal sequence was then obtained through 40 cycles of Edman degradation (Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), yielding SLMCYHCLLPSPNCSTVTNCTPNHDACLTAVSGPRVYRQC. Degenerate oligonucleotides were constructed based on peptide sequence and used to amplify a rabbit lymphocyte cDNA library (5′-RACE, Marathon kit) from which a 200-base pair PCR product was obtained. Specific primers based on this 200-base pair cDNA were designed and used to amplify the rabbit lymphocyte cDNA library by 3′-RACE. Full-length cDNA of rabbit CD59 was obtained by linking the PCR products from 5′- and 3′-RACE using PCR. The sequence of this cDNA clone was deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AF040387), and the deduced amino acid sequence of the predicted open reading frame is shown in Fig. 1. The predicted translation product consists of 124 residues, including a 24-residue signal peptide before the N-terminal Ser1 of the mature protein. The unusual N-terminal Ser1 of the mature rabbit CD59 protein was confirmed at both the protein and DNA levels (see Fig. 1). The 467-base pair insert encoding human CD59 was released from pUC18 using EcoRI restriction sites and subcloned into the EcoRI site in the pcDNA3 expression vector. The vector with correct CD59 cDNA orientation was selected and used as template for PCR. A 33-base pair oligonucleotide (corresponding to the TAG peptide sequence EQKLISEEDLN) was inserted between the leader sequence of CD59 and the N-terminal amino acid (Leu1) of the mature protein using PCR. Rabbit TAG-CD59 in the pcDNA3 vector was made by replacing the sequence in human TAG-CD59 pcDNA3 with the sequence encoding mature rabbit CD59 and the rabbit CD59 C-terminal signal using HindIII and XbaI sites in pcDNA3. cDNAs encoding the human/rabbit chimeric CD59 constructs depicted in Fig. 2 (panels I–VI) were prepared using PCR amplification by procedures previously described (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 plasmids containing human or rabbit CD59 sequence were used as template to generate the cDNA encoding chimeric CD59 proteins. The chimeric cDNA was then inserted into the pcDNA3 vector using HindIII and XbaI sites. Human, rabbit, and human/rabbit chimeric TAG-CD59 pcDNA3 plasmids were used to transform E. colistrain TOP10. Constructs from independent colonies were sequenced in their entirety in both directions by automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) or by dideoxy sequencing using the Sequenase Version 2.0 kit. Plasmids containing the desired constructs without nucleotide error were selected and amplified for expression in the SV-T2 cell line. SV-T2 cells were transfected with human, rabbit, or chimeric TAG-CD59 pcDNA3 by electroporation as described previously (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After 48 h, stable transfectants were selected with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin for 10 days. If episomal replication in the transfected cells was desired, 8 × 106 SV-T2 cells were transfected with 120 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation using Gene Pulse (Bio-Rad) at 360 V and 500 microfarads (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Geneticin-selected cells were stained with murine monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the TAG epitope followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody against mouse IgG and sorted by flow cytometry (FACStar Plus, Becton Dickinson). Individual clones were then obtained by limiting dilution in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. Comparison was made to clonal cell lines derived by transfection with pcDNA3 lacking insert (vector-only controls). The cell-surface expression of each TAG-CD59 construct in transfected SV-T2 cells was quantified by the binding at saturation of murine monoclonal antibody 9E10 (against the TAG epitope) as described previously (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Following growth to near confluence, cells were detached and incubated for 30 min at 23 °C with murine monoclonal antibody 9E10 (100 μg/ml) in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated (20 min at 23 °C) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) as described previously (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The complement inhibitory activity of recombinant CD59 expressed on the transfected SV-T2 cells was evaluated by a minor modification of methods previously described (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Zhao J. Rollins S.A. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13418-13422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cell clones expressing each chimeric CD59 construct, human C5b67 was deposited on the plasma membrane, and susceptibility to the lytic activity of either human C8 and C9 or rabbit C8 and C9 was measured and compared with identically treated clones expressing wild-type human or rabbit CD59. Briefly, SV-T2 cells grown to 80% confluence were washed and loaded with BCECF/AM dye. C5b67 complexes were deposited on the cells using 40% human C8D serum as complement source. After two washes, the C5b67 cells were incubated in serum-free medium either with 2 μg/ml human C8 and 5 μg/ml human C9 or with 4 μg/ml rabbit C8 and 5 μg/ml rabbit C9. MAC-mediated cell lysis was determined from the measured release of BCECF dye from the cytoplasm, with correction for nonspecific dye leakage from matched controls omitting C8 and C9, as described previously (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, MAC-mediated lysis of the vector-only SV-T2 controls not expressing recombinant CD59 ranged from 75 to 90%. The predicted translation product of cDNA encoding rabbit CD59 consists of 124 residues, including a 24-residue signal peptide, a predicted GPI attachment site, and a 23-residue signal peptide including a transmembrane domain C-terminal to the predicted transamidase cut site (Fig. 1) (31Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Takeda J. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gerber L.D. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12168-12173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of protein purified from rabbit erythrocytes and analysis of the signal peptidase cleavage site of the translated cDNA confirmed that rabbit CD59 contains an additional Ser residue before the highly conserved N-terminal Leu1 found in all other CD59 homologues that have been sequenced to date. Therefore, to simplify discussion of the aligned residues of human and rabbit CD59 in various chimeric constructs, we have renumbered residues of the mature rabbit CD59 polypeptide commencing with [N-Ser0]-Leu1-Met2-Cys3- etc. (Fig. 1). All references to amino acids in rabbit C59 are based on this renumbering of residues in the mature polypeptide. Whereas Gly76 is a predicted transamidase cut site for GPI attachment, the possibility of cleavage at another residue (e.g. Asp74) cannot be excluded. SV-T2 cell lines expressing various levels of cell-surface CD59 (human or rabbit) were produced through stable transfection with the TAG-CD59 pcDNA3 plasmid. Each cell line was then tested for its capacity to resist lysis by C5b-9. As has been previously described, cells transfected to express human CD59 were nearly completely protected from lysis by human C5b-9, and this protective effect of human CD59 was not observed when rabbit C8 and C9 substituted for human C8 and C9 in the C5b-9 complex (plotted curves in Fig. 2,panels I–VI). On the other hand, rabbit CD59 expressed on the surface of this murine cell line conferred a selective resistance to lysis by C5b-9 assembled from rabbit C8 and C9, whereas we observed virtually no inhibition of the lytic action of MAC when human C5b-9 components were used. These data confirm that recombinant rabbit CD59 shows the same homologous species-selective complement inhibitory function as was inferred from the differential susceptibility of rabbit erythrocytes to lysis by human versus rabbit complement (24Houle J.J. Hoffmann E.M. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1444-1452PubMed Google Scholar,25Houle J.J. Hoffmann E.M. Esser A.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 287-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As previously noted for the human TAG-CD59 construct (29Zhou Q. Zhao J. Hüsler T. Sims P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), these data also suggest that the rabbit TAG-CD59 fusion protein retains the properties of native rabbit CD59 that is expressed in the rabbit erythrocyte membrane. To probe which residues of human CD59 conferred its ability to selectively inhibit lysis by human C5b-9, we next constructed chimeric proteins in which segments of the rabbit and human CD59 polypeptides were interchanged. Our choice of constructs reflected (i) identity of amino acid residues exposed on the surface of human CD59 that were not conserved in the aligned polypeptide sequence of rabbit CD59 (selection was based on the reported solution structure of the glycosylated protein, utilizing surface residues considered not to be occluded by the N-linked carbohydrate (1Fletcher C.M.

Immunol. 1995; 32: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Based upon these considerations, we chose to analyze six human/rabbit CD59 chimeras (and the six complementary rabbit/human CD59 chimeras) constructed so as to replace the surface-exposed side chains contributed by (i) residues 8, 10, 12, and 14 (chimeras Ch1 and Ch1R; Fig. 2, panel I); (ii) residues 5, 37, and 38 (chimeras Ch2 and Ch2R; panel II); (iii) residues 20–22 and 41 (chimeras Ch3 and Ch3R; panel III); (iv) residues 60 and 62 (chimeras Ch4 and Ch4R; panel IV); (v) residues 29, 30, 60, and 62 (chimeras Ch5 and Ch5R; panel V); or (vi) residues 44, 48, 49, 51, 52, 55, and 58 (chimeras Ch6 and Ch6R;panel VI). Individual clones expressing each of these recombinant proteins were obtained, and the expression level on the cell surface was determined from the N-terminal TAG epitope common to each construct. In each case, two separate clones were expanded for independent assay of MAC inhibitory function. SV-T2 clones expressing the chimeric constructs were analyzed for their capacity to restrict lysis mediated by MAC. The species selectivity of the complement inhibitory function of each construct was tested using human versus rabbit C8 and C9 to assemble the C5b-9 complex. In each case, results for the chimeric constructs were compared with those obtained for transfected SV-T2 cells expressing full-length CD59 (human or rabbit) and for vector-transfected SV-T2 cells lacking the CD59 insert (Fig. 2, panels I–VI). As the data of this figure reveal, the species-selective inhibitory function of either human CD59 or rabbit CD59 was unaffected by the amino acid substitutions contained in chimeras Ch1/Ch1R, Ch2/Ch2R, Ch4/Ch4R, or Ch5/Ch5R (Fig. 2, panels I, II, IV, and V). This implies that residues 1–19, 29, 30, 37, 38, 60, and 62 of the CD59 polypeptide do not directly contribute to its selective avidity for homologous C8 and C9. The results we obtained for the Ch1/Ch1R chimeras are consistent with recent observations made with human CD59/Ly6E chimeras, which had suggested that the N-terminal residues of the human CD59 polypeptide do not contribute to its MAC inhibitory functi"
https://openalex.org/W2003467134,"To investigate the mechanisms of bradykinin B1 (BKB1) receptor gene expression, transient DNA transfection analyses of human BKB1 receptor gene promoter were performed in SV-40 transformed IMR90 cells. A positive regulatory element (PRE) located at position −604 to −448 base pair (bp) upstream of the transcription start site consistently exhibited, by far, the highest level of relative luciferase activity. A negative regulatory element, at position −682 to −604 bp, was able to completely ablate the function of the PRE. Transfection combined with deletion and mutation analyses illustrated that the PRE contains a classic, powerful enhancer. This enhancer was minimized to a 100-bp element at position −548 to −448 bp. A 78-bp fragment of negative regulatory element functioned as a silencer. Transient transfection of the enhancer construct, driven by heterologous herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, into a variety of cell types, showed that this enhancer presents a cell-type specific feature. In the characterization of the enhancer, motifs A (−548 to −532) and B (−483 to −477) were found to be essential for full enhancer activity. Motif D (−472 to −467) played a smaller role in enhancer activation. Gel shift and antibody supershift assays determined that an AP-1 factor binds with motif B. The nuclear protein which binds to motif A has yet to be identified. Both factors are the critical regulators for this enhancer activation. To investigate the mechanisms of bradykinin B1 (BKB1) receptor gene expression, transient DNA transfection analyses of human BKB1 receptor gene promoter were performed in SV-40 transformed IMR90 cells. A positive regulatory element (PRE) located at position −604 to −448 base pair (bp) upstream of the transcription start site consistently exhibited, by far, the highest level of relative luciferase activity. A negative regulatory element, at position −682 to −604 bp, was able to completely ablate the function of the PRE. Transfection combined with deletion and mutation analyses illustrated that the PRE contains a classic, powerful enhancer. This enhancer was minimized to a 100-bp element at position −548 to −448 bp. A 78-bp fragment of negative regulatory element functioned as a silencer.

Evidence suggests that the expression of BKB1receptors is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (3Hall J.M. Gen.

The genomic sequence of the human BKB1 receptor gene was recently reported by several groups including ours (6Yang X. Polgar P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Bachvarov D. Hess F. Menke J.G. Larrivee J.-F. Marceau F.

So far neither detailed functional promoter structure nor the regulatory elements of this gene have been defined. The aim of this study was to begin to characterize the functional promoter. We identified a powerful enhancer and certain crucial cis-acting regulatory elements of this gene. Initially, we used a transient transfection strategy to characterize the functional promoter and localize the important regulatory elements. By using deletion and mutation strategies, a minimum enhancer element and its regulatory sequence motifs were defined in the 5′-flanking region. Gel shift and antibody supershift procedures were then used to identify an AP-1 factor and another unknown factor as crucial transcriptional regulators of this enhancer. The BKB1 5′-flanking region was previously isolated as a λ genomic clone (6Yang X. Polgar P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By subcloning and sequencing we defined approximately a 1.8-kb fragment upstream of the transcription start site. Its nucleotide sequence was submitted to GenBank (access number U48827). A schematic representation of the pGL-BK-LUC constructs is shown in Fig. 1. The pGL-BKA-LUC was generated by using PCR to generate a 1.8-kb fragment from a subclone followed by cloning into the SacI and HindIII sites of pGL-3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) harboring a promoter segment from −1,748 to +89. The PGL-BKB-LUC was constructed by SmaI digestion of pGL-BKA-LUC to remove a 400-bp fragment. The other five 5′-end deleted constructs were generated by either standard restriction enzyme digestion or PCR and were cloned into the pGL-3-Basic vector. The exact end points of the deletions are presented in Fig. 1. The putative enhancer (−604 to −362) element and its six deletion mutants (Fig. 5) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGL-TK-LUC vector. This vector contains the luciferase gene driven by the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. The exact end points of the deletions and location are shown in Fig. 5. The oligonucleotide sequences and location used for enhancer mutagenesis are shown in Fig. 7 A. These oligonucleotides were used in PCR or site-directed mutagenesis to generate four mutants of the enhancer. The constructs were subcloned into pGL-TK-LUC vector. The constructs containing different orientations and positions of the enhancer were generated with standard restriction enzyme digestion and cloning techniques.Figure 7A, the putative protein-binding sites in the human BKB1 enhancer element. At the top, the putative protein-binding regions are depicted in the enhancer element, and assigned as separate motifs, motif A contains the nucleotides of NF-1-like site, motif B contains the nucleotides of AP-1 site, motif C contains the nucleotides of PEA-3A site, and motif D contains the nucleotides of PEA-3B site. At the bottom, the putative nucleotide consensus sequences are shown using uppercase letters in the nucleotide sequences of the 100-bp minimum enhancer. The four mutant sequences located above and below the core enhancer sequences are the primers used in the mutagenesis of the enhancer element.

The wild type enhancer fragment and its mutated derivatives, in which either motif was mutated (blank boxes) or a combination of motif mutation and nucleotide deletion were used, were fused to the pGL-TK-LUC vector. The transient transfection in IMRSV cells was performed in triplicate in each experiment. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. The data presented are mean ± S.D. from one of those triplicate experiments. The level of activation is depicted as a percentage change with the level obtained from wild type enhancer construct (assigned a value of 100).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All the oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized either in the DNA-Protein Core of our medical center using an ABI DNA synthesizer, model 394-08 or were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). All of the PCR products were first cloned into the TA-cloning vector from Invitrogen Inc. (Carlsbad, CA) and then subcloned into other plasmids. All of the deletion and mutation constructs and their orientations were confirmed by the DNA-Protein Core of our medical center using an automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystem Inc., Model 370A). The fidelity of the constructs was further confirmed with the use of restriction enzymes. BKB1 receptor number was determined by binding of [[3H]des-Arg10]kallidin to intact cells in culture as described previously (17Cahill M. Fishman J.B. Polgar P. Agents Actions. 1988; 24: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Confluent cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer (0.05% (v/v) bovine serum albumin, 2 mm bacitracin, 10 mmHepes (pH 7.3), 120 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 0.65 mmCaCl2, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm MgSO4) followed by a 15-min equilibration with 0.5 ml of cold binding buffer. The binding buffer was replaced with binding buffer containing 10 nm[[3H]des-Arg10]kallidin. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 4.5 μmunlabeled [des-Arg10]kallidin. After 2 h at 4 °C, the cells were washed 3 times with 1 ml of wash buffer (binding buffer supplemented with 0.15% bovine serum albumin). The cells were solubilized with 0.25 ml of 0.2% SDS and radioactivity determined in a β-counter. The IMR90-SV40 (IMRSV) and IMR90 cells were grown in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg (for 2 cm2 wells) or 1.0 μg (for 4 cm2 wells) of DNA construct using the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitation method (18Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar). Cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector DNA was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency (25 ng for 2 cm2 wells or 50 ng for 4 cm2 wells). After 16 h incubation with the transfection solution, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium. Twenty-four hours later the cell extracts were harvested for luciferase assays and β-galactosidase determination. In case of effector addition, 48 h after transfection the cells were washed two times with Hank's balanced salt solution and then serum-free minimal essential medium was added. The stimulators (LPS, 10 μg/ml, Difco; TNF-α, 5 ng/μl, R&D System; PMA, 100 ng/ml, Sigma; Bradykinin, 1 μm, Sigma) were added and retained in the culture medium for 4 h. Then the cell extracts were harvested for luciferase assay. The luciferase assays were performed according to the protocol from Promega. Luciferase activities were determined in a 1011 LKB β-counter equipped with a luminescence program. β-Galactosidase assays were carried out according to the method from Maniatis et al.(19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The luciferase activity data were normalized with β-galactosidase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (20Yang X. Hou F. Taylor L. Polgar P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The extracted nuclear protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The following sequences represent the coding strands of electrophoretic mobility shift assays probes and mutant competitors: probe A (BK enhancer −553 to −528), 5′-CATAATTTGAGAGACGCCAAGGAGG-3′; probe B (BK enhancer −497 to −472), 5′-CTCTGAACATTGCATGAGTCAAACG-3′; mutant 1, 5′-TTTGAGAGACAGACTGGAGGATTAGG-3′; mutant 3, 5′-GAACATTGCATCGCAGAAACGTTTTCC-3′. The nucleotide bases underlined indicate the bases mutated, with regard to the probes used. Consensus oligonucleotides for AP-1, AP-3, SP-1, and CTF were obtained from Stratagene. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the protocol used was described previously (20Yang X. Hou F. Taylor L. Polgar P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–5 μg of nuclear extract was preincubated in the binding buffer with/without oligonucleotide competitors for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then incubated with 1 μl of 32P-labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were run on 5% acrylamide gels at 150 V and gels were dried and exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak). For supershift assays, 2 μg of AP-1 polyclonal antibody which recognizes Jun family protein (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) or NF-1 polyclonal antibody reactive with all NF-1 isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated with the nuclear extract reaction mixture for 45 min at room temperature before adding the probe. The genomic structure of human BKB1 receptor including part of the 5′-flanking region has been reported recently (6Yang X. Polgar P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Bachvarov D. Hess F. Menke J.G. Larrivee J.-F. Marceau F. Genomics. 1996; 33: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Chai K.X. Ni A. Wang D. Ward D.C. Chao J. Chao L. Genomics. 1996; 31: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To date no information exists on the characterization of this gene promoter or the mechanism of its transcriptional regulation. To delineate the sequences essential for transcription of the BKB1 receptor gene and identify important regulatory domains, we cloned approximately a 1.8-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence from a λ-genomic clone (6Yang X. Polgar P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A series of six 5′-end deletion mutants were generated. One additional construct (pGL-BKB-LUC) was generated by a deletion between −1495 and −1092. These constructs were transfected into IMRSV cells. Reporter gene luciferase activities were measured. Several positive and negative regulatory regions were identified (Fig. 1). Two positive regions were found at nucleotide positions −730 to −682 and −604 to −448. Much lower luciferase activities were observed when these regions were deleted. Three negative regulatory regions (position −1745 to −730, −682 to −604, and −448 to −384) were identified. Deletion of these regions resulted in a marked increase in luciferase activity. A strong positive element (PRE) located in position −604 to −448 proved of particular interest. This element produced a very large (over 34-fold) increase of reporter gene expression. A strong negative element (NRE) was located in the immediate upstream left of the PRE at position −682 to −604. This element completely inhibited the function of the PRE. These observations point to the presence of a dominant enhancer and a strong silencer in the 5′-flanking region of the inducible BKB1receptor gene. Only a limited number of cell types and tissues have thus far been reported to express the BKB1 receptor (7Marceau F. Larrivee J-F. Saint-Jacques E. Bachvarov D.R. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Donaldson L.F. Hanley M.R. Villablanca A.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding of [[3H]des-Arg10]kallidin to IMR90, IMRSV, HEK-293, Rat-1, and COS cells was performed to determine the expression of BKB1 receptor in these cell types. The results illustrated in Fig. 2 show that HEK-293, Rat-1, and COS cells do not exhibit endogenous BKB1 receptor binding. Whereas, IMR90 and IMRSV cells exhibit statistically significant endogenous BKB1 receptor binding. To determine whether the regulatory elements in this gene promoter have cell-type specific features, construct pGL-BKE-LUC (containing PRE no NRE) and construct pGL-BKB-LUC (containing PRE plus NRE) were transfected into several cell types. The transient transfection results illustrated in Fig. 3 show that the sizable increase in luciferase activity with the construct, pGL-BKE-LUC was exhibited only in IMR90 and IMRSV cells. Both cell types were also shown to bind [des-Arg10]kallidin (Fig. 2). Only limited increase in luciferase activity from the construct pGL-BKE-LUC was found in HEK-293 cells which did not bind with [des-Arg10]kallidin. Another construct, pGL-BKB-LUC, presented very low luciferase activity in all three cell types. These results illustrate that the activating function of PRE correlates with the presence of endogenous BKB1 receptors. NRE completely abolished the activating function of the PRE. A putative, positive regulator of BKB1receptor transcription may exist in the cell lines presenting the endogenous BKB1 receptor; or an additional negative regulator is active in the cell types where no endogenous BKB1 receptor is expressed. The PRE is a 156-bp fragment located at position −604 to −448 of the 5′-flanking region of this gene. The above results, using transient transfection, suggest that PRE functions as an enhancer element. To ascertain whether this fragment fulfills the requirements of an enhancer, this 156-bp fragment was inserted into a plasmid with a luciferase reporter gene driven by the herpes simplex virus-TK promoter in either sense or antisense orientation, or with the fragment placed in the 3′-end of luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. 4, the luciferase activity of these constructs showed a 19-, 20-, and 38-fold stimulation, respectively. These results provide additional evidence that this 156-bp fragment functions as a classic, powerful enhancer. To minimize the functional enhancer, a series of deletion fragments were generated by PCR overlapping the PRE region. The fragments were subcloned into the pGL-TK-LUC vector and transfected into IMRSV to measure reporter gene luciferase activity. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Three constructs (−604 to −362, −604 to −448, and −548 to −448) presented strong enhancer activity, while three other constructs (−468 to −362, −548 to −491, and −508 to −448) only showed partial enhancer activity. The construct (pGL-Be100-TK-LUC) containing a 100-bp fragment from position −548 to −448 presented the strongest enhancer activity. Further deletion of 5′-end after position −548, or further deletion of 3′-end before position −448 reduced full enhancer activity. This suggests that the 100-bp fragment between −548 and −448 in the 5′-flanking region of BKB1 receptor gene is the minimum enhancer element, the nucleotides in both ends of this enhancer fragment are required for full enhancer activation. To determine whether the enhancer has cell-type specific function, constructs with/without the minimal 100-bp enhancer, driven by TK promoter, were transfected into IMR90, IMRSV, HEK- 293, Rat-1, and COS cells. Results shown in Fig. 6proved very interesting. The enhancer fully activated the TK promoter in IMR90 and IMRSV cells. There was no enhancer activation in HEK-293, Rat-1, and COS cells. These results provide further evidence that there is a cell-type specific enhancer in the 5′-flanking region of the BKB1 receptor gene. The function of the enhancer correlates with the cellular expression of the BKB1 receptor. To characterize the regulatory motifs of the 100-bp enhancer element, a search for consensus sequences of transcription factors identified several potential nuclear factor-binding sites. Some of the common consensus sequences in the enhancer element are shown in Fig. 7 A. An NF-1-like binding site (motif A) is located at the 5′-end of the enhancer. An AP-1 site (motif B) is located in the 3′-end of the enhancer. One PEA-3-binding site (motif C, PEA-3A) is adjacent to the 5′-end of motif A (NF-1-like site). Another PEA-3 site (motif D, PEA-3B) is located adjacent to motif B (AP-1 site) in the 3′-end of the enhancer. To determine whether any of these consensus sequences are essential for the function of the enhancer, four mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the enhancer as a template. The sense strand oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis are shown in Fig. 7 A. These mutant constructs were transfected into IMRSV to evaluate the enhancer activity. Results are shown in Fig. 7 B. As compared with the original enhancer, less than 20% of enhancer activity remained when motif A (NF-1-like site, −546 to −534) was mutated. Enhancer activity was almost eliminated when motif B (AP-1 site, −485 to −477) was mutated. Moreover, further deletion at the 5′-end and mutation of motif C (PEA-3A site) did not show a meaningful change of reporter gene luciferase expression when compared with the mutant activity where the NF-1-like site was mutated. The 3′-end deletion and mutation of motif D (PEA-3B site) did bring the relative luciferase activity down more than half but did not abolish the enhancer activity. These observations suggest that motifs A, B, and D are required for full enhancer activity. Motifs A and B play a major role in enhancer activation. To examine the ability of the crucial motifs, A and B, to interact with transcription factors, two probes, assigned as A (overlapping the motif A) and B (overlapping the motif B), were synthesized and used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed a specific set of protein-DNA complexes when nuclear extracts prepared from IMRSV were incubated with32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes A and B (Fig. 8, A and B). Two intense complexes, designated as complex R1 and complex R2, bound to oligonucleotide A. The specificity of these protein-DNA interactions was confirmed by increasing inhibition of binding in the presence of a 50- and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide A and no, or minimal, inhibition in the presence of excess of unlabeled unrelated consensus sequence such as SP-1, AP-3 (Stratagene). To further explore the specificity of the nuclear factor binding to probe A, an unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide (M-1), in which a NF-1-like site was mutated, was employed as competitor in the binding assay. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the unlabeled mutated A competed as efficiently as the wild type A for the formation of the two specific complexes. This suggests that the mutated nucleotides are not crucial for the formation of the two specific complexes. For further confirmation, the NF-1 consensus oligonucleotide, CTF (from Stratagene), was used as competitor in the binding assay. The NF-1 consensus oligonucleotide failed to inhibit the formation of the two specific complexes. This observation suggests that the two specific complexes are not formed by an NF-1 factor. Incubation of 32P-labeled probe B with nuclear extracts from IMRSV resulted in the formation of three protein-DNA complexes designated S1, S2, and S3 (Fig. 8 B). The formation of these complexes was inhibited by the inclusion of a 50- and 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide B. But the complex formation was only minimally inhibited at best in the presence of excess of unrelated competitors such as consensus sequences SP-1, AP3, and CTF. On the other hand, the AP-1 consensus sequence totally inhibited the complex formation as efficiently as unlabeled oligonucleotide B. In addition, further confirmation also showed that unlabeled mutated oligonucleotide (M-3), in which the AP-1 site was mutated, failed to compete with probe B in the formation of specific complexes. These results suggest that oligonucleotide B contains an AP-1 site binding with a nuclear protein. To further determine whether any of the three specific complexes are generated by an AP-1 transcription factor binding with probe B, antibody supershift was performed using an AP-1 polyclonal antibody which recognizes the Jun family of proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD). As shown in Fig. 8 C, the AP-1 antibody supershifted the formation of complex S1, whereas NF-1 antibody was unable to supershift the S1 complex. These results suggest that the 3′-end of the enhancer has an AP-1-binding site. The site binds to an AP-1 transcription factor likely to modulate transcription of the BKB1receptor gene. LPS, TNF-α, PMA, and BK effectors have been determined to up-regulate BKB1 gene expression by our laboratory and others (7Marceau F. Larrivee J-F. Saint-Jacques E. Bachvarov D.R. Can. J. Physiol.

We analyzed the 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated activation of the avian gene by transient transfection assays with promoter/reporter constructs into HD11 chicken macrophages and by DNA mobility shift assays. Deletion and mobility shift analyses indicated that the −62/−29 region confers 1,25-(OH)2D3responsiveness and forms DNA-protein complexes. The addition of an anti-vitamin D receptor (VDR) antibody inhibited binding to this sequence, whereas anti-retinoid X receptor (RXR) antibody generated a lower mobility complex. Therefore, we concluded that this element binds a VDR·RXR heterodimer, but the addition of extra 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on the formation of this complex. Moreover, the use of nuclear extracts from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated macrophages led to the formation of an additional high mobility complex also composed of VDR·RXR heterodimer. Mutations provided evidence that the 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated activation of the carbonic anhydrase II gene is mediated by VDR·RXR heterodimers bound to a DR3-type vitamin D response element with sequence AGGGCAtggAGTTCG. This vitamin D response element is also functional in the ROS 17/2.8 osteoblasts.

Despite this attention, understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the diverse forms of cell differentiation mediated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is still fragmentary.Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated and highly polarized bone-resorbing cells. They belong to the monocytic/macrophage lineage (34Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Tanaka H. Sasaki T. Nishihara T. Koga T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CAII, expressed at high levels in osteoclasts (41Hillstrom Shapiro L. Venta P.J. Yu Y.S.L. Tashian R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Zheng M.H. Fan Y. Wysocki S. Wood D.J. Papadimitriou J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), plays an important role in the extracellular acidification required for bone resorption and therefore bone remodeling. In particular, CAII deficiency is one of the factors responsible for the osteopetrosis characterized in humans by a renal tubular acidosis and a cerebral calcification (43Roth D.E. Venta P.J. Tashian R.E. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that 1,25-(OH)2D3enhances the expression of CAII in chicken primary blood-derived macrophages (38Woods C. Domenget C. Solari F. Gandrillon O. Lazarides E. Jurdic P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 1,25-(OH)2D3activates the CAII gene expression at the transcriptional level in the chicken monocytic BM2 cells induced to differentiate into macrophages by lipopolysaccharides and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (44Lomri A. Baron R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4688-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as in the human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL60 after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation (45Biskobing D.M. Nanes M.S. Rubin J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). CAII gene expression is also activated transcriptionally by thyroid hormone in normal erythrocytic cells (46Pain B. Melet F. Samarut J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 284-294PubMed Google Scholar), and several domains in the avian CAII promoter have been shown to control the thyroid hormone regulation of transcription (47Disela C. Glineur C.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2853-2867PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work, we identified a VDRE between positions −1203 and −1187 of the CAII promoter which mediates 1,25-(OH)2D3 responsiveness to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) minimal promoter in the Drosophila SL3 cell line and in human MCF-7 cells (23Quélo I. Kahlen J.P. Rascle A. Jurdic P. Carlberg C. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This VDRE, bound by a VDR·RXR heterodimer, is however not functional in an avian macrophage cell line.In the present study, we have looked for specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of the CAII gene transcription in macrophages. We have studied the ligand-dependent transactivation of the avian CAII promoter in the chicken HD11 macrophage cell line in which numerous hormonal nuclear receptors and CAII gene are expressed endogenously. 2I. Quélo, and P. Jurdic, manuscript in preparation. 2I. Quélo, and P. Jurdic, manuscript in preparation. We have looked for hormone response elements in this promoter and localized an element conferring 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated activation (VDRE) to a 34-base pair region located −62/−29 upstream the transcriptional start site. The VDRE was defined precisely after methylation interference assays and by using mutated forms of this sequence. This VDRE, functional in HD11 and in ROS 17/2.8 cell lines, has a DR3 structure with sequence AGGGCA tgg AGTTCG and is specifically bound by a heterodimer formed by VDR and the α or γ isoform of RXR.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we showed that the chicken CAII promoter activity is induced in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in an avian macrophage cell line. We identified a domain in the CAII promoter responsible for 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation. Transient transfection assays in HD11 macrophages of total or deleted fragments of the CAII promoter allowed us to define a region involved in 1,25-(OH)2D3 responsiveness. In macrophages, most if not all DNA sequences essential for CAII gene basal and 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced expression are within the first 178 bp upstream of the initiation site, referred to as the proximal promoter. It is noteworthy that the level of 1,25-(OH)2D3 activation increases with the 5′-end progressive deletions of the promoter. A repressor domain further upstream may be present and would explain the increasing activation of CAII promoter correlated with deletions. Further deletions and mutational analyses of the CAII proximal promoter allowed us to determine a more precise vitamin D-responsive domain, between residues −53 and −39 of the CAII promoter. We showed that this VDRE is highly functional in macrophages and is bound specifically by a complex formed by a RXR·VDR heterodimer. Lastly, we showed that mutations that abolished protein binding to the VDRE inhibit vitamin D-dependent activation in macrophages.Many have shown that the VDR has a binding preference for the direct repeat composed of AG(G/T)TCA motifs spaced by 3 bp (2Mangelsdorf D.J.

The CAII proximal VDRE consists of an imperfect tandem of 6 bases spaced by three nucleotides with the sequence AGGGCA for the 5′-motif and AGTTCG for the downstream motif. Mutational analysis revealed the validity of the DR3 structure for the CAII proximal VDRE. Oligonucleotides containing mutations within the spacer motif of this DR3 (m4 and m8 mutants) were still able to bind VDR·RXR heterodimer and have a very mild effect on transactivation efficiency. In contrast, mutations within the two hexameric motifs of the DR3 element inhibited 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transcriptional activation and most of the protein-DNA interactions. Furthermore, our results indicate that the 3′-element integrity of this VDRE is more crucial for binding than the 5′-element. This is evidenced by the ability of a mutated 5′-element VDRE (m3 mutant) to compete still for VDR binding with the native sequence, whereas mutations in the 3′-element (m5 and m6 mutants) resulted in a marked decrease in VDR binding to the mutant element. In contrast with others studies showing the important role of the residues in 5′-position outside the VDRE, we have shown here that the nucleotides located outside the VDRE were not essential either for the binding of the protein complex on DNA or for the transactivation activity.The sequences of numerous known natural positive VDREs, generally of the DR3 type, identified within the promoter regions of different genes, have been aligned. It is of interest to note that the hexameric core binding sites are rather degenerated, although they all can specifically bind VDR complexes and confer transactivation upon 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation. We have observed that the upstream motif of the consensus VDRE is more conserved than the downstream one. The difference between the two half-sites may indicate preferential binding of each receptor of the complex bound to DNA. Previous studies have shown that RXRs bind preferentially to the 5′-core binding site in retinoic acid and thyroid hormone response elements as well as in VDREs (1Umesono K. Murakami K.K.

Bone. 1995; 17: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have postulated that the guanine in the second position of the 3′-hexamer is absolutely conserved, as we found for the CAII proximal VDRE. Indeed, mutation of this guanine abolishes 1,25-(OH)2D3 responsiveness and the binding of transcription factors to the CAII proximal VDRE. Thus, the 5′-motif of the CAII VDRE could be a high affinity RXR binding motif, whereas the 3′-hexanucleotide sequence could be a VDR binding motif (60Nishikawa J. Matsumoto M. Sakoda K. Kitaura M. Imagawa M. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19739-19743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Consistent with the results obtained with gel retardation experiments, we have demonstrated by transient transfection experiments that the vitamin D stimulation of the CAII gene expression acts, in vivo, through VDR and RXR dimerization.2 Furthermore, we have also shown that, in vivo, addition of RXR ligand does not interfere with the 1,25-(OH)2D3response and so, does not affect the stability of VDR·RXR heterodimers in the cells nor the transactivation efficiency (49Maurer R.A. Notides A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, two specific complexes, C1 and C2, were formed on the CAII proximal VDRE with nuclear extracts from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated HD11 cells, whereas only one complex (C1) was formed with vehicle-treated extracts or recombinant proteins. However, C1 and C2 complexes bound to this VDRE are both composed at least of VDR and RXR heterodimers. We have speculated that in vivo, 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces a specific conformational change of the VDR·RXR heterodimer leading to the formation of the C2 complex, whereas in vitro, only the C1 complex is observed. This C2 higher mobility complex could be caused by the binding of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to the VDR, although the addition of extra 1,25-(OH)2D3 to the EMSA reaction mixture had no effect on the DNA binding affinity of the protein complex. In such conditions no change in mobility or complex composition was observed. This suggests that in vitro, binding of the ligand is not necessary for the binding of proteins to DNA. In contrast, in vivo, cell exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3 could change the complex conformation on DNA and in doing so could either recruit or displace the binding of either a coactivator or a corepressor. The two complexes, C1 and C2, obtained by EMSAs using nuclear extracts, may reflect the possible involvement of known or unknown factors in addition to the VDR·RXR heterodimer. In fact, the transcription factor TFIIB, which was shown to interact directly with VDR (61MacDonald P.N. Sherman D.R. Dowd D.R. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. DeLisle R.K. J. Biol.

Other potential unidentified proteins may also be involved in the binding of the VDR to the VDRE such as positive cofactors, including TRIP1 (63Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A.

The identified bases of the CAII proximal VDRE may therefore bind a transcription factor that promotes 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation by facilitating interactions between the receptor-occupied VDRE and the basal transcription apparatus.Finally, we tested the activity of this CAII proximal VDRE in a heterologous cellular system, the ROS 17/2.8 cell line. These analyses have demonstrated that the CAII proximal VDRE is also functional as a VDRE in the ROS 17/2.8 cells but less efficiently. Thus, the VDRE identified in this study allows 1,25-(OH)2D3transactivation of the CAII gene after binding of the VDR·RXR heterodimer, is efficient when cloned upstream a heterologous promoter, and is functional in a heterologous cellular system. Although the distal CAII VDRE is not functional in this macrophage cell line, the CAII proximal VDRE is fully active in the cell type (i.e.macrophages) expressing the CAII gene endogenously, and it is indeed the region promoting the 1,25-(OH)2D3response. Recent work points to the complexity of the molecular mechanisms involved in the vitamin D3 signaling pathway. It has been known for some time that in addition to the binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) 1The abbreviations used are: VDR, vitamin D receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; bp, base pair(s); DR3, direct repeats of two hexameric core binding sites spaced by three nucleotides; CAII, carbonic anhydrase II; 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; tk, thymidine kinase; CAT or Cat, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; Mi, microphalmia transcription factor. 1The abbreviations used are: VDR, vitamin D receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; bp, base pair(s); DR3, direct repeats of two hexameric core binding sites spaced by three nucleotides; CAII, carbonic anhydrase II; 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; tk, thymidine kinase; CAT or Cat, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; Mi, microphalmia transcription factor. to certain vitamin D response elements (VDREs) as homodimer (3Carlberg C.
