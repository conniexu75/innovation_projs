https://openalex.org/W1972975310,"Concepts borrowed from polymer science have been applied to tailor the properties of inorganic materials, especially those derived from amorphous precursors. Fractal geometry can be used to characterize macromolecular precursors and to relate their structures to kinetic growth processes. Within the silica system, for example, it is possible to manipulate the conditions of solution polymerization to yield a variety of macromolecules from branched chains to smooth colloidal particles."
https://openalex.org/W2009779967,"The adsorption of iodine on platinum single crystals was studied with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to define the limits of resolution that can be obtained while imaging in air and to set a target resolution for STM imaging of metal surfaces immersed in an electrochemical cell. Two iodine adlattice unit cells of slightly different iodine packing density were clearly imaged: ( radical7 x radical7) R19.1 degrees -I, surface coverage ø(I) = 3/7; and (3 x 3)-I, ø(I) = 4/9. The three iodine atoms in the ( radical7 x radical7) unit cell form a regular hexagonal lattice interatomic distance d(I) = 0.424 nanometer, with two atoms adsorbed in threefold hollow sites and one atom adsorbed at an atop site. The (3 x 3) unit cell showed two different packing arrangements of the four iodine atoms exit. In one of the (3 x 3) structures, the iodine atoms pack to form a hexagonal lattice, d(I) = 0.417 nanometer, with three of the iodine atoms at twofold adsorption sites and one atom at an atop site. Another packing arrangement of iodine into the (3 x 3) unit cell was imaged in which the iodine atoms are not arranged symmetrically."
https://openalex.org/W2077087126,"A model for lunar surface processes is presented which explains the main albedo and color contrasts and the temporal changes in these optical properties. Evidence from Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 samples and telescopic spectral reflectivity measurements indicates that the maria are similar in mineralogy on a regional scale and that the highlands are consistent with an anorthositic-gabbro composition. Bright craters and rays in both regions expose materials that are relatively crystalline compared with their backgrounds, which are richer in dark glass. With age, bright craters and rays in the maria darken in place by meteorite impact-induced vitrification and mixing with the surrounding material. Highland bright craters and rays may, however, darken primarily through regional contamination by iron- and titanium-rich mare material."
https://openalex.org/W2058986221,"The O(18)/O(16) analysis and Th(230)/Pa(231) dating of deep-sea cores showed that the last interglacial age, with an early major temperature maximum followed by two smaller ones, extended from 100,000 to 70,000 years ago and was preceded by a glacial age extending from 120,000 to 100,000 years ago. The O(18)/O(16) analysis and Th(230)/U(234) dating of speleothems confirm and refine these ages."
https://openalex.org/W2067574718,"Field investigations in southern Egypt have yielded Acheulian artifacts in situ in authigenic carbonate deposits (CaCO(3)-cemented alluvium) along the edges of nowaggraded paleovalleys (Wadi Arid and Wadi Safsaf). Uranium-series dating of 25 carbonate samples from various localities as far apart as 70 kilometers indicates that widespread carbonate deposition occurred about 45, 141 and 212 ka (thousand years ago). Most of the carbonate appears to have been precipitated from groundwater, which suggests that these three episodes of deposition may be related to late Pleistocene humid climates that facilitated human settlement in this now hyperarid region. Carbonate cements from sediments containing Acheulian artifacts provide a minimum age of 212 ka for early occupation of the paleovalleys."
https://openalex.org/W1968664535,"Sample surveys provide data for academic research, government policy-making, the media, and business. Statistical research aims to improve survey data by reducing extraneous sources of variability and thus increasing accuracy. Researchers have begun to use paradigms adapted from the cognitive sciences to study those sources of variability associated with the processes that the respondent undertakes in understanding questions, remembering, judging and estimating, and formulating answers. To generalize laboratory-based findings, researchers must begin to embed designed experiments that vary the questionnaire content into sample surveys of broad population. Issues associated with the design of and statistical inference from such embedded experiments are examined and illustrated with an example on the effects of context questions on responses in attitude surveys."

https://openalex.org/W2080107811,"The chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) acquired when single-domain size magnetite (Fe(3)0(4)) oxidizes to maghemite (gammaFe(2)O(3)) in a 50-microtesla field at a series of 13 temperatures from 1000 to 6560C is of similar intensity to viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) acquired under the same field and temperature conditions by unoxidized magnetite. The remanences of the oxidized and unoxidized phases also have similar resistances to demagnetization. These similarities imply that the remanence of the oxidized material is a chemico-viscous remanent magnetization (CVRM) having some of the characteristics of both classic growth CRM and thermally activated VRM. At low temperatures in partially oxidized grains, VRM of the magnetite core and growth CRM of the maghemite surface layer contribute about equally to CVRM. Near the Curie point, intensity of CVRM increases to a Hopkinson-type peak. High-temperature CVRM is more resistant to demagnetization than the thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) produced from cooling through the Curie point."

https://openalex.org/W2077959461,"Diamond films (∼0.7 micrometer thick) have been epitaxially grown on Si(111) substrates at room temperature with mass-selected 120-electronvolt C+ ions. The diamond reflections observed in x-ray diffraction are well localized at their predicted positions, indicating that (i) the diamond(111) and (220) planes are parallel to the Si(111) and (220), respectively; (ii) the diamond rotational spread around its (111) normal is ∼1.7°; and (iii) the mosaic block size is ∼150 Å. The film growth is discussed in terms of subplantation—a shallow subsurface implantation model. This discovery is an important step toward diamond semiconductor devices."
https://openalex.org/W1997997654,"Low-frequency sound has been recorded on at least two occasions in Bermuda with the passage of Apollo rocket vehicles 188 kilometers aloft. The signals, which are reminiscent of N-waves from sonic booms, are (i) horizontally coherent; (ii) have extremely high (supersonic) trace velocities across the tripartite arrays; (iii) have nearly identical appearance and frequencies; (iv) have essentially identical arrival times after rocket launch; and (v) are the only coherent signals recorded over many hours. These observations seem to establish that the recorded sound comes from the rockets at high elevation. Despite this high elevation, the values of surface pressure appear to be explainable on the basis of a combination of a kinetic theory approach to shock formation in rarefied atmospheres with established gas-dynamics shock theory."

Dnitz (Berlin), Albert Hassall (Washington), L. G. Neumann (Toulouse), G. H. F. Nuttall (Cambridge), and Cecil Warburton (London), has submitted its first report."
https://openalex.org/W2018592497,"The materials.-The statistics brought together in this paper were gathered, for the most part, in two separate investigations. One, relating principally to retardation in all its aspects, was conducted under the auspices of the Minnesota Psychological Conference. The other, concerning itself mainly with the first year of retardation, or with repeaters, was made at the request of the Associated School Boards of Minnesota. Part of the data collected was laid before these bodies at their respective 1910 meetings. Both reports have been combined, condensed, rewritten, and several sets of other interesting statistics introduced for comparative purposes. The schools studied.-The schools contributing the data on retardation proper are fifty-five of the smaller systems of the state. They each maintain high schools known in Minnesota as high schools, owing to the fact that they are carefully inspected and listed with the State High School Board for a large yearly special grant direct from the state treasury. They are, therefore, schools which are kept at a high state of efficiency. Only grade pupils considered.-Only the pupils in the grades below the high school are considered, for several reasons. First, the high-school students are invariably promoted by subjects, hence accurate statistics as to retardation among them, in the usual sense of the term, cannot be had. Then, again, with the eighth grade once passed, and often earlier, the most retarded"
