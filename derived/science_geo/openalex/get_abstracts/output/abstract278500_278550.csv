https://openalex.org/W1981459441,"The structure and dynamics of three-dimensional foams are probed quantitatively by exploiting the strong multiple scattering of light that gives foams their familiar white color. Approximating the propagation of light as a diffusion process, transmission measurements provide a direct probe of the average bubble size. A model for dynamic light scattering is developed that can be used to interpret temporal fluctuations in the intensity of multiply scattered light. The results identify previously unrecognized internal dynamics of the foam bubbles. These light-scattering techniques are direct, noninvasive probes of bulk foams and therefore should find wide use in the study of their properties."
https://openalex.org/W2040004408,"Self-assembly of a ferrocenyl thiol and a quinone thiol onto Au microelectrodes forms the basis for a new microsensor concept: a two-terminal, voltammetric microsensor with reference and sensor functions on the same electrode. The detection is based on measurement of the potential difference of current peaks for oxidation and reduction of the reference (ferrocene) and indicator (quinone) in aqueous electrolyte in a two-terminal, linear sweep voltammogram in which a counterelectrode of relatively large surface area is used. The quinone has a half-wave potential, E((1/2)), that is pH-sensitive and can be used as a pH indicator; the ferrocene center has an E(1/2) that is a pH-insensitive reference. The key advantages are that such sensors require no separate reference electrode and function as long as current peaks can be located for reference and indicator molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1991283651,"The results on the use of γG-immunoglobulin to Rh factor for the prevention of active immunization of Rh-negative mothers at risk appear most promising. One hundred and seven mothers in the clinical trial have been followed for periods of about 6 months to 1½ years after delivery. Of these, 48 were treated mothers who received 5 ml γG-immunoglobulin to Rh, and 59 were untreated mothers. Of the 48 treated mothers none are actively immunized; seven of the 59 control mothers have become actively immunized to Rh."
https://openalex.org/W2014973324,"The global tectonics of Venus may be dominated by plumes rising from the mantle and impinging on the lithosphere, giving rise to hot spots. Global sea-floor spreading does not take place, but direct convective coupling of mantle flow fields to the lithosphere leads to regional-scale deformation and may allow lithospheric transport on a limited scale. A hot-spot evolutionary sequence comprises (i) a broad domal uplift resulting from a rising mantle plume, (ii) massive partial melting in the plume head and generation of a thickened crust or crustal plateau, (iii) collapse of dynamic topography, and (iv) creep spreading of the crustal plateau. Crust on Venus is produced by gradual vertical differentiation with little recycling rather than by the rapid horizontal creation and consumption characteristic of terrestrial sea-floor spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2020167991,"Rocks from the vicinity of Bosumtwi crater, Ghana, and a repre-sentative collection of Ivory Coast tektites have been analyzed mass spectrometrically for rubidium, strontium, and strontium isotopic composition. The data from the rocks of the crater area yield an age of 1.97 x 10(9) years (lambda(gb) = 1.47 chi 10(-11) year(-1)). The data for the Ivory Coast tektites fall on this isochron. This identity of age values for the Ivory Coast tektites and the Birrimian basement rocks of West Africa strongly supports the hypothesis of terrestrial formation for these tektites. The evidence available at present suggests that the Ivory Coast tektites are most probably the fusion products of meteoritic impact at the Bosumtwi crater site."
https://openalex.org/W2084525629,"Eucrites and angrites are distinct types of basaltic meteorites whose origins are poorly known. Experiments in which samples of the Allende (CV3) carbonaceous chondrite were partially melted indicate that partial melts can resemble either eucrites or angrites, depending only on the oxygen fugacity (fo(2)). Melts are eucritic if thefo(2) is below that of the iron-wüstite buffer or angritic if above the fo(2) of that buffer. With changing pressure, the graphite-oxygen redox reaction can produce oxygen fugacities that are above or below those of the iron-wüstite buffer. Therefore, a single, homogeneous, carbonaceous planetoid >110 kilometers in radius could produce melts of drastically different composition, depending on the depth of melting."
https://openalex.org/W2039358220,"Gonotrophic dissociation, a condition in which the ovaries remain undeveloped in female mosquitoes that have taken a full blood meal, occurs in Culex pipiens L., when incubated at low temperature (10 degrees to 15 degrees C) with short photoperiod and held at low temperature after feeding. Gonotrophic dissociation occurred sporadically in Culex quinquefasciatus Say after conditioning by low temperature, irrespective of photoperiod. Two major considerations are posed: first, the importance of gonotrophic dissociation to hibernation potential; and, second, the potential of a hibernating female mosquito to serve as a virus reservoir."

The cytoplasmic labeling decreased with time after the removal of the labeled auxin, but nuclear and chromosomal labeling was retained for at least 120 hours."

The biological activity of these proteins, which is equivalent to that of basic encephalitogenic proteins isolated in other laboratories, suggested that they are identical."

https://openalex.org/W2018220937,"""Polyphosphate"" and fragments isolated from acid hydrolysis of polyphosphate have an infrared absorption band at 1400 cm(-1), which is characteristic of imidodiphosphate linkages. Complete hydrolysis of purified ""polyphosphate"" releases 1 to 2 moles of phosphate per mole of ammonia. The polymer must contain subunits which are cyclic and which contain both imidodiphosphate linkages and phosphate anhydride linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2041982336,"The rate coefficients, k(1), for the reaction of OH with CHF(2)Br have been measured using pulsed photolysis and discharge flow techniques at temperatures (T) between 233 and 432 K to be k(1), = (7.4 +/- 1.6) x 10(-13) exp[-(1300 +/- 100)/T] cubic centimeters per molecule per second. The ultraviolet absorption cross sections, sigma, of this molecule between 190 and 280 nanometers were measured at 296 K. The k(1), and sigma values were used in a one-dimensional model to obtain an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 7 years for CHF(2)Br. This lifetime is shorter by approximately factors of 10 and 2 than those for CF(3)Br and CF(2)ClBr, respectively. The ozone depletion potentials of the three compounds will reflect these lifetimes."

https://openalex.org/W2028734085,"Hemagglutination by extract of fava bean was inhibited by 5-percent d-glucose, d-fructose, or maltose, but not by 5-percent d-galactose or lactose. Failure to inhibit seems to reflect the presence of a hydroxyl group at the carbon No. 4 position. Hemagglutination was enhanced by dextran of high molecular weight, but not by dextran of low molecular weight. The finding supports the hypothesis that large molecular size explains the enhancement by gum acacia of hemagglutination by fava bean."
