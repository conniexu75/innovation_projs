https://openalex.org/W1974750479,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane-associated, essential component of the viral replication complex. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the membrane anchor domain of NS5A as determined by NMR spectroscopy. An alpha-helix extending from amino acid residue 5 to 25 was observed in the presence of different membrane mimetic media. This helix exhibited a hydrophobic, Trprich side embedded in detergent micelles, while the polar, charged side was exposed to the solvent. Thus, the NS5A membrane anchor domain forms an in-plane amphipathic alpha-helix embedded in the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane bilayer. Interestingly, mutations affecting the positioning of fully conserved residues located at the cytosolic surface of the helix impaired HCV RNA replication without interfering with the membrane association of NS5A. In conclusion, the NS5A membrane anchor domain constitutes a unique platform that is likely involved in specific interactions essential for the assembly of the HCV replication complex and that may represent a novel target for antiviral intervention."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. Here we show that the ADP produced by hexokinase activity in rat brain mitochondria (mt-hexokinase) controls both membrane potential (Δψm) and ROS generation. Exposing control mitochondria to glucose increased the rate of oxygen consumption and reduced the rate of hydrogen peroxide generation. Mitochondrial associated hexokinase activity also regulated Δψm, because glucose stabilized low Δψm values in state 3. Interestingly, the addition of glucose 6-phosphate significantly reduced the time of state 3 persistence, leading to an increase in the Δψm and in H2O2 generation. The glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose completely impaired H2O2 formation in state 3-state 4 transition. In sharp contrast, the mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were, in all the above mentioned experiments, insensitive to glucose addition, indicating that the mt-hexokinase activity is pivotal in the homeostasis of the physiological functions of mitochondria. When mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were incubated with exogenous yeast hexokinase, which is not able to bind to mitochondria, the rate of H2O2 generation reached levels similar to those exhibited by control mitochondria only when an excess of 10-fold more enzyme activity was supplemented. Hyperglycemia induced in embryonic rat brain cortical neurons increased ROS production due to a rise in the intracellular glucose 6-phosphate levels, which were decreased by the inclusion of 2-deoxyglucose, N-acetyl cysteine, or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Taken together, the results presented here indicate for the first time that mt-hexokinase activity performed a key role as a preventive antioxidant against oxidative stress, reducing mitochondrial ROS generation through an ADP-recycling mechanism.

Glucose is an essential molecule for maintaining life as it is a major metabolic fuel, which, through its degradation via glycolysis and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation, generates high energy phosphate compounds responsible for driving many cellular processes. Normal levels of glucose and growth factors may protect cells from apoptotic events (1Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N.

However, despite its clear beneficial roles, in mammals glycemia must be tightly regulated because excessive glucose, such as in diabetes, can be harmful to tissues (3Russell J.W. Golovoy D.

Although the mechanism of glucose toxicity is not completely understood, many studies have shown that high glucose increases the formation of advanced glycation end products (6Brownlee M. Annu. Rev.

It has been proposed that the production of ROS by mitochondria via the respiratory chain is a causal link between high glucose and the main pathways responsible for hyperglycemic damage (3Russell J.W.

In mammals, there are four isoforms of hexokinase (hexokinase-I to hexokinase-IV), differing in their affinities for glucose and inhibition by glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and Pi as well as in their subcellular distribution (9Wilson J.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has also been found that hexokinase dissociates from mitochondria in a reversible manner, depending on the levels of Glc-6-P (11Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Kabir F. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The preferential mitochondrial localization of hexokinase in rat brain provided a predominant access to ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation instead of others sources of ATP (13BeltrandelRio H. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hexokinase-I and hexokinase-II bind to mitochondria, and the extent of their association varies from tissue to tissue, with brain, kidney, cardiac, and skeletal muscle and tumor cells being the sites that display a larger percentage of mitochondrial association (15Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 16Parry D.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that this binding takes place at the voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), also known as mitochondrial porins (20Cesar M.D.C. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 422: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Nakashima R.A. Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Associated with VDAC is the ADP/ATP carrier (or adenine nucleotide translocator, ANT), which allows the exchange of ADP and ATP through the inner mitochondrial membrane (22Azoulay-Zohar H. Israelson A. Abu-Hamad S. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 23Vyssokikh M.Y. Brdiczka D. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies indicated that mt-hexokinase activity inhibits not only the Bax-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis in HeLa cells but also early apoptotic events mediated by Akt/protein kinase B activation (1Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 24Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol.

Imbalance between mitochondrial ROS production and the intracellular levels of antioxidant defenses leads to oxidative stress, a condition that has been associated with apoptosis (31Hockenbery D.M.

Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The physiological rate of mitochondrial ROS production is inversely proportional to the availability of cytosolic ADP (30Cadenas E. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Thus, a diminution in the ADP levels induces an increase in the magnitude of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), which, in turn, decreases the respiratory rate, leading to stimulation of ROS generation due to the highly reduced state of the components of the electron transport chain. When the mitochondrial ADP levels rise, the inverse occurs. This has been attributed to the reduction of the Δψm through F1F0 ATP synthase complex activity. In fact, mitochondrial ROS generation is strongly dependent on Δψm levels, because high H+ gradients increase O2−˙ and H2O2 formation (40Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a small decrease in Δψm levels strongly diminishes H2O2 production (40Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present work the relationship between Δψm and ROS production with the ADP generated by the mt-hexokinase activity was evaluated in both isolated rat brain mitochondria and rat embryonic cortical neurons. The results suggested that mt-hexokinase activity was directly involved in the local ADP recycling mechanism, providing a novel physiological antioxidant role in rat neuronal cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—ADP, ATP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), scopoletin, horseradish peroxidase, rotenone, safranine O, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate (Ap5A), 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG), 6-deoxyglucose (6-DOG), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), yeast hexokinase, Glc-6-P dehydrogenase (Leuconostoc mesenteroides), Percoll, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, NAD+, polyornitine, RPMI 1640 medium, and Glc-6-P were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrogen peroxide was from Merck. Neurobasal medium was from Invitrogen. CM-H2DCFDA was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were from analytical grade.Animals and Mitochondrial Isolation—Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-230 g fasted overnight prior to being killed by decapitation. Mitochondria were isolated by conventional differential centrifugation from forebrains as described elsewhere (41Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and kept at 4 °C throughout the isolation procedure. Briefly, brains from two rats were rapidly removed to an ice-cold isolation buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After five washes to remove contaminating blood, the tissue was sliced into little pieces in isolation buffer. The tissue was manually homogenized during two cycles of 10 s in a Teflon glass potter. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1.330 × g for 3 min in a Hitachi Himac SCR20B RPR 20-2 rotor. The supernatant was carefully removed and centrifuged at 21,200 × g for 10 min. The pellet was re-suspended in isolation buffer (10 ml/g tissue originally homogenized) and divided in two equal volumes. To obtain the mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria, one fraction of the 21,200 × g pellet was mixed with 2 mm Glc-6-P (42BeltrandelRio H. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The other fraction was used as a control. Both fractions were incubated in an ice bath for 30 min and then centrifuged at 21,200 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were gently removed and stored for hexokinase activity. Alternatively, 2 mm Glc-6-P was included in the isolation buffer from the beginning of the isolation procedure and kept throughout all steps. The pellets obtained were re-suspended in 15% Percoll. The discontinuous density gradient was prepared manually by layering 3-ml fractions of the resuspended pellet on two preformed layers consisting of 3.5 ml of 23% Percoll above 3.5 ml of 40% Percoll. Tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 30,700 × g with slow brake deceleration. The material equilibrating near the interface between the 23 and 40% Percoll layers was gently diluted 1:4 with isolation buffer and then centrifuged at 16,700 × g for 10 min. A firm pellet was obtained and gently resuspended in the isolation buffer in which sucrose was substituted by 0.32 m mannitol and supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation at 6,900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was rapidly decanted, and the pellet resuspended in the same buffer using a fine Teflon pestle. Protein was determined by the Folin-Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard (43Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure yielded about 5 mg of protein per rat brain. Mitochondrial associated hexokinase activity was essentially present in control mitochondrial pellets (∼75%) whereas, as expected (11Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), pre-incubation with Glc-6-P promoted a release of >80% of the mt-hexokinase from mitochondria. All of the experiments with isolated mitochondria were carried out at 37 °C with continuous stirring in a respiration buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m mannitol, 8 mm inorganic phosphate, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.08 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 50 μm Ap5A.Determination of Hexokinase Activity—The activity of mitochondrial bound hexokinase was determined based on a previously described method with minor modifications (44Wilson J.E. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 13-21PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondrial protein used in this assay varied from 0.03-0.08 mg/ml, and the activity of hexokinase was determined by NADH formation following the absorbance at 340 nm. The assay medium contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm Ap5A as an inhibitor of adenylate kinase, 5 mmd-glucose, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm NAD+, and 1 unit/ml Glc-6-P dehydrogenase (Leuconostoc mesenteroides) in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction temperature was 37 °C. When ATP generated intramitochondrially by oxidative phosphorylation was used to measure the mt-hexokinase activity, the standard respiration buffer supplemented with 2 mm succinate and 0.1 mm ADP was employed. In the experiments using exogenous yeast hexokinase, the units of enzyme added were calculated considering the endogenous rat brain mt-hexokinase activity in control mitochondria in the same reaction mixture described above as a reference. The mitochondrial protein in these assays was 0.1-0.2 mg/ml.Oxygen Uptake Measurements—Oxygen uptake was measured in an oxymeter fitted with a water-jacketed Clark-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co., model 5300). Mitochondria (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated with 1.5 ml of the standard respiration buffer described above. The cuvette was closed immediately before starting the experiments. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with different mitochondrial preparations, and Fig. 1 shows representative experiments. Other additions are indicated in the Fig. 1 legend. Respiratory control ratio values were obtained with isolated mitochondria by using both pyruvate and malate as complex I substrates or succinate as a complex II substrate and were in good agreement with previous reported values (41Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar).Determination of Δψm—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by using the fluorescence signal of the cationic dye safranine O, which is accumulated and quenched inside energized mitochondria (45Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (0.2 mg protein/ml) were incubated in the standard respiration buffer supplemented with 10 μm safranine. FCCP (5 μm) was used as a positive control to collapse Δψm. Fluorescence was detected with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm (slit 5 nm) and an emission wavelength of 586 nm (slit 5 nm) using a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) model F-3010 spectrofluorometer. In different laboratories it has been shown that the addition of ADP promoted a 5-10% decrease of the Δψm (37Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Under our conditions we found that the addition of 0.2 mm ADP promoted a 20-25% decrease of the Δψm, which indicated that the effect of ADP was even more potent in our preparations than in previously reports. Data are reported as arbitrary fluorescence units. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with different mitochondrial preparations, and Fig. 4 shows representative experiments. Other additions are indicated in the Fig. 4 legend.Fig. 4Mitochondrial associated hexokinase activity regulates Δψm in isolated rat brain mitochondria.

Martino E. Stoppani A.O. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (0.2 mg of protein per milliliter) were incubated in the standard respiration buffer supplemented with 10 μm scopoletin and 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase. Fluorescence was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm and 450 nm, respectively. Calibration was performed by the addition of known quantities of H2O2. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with different mitochondrial preparations, and Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show representative experiments. Other additions are indicated in the Figs. 1, 2, and 3 legends. In all experiments, small variations in the levels of H2O2 formation were observed with different preparations, but the overall pattern of response to different modulators was not changed.Fig. 2Effect of glucose analogues on ROS generation by control rat brain mitochondria.A, hydrogen peroxide production (trace 1) after 2 mm succinate and the simultaneous addition of 0.2 mm ADP plus 5 mm 2-DOG. Trace 2 shows the effect of the simultaneous addition of 0.2 mm ADP plus 0.5 mm glucose on H2O2 generation. A typical trace of hydrogen peroxide formation (trace 3) after 2 mm succinate and 0.2 mm ADP addition is shown.

Similar results were obtained in at least four different independent mitochondrial preparations. Bars represent mean ± S.E. (n = 4). The infinity sign (∞) represents the time of blockage of H2O2 formation under 2-DOG and ADP conditions, which was higher than 20 min in all the experiments limited by 2-DOG and Pi.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Localization of mt-hexokinase activity is important for controlling ROS production. The rate of H2O2 generation in the state 3-state 4 transition was measured in hexokinase-depleted mitochondria, which were supplemented with increasing amounts of exogenous yeast hexokinase (open circles) that used intramitochondrially generated ATP after the addition of 2 mm succinate and 0.1 mm ADP plus 5 mm glucose. The closed circle represents the rate of H2O2 generation in the state 3-state 4 transition in control mitochondria containing only endogenous hexokinase activity, which uses the intramitochondrially generated ATP after the addition of 2 mm succinate and 0.1 mm ADP plus 5 mm glucose. For the closed circle, the value shown represents mean ± S.E. of four independent preparations. The figure shows representative experiments.

Cells were plated on glass coverslips coated previously with 1.5 μg/ml polyornithine in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. After 96 h of culture, the neurobasal medium was replaced by RPMI 1640 medium, which contains 10 mm glucose supplemented with 2 μm CM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes) to assess intracellular ROS formation. To investigate the effects of glucose, several aliquots of the medium were supplemented with different solutions to achieve the following final concentrations: 40 mm glucose; 40 mm glucose, plus 30 mm 2-DOG; and 40 mm glucose plus 5 mm FCCP. The cells were kept for 40 min at 37 °C and 4% CO2, and randomly chosen fields were examined under a Nikon Eclipse TE300 epifluorescence microscope at a fixed exposure time. Additionally, control cells were preloaded with 1 mm NAC in neurobasal medium and kept for 45 min at 37 °C with 4% CO2. The medium was then replaced to RPMI plus 2 μm CM-H2DCFDA plus 40 mm glucose plus 1 mm NAC. Control experiments were also conducted in the presence of 10 mm glucose plus 2 μm CM-H2DCFDA plus 100 μm H2O2 in the presence or absence of 1 mm NAC. All solutions employed in cell culture experiments were prepared and kept at all times under sterile conditions. Five independent fields were counted for each experimental condition (which were carried out in triplicate). Essentially identical results were obtained in at least three repeated experiments using neurons from different animals.Determination of Intracellular Glc-6-P Content—The intracellular levels of Glc-6-P were measured by a spectrophotometric assay with minor modifications (48Lang G.

To quantify intracellular Glc-6-P content, cultures of rat cortical neurons were kept as described above and scraped in 200 μl of 6% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid per plate (35 mm). The extract was neutralized by adding 80 μl of 1 m Tris solution. Glc-6-P levels were determined enzymatically by coupling to Glc-6-P"
https://openalex.org/W2069078243,"The human topoisomerase I- and p53-binding protein topors contains a highly conserved, N-terminal C3HC4-type RING domain that is homologous to the RING domains of known E3 ubiquitin ligases. We demonstrate that topors functions in vitro as a RING-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase with the E2 enzymes UbcH5a, UbcH5c, and UbcH6 but not with UbcH7, CDC34, or UbcH2b. Additional studies indicate that a conserved tryptophan within the topors RING domain is required for ubiquitination activity. Furthermore, both in vitro and cellular studies implicate p53 as a ubiquitination substrate for topors. Similar to MDM2, overexpression of topors results in a proteasome-dependent decrease in p53 protein expression in a human osteosarcoma cell line. These results are similar to the recent finding that a Drosophila topors orthologue ubiquitinates the Hairy transcriptional repressor and suggest that topors functions as a ubiquitin ligase for multiple transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2116767239,"We have recently demonstrated that osteopontin (OPN) induces nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-mediated promatrix metalloproteinase-2 activation through IκBα/IκBα kinase (IKK) signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which OPN regulates promatrix metalloproteinase-9 (pro-MMP-9) activation, MMP-9-dependent cell motility, and tumor growth and the involvement of upstream kinases in regulation of these processes in murine melanoma cells are not well defined. Here we report that OPN induced αvβ3 integrin-mediated phosphorylation and activation of nuclear factor-inducing kinase (NIK) and enhanced the interaction between phosphorylated NIK and IKKα/β in B16F10 cells. Moreover, NIK was involved in OPN-induced phosphorylations of MEK-1 and ERK1/2 in these cells. OPN induced NIK-dependent NFκB activation through ERK/IKKα/β-mediated pathways. Furthermore OPN enhanced NIK-regulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion, uPA-dependent pro-MMP-9 activation, cell motility, and tumor growth. Wild type NIK, IKKα/β, and ERK1/2 enhanced and kinase-negative NIK (mut NIK), dominant negative IKKα/β (dn IKKα/β), and dn ERK1/2 suppressed the OPN-induced NFκB activation, uPA secretion, pro-MMP-9 activation, cell motility, and chemoinvasion. Pretreatment of cells with anti-MMP-2 antibody along with anti-MMP-9 antibody drastically inhibited the OPN-induced cell migration and chemoinvasion, whereas cells pretreated with anti-MMP-2 antibody had no effect on OPN-induced pro-MMP-9 activation suggesting that OPN induces pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 activations through two distinct pathways. The level of active MMP-9 in the OPN-induced tumor was higher compared with control. To our knowledge, this is the first report that NIK plays a crucial role in OPN-induced NFκB activation, uPA secretion, and pro-MMP-9 activation through MAPK/IKKα/β-mediated pathways, and all of these ultimately control the cell motility, invasiveness, and tumor growth.

OPN acts both as chemokine and cytokine. It has an N-terminal signal sequence, a highly acidic region consisting of nine consecutive aspartic acid residues, and a GRGDS cell adhesion sequence predicted to be flanked by the β-sheet structure (3Prince C.W. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This protein has a functional thrombin cleavage site and is the substrate for tissue transglutaminase (2Denhardt D. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). It is produced by osteoclast, macrophages, T cells, hematopoietic cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (4Weber G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). OPN binds with type I collagen (5Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fibronectin (6Singh K. Devouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol.

Res. 1992; 7: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several highly metastatic transformed cells synthesize higher levels of OPN compared with non-tumorigenic cells (8Craig A.M.

It has been shown that OPN also interacts with several integrins and CD44 variants in an RGD sequence-dependent and -independent manner (9Weber G.F. Akshar S. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 1996; 271: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 10Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparampil I. Mukherjee B.B. Li X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9308-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). OPN is involved in normal tissue remodeling processes such as bone resorption, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue injuries as well as certain diseases such as restenosis, atherosclerosis, tumorigenesis, and autoimmune diseases (10Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparampil I. Mukherjee B.B. Li X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

OPN causes cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion, and cell proliferation by interaction with its receptor αvβ3 integrin in various cell types (10Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparampil I. Mukherjee B.B. Li X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9308-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Integrins are noncovalently associated, heterodimeric, cell surface glycoproteins with α- and β-subunits. The NFκB family consists of several members including p65, p50, Rel B, and c-Rel molecules (13Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The activity of NFκB is tightly regulated by its inhibitors, the IκB family of proteins (14Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). These inhibitory proteins bind to NFκB dimers, masking their nuclear localization sequence resulting in cytoplasmic retention of NFκB (15Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded via the ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated pathway leading to the nuclear import of NFκB where it binds to cognate sequence in promoter regions of multiple genes. IκBα kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit protein kinase, the activation of which phosphorylates IκB. Nuclear factor-inducing kinase (NIK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family that may either directly or indirectly phosphorylate or activate IKKα/β, leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα followed by NFκB activation (16Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Previous data also has indicated that NIK regulates differentiation of PC-12 cells through phosphorylation and activation of MEK-1 (17Foehr E.D. Bohuslav J. Chen L.-F. DeNoronha C. Geleziunas R. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34021-34024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The data also show that constitutively expressed or overexpressed wild type NIK in the presence of TNF, interleukin-1, TRAF-2, and TRAF-6 induced, and kinase-negative NIK (mut NIK) in the presence of the same stimuli suppressed, the NFκB activation (18Song H.Y.

Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our previous results indicate that OPN induces cell motility, tumor growth, NFκB-mediated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion, and promatrix metalloproteinase-2 (pro-MMP-2) activation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/IKK/Akt signaling pathways (20Philip S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28593-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathway by which OPN regulates NIK activation and NIK-dependent MAPK/IKK-mediated NFκB activation through phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in B16F10 cells is not well defined. uPA is a serine protease that interacts with uPA receptor and facilitates the conversion of inert zymogen plasminogen into widely acting serine protease plasmin and activation of MMPs (23Collen C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 198-204Google Scholar). These proteases then degrade the surrounding matrix components (collagen, gelatin, fibronectin, and laminin) and allow cancer cells to migrate to distant sites. It is established that uPA plays a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis (25MacDougall J.R. Matrisian L.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6209-6221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NFκB-response element is present in the promoter region of uPA, which plays a key role in cancer metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism by which OPN regulates NIK activation and NIK-dependent MAPK- and IKK-mediated NFκB activation and uPA secretion, which lead to the activation of pro-MMP-9 and control cell migration, ECM invasion, and tumor growth, is not well documented. MMPs are ECM-degrading enzymes that play a critical role in embryogenesis, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and angiogenesis (27Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that OPN induces NFκB-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation through IκBα/IKK signaling pathways (20Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Philip S. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14487-14497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). MMP-9 (also called type IV collagenase or gelatinase B) is another important contributor to the process of invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis (28Scorilas A. Karameris A. Amogiannaki N. Ardavanis A. Bassilopoulos P. Trangas T. Talleri M. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 29Hrabec E. Strek M. Nowak D. Hrabec Z. Respir.

MMP-9 can efficiently degrade native type IV and V collagens, fibronectin, ectactin, and elastin. The regulation of activation of MMP-9 is more complex than that of most of the other MMPs because most of the cells do not express a constitutively active form of MMP-9, but its activity is induced by different stimuli depending on cell types (32Dubois B. Masure S. Hurtenbach U. Paemen L. Heremans H. Van den Oord J. Sciot R. Meinhardt T. Hammerling G. Opdenakker G. Arnold B. J. Clin.

Cancer. 1993; 53: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) thereby contributing to the specific pathological events. MMP-9 is not only associated with invasion and metastasis but also has been implicated in angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, retinopathy, and vascular stenosis, and hence MMP-9 is considered to be a therapeutic target of high priority (35Folkman J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Earlier reports indicate that transgenic mice lacking MMP-9 show reduced keratinocyte hyperproliferation and decreased incidence of invasive tumors (36Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1998: 300-356Google Scholar). NFκB-responsive element is present in the promoter region of MMP-9, which plays a key role in cancer metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism by which OPN regulates NFκB-mediated pro-MMP-9 activation and controls cell migration and tumor growth is not well understood. In this study, we found that OPN induced phosphorylation and activation of NIK and the interaction between phosphorylated NIK and IKK in B16F10 cells. OPN enhanced NIK- and IKK-dependent NFκB activation. OPN also induced NIK-mediated NFκB activation by modulating the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Moreover OPN induced uPA secretion and uPA-dependent pro-MMP-9 activation, cell motility, chemoinvasion, and tumor growth. The OPN-induced NIK-dependent ERK/IKK-mediated NFκB transactivation, pro-MMP-9 activation, and cell motility were enhanced when cells were transfected with wild type NIK, IKKα/β, and ERK1/2 and suppressed when cells were transfected with mut NIK, dn IKKα/β, or dn ERK1/2. Taken together, these data demonstrated that OPN enhances cell motility, chemoinvasion, and tumor growth and induces NIK-dependent NFκB-mediated uPA secretion and uPA-regulated pro-MMP-9 activation through MAPK/IKK-mediated signaling pathways.

All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—The B16F10 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Plasmids and DNA Transfection—The wild type NIK (wt pcDNA NIK) and kinase-negative NIK (mut pcDNA NIK, NIK-K429A/K430A) in pcDNA3 were generous gifts from Prof. David Wallach (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). The wild type and dominant negative constructs of IKKα (wt IKKα and dn IKKα) and IKKβ (wt IKKβ and dn IKKβ) in pRK were kind gifts from Prof. D. V. Goeddel (Tularik Inc., San Francisco, CA). The wt ERK1 and dn ERK1 in pCEP4 and wt ERK2 and dn ERK2 in p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 were from Dr. Melanie Cobb (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The luciferase reporter construct (pNFκB-Luc) containing five tandem repeats of the NFκB binding site was a generous gift from Dr. Rainer de Martin (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). The super-repressor form of IκBα cDNA fused downstream to a FLAG epitope in an expression vector (pCMV4) was a gift from Dr. Dean Ballard (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). B16F10 cells were split 12 h prior to transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were transiently transfected with cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly cDNA (8 μg) was mixed with Plus reagent, and then the cDNA Reagent Plus were incubated with LipofectAMINE. The LipofectAMINE Plus cDNA complex was added to the cells and incubated further at 37 °C for 12 h. The control cells received LipofectAMINE Plus alone. The cell viability was detected by a trypan blue dye exclusion test. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were refed with fresh medium and maintained for an additional 12 h. These transfected cells were used for interaction studies between phosphorylated NIK and IKK, IκBα phosphorylation, IKK assay, MEK-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, EMSA, NFκB luciferase reporter gene assay, and detection of MMP-9 by zymography and Western blot and uPA secretion by Western blot, cell migration, and chemoinvasion assays. In Vitro Kinase Assay—To examine the effect of OPN on NIK activity, the semiconfluent B16F10 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in kinase assay lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm DTT, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40). The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates containing an equal amount of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-NIK antibody. Half of the immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with IKK as substrate in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm DTT) containing 10 μm ATP and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C. The kinase reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using anti-NIK antibody. A fraction of equal volume of samples from the kinase reaction mixture was analyzed by Western blot using anti-IKKα/β antibody. To investigate the role of NIK in OPN-induced IKK activity, the cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 10 min at 37 °C. In separate experiments, cells were transfected with wild type NIK or kinase-negative NIK in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus and then treated with 5 μm OPN. The cells were lysed in kinase assay lysis buffer. The cell lysates containing an equal amount of total proteins (300 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα/β antibody. Half of the immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with recombinant IκBα (4 μg) in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm DTT) at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. The sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot using anti-IKKα/β antibody. A fraction of equal volume of samples from the kinase reaction mixture was analyzed by Western blot using anti-IκBα antibody. The level of NIK in the immunoprecipitated samples was analyzed by Western blot using anti-NIK antibody. To check whether OPN regulates the interaction between phosphorylated NIK and IKKα/β, cells were treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-IKKα/β antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot using rabbit anti-phospho-NIK antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-IKKα/β antibody as loading control. Western Blot Analysis—To delineate the role of OPN in regulation of NIK phosphorylation, the cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 0-30 min. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (20 μg/ml) or GRGDSP or GRGESP peptide (10 μm) and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 7 min at 37 °C. In other experiments, cells were treated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 5 min as positive control. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm iodoacetamide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysates containing an equal amount of total proteins were analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-phospho-NIK antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit anti-NIK or antiactin antibody as loading controls and detected by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To examine the effect of NIK on OPN-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, cells were transfected with either wild type NIK or kinase-negative NIK and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 10 min. The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-phospho-IκBα antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit anti-IκBα antibody. As loading control, the expression of actin was also detected by reprobing the blot with anti-actin antibody. To detect whether NIK regulates OPN-induced MEK-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, cells were transfected with wild type or kinase-negative NIK and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 10 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-p-MEK-1 or anti-p-ERK1/2 antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-MEK-1 or anti-ERK1/2 antibody. To check whether αvβ3 integrin is involved in OPN-induced MEK-1 phosphorylation, the cells were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 antibody or RGD peptide (GRGDSP or GRGESP) and then treated with OPN. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-p-MEK-1 antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-MEK-1 antibody. To investigate the role of OPN on pro-MMP-9 activation, the cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 24 h. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (20 μg/ml), RGD/RGE peptide (10 μm GRGDSP or GRGESP), anti-uPA antibody (25 μg/ml), or anti-MMP-2 antibody (0-50 μg/ml) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN. The conditioned medium was collected, concentrated, and dialyzed. The samples containing an equal amount of total proteins were analyzed by Western blot using rabbit anti-MMP-9 antibody. To ascertain the role of NIK in OPN-induced uPA secretion, the cells were either treated with 0-5 μm OPN or transfected with wild type NIK or mut NIK and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 24 h. To examine whether ERK1/2 plays any roles in OPN-induced uPA secretion, cells were transfected with wild type or dn ERK1/2 and then treated with OPN. The cell lysates containing an equal amount of total proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-uPA antibody. As loading controls the expression of actin was also detected by reprobing the blots with rabbit anti-actin antibody. Zymography Experiments—The gelatinolytic activity was measured as described previously (20Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To further check the effect of OPN on pro-MMP-9 activation, the cells were treated with 0-10 μm OPN for 24 h or pretreated with anti-uPA antibody (25 μg/ml) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN. The conditioned medium was collected by centrifugation. The samples containing an equal amount of total proteins were mixed with sample buffer in the absence of reducing agent and loaded onto zymography SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin (0.5 mg/ml) as described previously (20Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The gels were incubated in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3) for 16 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. Negative staining showed the zones of gelatinolytic activity. In another experiment, cells were also transfected with wild type NIK, kinase-negative NIK, or the super-repressor form of IκBα in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus and then treated with OPN for 24 h. In separate experiments, cells were transfected with wild type or dominant negative IKKα and IKKβ and then treated with 5 μm OPN. The conditioned medium was collected, and the level of active MMP-9 was detected by zymography as described above. EMSA—To check whether NIK and IKK play any role in OPN-induced NFκB-DNA binding, cells were either treated with 5 μm OPN or transfected with wild type NIK, kinase-negative NIK, or wild type and dn IKKβ and then treated with OPN for 6 h at 37 °C, and EMSA was performed as described previously (37Das R. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11051-11064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MEK-1 or ERK1/2 is involved in OPN-induced NFκB-DNA binding and whether it is regulated by NIK, cells were either pretreated with PD98059 or transfected with wt NIK or kinase-negative NIK and then treated with PD98059 or transfected with wild type and dn ERK1 and ERK2. Transfected or treated cells were further treated with OPN. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described earlier (37Das R. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11051-11064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly the cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The nuclear pellet was extracted in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT). The supernatant was used as a nuclear extract. The nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 16 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded NFκB oligonucleotide (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl) containing 2 μg of polydeoxyinosinic deoxycytidylic acid (poly(dI-dC)). The DNA-protein complex was resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. For supershift assay,"

One mechanism of bacterial survival and mucosal damage is induction of macrophage apoptosis, which we have reported to be dependent on polyamine synthesis by arginase and ornithine decarboxylase. During metabolic back-conversion, polyamines are oxidized and release H2O2, which can cause apoptosis by mitochondrial membrane depolarization. We hypothesized that this mechanism is induced by H. pylori in macrophages. Polyamine oxidation can occur by acetylation of spermine or spermidine by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase prior to back-conversion by acetylpolyamine oxidase, but recently direct conversion of spermine to spermidine by the human polyamine oxidase h1, also called spermine oxidase, has been demonstrated. H. pylori induced expression and activity of the mouse homologue of this enzyme (polyamine oxidase 1 (PAO1)) by 6 h in parallel with ornithine decarboxylase, consistent with the onset of apoptosis, while spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity was delayed until 18 h when late stage apoptosis had already peaked. Inhibition of PAO1 by MDL 72527 or by PAO1 small interfering RNA significantly attenuated H. pylori-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of PAO1 also significantly reduced H2O2 generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation. Overexpression of PAO1 by transient transfection induced macrophage apoptosis. The importance of H2O2 was confirmed by inhibition of apoptosis with catalase. These studies demonstrate a new mechanism for pathogen-induced oxidative stress in macrophages in which activation of PAO1 leads to H2O2 release and apoptosis by a mitochondrial-dependent cell death pathway, contributing to deficiencies in host defense in diseases such as H. pylori infection.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that selectively colonizes the mammalian stomach and causes gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. Intriguingly the human host mounts a vigorous innate and adaptive immune response, yet this results only in lifelong gastritis without eradication of the organism. H. pylori has evolved several strategies to enhance its own survival in the face of this immune response. For example, we have shown that while the host produces NO derived from inducible nitric-oxide synthase in response to soluble products of H. pylori (1Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L.

Additionally H. pylori has been shown to induce apoptosis of T cells (4Wang J. Brooks E.G. Bamford K.B. Denning T.L. Pappo J. Ernst P.B. J.

H. pylori-induced macrophage apoptosis is NO-independent, but is abrogated by inhibition of either arginase or ODC and restored by addition of spermidine or spermine (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y.

These studies raise the question as to the mechanism of polyamine-driven macrophage apoptosis. While ODC is the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis, there are several pathways of polyamine metabolism that are relevant to their biological function in cells. Spermine and spermidine can be metabolized by an oxidative process that results in the release of H2O2. Specifically this can occur in two ways. In the originally identified back-conversion pathway, spermine or spermidine is metabolized by the enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) to acetylspermine or acetylspermidine, respectively (6Casero Jr., R.A.

Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); this enzyme has recently been cloned (9Vujcic S. Liang P. Diegelman P. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Subsequently this enzyme has been named APAO to denote acetyl PAO (10Casero Jr., R.A. Wang Y. Stewart T.M. Devereux W. Hacker A. Smith R. Woster P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 361-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, an additional enzyme, PAOh1, was cloned in human cells (11Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M.

In the current study, we investigated the mouse homologue, which we term PAO1. Apoptosis induced by polyamine analogues has been attributed to oxidation of polyamines and generation of H2O2 in cell types that include small cell lung cancer (14Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D.

We hypothesized that oxidation of polyamines generated by H. pylori was the key step in causing macrophage apoptosis. We therefore sought to determine the respective roles of the SSAT-APAO versus the PAO1 pathway, the ability of H. pylori to induce these enzymes, and the relationship to apoptosis. This is the first report of any microbe inducing polyamine oxidation specifically via induction of PAO1 expression and activity in macrophages. We will show that a cascade of events ensues in which oxidation of spermine results in H2O2 release, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis. All reagents for cell culture, RNA extraction, and RT-PCR were from Invitrogen. MDL 72527, a PAO inhibitor, was a gift from N. Seiler (Strasbourg, France). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. H. pylori SS1, a mouse-adapted human strain (24Lee A. O'Rourke J. De Ungria M.C. Robertson B. Daskalopoulos G. Dixon M.F.

Bacteria were passaged on Brucella agar plates containing 10% sheep blood and were maintained under microaerobic conditions. For experiments, H. pylori were harvested from plates, washed twice, and suspended in PBS. H. pylori lysate (HPL) was prepared with a French press in PBS (1Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L.

For experiments, cells were washed, and the same medium without penicillin-streptomycin was added 2 h before stimulation. Multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) was determined as the ratio of bacteria/eukaryotic cells. In the experiments with HPL, the m.o.i. was based on the number of bacteria prior to lysis (1Wilson K.T.

After stimulation, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. Subsequently 2 μg of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using 50 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase. PCR was conducted using 2 μl of cDNA and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. For ODC, PAO1, APAO, and SSAT 15 pmol each of sense and antisense primers were used with 3 pmol each of β-actin primers in a multiplex reaction (2Gobert A.P. Mersey B.D. Cheng Y. Blumberg D.R.

The total numbers of cycles were 30 for PAO1 and SSAT, 32 for APAO, and 20 for ODC. A final elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C was used for each reaction. Sense and antisense primer sequences and PCR product sizes were as follows: murine PAO1, 5′-CACGTGATTGTGACCGTTTC-3′ and 5′-TGGGTAGGTGAGGGTACAGTC-3′, 222 bp; murine APAO, 5′-CTTTTCCAGGGGAGACCTTC-3′ and 5′-CACACCACCTGGATGAACTG-3′, 250 bp; murine SSAT, 5′-GACCCCTGAAGGACATAGCA-3′ and 5′-CCGAAGCACCTCTTCTTTTG-3′, 248 bp; murine ODC, 5′-CAGCAGGCTTCTCTTGGAAC-3′ and 5′-CATGCATTTCAGGCAGGTTA-3′, 602 bp; and murine/human β-actin, 5′-CCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC-3′ and 5′-CTGTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAG-3′, 436 bp. PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels with 0.4 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Stained bands were visualized under UV light and photographed with a digital gel documentation system (EDAS 290 and 1D software, Eastman Kodak Co.). 2 μg of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using 50 units Superscript II reverse transcriptase. PCRs were performed using an Opticon 2 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Cambridge, MA) and SYBR Green Master Mix (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with 5.4 nm primers for murine PAO1, APAO, SSAT, or ODC and β-actin as listed above. Thermal cycling conditions included an initial denaturation step (94 °C for 2 min) and 40 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). Relative expression was calculated from threshold values (CT) of target and reference genes. ODC activity was determined by a radiometric analysis in which the amount of 14CO2 liberated from l-[14C]ornithine was measured as described previously (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L.

Enzyme activities were assayed in cell homogenates by a modification of a chemiluminescence assay as described previously (27Wang Y. Murray-Stewart T. Devereux W. Hacker A. Frydman B. Woster P.M. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was determined using a Monolight 3010 luminometer with two reagent injectors. Luminol was prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO and diluted to 100 nm with H2O immediately prior to use. Macrophages were scraped into 500 μl of 80 mm borate buffer, pH 9.0, and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax (IKA Works, Wilmington, NC). For the assay of PAO1 activity, 100 μl of cell lysate was added to 100 μl of 80 mm borate buffer, pH 9.0, containing 570 milliunits of horseradish peroxidase and 250 μm spermine. All reagents were combined and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and then the tube was transferred to the luminometer. Luminol (5 nmol) was added, and the resulting chemiluminescence was integrated over 20 s. The integral values were calibrated against standards containing known concentrations of H2O2, and the activities were expressed as nmol of H2O2/mg of protein/min. The assay was linear in the range of 3-89 nmol of H2O2. All of the samples were diluted appropriately to be assayed in the linear range. For APAO activity, cell homogenates were prepared in borate buffer, pH 9.0, exactly as above. 100 μl of the cell lysate was added to 100 μl of 80 mm borate buffer, pH 9.0, containing 570 milliunits of horseradish peroxidase and 250 μmN1-acetylspermine (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) as substrate. This assay mixture was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and then the tube was transferred to the luminometer. Luminol (5 nmol) was added, and the resulting chemiluminescence was integrated over 20 s. Integral values were calibrated and expressed exactly as for PAO1 above with the same linear range. SSAT activity was determined in RAW 264.7 cell extracts by an assay that measures the formation of l-[14C]acetylspermidine from l-[14C]acetyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10 min at 30 °C as described previously (28Wallace H.M. Evans D.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 79: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mm spermidine, and 12.7 μm (specific activity, 63 mCi/mmol) l-[14C]acetyl-CoA in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 1 m NH2-OH·HCl and boiling for 3 min. The resulting samples were spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose discs and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Enzyme activity was expressed as nmol of l-[14C]acetylspermidine formed/min/mg of protein. Polyamine levels were determined by precolumn dansylation reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography as reported previously (29Casero Jr., R.A. Ervin S.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 639-643PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (1Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L. Musselman R.F. James S.P. Meltzer S.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1524-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was measured with three methods. Annexin V-FITC Staining—RAW 264.7 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in 24-well plates in the presence of HPL for 6-24 h. In some experiments RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of the H2O2-detoxifying enzyme catalase (250-1000 units/ml) or polyethylene glycol (PEG)-catalase (25-250 units/ml) for 24 h. Apoptosis was assayed using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in binding medium and stained with annexin V-FITC. Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and counterstained with 10 μl of propidium iodide (PI; 30 μg/ml). 1 × 104 cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Spectral overlap was electronically compensated using single color control cells stained with PI or FITC. Analysis of the multivariate data was performed with CELLQuest™ software (BD Biosciences). The upper right (annexin V+/PI+) quadrant represents late apoptotic cells, and the lower right (annexin V+/PI-) quadrant represents early apoptotic cells, while the upper left (annexin V-/PI+) and lower left (annexin V-/PI-) quadrants represent necrotic and viable cell populations, respectively. Apoptosis by DNA Histogram Analysis—RAW 264.7 cells or peritoneal macrophages (0.5 × 106 cells/well in 24-well plates) were stimulated with HPL for 24 h in the presence and absence of MDL 72527, transfected PAO1 siRNA, scrambled siRNA, or transfected PAO1 cDNA. Both adherent and floating cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol. Low molecular weight DNA was extracted with 0.2 m phosphate citrate buffer (pH 7.8), and the remaining cells were stained with PI (30Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) using a cell cycle analysis kit (Roche Applied Science). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. 1.5 × 105 cells were acquired and analyzed with ModFit LT™ software (BD Biosciences) using the sub-G0/G1 peak as the apoptotic population (31Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). DNA Nick-end Labeling of Cells—Macrophages (5 × 104/well) were cultured in 4-well plastic chambered slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) with or without HPL (m.o.i. of 30) and inhibitors for 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by TUNEL assay as described previously (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4692-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined after counting of 10 microscope fields at a magnification of 400×. Viability of RAW 264.7 cells was estimated by a colorimetric assay with the cell proliferation kit II (Roche Applied Science). The tetrazolium salt 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyaniline (XTT), which is metabolized to formazan by intact mitochondrial dehydrogenases, and electron coupling reagent were added after 20 h and left in the medium for the remaining 4 h of the stimulation period. The viability of cells was estimated on the basis of formazan formed, which was detected spectrophotometrically. siRNA duplexes were utilized that targeted mouse PAO1 nucleotides 467-487, numbered from the start codon (sense, 5′-GGACGUGGUUGAGGAAUUC-3′; antisense, 5′-CCUGCACCAACUCCUUAAG-3′). Scrambled control siRNA that has no sequence homology to any known genes was used as the control. 20 μl of the 20 μm stock duplex siPAO1 or control scrambled siRNA was mixed with 100 μl of optiMEM medium (Invitrogen). This mixture was gently added to a solution containing 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of optiMEM. The solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and gently overlaid onto 90% confluent RAW 264.7 cells in 1 ml of optiMEM for 18 h. Medium was changed, and cells were incubated for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were treated with HPL for 6-24 h. After 6 h RNA was isolated, and PAO1 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR using primers that flank the target sequence as follows: sense, 5′-CAATGGCCTTTTGGAAGAGA-3′; and antisense, 5′-TTACCATGCCGGAAGAACTC-3′. Apoptosis and PAO1 enzyme activity assays were performed after 24 h of stimulation with or without HPL. RAW 264.7 cells were cotransfected with 400 ng of pSV-β-galactosidase and 200 ng of pcDNA3.1-PAO1 using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) and optiMEM medium. Cell culture medium was changed 6 h after transfection to complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and cells were stimulated with HPL for 24 h. Transfected cells were stained with PI and analyzed for apoptosis and PAO1 activity as described above. Transfection efficiency was calculated by measuring the β-galactosidase activity in transfected cells. To measure intracellular H2O2 we used the cell-permeable redox-sensitive dye CM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes); the nonfluorescent reduced form is converted to the fluorescent form when oxidized, allowing detection by flow cytometry (14Ha H.C.

CM-H2DCFDA is oxidized by cellular H2O2, hydroxyl radicals, and other free radical products of H2O2, while it is relatively insensitive to oxidation by superoxide (32Kirkland R.A. Franklin J.L. J.

RAW 264.7 cells were treated for 1-6 h with HPL with or without MDL 72527, catalase, or PEG-catalase, washed with PBS, and treated with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 20 min at 37 °C. 1 × 105 cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan for changes in fluorescence (14Ha H.C.

Cells were stimulated with HPL for 6 h, washed with cold PBS, and incubated with a reaction mixture containing 50 μm Amplex Red reagent (Molecular Probes) and 0.1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer for 10 min. Plates were read with a fluorescence microplate reader with excitation of 530 nm and emission detection at 590 nm, and the H2O2 level was determined by using a standard curve with varying dilutions of H2O2 (34Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The electron gradient across the mitochondrial membrane space during normal respiration is Δψm. Loss of Δψm (depolarization) was measured by flow cytometry after staining with a MitoCapture™ kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cationic dye fluoresces red as it aggregates inside healthy mitochondria. In apoptotic cells, if the Δψm collapses, the dye stays as a monomer in the cytoplasm and emits green light. RAW 264.7 cells were plated on slide chambers (1 × 104 cells/well) and stimulated with HPL with or without MDL 72527 for 18 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 100% chilled methanol for 4 min on ice. Slides were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 60 min at room temperature and then incubated with a monoclonal anti-mouse cytochrome c antibody (Oncogene) overnight at 4 °C. A rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to FITC was used, and staining was visualized with a Nikon ECLIPSE E 800 microscope. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with HPL with or without MDL 72527 and incubated for 18 h. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared with a cytosolic/mitochondrial fractionation kit (Oncogene). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (1Wilson K.T.

https://openalex.org/W2067318991,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early regulatory protein ICP0 stimulates lytic infection and reactivation from latency, processes that require the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity mediated by the RING finger domain in the N-terminal portion of the protein. ICP0 stimulates the production of polyubiquitin chains by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a and UbcH6 in vitro, and in infected and transfected cells it induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of a number of cellular proteins including PML, the major constituent protein of PML nuclear bodies. However, ICP0 binds strongly to the cellular ubiquitin-specific protease USP7, a member of a family of proteins that cleave polyubiquitin chains and/or ubiquitin precursors. The region of ICP0 that is required for its interaction with USP7 has been mapped, and mutations in this domain reduce the functionality of ICP0. These findings pose the question: why does ICP0 include domains that are associated with the potentially antagonistic functions of ubiquitin conjugation and deconjugation? Here we report that although neither protein affected the intrinsic activities of the other in vitro, USP7 protected ICP0 from autoubiquitination in vitro, and their interaction can greatly increase the stability of ICP0 in vivo. These results demonstrate that RING finger-mediated autoubiquitination of ICP0 is biologically relevant and can be regulated by interaction with USP7.

Environmental stimuli such as stress and sunlight trigger periodic recurrences of lytic infection, causing cold sores and genital lesions. HSV-1 expresses three broad groups of temporally regulated genes during lytic infection, termed immediate-early (IE), early, and late (for reviews, see Refs. 1Roizman B. Pellett P.E. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2381-2397Google Scholar and 2Roizman B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2399-2459Google Scholar). The IE protein ICP0 has an important role in the mechanisms that govern the switch between lytic and latent infection (reviewed in Refs. 3Everett R.D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 4Hagglund R. Roizman B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2169-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Everett R.D. Boutell C. Orr A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although not essential for viral replication, ICP0 increases the probability of the virus entering lytic infection, particularly after low multiplicity infection of human fibroblasts, and in its absence, viral genomes are more likely to become repressed and establish a quiescent infection (5Everett R.D. Boutell C. Orr A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Preston C.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 7Samaniego L.A. Neiderhiser L. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3307-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP0 stimulates the expression of all three classes of viral genes by as yet uncertain mechanisms that correlate with its ability to induce the degradation of a number of cellular proteins (8Everett R.D.

Dejean A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5137-5143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP0 includes a zinc-binding RING finger domain in its N-terminal portion, and in its C-terminal third lie a nuclear localization signal and motifs required for self-multimerization and efficient localization at specific nuclear substructures known as ND10 or PML nuclear bodies. Consistent with its ability to induce the degradation of certain cellular proteins, the RING finger domain of ICP0 has been shown to possess the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that is typical of RING finger family proteins both in vitro and in vivo (13Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 14Boutell C. Everett R.D. J. Biol.

ICP0 has been reported to interact with a number of viral and cellular proteins (18Kawaguchi Y. Bruni R. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kawaguchi Y. Van Sant C. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7328-7336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kawaguchi Y. Tanaka M. Yokoymama A. Matsuda G. Kato K. Kagawa H. Hirai K. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among these interacting proteins is USP7 (also known as HAUSP (herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease), a member of a large family of cellular enzymes that cleave ubiquitin from either α- or isopeptide-linked chains (22Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. Cross A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). ICP0 function in gene expression and viral growth assays was reduced (but not eliminated) by mutation of residues within its USP7-binding motif, suggesting that the interaction is biologically relevant (23Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 417-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is clear that a major component of the functions of ICP0 is derived from its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, it is paradoxical that it should include in its C-terminal portion a domain involved in the potentially antagonistic process of polyubiquitin chain cleavage. This study aimed to test various possible consequences of the ICP0-USP7 interaction. For example, ICP0 might inhibit the peptidase activity of USP7 or control its specificity, or USP7 might regulate ICP0 E3 ligase activity. We have studied the activities of both proteins in vitro singly and in combination and the consequences of their interaction in vivo. Although we could not detect an effect of either protein on the intrinsic catalytic activity of the other in vitro, we found that ICP0 can induce its own ubiquitination in vitro and that binding to USP7 inhibits ICP0 autoubiquitination. Consistent with these observations, a derivative of ICP0 lacking the RING finger is more stable than the wild type (WT) protein during HSV-1 infection, indicating that the ubiquitin ligase activity of ICP0 contributes to its own turnover. Conversely, a USP7-binding-deficient form of ICP0 is highly unstable during HSV-1 infection. These observations demonstrate a mechanism that regulates RING finger E3 ligase activity that may be applicable to other members of the RING finger family, particularly those that have also been reported to interact with ubiquitin-specific protease enzymes. Plasmids—Plasmid pT7-USP7 was constructed by cloning the NdeI-HindIII fragment of the USP7 cDNA into pET3a (22Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. Cross A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The USP7 initiation codon is in the NdeI site, and the fragment includes 205 nucleotides of the 3′ untranslated region. The NdeI-HindIII fragment was excised and cloned into pET24a, which provided a NotI site on the 3′ side of the HindIII site. The NdeI-NotI fragment of the resultant plasmid (pET24a-USP7) was excised and cloned between the EcoRI-NotI sites of pFastBac-HTa (Invitrogen), downstream of an oligonucleotide flanked by EcoRI and NdeI sites and encoding a polyhistidine tag preceded by the sequence MRGS. This plasmid was named pFastBac-HTa-USP7, and subsequently the derivative pFastBac-HTa-USP7(C223S) was constructed in which the active site cysteine residue (Cys-223) had been mutated to a serine residue. The C223S mutation is as follows.AAGAATCAGGGcGCcACTaGTTACATGAACKNQGATSYMNSEQUENCE IThe changed bases are in lowercase, the two silent changes in the glycine and alanine codons create an NarI site for ease of tracking, and codon 223 is shown in bold. Plasmids pCI-USP7 and pCI-USP7(C223S) contain the wild type and C223S USP7 open reading frames inserted downstream of the human cytomegalovirus IE promoter in vector pCIneo (Promega) for expression in transfected mammalian cells. Plasmid pFastbac-HTa-ICP0 (13Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) was modified to create pFastBac-HTa-M1 by replacing the MluI-SalI ICP0 coding region fragment with the corresponding fragment from pCI-M1; the M1 mutations eliminate the ability of ICP0 to bind to USP7 (23Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 417-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEXUb52 expresses ubiquitin with a natural C-terminal extension fused to GST (22Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. Cross A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET28-E56 was constructed by linking the NcoI-NotI fragment of ICP0 cDNA plasmid p110-C1 (24Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the NotI-EcoRI fragment of ICP0 EcoRI linker insertion mutant p110E56 (25Everett R.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in vector plasmid pET28a. Plasmid pET28-E56 expresses in bacteria a polypeptide containing ICP0 residues 1–509 linked to a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. Viruses and Cells—HSV-1 strain 17+ was the wild type strain used. The mutant virus derivatives used were FXE and M1, that express forms of ICP0 lacking the RING finger (FXE) or contain amino acid substitutions in the USP7 interaction region (M1) (23Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 417-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1185-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All viruses were grown in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells and titrated in U2OS cells, in which ICP0 is not required for efficient replication of HSV-1 (27Yao F. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. BHK cells were grown in Glasgow modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 10% tryptose phosphate broth. All cell growth media were supplemented with 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg streptomycin/ml. Baculoviruses—Recombinant baculoviruses Ac.HTa-USP7, Ac.HTa-USP7(C223S), and Ac.HTa-M1 were generated from the plasmids described above using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) and grown according to the supplier's guidelines. Baculovirus Ac.HTa-ICP0 has been described previously (13Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For the preparation of baculovirus-infected cell extracts, Sf21 insect cells were grown in suspension in TC100 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics as above. When the cells reached a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml, they were infected for 72 h using a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 2 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell. The cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored at –70 °C until required. Expression and Purification of ICP0, ICP0-M1, and USP7—Pellets of infected Sf21 cells harvested from 75 ml of an infected culture were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The cell suspension was gently sonicated for 30 s in a soni-bath and incubated on ice for 30 min. The extracts were diluted with an equal volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before centrifugation at 13,000 revolutions/minute for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 200 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of Buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Proteins were eluted in three aliquots of 300 μl of Buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole, dialyzed into 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and stored at –70 °C. Expression and Purification of GST-Ub52—Plasmid pGEX-Ub52 was transformed into BL21(λDE3)pLysS bacteria, and fresh colonies were inoculated into 100 ml of yeast tryptone broth and grown to mid-log phase. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and then incubation was continued for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 revolutions/minute for 15 min, resuspended in 2 ml of PBS, and lysed by sonication. Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.1% (v/v), and the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 8000 revolutions/minute for 20 min. The soluble extract was stored at –20 °C. GST-Ub52 was purified by incubating 300 μl of extract with 100 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (50% v/v in PBS) for 30 min, washing the beads three times with PBS, and eluting bound protein with 150 μl of elution buffer (50 mm reduced glutathione, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Purified GST-Ub52 protein was stored at –20 °C. Expression and Purification of ICP0-E56—Plasmid pET28-E56 was transformed into BL21 bacteria (Novagen), and then fresh colonies were inoculated into 100 ml of yeast tryptone broth and grown to mid-log phase. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and incubation was continued for 2 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (used for the purification of full-length ICP0 as described above) and lysed by sonication. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation and then subjected to nickel affinity chromatography as described above for purification of full-length ICP0. Ubiquitin-specific Cleavage Assays—Ub52 cleavage assays were performed by incubating GST-Ub52 with USP7 in a 10-μl reaction volume in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol. The amount of Ub52 used varied from ∼200 to 600 ng, and the amount of USP7 used varied from 10 pg to 5 ng. The assay was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 135 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 0.06% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% glycerol. The reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Ubiquitin Ligase Assays—In vitro ubiquitin ligase assays were performed as described by Boutell, et al. (13Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant histidine-tagged ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) and the recombinant ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) UbcH5a were expressed and purified. Ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma. Ubiquitin conjugation assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm ATP. Approximately 5–50 nm E1, 50–250 nm E2, 7 μm ubiquitin, and 50 ng of ICP0 were used in each reaction. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were then subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the products were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (mAb) P4D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ICP0 autoubiquitination assays were carried out as described above, except that in some assays the reaction mixtures contained an additional 10–50 ng of USP7 and 10 mm dithiothreitol and utilized 100 ng of methyl ubiquitin (Boston Biochem, Inc.) instead of normal ubiquitin. The products were separated on 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting and probed for ICP0 using mAb 11060 (28Everett R.D. Cross A. Orr A. Virology. 1993; 197: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Infections and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were seeded into 24-well dishes at 1 × 105 cells/well and then infected the following day with HSV-1 viruses as described in the relevant figure legends and text. The cell monolayers were then washed twice with 1 ml of PBS before being harvested directly in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were resolved on 7.5 and/or 10% SDS-PAGE or 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting. After blocking overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% dried milk, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody in PBST containing 5% dried milk for 2 h at room temperature. The antibodies used were: anti-ICP0 mAb 11060 (28Everett R.D. Cross A. Orr A. Virology. 1993; 197: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), anti-ICP4 mAb 10176 (29Everett R. Cross A. Tyler J. Orr A. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1955-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), anti-USP7 rabbit serum r201 (30Parkinson J. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10006-10017Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or BL851 (Bethyl Laboratories), and anti-ubiquitin antibody P4D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membranes were washed four times in PBST, incubated with secondary antibody in PBST and 2% dried milk for one h at room temperature, washed four times in PBST, and then incubated with PerkinElmer Life Sciences Enhanced ECL reagent and exposed to film. Antibodies were stripped from the membranes using the Amersham Biosciences ECL protocol prior to reprobing with different antibodies. Immune Precipitation—Protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with anti-ICP0 mAb 11060 were incubated with equivalent amounts of either ICP0-E56 or full-length ICP0 and mixed end-over-end for 1 h at room temperature. USP7 radiolabeled with [35S]methionine was prepared by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using a rabbit reticulolysate system (Promega). The radiolabeled extracts were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads, and then equivalent amounts of the clarified supernatant were added to either mAb 11060-coupled beads alone (control) or to beads with bound ICP0-E56 or full-length ICP0. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then the beads were washed thoroughly before being boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for ICP0 and then autoradiography to detect USP7. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Assays—U2OS cells in 35-mm dishes were infected with WT HSV-1 or mutant virus M1 at a m.o.i. of 0.1 pfu/cell and harvested for FACS analysis 6 h later. The cells were washed and suspended in cell dissociation buffer (Sigma), and then total cell numbers in the sample were determined in a cell counting chamber. The cells were fixed with 5% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS containing 2% calf serum. The cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS/2% calf serum containing antibodies to detect ICP4 (58S hybridoma supernatant (31Showalter S.D. Zweig M. Hampar B. Infect. Immun. 1981; 34: 684-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1/100) or ICP0 (11,060 ascites at 1/1000). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the cells were washed twice and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, 1/100). After a further incubation for 1 h, the cells were washed twice and then resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS/2% calf serum. The samples were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur machine in comparison with mock-infected control samples prepared in parallel. Transfection and siRNA Treatment—U2OS cells were transfected with an equimolar mixture of three USP7 siRNAs (designed and synthesized by Ambion) or with control anti-GFP siRNA (Qiagen), using RNAiFect reagent (Qiagen). The siRNA sense sequences are as follows: USP7–1, 5′-GGCAACCUUUCAGUUCACUTT-3′; USP7–2, 5′-GGCUACGUCGGCUUAAAGATT-3′; USP7–3, 5′-GGCGAAGUUUUAAAUGUAUTT-3′; GFP-22, 5′-GCAAGCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAU-3′. 100 nmol total siRNA was used in each transfection. Three days after transfection, the cells were infected with WT HSV-1 at a m.o.i. of 2 pfu/cell, with mock-transfected cells used as a further control. 4 h later, the cells in replicate plates were either harvested into SDS-PAGE loading buffer or treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and harvested after a further 4 h. The levels of ICP0, ICP4, USP7, and actin in the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Enzymatic Activity of Purified USP7 on Model Substrates in Vitro—Previous reports have demonstrated that USP7 has ubiquitin-specific protease activity in vitro, both on model α-peptide-linked ubiquitin substrates and on isopeptide-linked p53 ubiquitin conjugates (32Holowaty M.N.

Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). We expressed and purified a His-tagged version of wild type USP7 (Fig. 1A) and confirmed that it can cleave a C-terminal extension from a natural ubiquitin precursor (Fig. 1B). This cleavage activity was very efficient, and by measuring the rate of cleavage of increasing amounts of substrate in the presence of limiting amounts of enzyme, we estimated a Km value of less than 5 μm for this reaction (data not shown). In contrast, USP7 displayed comparatively little isopeptidase activity on a range of model substrates in vitro. At concentrations that were sufficient to cleave all of the ubiquitin C-terminal extension substrate (Fig. 1B), USP7 did not efficiently cleave Lys48-linked tetraubiquitin (Fig. 1C) or forms of the E2 conjugating enzyme UbcH5a, autoubiquitinated with either normal or methyl ubiquitin (the latter giving only monoubiquitinated isopeptide-linked derivatives) (Fig. 1, D and E). Higher amounts of USP7 (on the order of 1 μg in similar assays instead of the 5 ng used here) have, however, been shown to cleave a similar model isopeptide-linked substrate (32Holowaty M.N. Zeghouf M. Wu H. Tellam J. Athanasopoulos V. Greenblatt J. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29987-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and therefore the protein does not lack the potential for this activity. It is possible that specific isopeptide-linked ubiquitinated substrates are preferentially cleaved by USP7. Indeed, USP7 has been shown to bind to and cleave ubiquitinated forms of both p53 and Epstein-Barr virus regulatory protein EBNA-1 (32Holowaty M.N. Zeghouf M. Wu H. Tellam J. Athanasopoulos V.

Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar); although in the case of p53, the Km value was estimated to be greater than 50 μm (33Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). As a control for the intrinsic activity of our preparations of USP7, we generated ubiquitinated p53 in reactions using ICP0 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase (14Boutell C. Everett R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36596-36602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The addition of wild type, but not C223S active site mutant, USP7 protein clearly reduced the levels of ubiquitinated p53 in this system, whether the USP7 was added during the conjugation reaction (Fig. 2, left panel) or after (Fig. 2, right panel). In the latter case, the ubiquitination reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA (see Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Deubiquitination of autoubiquitinated ICP0 by USP7 is increased by interaction between the two proteins. A, full-length ICP0 and a truncated version of ICP0 lacking the USP7 interaction domain (ICP0E56) were purified, and 20-ng aliquots were incubated with a mixture containing E1, UbcH5a, ubiquitin, and ATP (Ub mix) at 32 °C for 10 min. The ubiquitination reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm, and then purified aliquots of USP7 (2.5 or 5 ng) were added, as indicated. The reactions were stopped after a 5-min incubation, and then the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to detect ICP0. The unmodified forms of full-length ICP0 and ICP0-E56 are indicated. The lower molecular weight bands near the bottoms of the right-most 3 lanes are probably autoubiquitinated forms of ubiquitin ligase-active truncation products containing the RING finger motif. Consistent with the ICP0-E56 results, these forms are not sensitive to USP7. B, inhibition of ubiquitin conjugation by EDTA. A ubiquitination mix containing E1, UbcH5a, ubiquitin, and ATP was prepared, aliquoted, and incubated at 32 °C for 5 min. Mixtures of purified ICP0 and EDTA at the stated final concentrations were prepared, incubated for 5 min, and then mixed with the conjugation mixture aliquots. After a further 15 min at 32 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blot detection of conjugated ubiquitin (left panel). The filter was stripped and reprobed for ICP0 (right panel). The lower-most band is unmodified ICP0. C, ICP0E56 does not bind to USP7. Immune precipitations were conducted as described under “Materials and Methods.” The immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for ICP0 (upper panel) and then autoradiography to detect USP7 (lower pan"

It has been shown that LTA binds CD14 and triggers activation via Toll-like receptor 2, but whether the activation occurs at the cell surface or internalization is required to trigger signaling has yet to be demonstrated. In this work we have investigated LTA binding and internalization and found that LTA and its receptor molecules accumulate in lipid rafts and are subsequently targeted rapidly to the Golgi apparatus. This internalization seems to be lipid raft-dependent because raft-disrupting drugs inhibited LTA/Toll-like receptor 2 colocalization in the Golgi. Similarly to lipopolysaccharide, LTA activation occurs at the cell surface, and the observed trafficking is independent of signaling.

Sepsis is an inflammatory response to infection either by Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria which can lead to multiorgan failure and death (1Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar). This inflammatory response seems to be triggered by bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ConA, concanavalin A; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GM1, Il3NeuAc-GgOse4Cer; HEK, human embryonic kidney; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. from Gram-negative bacteria, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive (2Hermann C.

It is now well established that the triggering of the host response occurs at the level of innate defense, without the need for antigen presentation or the clonal expansion of cells to fight the invading pathogens. The recognition of these pathogen-associated molecular patterns is mediated through germ line-encoded receptors, called pattern recognition receptors. At first glance it seems that both LPS and LTA activate the innate immune system via similar mechanisms of action. Both LPS and LTA bind CD14 (4Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J.

On second glance though it seems that there are differences in host responses that follow cell activation. Recent studies have reported significant differences in host responses to TLR2 versus TLR4 activation (12Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V. Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Watts D.C. Qureshi N.

Specifically, LPS has been reported to induce TNF-α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, and RANTES production in human alveolar macrophages, whereas TLR2 agonists induced only macrophage inflammatory protein-1 production (17Jones B.W. Heldwein K.A. Means T.K. Saukkonen J.J. Fenton M. J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2001; 60: 6-12PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that different ligands trigger distinct cellular responses even though they share the ability to activate NF-κB. The question remains as to how these differences in host response are achieved. It is possible that different ligands trigger distinct TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Although both TLR2 and TLR4 trigger the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, via MyD88 (18Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S.

The MyD88-independent pathway seems to involve the toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (22Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) as well as TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFNs (23Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Taketa K. Kim S.O. Goode J.

The existence of individual signaling pathways for each TLR may explain the distinct biological responses elicited by the different ligands. It is now clear that the mechanism of LPS activation seems to require the formation of a receptor cluster that comprises at least CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 (25Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The possibility of the formation of even larger activation clusters has also been suggested (6Pfeiffer A. Bottcher A. Orso E. Kapinsky M. Nagy P. Bodnar A. Spreitzer I. Liebisch G. Drobnik W.

Furthermore, it has been shown recently that this activation is triggered at the cell surface in myeloid cells, and LPS is subsequently dragged to the Golgi apparatus along with CD14 and TLR4 (27Latz E.

In intestinal epithelial cells, LPS seems to trigger TLR4 activation intracellularly within the Golgi apparatus (28Hornef M.W. Frisan T. Vandewalle A. Normark S. Richter-Dahlfors A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In the case of LTA the mechanism is not as well understood. It has been shown that LTA binds CD14 (29Dziarski R. Tapping R.I.

Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TLR2 we investigated the localization of TLR2 and LTA at the cell surface, defined the subcellular localization and trafficking of LTA by employing fluorescent imaging methods. Here we show that LTA associates with TLR2 at the cell surface within lipid rafts. LTA is subsequently internalized and rapidly reaches the Golgi apparatus independently of the clathrin-interacting endocytic machinery. This transport pathway appears to be raft-specific, and receptors involved in LTA recognition, CD14 and TLR2, seem to follow it. Overall, our data suggest that TLR2 and LTA follow the considerable fluidity of lipid rafts between the plasma membrane and the Golgi complex to gain access to the cell. Our findings are in agreement with Latz et al. (27Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K. Monks B. Kurt-Jones E. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and Nichols et al. (31Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), who have demonstrated a novel rapid recycling pathway from the plasma membrane to the Golgi which is followed by LPS and lipid raft markers. It seems that LTA binding induces the recruitment of TLR2 into membrane microdomains and takes advantage of the internalization of these domains to reach and accumulate in the Golgi apparatus. Similarly to LPS, LTA trafficking is independent of signaling. Materials—LTA from Staphylococcus aureus was prepared as described previously (32Morath S. Geyer A. Spreitzer I. Hermann C. Hartung T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). LysoTraker Red DND-99, TR-Dextran, TR-ConA, and BODIPY-TR-ceramide were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. EEA1-specific as well as clathrin-specific polyclonal sera were obtained from Santa Cruz. LTA-specific antibody was purchased from Cambridge Biosciences (Cambridge, UK). Hybridoma cells secreting 26ic (anti-CD14) and W6/32 secreting MHC class I-specific mAb were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). TLR2-specific antibody, TL2.1, was purchased from HyCult (Denmark). The antibodies were conjugated to either Cy3 or Cy5 using Cy3 and Cy5 labeling kits from Amersham Biosciences. Cholera toxin was purchased from List Laboratories. The following chemicals were obtained from Sigma and used to study the LTA entry procedures: 20 μm nocodazole for depolymerization of microtubules, 25 and 50 μm) chloropromazine to inhibit the formation of clathrin-coated pits, 25 μm nystatin and 1 μg/ml filipin for the disruption of rafts. Expression Plasmids—The vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was modified to include GFP as C-terminal epitope tag in-frame with a cloning site. PCR of TLR2 was performed on pRK7-TLR2 (obtained from Dr. C. Kirschning, Technical University of Munich) to construct chimeric fluorescent cDNA. The upper and lower primers for TLR2 were 5′-GAAGCAGGATCCATGCCACATACTTTGT-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCGAGGGACTTTATCGCAGCTCTCAGA-3′. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned in-frame into pcDNA3-GFP. An expression plasmid containing huCD14 (pcDNA3-huCD14) was a kind gift from Dr. D. T. Golenbock (University of Massachusetts, Worcester). Stable Cell Lines—Stable transfections of HEK293 cells with pcDNA3, GFP-TLR2, or CD14 were performed using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Positive selection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed. Clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. Stably transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 unit/ml penicillin, 0.5 μg/ml streptomycin, 400 μg/ml G418 for HEK/pcDNA3, HEK/GFP-TLR2, HEK/CD14, HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14, and 400 μg/ml hygromycin for HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14. The Chinese hamster ovary/CD14/huTLR2 (3E10TLR2) reporter cell line was constructed by stable cotransfection of 3E10 with the cDNA for human TLR2 and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), as described previously (33Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The medium was supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 and 400 μg/ml hygromycin (3E10TLR2). Luciferase Reporter Assays for NF-κB Activation—HEK293 cells transfected with CD14 and GFP-TLR2 were seeded into 96-well plates. The following day, the cells were transiently transfected with a NF-κB luciferase reporter gene using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The next day the cells were stimulated as indicated, and after6hof stimulation the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a plate reader luminometer. TNF-α ELISA—Stably transfected HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 cells were plated on 24-well dishes (Nunc, Germany) at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml in 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. The next day cells were stimulated for the indicated time period. Supernatants were collected and analyzed for TNF-α with a commercial ELISA (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Cell Labeling for Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)— Stably transfected HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 were seeded on microchamber culture slides (Lab-tek, Invitrogen) and labeled with 100 μl of a 1:1 mixture of donor-conjugated antibody (Cy3) and acceptor-conjugated antibody (Cy5). For control experiments to determine whether FRET is dependent on donor and acceptor surface density, the donor:acceptor ratio was varied to 1:2 and 1:4. The cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.02% bovine serum albumin prior to fixation with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were fixed to prevent potential reorganization of the proteins during the course of the experiment. Fluorescent Imaging—HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 cells were grown on microchamber culture slides. Cells were stimulated with 1 and 10 μg/ml LTA, and after different times poststimulation they were exposed to fluorescent stains for organelles and subsequently fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. For LTA and receptor staining fluorescent probes were added and incubated for 60 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% saponin, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were mounted on Prolong antifadant (Molecular Probes). When specific inhibitory drugs were used, the chemicals (nocodazole, chloropromazine, nystatin, filipin) were added to the cell culture medium prior to stimulation for 30 min, and they were also present during the course of LTA stimulation. Cells were imaged on a Carl Zeiss, Inc. LSM510 META confocal microscope (with an Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope) using a 1.4 NA 63× Zeiss objective. The images were analyzed using LSM 2.5 image analysis software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC were detected using the appropriate filter sets. Using typical exposure times for image acquisition (less than 5 s), no fluorescence was observed from a Cy3-labeled specimen using the Cy5 filters, nor was Cy5 fluorescence detected using the Cy3 filter sets. In addition, cells were imaged on a CCD (charged cooled device) camera-based microscope system, consisting of a Carl Zeiss 200-inverted microscope with an Orca ER CCD camera (Improvision, UK). Openlab software was used to control the camera, whereas image analysis was carried out using Volocity software. FRET Measurements—FRET is a noninvasive imaging technique used to determine molecular proximity. FRET can occur over 1–10-nm distances and effectively increases the resolution of light microscopy to the molecular level. It involves nonradiative transfer of energy from the excited state of a donor molecule to an appropriate acceptor. The rate of energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) is defined with respect to r and R0, the characteristic Forster distance by Equation1. E=1/(1+(r/R0)6)(Eq. 1) In the present study, FRET was measured using a method described previously (34Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 35Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. Gelb M.H. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 37-49Google Scholar). FRAP Measurements—FRAP measurements were performed as described previously (36Ladha S. Mackie A. Harvey L. Clark D. Lea E. Brullemans M. Duclohier H. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1364-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Triantafilou K. Triantafilou M. Ladha S. Mackie A. Fernandez N. Dedrick R.L. Cherry R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2535-2545PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, slides containing labeled cells were placed onto a temperature-controlled microscope stage (Physitemp model TS-4) and allowed to equilibrate to the desired temperature for FRAP measurements. After equilibration, the beam of an argon ion laser (Innova 100-10) was focused onto the desired area on the cell. The laser beam was of Gaussian cross-sectional intensity distribution, with a half-width at 1/e2 height of the laser beam at its point of focus equal to 1.24-μm spot radius. FRAP measurements were recorded and analyzed as described previously (36Ladha S. Mackie A. Harvey L. Clark D. Lea E. Brullemans M. Duclohier H. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1364-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For intracellular FRAP experiments, the laser beam was focused inside the cell rather than on the cell surface. GFP-TLR2 Fusion Proteins Are Able to Respond to LTA— HEK293 cells are normally unresponsive to LPS or LTA because they lack CD14, TLR4, and TLR2 expression. In this work we transfected HEK293 cells with CD14 or CD14 and GFP-TLR2 to be able to define the subcellular localization and trafficking of TLR2 before and after stimulation by bacterial LTA. HEK293 cells transfected with CD14 and GFP-TLR2 successfully expressed TLR2 on the cell surface (Fig. 1A), similarly to human monocytes (Fig. 1B). To establish that transfection of HEK293 cells with CD14 and TLR2 rendered them able to respond to LTA, we measured TNF-α secretion in HEK293, HEK/CD14, and HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 cells following LTA stimulation. HEK293, HEK/CD14, and HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 cells as well as human monocytes were stimulated with 10 μg/ml LTA. In parallel as a control HEK293, HEK/CD14, HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14, and human monocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS. After stimulation supernatants were collected and analyzed for TNF-α using a commercial ELISA. As expected it was shown that HEK293 cells were incapable of responding to either LPS or LTA. Transfection with CD14 did not make them responsive to bacterial products, whereas transfection with CD14 and TLR2 rendered them responsive to LTA but not to LPS (Fig. 1C). Human monocytes expressing CD14, TLR4, and TLR2 (Fig. 1C) were able to respond to both LPS and LTA. From these data we conclude that transfection of HEK293 cells with both CD14 and TLR2 enables them to respond to LTA. In addition, the fluorescent tag fused on the C terminus of TLR2 does not seem to affect TLR2 function, and thus GFP-TLR2 is a functional signaling receptor for LTA. Cell Surface Interactions of LTA: FRET Imaging of Lipid Rafts—It has been shown previously that the innate recognition of LPS takes place within lipid rafts or microdomains (38Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are believed to perform diverse functions by providing a specialized microenvironment in which the relevant molecules for the specific biological processes are partitioned from the rest of the plasma membrane and are concentrated into the raft (39Horejsi V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Stockinger H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To investigate whether LTA recognition also occurs within lipid rafts FRET was utilized. We measured FRET in terms of dequenching of donor fluorescence after complete photobleaching of the acceptor fluorophore. Increased donor fluorescence after complete destruction of the acceptor indicated that the donor fluorescence was quenched in the presence of the acceptor because of energy transfer. We tested the energy transfer efficiency in our system using as a positive control the energy transfer from mAbs Cy3-W6/32 and Cy5-MCA1115 to two different epitopes on MHC class I molecules (Table I), which showed that the maximum energy transfer efficiency (E) was 34 ± 2.5.Table IEnergy transfer efficiency values between donor-acceptor pairs on HEK cells Energy transfer between different pairs was detected from the increase in donor fluorescence after acceptor photobleaching.

Dequenching was observed once the Cy5 was photobleached (E = 24 ± 1.0%), suggesting that most (∼62%) of the LTA concentrates in the lipid rafts of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Control experiments were performed with the Cy5-cholera toxin using Cy3-LTA-specific mAb without the presence of LTA. The results showed that the energy transfer efficiency was 1.2 ± 0.5%, thus verifying that there was no nonspecific interaction. In addition, control experiments were performed using the parental HEK293 cell line. It was found that barely detectable levels of LTA bound in the absence of CD14 (data not shown). We similarly examined whether CD14 and TLR2 receptor molecules localize in lipid rafts prior to LTA stimulation, by using Cy3–26ic Fab specific for CD14 and Cy3-TLR2-specific mAb, respectively, and Cy5-cholera toxin for the GM1 ganglioside. Our results showed that there was FRET observed between CD14 and GM1 ganglioside (26 ± 1.5%), thus CD14 was present in lipid rafts prior to LTA stimulation (Table I). In contrast, there was no energy transfer between TLR2 and GM1 ganglioside prior to LTA stimulation (6 ± 1%), suggesting that similar to TLR4, TLR2 does not reside in lipid rafts prior to stimulation (Fig. 2B). Upon stimulation, we observed large dequenching (28 ± 2%) between TLR2 and GM1 ganglioside, thus suggesting that TLR2 is recruited within lipid rafts following LTA stimulation (Fig. 2D). As expected upon LTA stimulation, CD14 remained within the lipid raft because large dequenching was observed after Cy5-cholera toxin photobleaching. Control experiments investigating the association of TLR2 with GM1 ganglioside after LPS stimulation were also performed. It was shown that TLR2 was not recruited in lipid rafts following LPS stimulation because the energy transfer observed between TLR2 and GM1 ganglioside after LPS stimulation was 3 ± 0.5%. Similar results were obtained when human monocytes were utilized (Table II).Table IIEnergy transfer efficiency values between donor-acceptor pairs on human monocytes Energy transfer between different pairs was detected from the increase in donor fluorescence after acceptor photobleaching.

E was found to be independent on acceptor density, to be sensitive to donor:acceptor ratio, and not to go to 0 at low surface density, thus suggesting that the FRET values observed were the result of clustered molecules and not random associations. Entry Route—To investigate the entry route of LTA into cells, we used vital stains for known vesicular compartments in cells as well as fluorescent probes for LTA (using a Cy5-specific LTA mAb) and CD14 (Cy5–26ic Fab). We determined whether LTA or its receptors CD14, TLR2 are internalized into lysosomes using a freely permeant probe with a high selectivity for acidic organelles, LysoTraker Red DND-99 (40Loike J.D. Sodeik B. Cao L. Leucono S. Weitz J.I. Detmers P.A. Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 were incubated for different time periods (5, 15, 30, and 60 min) with 1 and 10 μg/ml LTA in the presence of LysoTraker Red DND-99. Triple labeling with LysoTraker Red DND-99, LTA-specific probe, or CD14-specific probe and GFP-TLR2 was performed. Our results showed that LTA did not colocalize within lysosomes (data not shown). Furthermore, we investigated the internalization of a fluid phase marker (TRITC-dextran), LTA, and GFP-TLR2. Fluorescent dextran, a hydrophilic polysaccharide with poly(a-d-1,6-glucose) linkages, labels early and late endosomes (41Berlin R.D. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 85: 660-671Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). LTA was found to concentrate in a compartment distinct from TRITC-dextran, showing us that LTA does not localize in late endosomes. To determine whether LTA was localized in the Golgi we used two different markers to label compartments of the Golgi apparatus, Concanavalin A (ConA) and BODIPY-TR-ceramide. ConA is known to label the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the dilated cisternae of the cis-Golgi apparatus structure (42Winqvist L. Eriksson L.C"
https://openalex.org/W2089635824,"Cell culture work suggests that signaling to polymerize cortical filamentous actin (F-actin) represents a required pathway for the optimal redistribution of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane. Recent in vitro study further suggests that the actin-regulatory neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) mediates the effect of insulin on the actin filament network. Here we tested whether similar cytoskeletal mechanics are essential for insulin-regulated glucose transport in isolated rat epitrochlearis skeletal muscle. Microscopic analysis revealed that cortical F-actin is markedly diminished in muscle exposed to latrunculin B. Depolymerization of cortical F-actin with latrunculin B caused a time- and concentration-dependent decline in 2-deoxyglucose transport. The loss of cortical F-actin and glucose transport was paralleled by a decline in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, as assessed by photolabeling of cell surface GLUT4 with Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA. Although latrunculin B impaired insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt by insulin was not rendered ineffective. In contrast, the ability of insulin to elicit the cortical F-actin localization of N-WASP was abrogated. These data provide the first evidence that actin cytoskeletal mechanics are an essential feature of the glucose transport process in intact skeletal muscle. Furthermore, these findings support a distal actin-based role for N-WASP in insulin action in vivo.

Type II diabetes (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) is a major disease in the world today, afflicting over 90 million Americans. In its earliest phases, the major feature of this disease is resistance of skeletal muscle to insulin, which is of considerable importance, because it is responsible for the disposal of the majority of an exogenous glucose load (1Defronzo R.A.

The overall insulin-dependent shift in the dynamics of GLUT4 trafficking results in a net increase of GLUT4 protein levels at the cell surface, and these plasma membrane-localized transporters subsequently facilitate the influx of glucose into the cell. Activation of GLUT4 translocation by insulin requires a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signal involving the upstream insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate activators and the downstream protein kinase B (Akt) and C target enzymes (5Pessin J.E.

Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) appears to be a downstream target of TC10. Consistent with a functional role of this actin nucleation promoting factor in insulin action, a role for actin in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation has been implicated by several studies. For example, treatment with the actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D or the actin monomer binding Red Sea Sponge toxins latrunculin A or B inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (26Omata W.

Importantly, it has been shown that insulin elicits actin filament (F-actin) formation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes (24Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Thus, insulin signaling to polymerize cortical F-actin apparently represents a required pathway for optimal movement or fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicle membranes to the cell surface membrane. Nonetheless, data interpretation has to consider that adherent cultured cells possess significant numbers of actin stress fibers that may be more susceptible to these agents than cortical F-actin. Additionally, these cell systems differ from intact tissues from which they were originally derived in both their glucose transporter isoform expression and their responses to insulin (37Wilson C.M. Mitsumoto Y. Maher F. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Ruan H. Zarnowski M.J. Cushman S.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47585-47953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that cell lines may not be completely representative of in vivo insulin signaling and the glucose transport process. There is suggestive evidence in isolated rat fat cells that actin participates in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport (39Peyrollier K. Hajduch E. Gray A. Litherland G.J. Prescott A.R. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the role of actin in skeletal muscle, a tissue that is responsible for ∼80% of postprandial glucose disposal (40Ferrannini E. Smith J.D. Cobelli C. Pilo G. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and is regarded as a major peripheral site of insulin resistance in diabetes (41Defronzo R.A. Gunnarsson R. Bjorkman O. Olsson M. Wahren J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), has not been addressed. This is partially due to the difficulty in both working with skeletal muscle preparations, and in visualizing the cellular distribution of GLUT4 and the organization of cortical F-actin in a setting comprised mainly of contractile machinery. The isolated rat epitrochlearis muscle, a small flat muscle in the rat fore limb, has been extensively utilized for investigation of the regulation of glucose transport (42Henriksen E.J. Holloszy J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1991; 143: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used this preparation to address the role the actin cytoskeleton plays in the glucose transport process in skeletal muscle. We demonstrate for the first time that disruption of cortical F-actin in an intact muscle inhibits both insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. Additionally, early insulin signal propagation remained intact in epitrochlearis muscle made insulin-resistant by cortical F-actin disassembly. Consistent with a more distal signal transduction disturbance, the loss of actin membrane skeleton was associated with the inability of insulin to spatially regulate N-WASP in the isolated epitrochlearis muscle preparation. The subsequent report provides a detailed account of these studies. Animals—Specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats weighing 100–125 g were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Boston, MA). Upon arrival, rats were housed four to a cage in a temperature-controlled animal room maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. The rats were fed ad libitum National Institutes of Health standard chow and water. Muscle Preparation and Incubation—Rats in the postprandial state were anesthetized with 5 mg/100 g of body weight sodium pentobarbital. Epitrochlearis muscles were dissected out, blotted on gauze, and transferred to 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 32 mm mannitol, and 8 mm glucose. The suitability of this muscle for incubation studies has been extensively described previously (42Henriksen E.J. Holloszy J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1991; 143: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The flasks were incubated in a shaking water bath maintained at 30 °C for 1 h and were continuously gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2. Muscles were initially incubated in the presence or absence of latrunculin A or B (20 μm) for various periods of time prior to incubation under basal conditions (no additions), or stimulation with insulin (13.3 nm). The muscles were then transferred to flasks containing 2 ml of KHB with 0.1% BSA, 40 mm mannitol, 2 mm pyruvate, and the same additions as in the previous incubation, and used for measurement of glucose transport, for photolabeling of surface GLUT4, or frozen and used for Western blotting/signaling assays. The flasks were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C to wash out glucose, and the gas phase in the flasks was maintained at 95% O2/5% CO2. Following the wash step the muscles were used for measurement of glucose transport or GLUT4 photolabeling as described below. Measurement of Glucose Transport Activity—Glucose transport activity was measured using 2-deoxyglucose as described in detail previously (43Brozinick J.T. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14679-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Following the above incubations, muscles were blotted and transferred to flasks containing 1.5 ml of KHB with 1 mm 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]glucose (1.5 mCi/mmol) and 39 mm [1-14C]mannitol (8 μCi/mmol) and the same additions as in the previous incubation. The flasks were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and were continuously gassed with 95%O2/5%CO2. After the incubations, the muscles were frozen between tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until they were processed for measurement of 2-deoxyglucose transport. Frozen muscles were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 n KOH and were then neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1n HCl. The samples were mixed, and aliquots of the supernatant were counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Photoaffinity Labeling of Isolated Epitrochlearis Muscles—Isolated muscles were photolabeled as described previously (44Ryder J.W. Yang J. Galuska D. Rincon J. Bjornholm M. Krook A. Lund S. Pedersen O. Wallberg-Henriksen H. Zierath J.R. Holman G.D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscles were incubated in flasks containing 400 μm Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA for 4 min and then exposed to UV light in a Rayonet Photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Branford, CT) for 4 min. Following the labeling, the muscles were trimmed of their tendons, blotted, and frozen between tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Muscles were kept stored at –80 °C until processed. Crude total membranes were prepared from the photolabeled muscles and solubilized, and GLUT4s were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin beads (Pierce) as described previously (44Ryder J.W. Yang J. Galuska D. Rincon J. Bjornholm M. Krook A. Lund S. Pedersen O. Wallberg-Henriksen H. Zierath J.R. Holman G.D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, biotinylated GLUT4 was immunoprecipitated overnight from Thesit (Roche Applied Science)-solubilized crude membranes (equivalent amounts of protein) with 50 μl of streptavidin beads, and the beads were washed sequentially with 1% Thesit/PBS (4×), 0.1% Thesit/PBS (3×), and PBS (1×). Subsequent to immunoprecipitation, the immunocomplex was released from the streptavidin beads with Laemmli sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated with either affinitypurified GLUT4 (courtesy of Dr. Sam Cushman) or GLUT1 antiserum (courtesy of Dr. Larry Sliecker). Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody. Photolabeled GLUT4 or GLUT1 was detected via enhanced chemifluorescence and quantified by comparison to a plasma membrane standard that was run on each gel. Tissue Lysate Preparation—Isolated muscles were incubated under the experimental conditions as described above. Following incubation, the muscles were trimmed of their tendons, blotted, and frozen between tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Muscles were kept stored at –80 °C until processed. Lysates were prepared from the incubated muscles essentially as described previously (43Brozinick J.T. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14679-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen muscles were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaVO3, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (Pefabloc, Roche Applied Science) and 10 μg/ml antipain) and mixed end over end for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then spun at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and protein was determined on the supernatant via the bicinchoninic method (Pierce) using crystalline BSA as a standard. Akt Western Blotting—Wistar epitrochlearis lysate protein samples (100 μg) were prepared for SDS-PAGE by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples, along with molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Resolved samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were rinsed in water and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tween Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (TTBS), for 1 h. The membranes were then rinsed in TTBS and incubated overnight in affinity-purified anti-phospho-Akt (recognizing phospho-serine 473) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Following this step, the membranes were rinsed in TTBS and incubated in horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody for 2 h. The membranes were then rinsed in TTBS, and resolved bands were detected via enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Biosciences). PI3K Kinase Assays—For phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) assays, 1 mg of lysate protein was immunoprecipitated overnight with 4 μg of α-IRS-1 antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), and captured with protein G-agarose beads. The immunocomplexes were washed and incubated with 50 μl of the final wash buffer containing 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol, 100 mm MgCl2, 880 μm ATP, and 30 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The lipid products were resolved by TLC and quantified on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Immunofluorescent Labeling of Fixed Tissues—Following fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 2 h, tissues were washed with PBS and stored at 4 °C. A small section was excised from each tissue and incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100/0.05% Tween 20/PBS for 30 min at 25 °C. The sections were then rinsed three times in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS and blocked in 5% donkey serum/0.05% Tween 20/PBS (for caveolin-3 and dystrophin labeling) or 2% BSA/0.05% Tween 20/PBS (for actin and N-WASP labeling) for 60 min at 25 °C. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in mouse IgM anti-human F-actin (Serotech Oxford, UK), anti-N-WASP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-dystrophin (Neomarkers, Inc., Fremont, CA), or anti-caveolin 3 (BD Biosciences) antibodies diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer. Samples were then washed extensively in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. Sections were incubated for 45 min at 25 °C in 1:50 rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgM (for actin labeling), 1:50 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey antigoat IgG (for caveolin-3 labeling), 1:50 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (for dystrophin labeling), and 1:50 rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (for N-WASP labeling). All conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Following secondary antibody incubation, samples were washed extensively with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS, rinsed with ddH2O, mounted to slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and examined via confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Confocal Microscope). All images were taken in the same focal plane of the section and under identical microscopic parameters. Images shown are representative of three to five fields from each sample. Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by analysis of variance to test the effect of treatment (insulin and latrunculin) on muscle glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation, plasma membrane GLUT1 content, Akt phosphorylation, and PI3K kinase activity. When a significant F ratio was obtained, a Fisher's post-least significant difference post hoc test was employed to identify statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the means. Disruption of F-Actin Inhibits Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake—Previous studies (26Omata W. Shibata H. Li L. Takata K. Kojima I. Biochem.

J. 1995; 309: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have reported that the actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D and the actin monomer sequestering agents latrunculin A or latrunculin B can inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in primary adipocytes. Consistent with this effect on preventing GLUT4 mobilization to the cell surface, exposure of epitrochlearis muscles to increasing concentrations of latrunculin B for 2 h markedly reduced the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake (Fig. 1, solid bars). Basal glucose transport was not affected at any concentration of latrunculin B tested (Fig. 1, open bars). Muscles exposed to 20 μm latrunculin B for 0.5, 1, or 2 h displayed a time-dependent decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Fig. 2). Parallel studies performed with latrunculin A demonstrated a similar profile of impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport (data not shown). Given the clear effect of 20 μm latrunculin B for 1 h on insulin-stimulated glucose transport, subsequent analyses were performed with this treatment parameter. Before evaluating the effect of latrunculin B on cortical F-actin, we studied the molecular architecture of the epitrochlearis muscle by using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. To locate the position of the cell surface sarcolemma and the transverse tubular (t-tubule) membranes we used a specific antibody against caveolin-3, because the caveolae formed by homomultimers of this protein are located both at the sarcolemma and within the t-tubules (47Gabella G. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 65: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A (panel 1), both the sarcolemma (closed arrows) and t-tubule (open arrows) are labeled. To further clarify the observed staining pattern, we collected images of epitrochlearis muscle labeled with dystrophin, a protein that is part of a large oligomeric complex named the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) (48Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 49Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D.

Our analyses revealed, as expected, marked cell surface sarcolemma membrane dystrophin staining (Fig. 3A, panel 2). Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin staining (data not shown) and anti-F-actin immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B) demonstrated that the muscles contained polymerized actin underneath and juxtaposed to the inner face of the sarcolemma membrane (Fig. 3B, panels 1 and 2). In parallel to the reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity, latrunculin B treatment resulted in a disruption of this cortical F-actin structure (Fig. 3, panels 3 and 4).Fig. 2Time dependence of latrunculin B on 2-deoxyglucose transport in isolated rat epitrochlearis muscles.

In this study, we have identified a putative TRAF6 interaction site in Mal but not in MyD88 and we demonstrate that Mal can be co-immunoprecipitated with TRAF6. Overexpression of MalE190A, which contains a mutation within the TRAF6-binding motif, failed to induce the expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene, p65-mediated transactivation of gene expression, or activation of Jun N-terminal kinase or p42/p44 MAP kinase, which are induced with wild type Mal.

LPS-stimulated macrophages from MyD88- and Mal-deficient mice both displayed similar absence of cytokine production and delayed NF-κB activation but were normal for IRF3 activation and interferon β production. A double knock-out suggested that neither protein could compensate for the other. While a role for TRIF and TRAM in the IRF3 pathway distinguishes them from MyD88 and Mal, there is still no functional distinction between MyD88 and Mal in terms of function. Recently, two groups reported the identification and functional role TRIF association with TRAF6 via a TRAF6-binding motif (14Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TRIF was found to mediate TLR3-induced activation of NF-κB via an association with TRAF6, independent of MyD88 and IRAK (15Sato S. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Kawai T. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

This interaction region was further defined by the elucidation of the crystal structure of the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 in complex with peptides corresponding to CD40 or TRANCE-R (18Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Structural analysis identified a nominal TRAF6-binding motif consisting of Pro-X-Glu-X-X-aromatic/acidic amino acids. Furthermore, three TRAF6-binding motifs were identified in IRAK, two in IRAK-2, one in IRAK-M, and one in RIP2 (see Table I). Sequential mutation of a critical glutamic acid in one, two, or all three TRAF6-binding motifs in IRAK proportionally attenuated IL-1-induced NF-κB activation.Table IPutative TRAF6-binding motifs in human TIR domain-containing adapters Open table in a new tab In this study we have found that similar to TRIF, Mal has a putative TRAF6-binding motif. The motif is required for Mal to drive signals for NF-κB activation and the interaction between Mal and TRAF6 for downstream signaling events. This provides a distinguishing feature between Mal and MyD88 in TLR2- and TLR4-mediated responses. Cell Lines and Reagents—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, HEK293T, and HEK293 stably transfected cells expressing TLR4 and MD2, were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine and maintained in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere. LPS K235 (Sigma) was repurified as described previously (19Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), Pam3Cys was obtained from EMC microcollections (Turbingen, Germany), poly(I)·poly(C) (pI:C) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden), and anti-FLAG M2-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads were from Sigma. Plasmids—Full-length pDC304 Mal-HA, pDC304 Mal-HA N-terminal(1–74), and pDC304 Mal-HA TIR domain(74–235) have been described previously (1Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G.

MalE190A was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with pfu-Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the pDC304 Mal-HA template. Gal4-p65(1–551) plasmid encoding the full-length p65 subunit of NF-κB fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain was a kind gift from Lienhard Schmitz (German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelburg, Germany) (20Jefferies C. Bowie A. Brady G. Cooke E.L. Li X. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Gal-luciferase reporter gene pFA-Jun and pFA-Elk-1 fusion vectors for analysis of JNK and P42/p44, respectively, were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 cells (2 × 104) were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Mal vectors (0.5–2 ng) and κB-luciferase were from Stratagene. NF-κB-dependent gene expression was determined using the 5× κB-luciferase reporter construct (Stratagene). Using the PathDetect transient transfection kit (Stratagene), co-transfection of pFR-luciferase in combination with Gal4-p65, pFA-Jun, or pFA-Elk-1 fusions, respectively, were used to analyze Mal/MalE190A activation of MAP kinase and p65 transactivation. The Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase construct was used to normalize for transfection efficiency, and pRSV empty vector was used to maintain constant DNA. Cells were left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml Pam3Cys, 50 ng/ml K235 LPS, or 25 μg/ml pI:C for 4 h where indicated. Transfected cells were lysed using Passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using luciferase assay reagent (Promega) or β-galactosidase assay reagent. Luminescence readings were corrected for β-Galactosidase activity and expressed as fold increase over non-stimulated control values or percentage stimulation. Statistical Analysis—Significance was evaluated using Student's t test for unpaired data. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting have been described previously (1Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S.

Western blot analysis was performed using anti-HA antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) to detect Mal-Ha. Mal Associates with TRAF6 —Structural studies of TRAF6 in a complex with CD40 and TRANCE-R peptides suggested the structural determinant of the target protein contains a Pro-X-Glu-X-X-(aromatic/acidic residue) motif (18Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) for TRAF6 interaction. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of Mal indicated a putative TRAF6-binding domain at amino acid position 188–193 consisting of Pro-Pro-Glu-Leu-Arg-Phe similar to that described for IRAK and TRIF (Table I). Further analysis suggested that while Mal, TRIF, and TRAM all contain a putative TRAF6-binding motif, MyD88 does not, since the critical Glu residue (termed the P0 site) that has been found to confer specificity for TRAF6 interaction is changed to Ile in the corresponding MyD88 sequence (Table I). To test the hypothesis that Mal was therefore able to interact with TRAF6, co-precipitation experiments were carried out in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged TRAF6 and HA-tagged Mal. As shown in Fig. 1A (lane 1), we were able to detect complexes containing Mal- and TRAF6-tagged proteins by co-immunoprecipitation. To evaluate the functional regions involved in this association, the ability of Mal N-terminal region (amino acids 1–74) and the Mal-TIR region (amino acids 74–235) were also assayed for their ability to co-precipitate with TRAF6. As can be observed in lanes 2 and 3, while the N-terminal region of Mal is unable to associate with TRAF6, the Mal-TIR domain, which harbors the putative TRAF6-binding motif, does co-immunoprecipitate with TRAF6. We next mutated the putative TRAF6-binding motif in Mal by changing the glutamic acid at position 190 to alanine and tested the ability of the mutant to interact with TRAF6. Surprisingly, TRAF6 was found to still co-immunoprecipitate with MalE190A (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The mutated form of Mal did, however, affect the ability of TRAF6 to signal (Figs. 1B, 2, and 3). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, while TRAF6 overexpression induced NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression, MalE190A inhibited this effect in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MalE190A had no effect the activation of NF-κB by overexpressed IKK2 at the maximal dose required to inhibit TRAF6-mediated signaling. This result indicates that the critical Glu at position 190 in Mal is required for TRAF6 to induce downstream signaling events.Fig. 2Mal interaction with TRAF6 mediates NF-κB activation and NF-κB transactivation. HEK293 cells (2 × 104) were transiently co-transfected with κB-luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter plasmids in conjunction with Mal or MalE190A. Readings are normalized for each sample as expressed κB-luciferase over constitutively expressed β-galactosidase and plotted as fold stimulation. Results are ±S.D. for triplicate determinations (n = 3). B, HEK293 cells (2 × 104) were co-transfected with the components of the p65(1–551)-Gal4 system together with Mal and MalE190A plasmid.

Cells (2 × 104) were co-transfected with κB-luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter plasmids, in conjunction with a concentration range of MalE190A (0.5–2 ng, respectively, for HEK293 TLR2- and TLR3-transfected cells and 1–25 ng, respectively, for TLR4/MD2 stably transfected HEK293 cells). Cells were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml), Pam3Cys (100 ng/ml), or pI:C (25 μg/ml) where indicated for 6 h. Data represent relative stimulation of luciferase activity ± S.D. for triplicate determinations (*, p = 0.01; **, p = 0.009) (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The TRAF6-binding Motif in Mal Is Required for Mal to Signal—Wild type Mal was able to induce an 8–11-fold increase in NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression in a DNA dose-dependent manner. MalE190A, however, failed to induce any significant luciferase expression over a corresponding DNA dose range (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that the TRAF6-binding motif is required to mediate NF-κB activation by Mal. Three further signals activated by Mal were similarly impaired by mutation of the TRAF6 interaction motif. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, wild type Mal significantly drives p65-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal activation of 2.2-fold (p < 0.01) using this reporter system, although low, is consistent with the levels of activation previously reported in IL-1-mediated transactivation studies (20Jefferies C. Bowie A. Brady G. Cooke E.L. Li X. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Conversely, MalE190A failed to induce transactivation above control levels at comparable DNA concentrations to wild type Mal. Mutant Mal was also unable to activate JNK or p42/p44 MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 3C, overexpression of an optimal dose of plasmid encoding Mal (1 ng) was sufficient to drive JNK- and p42/p44-dependent luciferase expression (p = 0.02 and 0.002, respectively) at levels comparable with that which we have previously observed using these reporter assays (1Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MalE190A was unable to induce comparable luciferase expression above that of control levels at equivalent DNA concentrations. These data importantly demonstrate that Mal mediates the activation of the MAP kinases JNK and P42/P44 via its interaction with TRAF6. MalE190A Inhibits TLR-mediated Activation of NF-κB—Finally, we addressed the role of Mal/TRAF6 interaction in TLR-mediated activation of NF-κB. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the NF-κB-linked luciferase reporter plasmid, plus TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4/MD2, rendering them responsive to the respective TLR ligands Pam3Cys, pI:C, and LPS. As can be seen in Fig. 3, MalE190A was able to specifically inhibit both TLR2- and TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner. However, MalE190A was unable to inhibit TLR3-mediated activation of the κB-luciferase reporter, consistent with other studies demonstrating no role for Mal in TLR3-mediated signaling (7Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S.

Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the interaction between Mal and TRAF6 is necessary for the optimal induction of NF-κB-dependent gene expression, specifically upon TLR-2 and TLR4 stimulation. In this study we have found a novel feature in Mal that distinguishes it from MyD88. Mal has a TRAF6 interaction motif, which is required for Mal to signal. The motif is important for the functioning of Mal, since a mutant form of Mal, MalE190A, which contains a mutation of a critical amino acid within the TRAF6-binding motif failed to activate p65-mediated transactivation of gene expression, NF-κB-linked luciferase expression, and activation of JNK and p42/p44 MAP kinase. MyD88 does not contain a putative TRAF6-binding motif and links to TRAF6 via IRAK whose interaction with MyD88 is via homotypic death domain interaction (5Janssens S. Beyaert R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 474-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Importantly the mutated MalE190A also acted as a dominant negative toward TLR2- and TLR4-mediated activation of a NF-κB reporter gene. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Mal-TRAF6 interaction is required for signal transduction by TLR2 and TLR4. Based on the novel data presented here, we propose a model whereby the role of Mal is to link TLR2 and TLR4 with TRAF6, independent of MyD88 and IRAK that may induce activation of the MAP kinase pathway and transactivation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 4). Recent studies have shown that a corresponding point mutation, E252A, in the TRAF6-binding motif of TRIF abrogated TRIF/TRAF6 association (14Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), whereas our results indicated that MalE190A was still able to associate with TRAF6. There are, however, contradictions in the literature regarding the details of the TRIF/TRAF6 interaction and signaling (14Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Sato S. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Kawai T. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) found that TRIF E252A could no longer bind TRAF6, and overexpression of this mutant failed to drive NF-κB activation acting as a dominant negative in TLR3-mediated NF-κB activation (14Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). By contrast, Sato et al. (15Sato S. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Kawai T. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4304-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) demonstrated a lack of association between TRIF and TRAF6 only by the E/A mutation of all three putative TRAF6-binding motifs in TRIF, combined with the truncation of the C terminus. Furthermore, these authors reported that the E252A mutant displayed only a limited inhibition of NF-κB activation (15Sato S. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Kawai T. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4304-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and the triple E/A TRIF mutations were required to inhibit TLR3-mediated NF-κB activation to a similar degree to that demonstrated by Jiang et al. (14Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The need to truncate the C terminus to inhibit association and NF-κB activation suggested that the C-terminal of an adapter such as TRIF may affect TRAF6 association and NF-κB activation. Our observation of the continued association of MalE190A and TRAF6 suggests a similar mechanism whereby other regions of Mal effect TRAF6 association that is not required for signal transduction. Another explanation for the binding of Mal and TRAF6 in the absence of the P0 Glu is that the two flanking P–2 and P+3 amino acids of MalE190A are still able to engage TRAF6 in our experimental conditions via hydrogen bonding, as demonstrated by Ye et al. (18Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) for TRANCE-R and TRAF6. However, the absence of the critical P0 Glu interacting with TRAF6 renders TRAF6 unable to signal. While our study suggests that Mal interaction with TRAF6 is direct, there remains the possibility that Mal interaction with IRAK 2A. Dunne and L. A. O'Neill, personal communication. may also lead to indirect interaction with TRAF6 as is the case with MyD88. The ability of Mal to interact with TRAF6 may serve to recruit additional TRAF6 molecules to the signaling complex, additive to that recruited by the MyD88/IRAK complex. This would potentiate NF-κB activation, inducing a stronger pro-inflammatory response typical of LPS. However, the total lack of cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated Mal-deficient macrophages (6Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 7Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) suggests that the role of Mal is not simply to potentiate the canonical pathway in TLR4 signaling but to provide a separate and necessary signal, consistent with our results. The mutant Mal was unable to drive several signals. A notable signal was p65-mediated transactivation of gene expression. This is the first demonstration of Mal activating this process, and it is possible that one explanation for the lack of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in Mal-deficient cells, despite NF-κB activation being relatively normal, is that the signal for p65-mediated transactivation requires Mal. While the primary means of regulating NF-κB activity is its sequestering in the cytosol by IκB, the transactivation of NF-κB to control gene expression is of critical importance to regulating the pro-inflammatory response (22Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Notebaert S. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Our study implies that the interaction between Mal and TRAF6 is necessary for this transactivation. In conclusion, we demonstrate Mal as a TRAF6 interacting protein. The ability to manipulate the interaction between Mal and TRAF6 may provide drug targets to control these signaling pathways, and thus NF-κB-dependent gene expression, while not interfering with the canonical pathway of the remaining TLRs, which are all dependent on MyD88.

The mechanisms involved in the biogenesis of these vesicles and their translocation to the cell surface are poorly understood. Here, we report that an Eps15 homology (EH) domain-containing protein, EHD1, controls the normal perinuclear localization of GLUT4-containing membranes and is required for insulin-stimulated recycling of these membranes in cultured adipocytes. EHD1 is a member of a family of four closely related proteins (EHD1, EHD2, EHD3, and EHD4), which also contain a P-loop near the N terminus and a central coiled-coil domain. Analysis of cultured adipocytes stained with anti-GLUT4, anti-EHD1, and anti-EHD2 antibodies revealed that EHD1, but not EHD2, partially co-localizes with perinuclear GLUT4. Expression of a dominant-negative construct of EHD1 missing the EH domain (ΔEH-EHD1) markedly enlarged endosomes, dispersed perinuclear GLUT4-containing membranes throughout the cytoplasm, and inhibited GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membranes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated with insulin. Similarly, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of endogenous EHD1 protein also markedly dispersed perinuclear GLUT4 in cultured adipocytes. Moreover, EHD1 is shown to interact through its EH domain with the protein EHBP1, which is also required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 movements and hexose transport. In contrast, disruption of EHD2 function was without effect on GLUT4 localization or translocation to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results show that EHD1 and EHBP1, but not EHD2, are required for perinuclear localization of GLUT4 and reveal that loss of EHBP1 disrupts insulin-regulated GLUT4 recycling in cultured adipocytes.

Activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase triggers a cascade of signaling events that impact the GLUT4 recycling system, leading ultimately to the recruitment of intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles to the cell surface (1Czech M.P.

A Rab GTPase-activating protein substrate of Akt protein kinase has also recently been discovered, which may in part mediate insulin action on GLUT4 trafficking (18Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P.

However, the identities of the Rab protein or proteins involved in this mechanism are unknown, and it is likely that additional components required for GLUT4 regulation are yet to be discovered. A number of fundamental questions about the membrane trafficking pathway of recycling GLUT4-containing membranes also remain unanswered. These include the following. 1) How does GLUT4 relate to the constitutive recycling pathway that is traversed by such proteins as the transferrin receptor? 2) What is the mechanism that retards movement of GLUT4 out of the perinuclear compartment in the basal state? 3) What are the site(s) in the GLUT4 recycling pathway regulated by insulin? In attempts to address these questions, several groups have reported that the trafficking of GLUT4 appears to partially overlap with the general endocytic recycling pathway, and several endosomal proteins have been identified in GLUT4 vesicles (19Kandror K.V.

Similar to the transferrin receptor, GLUT4 is internalized from the cell surface to early endosomes via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (22Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J.

Evidence for a role of dynein during this latter step has been published recently, consistent with the hypothesis that the cytoskeleton plays a role in this process (10Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A.

In the ERC, however, GLUT4 appears to be segregated away from the other recycling proteins that constitutively recycle back to the cell surface. The sorting and segregation of GLUT4 from the ERC into a specialized sequestration compartment are strongly supported by studies employing both biochemical and morphological techniques, indicating that GLUT4 is targeted to a discrete intracellular compartment compared with other proteins such as the transferrin receptor and GLUT1 (20Hashiramoto M.

Consistent with the hypothesis that GLUT4-containing vesicles bud off from the ERC, a role for Rab11 in GLUT4 vesicle biogenesis and recycling has been proposed recently (32Zeigerer A.

There is also indirect evidence that GLUT4 recycling through the trans-Golgi network occurs (33Perera H.K. Clarke M. Morris N.J. Hong W. Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. Mol. Biol.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 557-589Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), have converged to suggest a role for these proteins in regulated membrane recycling. Thus in Caenorhabditis elegans, a protein similar to EHD1, denoted RME-1, was found localized in perinuclear recycling membranes, and its disruption caused both redistribution of the endocytic recycling compartment and impaired transferrin recycling to the cell surface (38Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, EHD1 was found to reside in a recycling membrane compartment related to exocytosis of major histocompatibility complex class I and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (39Caplan S.

Rapaport D. Rotem-Yehudar R. Tolchinsky S. Horowitz M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 557-589Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Findings in our laboratory showed that the related protein EHD2 localizes near the plasma membrane in actin-rich areas and is required for endocytosis of transferrin and the GLUT4 glucose transporter (37Guilherme A. Soriano N.P. Bose S. Holik J. Bose A. Pomerlau D.P. Furcinitti P. Leszyk J. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we therefore sought to determine whether EHD1 plays a role in GLUT4 recycling similar to its role in transferrin receptor trafficking and to compare the functions of EHD1 and EHD2 in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Here, we present evidence that EHD1 and its interacting protein EHBP1 (EH domain-binding protein-1), but not EHD2, are required for perinuclear sorting and insulin-regulated GLUT4 recycling in these cells. Loss of function of EHD1, mediated by expression of a dominant-negative construct or siRNA-based gene silencing, markedly enlarged the ERC, dispersed GLUT4 membranes, and impaired translocation and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Based on these results, we postulate that EHD1 is part of the cellular machinery necessary for normal sequestration and regulation of GLUT4-containing vesicles. Material and Chemicals—Anti-EHD1 antibody was a gift from Dr. Mia Horowitz (Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel).

DNA Constructs—The murine expressed sequence tag encoding mouse EHD1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number BC037094) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced, and full-length mEHD1 was used to generate the different constructs in this study. The plasmid expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged ΔEH-EHD1 (amino acids 1-442) was constructed by PCR amplification using primers creating XhoI and HindIII sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned in-frame with a pEYFP-C3 vector. The plasmid expressing full-length HA-EHD1 was constructed using a linker (5′-ATAAGCTTGATGTTCAGCTGGGTGAGCAAGGATGCCCGCCGCAAGAAGGAGCCGGAGCTC-3′) with HindIII and SacI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, designed to place Ehd1 cDNA in-frame with the 3XHA vector. Full-length EHD1 in pCMV-sport6.0 was digested with SacI and XbaI, and this fragment was ligated with the linker into the HA vector to yield full-length HA-EHD1. The plasmid expressing HA-ΔEH-EHD1 was constructed by excising the ΔEH-EHD1 fragment (amino acids 1-442) from the YFP-ΔEH-EHD1 vector described above and subcloned in-frame with the 3XHA vector using the linker described above.

EHD2 (amino acids 1-543), ΔEH-EHD2 (amino acids 1-444), ΔEHΔA-EHD2 (amino acids 1-428), and the EH domain (amino acids 444-543) were PCR-amplified using primers generating BamHI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. ΔEH-EHD1 (amino acids 1-442) constructs were PCR-amplified using primers generating SalI and NotI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The PCR products were subcloned in-frame with a pGEX5×3 vector. The GST-VCA-expressing plasmid was similarly constructed by amplifying the region encoding amino acids 398-501 in rat neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. All constructs were sequenced for verification prior to transfection.

Briefly, adipocytes were detached from culture dishes with 0.25% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed twice, and resuspended in PBS. Half of the cells from one 150-mm dish were mixed with siRNA and then delivered to the cells by a pulse of electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II system at a setting of 0.18 kV and 950-microfarad capacitance. Using a Cy3-tagged siRNA for lamin A/C, we showed previously that Cy3-tagged siRNA was introduced with virtually 100% efficiency into cells using this method and that nearly all cells showed loss of nuclear lamin A/C (15Jiang Z.Y.

After 72 h, cells were harvested, and equal amounts of protein from different lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. A portion of these cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence Microscopy Analysis—For immunofluorescence microscopy analysis, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected by electroporation as described (37Guilherme A. Soriano N.P.

Cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to detect F-actin. For analysis of co-localization of endogenous GLUT4 and EHD1, z-series stacks of images were deconvoluted and reconstituted using specialized software as described (37Guilherme A. Soriano N.P.

The co-localization of endogenous EHD1 with perinuclear GLUT4 (see Fig. 6A) and that of ΔEH-EHD1 with GLUT4 (see Fig. 7A) were measured using the Metamorph software package. A rectangular region of interest in a single z-plane of the deconvolved images of cells costained with anti-EHD1 and anti-GLUT4 antibodies (Figs. 6A and 7A) was drawn. An intensity threshold was set in each image, and the percentages of EHD1 and truncated EHD1 that overlapped with GLUT4 were measured in the boxed region. The percentages of GLUT4 that overlapped with EHD1 and truncated EHD1 were also similarly measured.Fig. 7Expression of ΔEH-EHD1, but not ΔEH-EHD2, disrupts perinuclear localization of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with YFP-ΔEH-EHD1 (A) or full-length EHD1 or YFP-ΔEH-EHD2 (B). After 24 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-GLUT4 antibody to visualize endogenous GLUT4. GLUT4-containing membranes were quite dispersed in cells expressing truncated EHD1 (A), but not in untransfected cells (arrows) or in cells expressing truncated EHD2 or full-length EHD1 (B). Overlay images (Merge) depict GLUT4 (red) in cells transfected with YFP constructs (green). In cells expressing YFP-ΔEH-EHD1, ring-shaped and tubular compartments containing both truncated EHD1 and GLUT4 at the cell periphery were observed. 80-90% of the GLUT4 protein in boxed regions a and b co-localized with YFP-ΔEH-EHD1.

The samples were incubated at 4 °C end-over-end, and the beads were washed five times with buffer A and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. The Arp2/3 complex was detected by immunoblotting using anti-Arp3 polyclonal antibody after resolution by SDS-PAGE. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake Assay—Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was estimated by measuring 2-deoxyglucose uptake as described (9Bose A.

Briefly, siRNA-transfected cells were reseeded on 24-well plates, cultured for 72 h, washed twice, and starved for 2 h with Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were then stimulated with insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. Glucose uptake was initiated by addition of 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose to a final assay concentration of 100 μm for 5 min at 37 °C. Assays were terminated by three washes with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer; the cells were solubilized with 0.4 ml of 1% SDS; and 3H was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific deoxyglucose uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from each determination to obtain specific uptake.

Dopamine-mediated cytotoxicity of striatal neurons occurs through two distinct pathways: autoxidation and the D1 dopamine receptor-linked signaling pathway. Here we investigated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways activated upon the acute stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors. In SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells, endogenously expressing D1 dopamine receptors, dopamine caused activation of phosphorylated (p-)ERK1/2 and of the stress-signaling kinases, p-JNK and p-p38 MAPK, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Selective stimulation of D1 receptors with the agonist SKF R-38393 caused p-ERK1/2, but not p-JNK or p-p38 MAPK activation, in a manner sensitive to the receptor-selective antagonist SCH 23390, protein kinase A inhibition (KT5720), and MEK1/2 inhibition (U0126 or PD98059). Activation of ERK by D1 dopamine receptors resulted in oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. In cells transfected with a catalytically defective mutant of MEK1, the upstream ERK-specific kinase, both dopamine- and SKF R-38393-mediated cytotoxicity was markedly attenuated, confirming the participation of the ERK signaling pathway. Cell fractionation studies showed that only a small amount of p-ERK1/2 was translocated to the nucleus, with the majority retained in the cytoplasm. From coimmunoprecipitation studies, p-ERK was found to form stable heterotrimeric complexes with the D1 dopamine receptor and β-arrestin2. In cells transfected with the dominant negative mutant of β-arrestin2, the formation of such complexes was substantially inhibited. These data provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of ERK in the cytotoxicity mediated upon activation of the D1 dopamine receptor.

Striatal neurodegeneration is found in several human disorders involving postsynaptic dopamine neuronal dysfunction, such as the l-dopa-unresponsive parkinsonism subtype of multiple system atrophy (1Ghorayeb I.

Although all of these diseases are characterized by elevated dopamine levels in the synapse, the underlying pathological mechanism(s) promoting striatal degeneration remains enigmatic. Recent studies suggest a role for the participation of both reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species in the degeneration of striatal neurons (6Imam S.Z. el-Yazal J. Newport G.D.

Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species may be produced through autoxidation of extracellular dopamine in the synapse and may be especially important in the striatal degeneration seen in the l-dopa-unresponsive parkinsonism subtype of multiple system atrophy (1Ghorayeb I.

Dopamine in the synapse causes activation of the postsynaptic D1 and D2 subtypes of the dopamine receptor. Accumulating evidence in primates indicates that blockage of D1 dopamine receptors with selective antagonists has strong neuroprotective and anti-parkinsonian effects (11Cools A.R.

In both rat striatal primary cultures (13Wersinger C. Chen J. Sidhu A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells (14Chen J.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we have shown recently that the chronic treatment of these cells with dopamine promotes increased expression of the nitric-oxide synthases, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and inducible nitric-oxide synthase, accompanied by increased nitric oxide production, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity. These effects of dopamine were only partially mimicked by the oxidant H2O2 and by direct stimulation of the D1 dopamine receptor with the selective agonist SKF R-38393. Dopamine effects were only partly blocked by the antioxidant sodium metabisulfite (SMBS) 1The abbreviations used are: SMBS, sodium metabisulfite; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK1/2; MAPK/ERK kinase 1 and 2; p-, phosphorylated; p38 MAPK, 38-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase. and by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390. However, together these compounds completely ablated the actions of dopamine (13Wersinger C. Chen J. Sidhu A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Chen J. Wersinger C. Sidhu A. J. Biol.

These data suggest that dopamine-mediated responses are mediated by at least two distinct and nonoverlapping pathways: through extracellular autoxidation of the compound and through chronic activation of the D1 dopamine receptor. The current studies were undertaken to examine further the procytotoxic signaling pathways activated by D1 dopamine receptors. We examined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the downstream mediators of signal transduction from the cell surface receptors to the nucleus. MAPKs have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic cell death. In mammals, three major groups of MAPKs have been identified: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (16Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), p38 MAPK (17Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (18Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). The ERK-linked signaling pathways are stimulated by receptor tyrosine kinases (19Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (20Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and generally lead to a mitogenic and proliferative response (21Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 MAPK are stimulated by cellular stresses, such as free radicals and inflammatory agents, leading to apoptotic cell death (22Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the activation of MAPKs was assessed by examining the expression levels and function of the phosphorylated MAPKs: p-JNK, p-p38 MAPK, and p-ERK1/2. Instead of observing an elevation of the archetypical proapoptosis MAPKs, p-JNK and p-p38 MAPK, we surprisingly found that D1 dopamine receptors selectively stimulated the ERK1/2 signaling cascade. Moreover, the activated p-ERK1/2 was primarily retained in the cytoplasm and formed a heterotrimeric complex with the D1 receptor and β-arrestin2, with only low levels seen in the nuclei, suggesting that the failure of p-ERK to be translocated into the nucleus may be linked to the subsequent cytotoxic response. Our findings underscore a novel and selective mechanism by which stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors promotes oxidative stress and cytotoxicity while providing a heuristic view in which to evaluate alternate roles of p-ERK1/2 in mediating these cellular responses. Materials—Human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Dopamine, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), SMBS, SKF R-38393, SCH 23390, and forskolin were purchased from Sigma. KT5720, U0126, SB203580, and PD98059 were from Calbiochem, and SB600125 was from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. Cell Culture, Drug Treatment, and Cell Viability—Human neuroblastoma-derived SK-N-MC cells were grown in 12-well culture plates (seeding density, 1.0 × 105/well) in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10% (v/v) Nu-serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), antibiotics, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C until 90% confluent. Cells were then serum starved overnight with serum-free RPMI medium and incubated with various drugs for 16 h or the indicated times. Control cells were treated with an equal concentration of solvent (0.2% H2O). After incubation, 0.3 ml of medium was removed to measure nitrite concentration. Cell viability in 12-well plates was evaluated by counting viable cells in a Neubauer cell using the trypan blue exclusion test, as described by the manufacturer's (Sigma) protocol, whereby viable cells exposed to trypan blue for no more than 15 min exclude the dye. Values from each treatment were expressed as a percentage of cell survival relative to control. Plasmids and Transfection—Wild type MEK1 and catalytically defective MEK1 mutant (MEK1-K97M) cDNA were kind gifts from M. Cobb, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. The MEK1-K97M cDNA construct was subcloned into vector pRSET (Invitrogen), and the wild type MEK1 cDNA construct was subcloned into vector pCMV5 (Invitrogen). β-Arrestin1 dominant negative mutant (β-arrestin1 V53D) and β-arrestin2 dominant negative mutant (β-arrestin2 V54D) cDNA constructs (gifts from M. G. Caron, Duke University, Durham, NC) were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA1AMP (Invitrogen). SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were transiently transfected (1 μg of DNA/105 cells) by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were seeded in 12 wells (105 cells seeded/well) and grown to 80% confluence on the day of transfection. DNA-LipofectAMINE 2000 was prepared as follows. Diluted DNA in Opti-MEM (without serum) was brought to a concentration of 1.6 μg/100 μl. Then diluted LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent in Opti-MEM (without serum) was brought to a concentration of 4.0 μl/100 μl, mixed gently, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. After a 5-min incubation, the diluted DNA was combined with the diluted LipofectAMINE 2000, mixed gently, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow DNA-LipofectAMINE 2000 complexes to form. 200 μl of the DNA-LipofectAMINE 2000 complex was added to each well containing cells and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum and antibiotics), mixed gently, and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 h. After the 5-h incubation, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and used 48 h after transfection. Mock transfected cells were transfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) that lacked a DNA insert. Measurement of Nitrite Concentration—The nitrite concentration was measured as described previously (13Wersinger C. Chen J. Sidhu A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Chen J. Wersinger C. Sidhu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28089-28100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.3 ml of Griess reagent (1 part of 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in H2O and 1 part of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H3PO4) and 0.3 ml of culture medium from treated cells (see above) were mixed. After a 30-min incubation at 45 °C, the absorbance was determined at 550 nm. The nitrite concentration was measured from a standard curve using NaNO2 at a range of 0–10 μm. Results were expressed as nm/1.0 × 105 cells or -fold increase of the nitrite level from drug treatment over a distilled water-treated control. Protein Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—SK-N-MC cells were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (24Kimura K. White B.H. Sidhu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14672-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein (50 μg/lane) was separated eletrophoretically using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) followed by incubation in primary antibodies. The blots were then washed and incubated with secondary antibody. Enhanced chemiluminescence was carried out using Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primary antibodies used were as follows: p-ERK1/2, p-JNK and p-p38 MAPK mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p-MEK1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The optical density of the immunoblots was quantified by NIH Image. Coimmunoprecipitation Studies—Untransfected or transfected SK-N-MC cells (1–2 × 107 cells) were solubilized with 1% sodium cholate (Sigma) as described previously (25Sidhu A. Kimura K. Uh M. White B.H. Patel S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To the soluble extracts (200–400 μl/assay tube, 1–1.5 mg/ml of protein), either of the following antisera was added (1:100): p-ERK1/2 rabbit monoclonal (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) or pan-β-arrestin rabbit polyclonal (Affinity BioReagents, Golgen, CO) or mouse anti-D1 monoclonal (26Luedtke R.R. Griffin S.A. Conroy S.S. Jin X. Pinto A. Sesack S.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 101: 170-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (CL-4B, Amersham Biosciences). Pellets were washed five times and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Blots were probed with antibodies (1:1,000) for either p-ERK1/2 mouse monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or β-arrestin2 mouse monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or D1 dopamine receptors mouse monoclonal (26Luedtke R.R. Griffin S.A. Conroy S.S. Jin X. Pinto A. Sesack S.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 101: 170-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:8,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). p-ERK1/2 was detected as two bands, about 42 and 44 kDa; β-arrestin2 had a band of about 47 kDa, and D1 is about 50 kDa, consistent with the known molecular sizes reported in the literature. Subcellular Fractionation—For the separation of nuclear and cytosolic pools of endogenous p-ERK1/2, serum-starved cells were stimulated with dopamine or SKF R-38393. Monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min to allow lysis. The cellular extract was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatants contained the cytosolic fraction. Pellets containing cell nuclei were washed with lysis buffer and pelleted again at 500 × g for 10 min. Both cytosolic and nuclear fractions were solubilized in 2 × Laemmli loading buffer, and p-ERK1/2 levels were determined by immunoblotting. The purity of nuclear and cytosolic fractions was verified by immunoblotting with antibodies to Elk-1. Analysis of Data—All statistical analyses values were accomplished using Instat Statistical Software (GraphPad, Sorrento Valley, CA). Statistical comparisons were performed with one-factor analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least squares difference test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Activation of D1 Dopamine Receptors Enhances Oxidative Stress and Cytotoxicity—We have shown previously that chronic (16 h) stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors with dopamine or D1 receptor selective agonist, SKF R-38393, causes profound cytotoxicity, as indexed by increased oxidative stress and accelerated cell death (14Chen J. Wersinger C. Sidhu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28089-28100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells, a postsynaptic striatal cell model endogenously expressing the D1 receptors (15Sidhu A. Fishman P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Sidhu A. Olde B. Humblot N. Kimura K. Gardner N. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were treated with increasing concentrations of dopamine in the presence of SCH 23390, a D1-selective antagonist, or SMBS, a potent antioxidant. In the presence of either of these two compounds, the cytotoxic effects of dopamine were reduced sharply by ∼50%, as indexed by a decrease in both nitrite production (Fig. 1A) and cell death (Fig. 1B). When SCH 23390 and SMBS were used together, the cytotoxic effects of dopamine were completely prevented, indicating that both autoxidation of dopamine and direct activation of the D1 receptors by dopamine contribute to mediation of dopamine cytotoxicity. The direct participation of D1 dopamine receptors in inducing cytotoxicity was tested by stimulating the receptor with the D1-selective agonist SKF R-38393 in the absence or presence of SMBS or SCH 23390. Treatment of SK-N-MC cells with SKF R-38393 caused an increase in both nitrite levels (Fig. 1C) and cell death (Fig. 1D). SMBS did not modulate the SKF R-38393-mediated effects, consistent with lack of oxidation of this stable compound. By contrast, SCH 23390 attenuated the effects of SKF R-38393 with regard to both nitrite production and cell death. Dopamine Enhances Phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 MAP Kinases—To gain insight into the mechanistic pathways by which dopamine mediates its toxic effects, we analyzed the early signaling cascades that are activated by examining the phosphorylation of the three major groups of MAP kinases: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK, in SK-N-MC cells treated with dopamine or H2O2. Dopamine caused a strong enhancement of p-ERK1/2 in SK-N-MC cells in a dose-dependent manner, and an increase of 116 ± 14.9% was observed at the highest concentration of dopamine (100 μm) used in these studies (Fig. 2A). By contrast, H2O2 enhancement of p-ERK1/2 was weak, and even at 100 μm, a modest increase of only 33% was seen. On the other hand, dopamine caused only a weak enhancement (33%) of p-JNK, whereas H2O2 increased p-JNK levels by 65% (Fig. 2B). Dopamine and H2O2 activated p-p38 MAPK to similar levels, and increases of 143 and 133%, respectively, were observed at concentrations of 100 μm (Fig. 2C). The time course of activation of p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-p38 MAPK by 100 μm dopamine was investigated. Maximal activation of p-ERK1/2 and p-p38 MAPK was achieved within 45 min of exposure to dopamine (Fig. 2D), with a slight decrease after 60 and 120 min of exposure. The weak activation of p-JNK by dopamine was seen only after 60 min and was sustained up to 120 min of exposure to dopamine. These data indicate that dopamine strongly enhances the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs, with weak activation of JNK. D1 Dopamine Receptor-mediated Cytotoxicity Proceeds through the p-ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway—Because the ability of dopamine to enhance phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was much higher than that of H2O2, we speculated that the increase in p-ERK1/2 levels was not the result of the oxidant properties of these compounds, but was a direct consequence of D1 dopamine receptor stimulation by dopamine. To test for this, we examined p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-p38 MAPK levels after stimulating SK-N-MC cells with the D1 receptor-selective agonist, SKF R-38393. Treatment of cells with increasing doses of SKF R-38393 selectively enhanced p-ERK1/2 levels (Fig. 3A), with no corresponding increase in either p-JNK or p-p38 MAPK levels (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the increase in p-ERK1/2 was blocked by the D1-selective antagonist SCH 23390, protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720, and by U0126, a selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 (Fig. 3A). One feature of the ERK signaling cascade is that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is exclusively regulated by MEK1/2, the upstream dual specificity kinase. This dual phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for ERK activation. We therefore also measured p-MEK1/2 levels by stimulating SK-N-MC cells with SKF R-38393 and found a dose-dependent increase in p-MEK1/2 which was blocked completely by SCH 23390 (Fig. 3C). To assess further the participation p-ERK1/2 in mediating dopamine and D1 receptor cytotoxicity, SK-N-MC cells were treated for 16 h with dopamine or SKF R-38393 (50 μm each) in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors of the various MAPKs, and nitrite levels and cell viability were measured. Cells were also treated with 50 μm H2O2 to measure separately the role of MAPKs in the oxidative pathway. 10 μm SB203580, a selective inhibitors of p38 MAPK, reduced nitrite production by both dopamine (47%) and H2O2 (62%), with a significant (p < 0.05) increase in cell viability (Fig. 4A). When cells were treated with SKF R-38393, SB203580 caused a modest decrease (21%) in nitrite production, without any significant changes in cell viability (Fig. 4A). By contrast, inhibition of p-JNK activity with its selective inhibitor SB600125 had virtually no significant effect on SKF R-38393-mediated nitrite production or cell death, while significantly reducing nitrite levels produced by dopamine and H2O2 (29 and 44%, respectively) (Fig. 4B). U0126 and PD98059, another selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 (10 μm each), blocked (41 and 48%, respectively) dopamine-mediated nitrite production, causing a significant (p < 0.05) increase in cell viability (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, both U0126 and PD98059 almost completely blocked an SKF R-38393-mediated increase in nitrite production (by 86 and 84%, respectively), while significantly (p < 0.05) restoring cell viability to near control levels (Fig. 4, C and D). By contrast, H2O2-induced nitrite production was much less affected by the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitors, with inhibition of only 15–22% with U0126 and PD98059, respectively, and without significant changes in cell viability (Fig. 4, C and D). Together, these data suggest that the cytotoxicity observed is the result of the direct stimulation of D1 receptors and is dependent on activation of p-ERK1/2, but not p-JNK, with only a modest involvement of p-p38 MAPK in these events. D1 Dopamine Receptor-mediated Cytotoxicity Involves MEK1—To confirm the involvement of MEK1 in D1 dopamine receptor-mediated oxidative stress and cytotoxicity, we transfected SK-N-MC cells with wild type MEK1 and its catalytically defective MEK1 mutant, MEK1-K97M. Compared with wild type MEK1-transfected SK-N-MC cells, MEK1-K97M-transfected cells had decreased nitrite production and cell death upon treatment with both dopamine and SKF R-38393 (Fig. 5A) (38 and 56%, respectively; p < 0.05), without affecting H2O2-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A). To ascertain whether MEK1 was involved in the direct receptor stimulation pathway of dopamine action or through production of free radicals, MEK1-K97M-transfected cells were treated with dopamine (Fig. 5B), SKF R-38393 (Fig. 5C), and H2O2 (Fig. 5D) in the absence or presence of SMBS and SCH 23390. In wild type MEK1-transfected cells, dopamine-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity were significantly (p < 0.05) and equally ablated by both SMBS and SCH 23390 (Fig. 5B). However, in MEK1-K97M-transfected cells, dopamine-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity were only blocked upon co-treatment with the antioxidant SMBS, but not by the D1 receptor-selective antagonist SCH 23390 (Fig. 5B). Meanwhile, in wild type MEK1-transfected cells, 50 μm SKF R-38393 caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in nitrite production and cytotoxicity, which were blocked by the D1 receptor-selective antagonist SCH 23390, but not by SMBS (Fig. 5C). In contrast to MEK1-transfected cells, SKF R-38393 had no significant effect on either nitrite production or cytotoxicity in MEK1-K97M-transfected SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, in both wild type MEK1- and MEK1-K97M-transfected SK-N-MC cells, H2O2-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity were only blocked by cotreatment with the antioxidant SMBS (Fig. 5D), but not by the D1 receptor-selective antagonist SCH 23390 (Fig. 5D). These results are consistent with our finding that MEK1/2 is selectively activated by D1 dopamine receptors but not through the oxidative stress pathway of dopamine autoxidation.Fig. 5MEK1/ERK pathway mediates D1 dopamine (DA) receptor-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity.A, compared with wild type MEK1-transfected SK-N-MC cells, MEK1 mutant-transfected SK-N-MC cells ablated dopamine-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity and blocked the nitrite production and cytotoxicity induced by SKF R-38393 compared with wild type MEK1, but had no effect on H2O2-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity. B, in MEK1 mutant-transfected SK-N-MC cells, dopamine-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity were blocked by cotreatment with the antioxidant SMBS, but not by the D1 receptor-selective antagonist SCH 23390. C, in MEK1 mutant-transfected SK-N-MC cells, SKF R-38393 produced no significant change in nitrite production and cytotoxicity. D, in MEK1 mutant-transfected SK-N-MC cells, H2O2-induced nitrite production and cytotoxicity were blocked by cotreatment with the antioxidant SMBS, but not by the D1 receptor-selective antagonist SCH 23390.

https://openalex.org/W2069039477,"Increasing evidence suggests that IscS, a cysteine desulfurase, provides sulfur for assembly of transient iron-sulfur clusters in IscU. IscU appears to act as a scaffold and eventually transfers the assembled clusters to target proteins. However, the iron donor for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly largely remains elusive. Here we find that Escherichia coli IscU fails to assemble iron-sulfur clusters when the accessible “free” iron in solution is limited by an iron chelator sodium citrate. Remarkably, IscA, an iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein with an iron association constant of 3.0 × 1019m–1, is able to overcome the iron limitation due to sodium citrate and deliver iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. Substitution of the invariant cysteine residues Cys-99 or Cys-101 in IscA with serine completely abolishes the iron binding activity of the protein. The IscA mutants that fail to bind iron are unable to mediate iron delivery for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU under the limited accessible “free” iron conditions. The results suggest that IscA is capable of recruiting intracellular iron and providing iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in cells in which the accessible “free” iron content is probably restricted.

The biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins requires a coordinated incorporation of iron and sulfur to form iron-sulfur clusters. Recently, a highly conserved gene cluster iscSUA-hscBA-fdx has been identified as critical for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in bacteria (1Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Whereas both IscU and IscA can assemble transient iron-sulfur clusters when iron and sulfide are provided in solution, there is little sequence similarity between the two proteins.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10469-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) further indicate that IscU and IscA are structurally very different proteins. IscU is fluxional among widely different conformational arrangements (21Bertini I. Cowan J.A. Del Bianco C. Luchinat C. Mansy S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 907-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Mansy S.S. Wu S.P. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10469-10475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). IscA, on the other hand, is remarkably stable with a compact globular domain and an apparently mobile C-terminal tail (19Bilder P. Ding H. Newcomer M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The crystal structure also indicates that IscA probably exists as a tetramer with the three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101) projected to form a “cysteine pocket” within a central channel formed by the association of IscA monomers (19Bilder P. Ding H. Newcomer M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The unique structure of IscA (19Bilder P. Ding H. Newcomer M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggests that IscA, besides being a potential alternative scaffold, may have other functions in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins. In the previous study (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we reported that purified E. coli IscA contains iron with an apparent iron association constant of 3.0 × 1019m–1. The iron center in IscA is stable and resistant to oxygen. The electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of the iron-loaded IscA revealed an electron paramagnetic resonance signal at g = 4–6, which disappears when the iron-loaded IscA is reduced with dithionite (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), indicating that the iron center in IscA is in an oxidized state. The ratio of iron to IscA monomer in the iron-loaded IscA is ∼1:2, suggesting a stoichiometry of one iron atom per two IscA monomers (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the iron-loaded IscA can provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in the presence of l-cysteine and cysteine desulfurase (IscS) in vitro (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results led us to hypothesize that IscA may be able to recruit intracellular iron and provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. Nonetheless, kinetics characterizations indicated that the iron-loaded IscA has little advantage over “free” iron in solution as iron source for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), leaving the role of IscA as a physiological iron donor for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly questionable. The concentration of the accessible “free” iron in cells is likely to be much less than what often has been used for the in vitro iron-sulfur cluster assembly, because an elevated level of the intracellular “free” iron content is highly toxic to cells due to the generation of hydroxyl free radicals via the Fenton reaction (24Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to determine whether the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU can occur under the limited accessible “free” iron conditions. In this study, we find that sodium citrate, a physiological iron chelator with an iron association constant of 1.0 × 1017m–1 (25Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), can effectively block the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU by limiting the accessible “free” iron content in solution. Remarkably, we find that IscA is able to recruit iron from citrate and deliver iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that, among the three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101) in IscA, Cys-35 is not critical for the iron binding, although the substitution of Cys-35 with serine results in a decreased iron binding affinity of the protein. In contrast, the substitution of Cys-99 or Cys-101 with serine completely abolishes the iron binding activity of IscA. The IscA mutants (C99S and C101S) that fail to bind iron are unable to mediate iron delivery for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU under the limited accessible “free” iron condition. The potential role of IscA as an iron donor for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU will be discussed. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—The site-directed mutagenesis of E. coli IscA was carried out using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and a previously constructed plasmid, pTNISCA (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Three pairs of degenerated primers were designed to replace Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101 in IscA with serine, respectively. Mutations in the iscA gene were confirmed by direct sequencing using the T7 primer (Gene Laboratory, Louisiana State University). The His-tagged IscA mutants were expressed and purified, and the His tag was subsequently removed by incubating with thrombin (0.65 unit/ml) (Pierce) overnight as described for wild type IscA (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli IscU (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and IscS (26Yang W. Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12868-12873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. The purity of all of the purified proteins was greater than 95% as judged by electrophoresis analysis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The concentration of apo-IscA was determined using an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 2.4 mm–1 cm–1 (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The concentrations of IscU and IscS were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 11.2 and 39.7 mm–1 cm–1, respectively. All of the protein concentrations in text are referred to the monomeric species. Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly in IscU—Purified IscU (40 μm) was incubated with IscS (1 μm), dithiothreitol (2 mm), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (50 μm), NaCl (200 mm), and Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0). The reaction mixture was purged with pure argon gas and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before l-cysteine (1 mm) was added to initiate the iron-sulfur cluster assembly reaction under anaerobic conditions. As indicated, sodium citrate and/or IscA was added prior to the 5 min preincubation. The iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU was monitored in a Beckman DU-640 UV-visible absorption spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller. The absorption peak at 456 nm was used to calculate the amount of the [2Fe-2S] clusters assembled in IscU using an extinction coefficient of 5.8 mm–1 cm–1 (6Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Re-purification of IscA and IscU from the Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly Solutions—A Mono Q column (0.98 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) attached to the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for re-purification of IscA and IscU from the iron-sulfur cluster assembly solutions. After incubation, the reaction solution (2 ml) was loaded onto the Mono Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) within 10 column volumes at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution profile was monitored using a UV detector at a wavelength of 280 nm. All of the buffer solutions were purged with pure argon gas before use. Each eluted fraction (0.5 ml) was immediately transferred to an anaerobic cuvette and analyzed using the Beckman DU-640 UV-visible absorption spectrometer. The eluted fractions then were subjected to the SDS electrophoresis gel analysis. Iron Binding Analysis in IscA—The iron-depleted IscA (apo-IscA) was prepared by incubating IscA with 10 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 60 min followed by passing the sample through a HiTrap desalting column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences). For the iron binding experiments, apo-IscA protein (40 μm) was incubated with Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (40 μm) in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol in open-to-air microtubes at room temperature for 15 min. The protein samples then were passed through a HiTrap desalting column equilibrated with buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The iron content in the protein samples was analyzed as described previously (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The same iron binding experiments were carried out for IscU and the IscA mutants. Sodium Citrate Blocks the Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly in IscU—When purified E. coli IscU (40 μm) was incubated with cysteine desulfurase (IscS) (1 μm), ferrous iron (50 μm), dithiothreitol (2 mm), and l-cysteine (1 mm) in buffer containing NaCl (200 mm) and Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0) anaerobically at 37 °C, an absorption peak at 456 nm that has been attributed to the iron-sulfur clusters in IscU (6Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) gradually appeared and reached the maximum in ∼30 min (Fig. 1A). As reported by others (6Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 7Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5948-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in IscU requires IscS and l-cysteine because the samples lacking any of these components failed to produce the absorption peak at 456 nm of IscU (data not shown). Using an average extinction coefficient of 5.8 mm–1 cm–1 at 456 nm for the [2Fe-2S] clusters assembled in IscU (6Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we estimated that up to 22 μm [2Fe-2S] clusters were assembled in IscU after a 30-min incubation, indicating that ∼ 90% of ferrous iron (50 μm) in the solution was incorporated into the iron-sulfur clusters in IscU. This finding would suggest that, as the iron-sulfur cluster assembly proceeds, the concentration of iron will become very low in the incubation solution. To test this idea, we analyzed the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU under the same experiment conditions with the exception that various “free” iron concentrations were used in the incubation solution. Fig. 1B shows that the yield of the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU had a nearly linear relation to the iron concentration in the incubation solution up to 50 μm and was apparently saturated at the concentrations above 50 μm. A maximum amount of ∼27 μm [2Fe-2S] clusters were assembled in 40 μm monomeric IscU in the incubation solution. This is in good agreement with the notion that, on average, one [2Fe-2S] cluster was assembled per IscU dimer (6Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because an elevated level of the accessible “free” iron will promote the production of hydroxyl free radicals via the Fenton reaction (24Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), it is most likely that the intracellular “free” iron concentration will be much lower than what often has been used for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in vitro. To determine whether the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU can occur under the limited accessible “free” iron conditions, we included sodium citrate, a physiological iron chelator (25Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in the incubation solution before l-cysteine was added to initiate the iron-sulfur cluster assembly reaction. As shown in Fig. 1C, sodium citrate (5 mm) effectively blocked the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in which ferrous iron (50 μm) was used as iron source. Titration of sodium citrate revealed that the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU was gradually diminished as the concentration of sodium citrate was increased (Fig. 1D). The inhibitory effect of sodium citrate on the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU was completely removed when additional ferrous iron (1 mm) was added to the incubation solution (data not shown), suggesting that sodium citrate blocks the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU by limiting the accessible “free” iron content in solution. Because the iron association constant of citrate is ∼1.0 × 1017m–1 (25Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), at equilibrium the accessible “free” iron concentration in the solution containing 5 mm sodium citrate and 50 μm iron will be ∼1.0 × 10–19m. These results suggest that IscU fails to assemble iron-sulfur clusters when the accessible “free” iron concentration is decreased to ∼1.0 × 10–19m. IscA Restores the IscS-mediated Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly in IscU under the Limited Accessible “Free” Iron Conditions—We previously reported that E. coli IscA binds iron with an iron association constant of 3.0 × 1019m–1 (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because the iron association constant of citrate is ∼1.0 × 1017m–1 (25Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), at equilibrium IscA should be able to compete for iron from citrate. To test this idea, apo-IscA (40 μm) or apo-IscU (40 μm) was incubated with ferrous iron (40 μm) in the presence of sodium citrate (5 mm) and dithiothreitol (2 mm) at room temperature for 15 min. The protein samples were then re-purified by passing through a HiTrap desalting column. As shown in Fig. 2A, no absorption peaks indicating iron binding in IscU were observed after IscU was incubated with ferrous iron. On the other hand, re-purified IscA showed an absorption peak at 315 nm of the mononuclear iron binding in proteins (Fig. 2B) (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Bennett D.E. Johnson M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) after incubation with ferrous iron. The absorbance ratio at 315 nm to 260 nm of the iron-reconstituted IscA was ∼1.05, suggesting that IscA was fully loaded with iron (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, IscA, unlike IscU, is able to recruit iron from citrate. In the previous study, we also showed that the iron-loaded IscA can provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in the presence of l-cysteine and IscS in vitro (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that IscA may recruit iron from citrate and deliver iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU under the limited accessible “free” iron conditions. To test this idea, we included IscA (40 μm) in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly solution containing sodium citrate (5 mm) before the reaction was initiated with l-cysteine and found that the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU was largely restored by IscA (Fig. 3B). The amount of the iron-sulfur clusters assembled in IscU was further increased when more IscA (80 μm) was used (Fig. 3C). The kinetics of the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in the presence of citrate/IscA are summarized in Fig. 3D. Whereas sodium citrate effectively blocks the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU, IscA restores both the yield and rate of the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. Collectively, the results suggest that IscA is able to overcome the iron limitation due to citrate and deliver iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. To further examine whether the iron center in IscA is transferred to the iron-sulfur clusters in IscU, we incubated the iron-loaded IscA with IscU, IscS, and dithiothreitol with or without l-cysteine anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the reaction solution was loaded onto a Mono Q column to re-purify IscA and IscU as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4A shows the elution profile of IscA and IscU from the reaction solution after incubation without l-cysteine. The SDS electrophoresis gel analysis of the eluted fractions indicated that IscA was mainly eluted in fraction 8 and IscU was eluted in fraction 10. Each eluted fraction was immediately transferred to an anaerobic cuvette for the UV-visible absorption measurements. As shown in the figure, the iron center in re-purified IscA (fraction 8) remained intact with an absorption peak at 315 nm (Fig. 4B) and IscU (fraction 10) did not have any significant absorption peaks indicating the binding of iron or iron-sulfur clusters in the protein (Fig. 4C). When l-cysteine was included in the assembly solution (Fig. 4D), the iron center in IscA (fraction 8) was largely removed (Fig. 4E) and IscU (fraction 10) had a typical absorption peak at 456 nm of the iron-sulfur clusters (Fig. 4F). From the amplitude of the absorption peak at 456 nm, we estimated that ∼23 μm [2Fe-2S] clusters were assembled in IscU in fraction 10. Although the total amount of the [2Fe-2S] clusters assembled in IscU could not be accurately obtained because IscU was also eluted in fractions 9 and 11 (Fig. 4D), the results clearly show that the iron center in IscA is transferred to the iron-sulfur clusters in IscU when l-cysteine and IscS are also present in the incubation solution. IscA Mutants That Fail to Bind Iron Are Unable to Deliver Iron for the IscS-mediated Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly in IscU under the Limited Accessible “Free” Iron Conditions—E. coli IscA contains three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101) that are projected to form a cysteine pocket in the IscA tetramer (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To examine whether Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101 are involved in iron binding, we carried out the site-directed mutagenesis by substituting the three cysteine residues individually with serine to generate mutants C35S, C99S, and C101S. Purified proteins then were incubated with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron in the presence of dithiothreitol at room temperature for 15 min followed by passing through a HiTrap desalting column to remove dithiothreitol and residual ferrous iron. Fig. 5 shows that, after incubation with ferrous iron, wild type IscA had an absorption peak at 315 nm with a ratio at 315 nm to 260 nm of 1.05, indicating that IscA was fully loaded with iron (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For mutant C35S, the absorption peak at 315 nm was also observed after incubation with ferrous iron but the ratio at 315 nm to 260 nm was only ∼0.69, suggesting that mutant C35S binds iron at a reduced binding affinity. On the other hand, no absorption peak at 315 nm was observed in mutants C99S and C101S after incubation with ferrous iron. Thus, the substitution of Cys-99 or Cys-101 with serine abolishes the iron binding activity of IscA. In the parallel experiments, the three IscA mutants were analyzed for their ability to deliver iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. As shown in Fig. 6, mutants C99S and C101S completely failed to mediate iron delivery for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU, whereas mutant C35S showed a decreased activity. The results indicate that the IscA mutants that fail to bind iron are unable to deliver iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU under the limited accessible “free” iron conditions. In this study, we find that E. coli IscU, a proposed scaffold for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (6Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 7Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Considering abundant iron chelators including citrate in cells, it is most likely that the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in IscU will require the assistance of specific iron donors in vivo. Our results show that E. coli IscA, a key member of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery (1Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem.

The results suggest that IscA may be responsible for recruiting intracellular iron and providing iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in vivo. IscA has previously been characterized as an alternative scaffold for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (12Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Hemann C. Hille R. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), because purified E. coli IscA or its homologs can host iron-sulfur clusters when iron and sulfide are provided in solution. It is tempting to suggest that iron binding in IscA is an intermediate state during assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in IscA. However, considering that iron binding in the proposed scaffold IscU is fairly weak (6Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28Nuth M. Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8774-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), it is remarkable that IscA binds iron with an iron association constant of 3.0 × 1019m–1 (23Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which is close to that reported for human transferrin (4.7 × 1020m–1) (29Aisen P. Leibman A. Zweier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1930-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such an iron association constant would allow IscA to recruit the intracellular “free” iron and make it accessible for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in cells. Although it is possible that IscA may act as an alternative scaffold (12Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22604-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K.

Hemann C. Hille R. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we would like to suggest that the primary function of IscA is to recruit intracellular “free” iron and deliver iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. The mechanism by which iron is transferred from IscA to IscU may only be speculated at present. One possibility is that iron transfer from IscA to IscU may be accomplished via protein-protein interactions. An example of such has been documented for sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU in which specific cysteine residues from both proteins are involved (9Smith A.D. Agar J.N. Johnson K.A. Frazzon J.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5948-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, direct iron transfer from IscA to IscU may be unlikely, because the iron-loaded IscA remains intact after incubation with IscU at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence of l-cysteine (Fig. 4B). Alternatively, IscA may assemble iron-sulfur clusters and subsequently transfer the assembled clusters to IscU, since it has been reported that IscA and its homologs can transfer the assembled iron-sulfur clusters to apoferredoxin (12Ollagnier-de-Choudens S.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5784-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and apoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (14Wollenberg M. Berndt C. Bill E. Schwenn J.D. Seidler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the kinetics of the iron-sulfur cluster transfer from IscA to apoferredoxin (13Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14069-14080Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) or to apoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (14Wollenberg M. Berndt C. Bill E. Schwenn J.D. Seidler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was very slow (requiring 1–2 h of incubation). Under the similar experimental conditions as described previously (13Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14069-14080Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we incubated the IscA iron-sulfur clusters with apo-IscU at 37 °C for 60 min and found no iron-sulfur cluster formation in IscU, suggesting that the iron-sulfur cluster transfer from IscA to IscU may be kinetically restricted. Because the IscA-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU is almost complete after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3D), we suppose that the iron-sulfur cluster transfer from IscA to IscU is not very likely under the experimental conditions. Our current working model is that l-cysteine or sulfide/sulfur released from l-cysteine by IscS may directly facilitate or promote iron transfer from IscA to IscU. This model is based on the observation that, when l-cysteine is added to the iron-sulfur cluster assembly solution, the iron in IscA is released and the iron-sulfur clusters are assembled in IscU (Fig. 4, E and F). Evidently, additional experiments are needed to test this model. If proven to be the case, l-cysteine would have two distinct functions for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly: 1) to facilitate iron transfer from IscA to IscU and 2) to provide sulfur for the iron-sulfur clusters in IscU. It is plausible that regulation of intracellular l-cysteine content may constitute another control mechanism of the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in cells. IscA is highly conserved from bacteria to humans. All of the IscA homologs contain three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101, E. coli numbering), which have been shown to be important for the in vivo IscA activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (30Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Kaut A. Lange H. Diekert K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15955-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An in vitro study indicated that two of the three invariant cysteine residues (equivalents of the E. coli Cys-99 and Cys-101) in the Isa1 from cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 are required for hosting iron-sulfur clusters (14Wollenberg M. Berndt C. Bill E. Schwenn J.D. Seidler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Another in vitro study using the Isa1 from S. pombe suggested that the mutants with each cysteine replaced individually with alanine are able to host iron-sulfur clusters and transfer iron-sulfur clusters to target proteins (17Wu G. Mansy S.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Wu S.P. Cowan J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5784-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the in vitro results could be complicated by the sometimes nonspecific formation of iron-sulfur clusters by proteins containing free thiol groups (20Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). From the x-ray crystal structure of E. coli IscA (19Bilder P. Ding H. Newcomer M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the three invariants, Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101, are projected to form a cysteine pocket within a central channel formed by the association of IscA monomers. The C-terminal nine residues (amino acids 99–107) including Cys-99 and Cys-101 are not visible in the reported electron density maps (19Bilder P. Ding H. Newcomer M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), probably because the cysteine pocket is a flexible structure. Here, we find that, among the three invariant cysteine residues in E. coli IscA, Cys-35 is not critical for the iron binding because substitution of Cys-35 with serine only decreases the iron binding affinity of the protein. In contrast, Cys-99 and Cys-101 in IscA are required for the iron binding activity (Fig. 5) and for delivering iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU under the limited accessible “free” iron conditions (Fig. 6). This result is consistent with the genetic studies of Isa1 in S. cerevisiae in which the substitution of either of the two cysteine residues (equivalents of the E. coli Cys-99 and Cys-101) with serine completely inactivates the function of Isa1 (31Kaut A. Lange H. Diekert K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15955-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It seems that the flexible C-terminal region (including Cys-99 and Cys-101) in IscA plays an essential role in recruiting iron and delivering iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. Recently, it was reported that human frataxin, an iron-binding protein found in mitochondria (32Cavadini P. O'Neill H.A. Benada O. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 217-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can also provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in ISU, a human homolog of IscU (33Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This suggestion is consistent with the observations that the frataxin homolog physically interacts with the IscU homolog in S. cerevisiae (34Gerber J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 35Ramazzotti A. Vanmansart V. Foury F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the frataxin homolog is not essential for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins in S. cerevisiae (36Duby G. Foury F. Ramazzotti A. Herrmann J. Lutz T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and in E. coli (37Li D.S. Ohshima K. Jiralerspong S. Bojanowski M.W. Pandolfo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional proteins may be involved in providing iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in cells. In contrast, depletion of the IscA homologs (Isa1 or Isa2) leads to the accumulation of iron in mitochondria and deficiency of cellular iron-sulfur proteins in S. cerevisiae (30Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Kaut A. Lange H. Diekert K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In E. coli, inactivation of the iscA gene also decreases the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins (2Takahashi Y. Nakamura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), although deletion of the iscA gene is not lethal (3Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It could be that other IscA paralogs (SufA and a function unknown protein, YadR) may provide specific activities of IscA in cells. SufA has 47% identity and 71% similarity with IscA and is a member of the gene cluster sufABCDSE that has been assigned as a redundant activity for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters (39Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 40Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). It may be envisioned that IscA and its paralogs as a group are at least in part responsible for recruiting intracellular “free” iron and delivering iron for the IscS-mediated iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU."
https://openalex.org/W2150020603,"Crk-associated substrate (p130CAS or CAS) is a major integrin-associated Src substrate that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at multiple YXXP motifs in its substrate domain (SD) to create docking sites for SH2-containing signaling effectors. Notably, recruitment of Crk adaptor proteins to the CAS SD sites is implicated in promoting cell migration. However, it is unclear which or how many of the 15 CAS SD YXXP tyrosines are critically involved. To gain a better understanding of CAS SD function, we assessed the signaling capacity of individual YXXP motifs. Using site-directed mutagenesis combined with tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, we determined that the ten tyrosines in YXXP motifs 6–15 are the major sites of CAS SD phosphorylation by Src. Phosphopeptide binding assays showed that all of these sites are capable of binding the Crk SH2 domain. To evaluate the requirement for CAS YXXP sites in stimulating cell migration, a series of phenylalanine substitution variants were expressed in CAS –/– mouse embryo fibroblasts. CAS expression enhanced the rate of cell migration into a monolayer wound in a manner dependent on the major sites of Src phosphorylation. Effective wound healing was achieved by CAS variants containing as few as four of the major sites, indicating sufficiency of partial SD signaling function in this cell migration response.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) has emerged as a key tyrosine kinase substrate in cell migration signaling. CAS consists of multiple protein-protein interaction domains including an N-terminal SH3 domain, an interior substrate domain (SD) and a Src-binding domain (SBD) near the C terminus. The CAS SD is characterized by fifteen Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Pro (YXXP) motifs, and evidence suggests that the YXXP tyrosines represent the major sites of CAS phosphorylation. For example, SD deletion results in a loss of CAS tyrosine phosphorylation (4Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell.

Nine of the 15 CAS SD YXXP sites contain an aspartic acid residue in the Y + 1 position (YDXP sites), predicted to further enhance Crk SH2 affinity (8Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) that is positioned to phosphorylate the SD through either direct binding of the Src SH3 domain to the CAS SBD or an indirect mechanism involving focal adhesion kinase interactions with the CAS SH3 and Src SH2 domains (4Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Fonseca P.M. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Ryzhova L. Wu J. Hanks S.K. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Considerable evidence supports a role for CAS SD tyrosine phosphorylation in promoting cell migration. Thus, the CAS interaction with focal adhesion kinase is critical for the ability of focal adhesion kinase to stimulate cell migration (13Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 14Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CAS overexpression in COS-7 cells promotes cell migration dependent on an intact SD (15Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Moreover, CAS –/– mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit cell spreading and migration defects that can be rescued by WT CAS but not by CAS SD deletion mutants (16Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recruitment of members of the Crk family to the CAS SD sites of tyrosine phosphorylation may be the primary function of CAS in integrin signaling affecting cell motility. Crk family proteins (reviewed in Ref. 17Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) are small SH2/SH3 adaptors that function in tyrosine kinase signaling events via SH2-mediated binding to phosphotyrosine sites while recruiting downstream effectors bound to an SH3 domain. The N-terminal Crk SH3 domain interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors including DOCK180. DOCK180 activates the small GTPase Rac1, which in turn can promote actin nucleating activity of the Arp 2/3 complex leading to plasma membrane protrusion and extension of lamellipodia (reviewed in Ref. 18Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The ability of CAS to interact with Crk and promote Rac1 activity through DOCK180 has been linked to enhanced cell migration (15Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 16Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to Crk, SH2/SH3 adaptors of the Nck family show strong SH2 binding preference for phosphorylated YDXP sites (8Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar), have been shown to interact with CAS (19Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and can promote Arp2/3 complex activation (20Rohatgi R. Nollau P. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. Mayer B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26448-26452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, by directing localized binding of Crk (and possibly Nck) proteins, CAS SD tyrosine phosphorylation may serve as a switch for activating and/or sustaining the protrusion step of cell motility. Supporting this, antibodies specific for phosphorylated CAS YXXP tyrosines prominently stain the leading edges of extending lamellipodia (12Fonseca P.M. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Ryzhova L. Wu J. Hanks S.K. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Questions remain regarding the signaling functions of CAS SD YXXP motifs and their role in cell migration. Previous studies employed large deletion mutants that remove all or substantial portions of the CAS SD and thus provided no insight into which or how many CAS SD tyrosines are critically involved. The large SD deletions also cannot distinguish between phosphorylation-mediated functions versus other possible motility-related functions of the SD, such as its ability to interact with members of the zyxin family (23Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9580-9589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and could impair proper protein folding and function of other CAS domains. Thus, to better understand the function of the CAS SD in cell migration, it is important to determine which CAS SD tyrosines are subject to phosphorylation by Src and to assess their roles in cell motility through analysis of mutants in which the phosphoacceptor tyrosines are changed to nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine residues. In the present study we used the strategy of site-directed mutagenesis combined with tryptic phosphopeptide mapping to identify CAS sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and found that the 10 most C-terminal SD YXXP tyrosines, including all of the YDXP sites, serve as the major sites of phosphorylation by Src. We further evaluated the involvement of the CAS YXXP tyrosines in promoting cell migration and found that a substantial number of the major Src sites are dispensable for this response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Construction—Using sequential PCR steps (24Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. 3rd Ed. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 8-21-8-22Google Scholar) with high fidelity amplification (Advantage-HF2; Clontech/BD Biosciences), point mutations were made in full-length mouse CAS cDNA (25Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to convert individual codons for YXXP tyrosines to encode phenylalanines (FXXP mutations). To obtain specific products, 27–29 nucleotide primers were designed, and the annealing temperature was 59 °C. To generate variants with multiple FXXP mutations, sequential PCR was repeated using cDNA templates with existing FXXP mutations. Mutated cDNAs were then substituted for WT CAS cDNA in pRc/CMV-CASmyc (26Ruest P.J. Shin N.Y. Polte T.R. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7641-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to generate a set of plasmids expressing Myc-tagged CAS variants with single and multiple phenylalanine substitutions. Mutated cDNAs were also subcloned into retroviral vector pLZRS-MS-IRES-GFP (27Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Al Reynolds, Vanderbilt University) for expression of untagged CAS variants in conjunction with GFP expressed from a bicistronic transcript. All cDNAs with FXXP mutations were sequenced in their entirety to verify final plasmid constructs.Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody 9E10 against c-Myc epitope was a gift from Kathy Gould (Vanderbilt University). Monoclonal antibody against CAS (clone 24, here designated “CAS-TL”) was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. The pCAS phosphospecific polyclonal antibodies (12Fonseca P.M. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Ryzhova L. Wu J. Hanks S.K. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Anti-GST monoclonal antibody (clone GST-2) ascites fluid was from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory, Inc.Cells, Cell Culture, and Expression of CAS Variants—COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine serum. CAS –/– MEFs were kindly provided by Hisamaru Hirai (University of Tokyo) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The retroviral packaging cell line Phoenix ECO, provided by Gary Nolan (Stanford), was maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Plasmids expressing CAS variants were transfected into COS-7 (pRc/CMV plasmids) or Phoenix ECO (pLZRS-MS-IRES-GFP plasmids) cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). COS-7 cells were lysed 2 days after transfection for recovery of transiently expressed proteins. For Phoenix ECO cells, viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection and used to infect CAS –/– MEFs for stable expression of the CAS variants, essentially as described (27Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Three successive rounds of infection were done to increase expression. Cells expressing CAS were then selected by two rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting for GFP. Gates were set to collect GFP-positive cells from a window between 70 and 85% of maximal expression. After expansion, CAS expression in the sorted cell populations was roughly equivalent to levels of endogenous CAS in CAS +/+ MEFs (12Fonseca P.M. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Ryzhova L. Wu J. Hanks S.K. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).In Vitro Phosphorylation of CAS Variants and Phosphopeptide Mapping—Myc-tagged CAS variants were immunoprecipitated from radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lysates using 9E10 antibody and phosphorylated by the addition of recombinant Src in a kinase reaction buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP, as described previously (26Ruest P.J. Shin N.Y. Polte T.R. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7641-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated CAS was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. The labeled region of the membrane was then excised, incubated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington), and cleaved peptides were subjected to two-dimensional mapping on thin layer cellulose plates (28Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) using 40-min electrophoretic separation in pH 1.9 buffer and overnight chromatographic separation in phospho-chromatography buffer.Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and SH2 Binding Assays— The cells were treated with 500 μm sodium orthovanadate for 3 h to increase CAS phosphotyrosine content and then lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). For immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates, 15 mg of total protein/sample was used. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of total protein/ml of lysis buffer was incubated with 1 μg/ml CAS-TL antibody, and protein was recovered on protein G-agarose (Upstate). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot and Far Western analyses. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20. For immunoblot analysis, primary antibodies were used at 0.25–1.0 μg/ml with detection by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and development using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For Far Western (blot overlay) analysis (29Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), the membranes were incubated with a GST-Crk-II SH2 fusion protein (0.1 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature, and binding was detected by a secondary incubation with anti-GST antibody (1:5,000 dilution of ascites) and ECL. For the peptide microarray assays of SH2 binding, cellulose membranes containing 17-mer spot-synthesized peptides (30Kramer A. Reineke U. Dong L. Hoffmann B. Hoffmuller U. Winkler D. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were incubated with GST-SH2 fusion proteins (0.1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-GST antibody as above for detection. GST-SH2 fusion proteins were prepared (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar) using pGEX plasmids harboring SH2 domains of chicken Crk and Src and human Nck (32Nollau P. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During this time period, while cells were observed to maintain healthy morphology, differential interference contrast images were collected with a Nikon inverted microscope using a 10×, 0.3 NA objective lens and a side-mounted Coolsnap HQ camera. Automated collection of images using Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging) allowed collection of 12 fields of view at 10-min intervals. For each cell population analyzed (expressing either a CAS variant or vector-only control), the nuclear centers of at least 50 individual cells were plotted over a 6-h period beginning at the start of the second hour. Combined data from three independent experiments were plotted as “box and whisker” profiles showing the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of cell migration distances. Analysis of variance indicated statistically significant differences in migration among the populations. Subsequent pairwise comparisons of mutants to either WT CAS or CAS F6–15 in post-hoc analysis by the Dunnett's t test revealed migration differences significant at the 0.05 level of probability.RESULTSIdentification of CAS Phosphorylation Sites—To determine the capacity of individual CAS YXXP tyrosines to undergo phosphorylation by Src, site-directed mutagenesis combined with two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping was employed. For mouse CAS, used in this analysis, the 15 SD YXXP tyrosines are contained in 12 predicted tryptic peptides (Fig. 1). The 15 YXXP tyrosines were individually substituted with phenylalanine, with the resulting variants designated F1–F15. In addition, two variants with either double (F12/F13) or triple (F3/F4/F5) phenylalanine substitutions were made to aid in the identification of tryptic phosphopeptides containing more than one YXXP site. Along with WT CAS, the variants were individually expressed as Myc epitope-tagged proteins in COS-7 cells, recovered by immunoprecipitation, and phosphorylated in vitro by incubating in the presence of Src and a kinase reaction buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP.Maps of WT CAS, and CAS variants F1, F2, and F3/F4/F5 are shown in Fig. 2, A–D, respectively. Whereas the relative spot intensities vary somewhat, these maps all showed an essentially identical pattern of major phosphopeptide spots designated a–p (notation diagram in Fig. 2E). Because phenylalanine substitutions for any of the first five YXXP tyrosines did not result in loss of a consistently observed phosphopeptide spot, we conclude that none of these tyrosines are among the major sites of phosphorylation by Src. However, they could represent minor sites.Fig. 2Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of WT CAS and CAS FXXP variants F1, F2, and F3/F4/F5 phosphorylated by Src in vitro. A, WT CAS.

E, notation diagram indicating designations of the major phosphopeptides spots (a–p) observed in these maps.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to the first five sites, maps of CAS variants F6–F15 indicated that each of the remaining 10 YXXP sites are subject to efficient phosphorylation by Src (Fig. 3). The F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F14, and F15 substitutions each resulted in a clear loss of one of the major phosphopeptide spots (l, e, p, o, f, k, g, and n, respectively), indicating that these phosphopeptides carry the respective YXXP tyrosines. These assignments are well supported by peptide mobility predictions (not shown). The closely migrating doublet of spots h and i is also missing from the F9 map, suggesting that one of these may also derive from the phosphopeptide containing the ninth YXXP tyrosine. In addition to phosphopeptide n, the F15 map is also missing phosphopeptide o, which was assigned to YXXP site 9. Thus, phosphorylation of site 9 could be dependent on prior phosphorylation of site 15. However, our analysis shows no other indication of such dependence.Fig. 3Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of other CAS FXXP variants phosphorylated by Src in vitro. A, CAS F6 (Y238F).

K, CAS F15 (Y414F). The arrowheads point to positions of phosphopeptide spots that are either missing (–) or shifted () as a result of the phenylalanine substitutions. The arrows in D and K indicate additional missing spots resulting from the F9 and F15 substitutions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)YXXP tyrosines 12 and 13 reside on the same tryptic peptide, which could be singly phosphorylated at either site or doubly phosphorylated. The F12 and F13 individual substitutions generated similar maps characterized by chromatographic mobility shifts of phosphopeptides d and m (Fig. 3, G and H). Such shifts, because of the more hydrophobic character of phenylalanine in comparison with tyrosine, would be expected for a singly phosphorylated peptide containing two potentially phosphorylatable tyrosines. Thus, phosphopeptides d and m appear to represent two alternatively cleaved peptides containing YXXP tyrosines 12 and 13 where either, but not both, is phosphorylated. This was confirmed by the F12/F13 double substitution that eliminated both phosphopeptides d and m (Fig. 3I). Peptides representing the doubly phosphorylated forms of d and m are not readily evident, indicating either that simultaneous phosphorylation of both sites is a low stoichiometric event or that the doubly phosphorylated peptides are poorly resolved in the maps.To further evaluate CAS SD phosphorylation, additional CAS variants were constructed in which either all (F1–15) or substantial subsets (F1–9 and F10–15) of the YXXP tyrosines were changed to phenylalanines. Maps of these variants (Fig. 4) show the expected pattern of remaining spots and thus support the conclusions drawn from the individual site mutants. Phosphopeptide spot j is apparent even in the F1–15 map and thus must represent a non-YXXP tyrosine subject to phosphorylation by Src. Notably, all nine of the YDXP sites with potential for higher affinity binding to Crk or Nck proteins were identified as being efficiently phosphorylated by Src and thus likely to function in CAS SD signaling in vivo.Fig. 4Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of CAS variants lacking substantial subsets of YXXP tyrosines phosphorylated by Src in vitro.

B, CAS F10–15 in which the last six SD YXXP tyrosines (310, 331, 366, 376, 391, and 414) are all changed to phenylalanines.

The remaining major phosphopeptide spots are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Crk-, Nck-, and Src-SH2 Binding—To assess the capacity of the individual CAS SD YXXP tyrosines to interact with likely SH2-containing effector proteins, peptide microarray binding assays were performed. Membranes containing 17-residue synthetic phosphopeptides representing each of the 15 YXXP motifs and two putative Src-SH2-binding sites in the SBD (Fig. 5A), as well as control nonphosphorylated peptides, were briefly incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of Crk-II, Nck-I, or Src, and binding was assessed by secondary incubation with anti-GST antibody. The results indicate that each of the identified sites of Src phosphorylation (sites 6–15) can promote a stable interaction with Crk-SH2, with sites 9 and 10 having the highest apparent affinity (Fig. 5B, top panel). Sites 1, 4, and 5 also exhibited the capacity for Crk-SH2 binding. In contrast, only sites 9 and 10 were well recognized by Nck-SH2 (Fig. 5B, middle panel). As expected, the Src-SH2 control showed efficient binding only to the two SBD sites (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). No binding to the control nonphosphorylated peptides was observed.Fig. 5Analysis of Crk-SH2 binding capacities of the phosphorylated YXXP tyrosines.

https://openalex.org/W2022011021,"Bacterial exopolysaccharides provide protection against phagocytosis, opsonization, and dehydration and act as a major structural component of the extracellular matrix in biofilms. They contribute to biofilm-related resistance by acting as a diffusion barrier to positively charged antimicrobial agents including cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs). We previously created novel CAPs consisting of a nonamphipathic hydrophobic core flanked by Lys residues and containing a Trp residue in the hydrophobic segment as a fluorescent probe. Peptides of this type above a specific hydrophobicity threshold insert spontaneously into membranes and have antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at micromolar concentrations. Here we show that alginate, a polymer of β-d-mannuronate and α-l-guluronate secreted by the cystic fibrosis pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, induces an α-helical conformation detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy and blue shifts in Trp fluorescence maxima in peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold, changes typically observed upon association of such peptides with nonpolar (membrane) environments. Parallel effects were observed in the archetypical CAPs magainin II amide and cecropin P1. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies indicated that alginate induces peptide-peptide association only in peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold, suggesting that the hydrophilic alginate polymer behaves as an “auxiliary membrane” for the bacteria, demonstrating a unique protective role for biofilm matrices against CAPs. Bacterial exopolysaccharides provide protection against phagocytosis, opsonization, and dehydration and act as a major structural component of the extracellular matrix in biofilms. They contribute to biofilm-related resistance by acting as a diffusion barrier to positively charged antimicrobial agents including cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs). We previously created novel CAPs consisting of a nonamphipathic hydrophobic core flanked by Lys residues and containing a Trp residue in the hydrophobic segment as a fluorescent probe. Peptides of this type above a specific hydrophobicity threshold insert spontaneously into membranes and have antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at micromolar concentrations. Here we show that alginate, a polymer of β-d-mannuronate and α-l-guluronate secreted by the cystic fibrosis pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, induces an α-helical conformation detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy and blue shifts in Trp fluorescence maxima in peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold, changes typically observed upon association of such peptides with nonpolar (membrane) environments.

Alginate is a secreted extracellular polysaccharide composed of the uronic acid β-d-mannuronate and its C-5 epimer α-l-guluronate (4Gacesa P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which is partially O-acetylated at the second and/or third position(s) of the d-mannuronate residues. The chronicity of P. aeruginosa infections in CF; its high level intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, a result of the low permeability of its outer membrane to antibiotics and multidrug efflux systems; and its propensity to develop resistance during prolonged antimicrobial therapy have all presented major therapeutic challenges to CF caregivers. Our laboratory has developed a new category of cationic antimicrobial peptides that display antibacterial activity (5Stark M. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The peptides consist of a nonamphipathic hydrophobic core sequence (11-19 residues) flanked at one or both termini by a number of Lys or Arg residues. These peptides, which were originally designed as transmembrane mimetic model peptides (6Liu L.P. Li S.C. Goto N.K. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), have the prototypic sequence KKAAAXAAAAAX- AAWAAXAAAKKKK-NH2 with several key features: (i) Ala is the preferred background residue because of its mid-range hydropathy and frequent occurrence in membrane protein transmembrane domains; (ii) a Trp residue is inserted into the hydrophobic segment as a fluorescent probe; and (iii) N- and C-terminal hydrophilic Lys residues act to solubilize the otherwise hydrophobic peptides in aqueous media to facilitate purification and characterization. These peptides have been shown to spontaneously insert into membranes when the average hydrophobicity of their core segment is above an experimentally determined “threshold” value based on the Liu-Deber hydrophobicity scale (see Table I), approximately above that where Xaa = Ala (7Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that peptides in this general category containing sequences above the hydrophobicity threshold have antimicrobial activity against both planktonic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at μg/ml concentrations (5Stark M.

Open table in a new tab However, many antimicrobial compounds become considerably less effective against bacteria in biofilms. More specifically, alginate has been shown to act as a penetration barrier to conventional positively charged antibiotics through binding based on electrostatic interactions with the anionic sugars (8Nichols W.W. Dorrington S.M. Slack M.P.E. Walmsley H.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Stewart P.S. Costerton J.W. Lancet. 2001; 358: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3261) Google Scholar). However, the peptide-alginate interaction per se has not been widely studied. In this study, we investigated the effects of alginate on the structure of the 25-residue transmembrane mimic peptides. This set of model peptides allows us to vary the “guest” residue Xaa to any of the 20 commonly occurring amino acids individually and correlate the effects observed with the properties of the specific amino acid. By investigating the primary mode of interaction of these model peptides and the alginate polymers within biofilms, we can increase our understanding of the mechanism by which alginate may “trap” cationic antibiotics and ultimately progress toward optimizing the antimicrobial activity of this cationic antimicrobial peptide family against the P. aeruginosa biofilms in CF patients. Peptide Synthesis—The reagents for peptide synthesis, cleavage, and purification were Fmoc-protected amino acids (Novabiochem), [5-(4-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxyphenoxy)valeric acid]-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene (PAL-PEG-PS) resin (Applied Biosystems), N-N-dimethylformaamide (peptide grade; Caledon Laboratories Ltd.), piperidine (Applied Biosystems), methanol (Caledon), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Aldrich), O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (Applied Biosystems), diethyl ether (Caledon), triisopropylsilane (Aldrich), phenol (Invitrogen), and acetonitrile (Caledon). The peptides were synthesized by continuous flow Fmoc solid phase method on a PerSeptive Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesizer using the standard cycle as previously described (7Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PAL-PEG-PS resin was used to produce an amidated C terminus. The O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate-N,N-diisopropylethylamine activator pair was used with amino acids at 4-fold excess. Deprotection and cleavage of the peptides were carried out in a mixture of 88% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% water, and 2% triisopropylsilane for 2 h at room temperature. Cleaved and deprotected peptides were precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether. Purification of peptides was carried out on a reversed-phase C4 preparative HPLC (21.2 × 250 mm, 300 A), using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as counter-ion. Purified peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry. Concentrations of peptides were determined in triplicate by micro-bicinchoninic acid protein assay. CD Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed on a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path-length quartz cell at 25 °C. Each spectrum was the average of four scans with buffer background or alginate in the absence of peptide subtracted. Peptide concentrations were typically 40-50 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) in the presence and absence of carbohydrates. Seaweed alginate (Sigma) and alginate purified from P. aeruginosa (gift from Dr. Gerald Pier, Harvard Medical School) samples were extracted with both chloroform and hexane to remove potential fatty acid impurities (10Diefenbach R. Keweloh H. Rehm H.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 36: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) prior to use. Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Hitachi F-400 fluorescence spectrophotometer with emission and excitation slit widths of 4 nm. Fluorescence measurements were performed with 4 μm peptide solutions (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) with or without the addition of 0.02 mg/ml carbohydrates at 25 °C with subtraction of the background of buffer or alginate in the absence of peptide. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm. The emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm. Fluorophore Labeling—Fluorophore labeling of peptides was performed as previously described (11Adair B.D. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (dansyl chloride), 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4′-sulfonyl chloride (dabsyl chloride), and 5-(and-6-)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (5(6)-TAMRA), succinimidyl ester mixed isomers were obtained from Molecular Probes. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Measurements—Separate populations of peptides were labeled with dansyl chloride as the donor chromophore and dabsyl chloride as the acceptor chromophore to observe association. The samples were prepared with 3 μm dansyl chloride-labeled peptide solutions (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) with or without the addition of variable concentrations of dabsyl chloride-labeled peptide in the presence of 0.02 mg/ml alginate. Excitation wavelength was 341 nm. Emission spectra of the donor chromophore were recorded from 450 to 600 nm at 25 °C. Penetration of Peptides into Alginate Beads—Alginate beads (0.5 mm in diameter) were made by the “dripping method” (12Fundueanu G. Nastruzzi N. Carpov A. Desbrieres J. Rinaudo M. Biomaterials. 1999; 20: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) where droplets (1 μl) of a 1 mg/ml solution of alginate were added into a solution containing 1 m CaCl2. Following dialysis performed to remove excess CaCl2, 20 μl of 0.50 nm of TAMRA-labeled peptides were allowed to incubate with the alginate beads for 10 min. Unbound peptides were removed by washing with H2O. Examination of the interaction of TAMRA-labeled peptides with alginate beads was performed using a LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss). The images were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 543 nm and an emission wavelength of 635 nm for TAMRA-labeled peptides at the mid-cross-section of the beads using the LSM 510 positioning software. Alginate Induces Helical Conformations in Peptides above the Hydrophobicity Threshold—In aqueous solution, the peptide with the guest residue Xaa = Phe displayed a partially helical CD spectrum (Fig. 1a) consistent with residue preferences on the Chou-Fasman (Pα) scale (7Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). However, upon the addition of alginate, the peptide adopted an essentially full α-helical conformation. Peptide interactions with alginate were seen to vary with peptide/alginate ratios, with CD spectra displaying a nonmonotonic progression of curves before progressing toward final helical patterns. Similar to the Xaa = Phe peptide (Fig. 1a), we found that peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold of the Liu-Deber scale (7Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Xaa = Trp, Leu, Ile, Met, Val, Tyr, and Ala) demonstrated similar properties, i.e. alginate induced α-helical formation in each of these peptides (spectra not shown). In contrast, although the spectra of peptides below the threshold similarly display nonmonotonic progression of CD curves, the final spectra at highest alginate/peptide ratios showed little or no net conformational change; as an example, the model peptide with guest residue Xaa = Pro is shown in Fig. 1b. As well, some peptides with guest residues having polar and/or charged side chains (such as Xaa = Arg, Asp, Glu, Lys, and His) similarly displayed a variable pattern (shown for Xaa = Glu in Fig. 1c), where alginate induced intermediate conformational changes other than helical induction but little net conformational alteration. The observation that only peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold undergo net helix induction suggested initially that the predominantly hydrophilic alginate polymer interacts with peptides via both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (14Mishima Y. Momma K. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6552-6559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Alginate Induces Blue Shifts in Peptide Tryptophan Fluorescence Emission Maxima—The presence of Trp in the hydrophobic core of the model peptides allowed us to probe for changes in their environment by examining alginate-induced shifts occurring in the wavelength of their fluorescence emission maximum. The feasibility of fluorescence spectroscopy for elucidating sugar-protein interactions has been demonstrated by Vazque-Ibar et al. (15Vazquez-lbar J.L. Guan L. Svrakic M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12706-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present work, the emission maximum of each Trp-containing peptide was ∼350 nm in aqueous solution, but upon the addition of alginate, a blue shift in the emission maximum, diagnostic for relocation to a less polar environment, occurred, accompanied by the characteristic increase in intensity. Table I lists the blue shift values of the peptides in a buffered alginate solution. Blue shifts of 3-10 nm were observed for all peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold (i.e. all the antimicrobially active peptides); alginate had no effect on spectra of peptides below the threshold (Table I). Consistent with previous data showing that alginate can absorb pyrene molecules from bulk aqueous media (16Neumann M.G. Schmitt C.C. Iamazaki E.T. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these results support the notion that alginate contains hydrophobic microdomains that may induce α-helicity and blue shifting effects in peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold. Molecular Modeling of Alginate—A previous study on lipid-alginate interactions suggested that alginate could insert into the lipid bilayer by broad analogy to insertion of membrane proteins (17Cohen S. Bano M.C. Chow M. Langer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), an observation providing further indication that alginate possesses some discrete hydrophobic character. Because the alginate-induced blue shifts observed in fluorescence studies correlate with formation of α-helix in CD spectra of the same set of peptides (Table I and Fig. 1), hydrophobic peptide-alginate interactions are implicated as a potential contributor to the observed spectroscopic effects. To identify a molecular origin for a hydrophobic compartment in alginate, we considered the chemical nature of the faces of its monomeric components (Fig. 2, a and b) (Sweet Program; www.dkf-heidelberg.de/spec/sweet2/doc/index.html). Although α-l-guluronate (∼30% of alginate composition in P. aeruginosa) projects two axially oriented C-H protons on its more hydrophobic face, we noted that β-d-mannuronate (70% composition) contains a highly hydrophobic face with a total of four C-H protons (three axial + one equatorial) in similar orientation (Fig. 2b). A composite of such structures among alginate strands, particularly in β-d-mannuronate-rich segments, could readily form a localized hydrophobic compartment. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Studies of Peptide-Alginate Interactions—To show that the anionic alginate can not only bind to cationic peptides through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions but also can promote peptide-peptide interactions, we used FRET to measure the distance-dependent interaction between the excited electronic states of donor-acceptor pairs of dye molecules covalently attached to the N termini of selected peptides. This technique has been widely used to study interactions between subunits in protein complexes (19Carraway III, K.L. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8699-86707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Matysu L. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1992; 12: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), e.g. where dansyl-chloride-labeled and dabsylchloride-labeled glycophorin A peptides in lipid vesicles were used to demonstrate that the protein exists in a dimeric form (11Adair B.D. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, two cationic antimicrobial peptides with guest residue Xaa = Phe were created: one labeled with dansyl chloride (as a donor) and the other labeled with dansyl chloride (as an acceptor). As shown in Fig. 3a, the emission maximum is quenched when the dabsyl-labeled Phe peptide was added to the dansyl-labeled peptide in alginate solution. Similar to results with the glycophorin dimer, quenching was not affected over a range of 5-fold increase in the amount of alginate present but decreased upon the addition of unlabeled Phe peptide (results not shown), indicating that the FRET signal is not simply the result of nearby but noninteracting peptides (11Adair B.D. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A nonlinear curve fit to the observed energy transfer for a number of donor-to-acceptor ratios indicated that the peptide likely forms dimers and/or higher oligomers in alginate solutions (results not shown). A further indication of the intimate interaction of the Phe peptide with alginate is the observation of a significant blue shift in the dansyl emission maximum, from ∼550 nm in aqueous phases to ∼525 nm in the presence of added alginate. In contrast, when the same studies were performed with peptide with Xaa = Asp, no quenching of the dansyl chloride emission was observed when dabsyl-chloride-labeled peptide was added in alginate solution (Fig. 3b), and no blue shift occurred in dansyl emission maxima. Studies of Peptide-Alginate Interactions by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—To correlate the helical induction properties of the peptides in alginate to their ability to permeate the alginate matrix, we investigated the penetration of the peptides in alginate beads. Peptides with Xaa = Trp and Phe (both above the hydrophobicity threshold) and with Xaa = Glu and Ser (both below the threshold) were labeled with TAMRA. Consistent with studies on fluorescently labeled magainin (21Park C.B. Kim H.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), TAMRA-labeled peptides used in the present experiments displayed the same antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa as their unlabelled counterparts (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 4, both the Trp and Phe peptides (Fig. 4, a and b) were largely concentrated on the surface of the beads, whereas the Glu and Ser peptides (Fig. 4, c and d) diffused nonspecifically into the center of the beads. CD of Other Antimicrobial Peptides in Alginate—To examine the generality of the ability of alginate to induce α-helical character in peptides with antimicrobial activity, we performed parallel experiments on two commercially available antimicrobial peptides. As shown in the CD spectra in Fig. 5, both cecropin P1 (SWLSKTAKKLENSAKKRISEGIAIAIQGGPR) (22Lee J.Y. Boman A. Sun C.X. Andersson M. Jornvall H. Mutt V. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9159-9162Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and magainin-II-amide (GIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS-NH2) (23Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) adopt α-helical conformations in the presence of alginate. CD and Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Model Peptides in Other Carbohydrates—To address whether alginate possesses the unique characteristic among carbohydrate systems of inducing helical conformation in peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold, we used CD spectroscopy to examine the effects on peptide conformation in the presence of the neutral polysaccharide amylose (composed of glucose), of the negatively charged polymer hyaluronate (a polymer composed of glucuronate and N-acetyl glucosamine), and of the monomeric uronic acid sugar glucuronate. We found that amylose did not evoke any helix induction effects (spectra not shown). Hyaluronate was able to induce α-helical structure but only in the peptide with Xaa = Trp (results not shown; spectra with the Xaa = Trp peptide similar to Fig. 1a). Monomeric glucuronate was also able to induce helical structure, indicating that a polymer is not required to induce peptide helicity, but again, only in the peptide Xaa = Trp. Note that a hydrophobic “face” is available in the glucuronate molecule, as formed by three co-oriented C-H protons (Fig. 2c). However, distinct from alginate, no blue shift in Trp emission maxima was observed for any peptide studied under all of the conditions in amylose, hyaluronate, or glucuronate solutions. Helix induction in peptides by sugars may be fundamentally a consequence of the fact that the addition of saccharides lowers the dielectric constant of the pure aqueous medium, in effect creating a less polar medium in which competition by solvent for peptide backbone H-bonds is reduced. An accompanying phenomenon is the ability of anionic sugars to “neutralize” Lys side chain amino acids by serving as organic counterions, with the consequence that the already hydrophobic peptides become significantly less soluble in the presence of alginate. This latter effect could also promote peptide aggregation. However, in contrast to the observation that basic poly-l-lysines form precipitates in pectate solutions, likely because of Lys-promoted “cross-linking” of pectate strands (24Bystricky S. Malovíková A. Sticzay T. Carbohydr. Polym. 1990; 13: 283-294Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25MacDougall A.J. Brett G.M. Morris V.J. Rigby N.M. Ridout M.J. Ring S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Paradossi G. Chiessi E. Malovikova A. Biopolymers. 1999; 50: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the current FRET experiments confirm the presence of peptide-peptide interactions that likely originate from the intrinsic hydrophobic character of the peptides. Although the oligomeric state of hydrophobic peptides can explain, in part, the blue shifts in Trp fluorescence indicating the burial of the Trp residue within the peptide oligomers, it is important to note that the alginate-induced blue shift is accompanied by a concomitant increase in fluorescence intensity, whereas Trp fluorescence would usually be quenched in peptide aggregates (27Wang C. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16155-16159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hydrophobic “compartment” presented to the peptides by alginate, in concert with the hydrophobic character of the peptides, apparently act synergistically to produce the observed structured helical monomeric and/or oligomeric peptide species. Along with the confocal laser scanning microscopy images, these data lead us to postulate that alginate, by promoting peptide-peptide association, could play a protective role by inhibiting the antimicrobially active peptides from reaching the target bacterial membrane in biofilms. Among the peptides tested in the present work, only the peptide with Xaa = Trp, which contains a total of four Trp residues, adopts an α-helical conformation in the presence of carbohydrates other than alginate, suggesting a degree of specificity of Trp binding to carbohydrates. A crystal structure of the alginate-binding protein AlgQ2 complexed with the alginate tetrasaccharide MMGM suggested that the nonpolar/non-polar protein-sugar contacts occur mainly through aromatic (mainly Trp) side chains (14Mishima Y. Momma K. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6552-6559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Indeed, the proximity of aromatic side chains to bound carbohydrates is a feature of carbohydrate binding to many proteins and/or enzymes, as exemplified by Trp-galactopyranosyl ring stacking interactions within the lactose permease LacY membrane domain (28Guan L. Hu Y. Kaback R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), where interactions between the π electrons of aromatic side chains and the C-H bonds present in hexopyranoses are a common motif (28Guan L. Hu Y. Kaback R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 30Vyas N.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 732-740Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 31Brandl M. Weiss M.S. Jabs A. Suhnel J. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 32Meyer E. Castellano R. Diederich F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 1210-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). The carboxylate and OH groups of the alginate sugars render the protons of the C-H bonds δ-positive, which enhances their capacity for interaction with electron-rich aromatic rings (33Sipos D. Andersson M. Ehrenberg A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the fact that alginate induced both α-helical conformation and blue shifting of Trp emission maximum only in peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold (viz., the antimicrobially active subset) indicates that alginate possesses some unique characteristics possibly related to its biological function in biofilms. As well, the Trp residue is not in itself sufficient to mediate the effects observed, because peptides below the threshold (Table I), all of which contain Trp, do not interact substantively with the polysaccharides. Thus, the alginate matrix, which contains both equatorial-axial and axial-equatorial monomer-monomer linkages, may offer local strand-strand interactions to produce hydrophobic “pockets” that can effectively sequester added peptides. As mentioned above, such pockets could be formed largely from β-d-mannuronate-rich alginate segments (Fig. 2b). Although structural details of the macromolecular complexes formed by peptide-alginate interactions remain to be elucidated, we have shown here that alginate can induce α-helical structure in antimicrobially active peptides whose average core sequence hydrophobicity exceeds a “hydrophobicity threshold. “In addition to the nonpolar/nonpolar interactions between hydrophobic residues and suitably positioned carbohydrate C-H protons, the neutralizing effects by the anionic sugars on Lys play a significant role in helix induction in peptides above the hydrophobicity threshold (as demonstrated by amylose, a neutral polysaccharide). Because peptides of this category are antimicrobially active only when above the hydrophobicity threshold, we postulate that alginate exhibits membrane-mimetic properties. The fact that α-helical induction of membrane-active peptides is typically observed upon peptide association with micelles or membrane bilayers (7Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34Wieprecht T. Dathe M. Schümann M. Krause E. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10844-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Gesell J. Zasloff M. Opella S.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) leads us to suggest that alginate behaves as an “auxiliary membrane” for the bacteria. Furthermore, just as nonpolar clusters present in alginate are likely stacked with aromatic residues (14Mishima Y. Momma K. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6552-6559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), aromatic residues are correspondingly responsible for anchoring protein transmembrane segments at the membrane/water interface (36Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Alginate thus forms complexes with peptides competitively with the bacterial membrane and probably entraps the peptide by promoting peptide oligomerization before the peptide can reach the bacterial membrane, consistent with the decreased effectiveness of these antibiotics in biofilm-situated bacteria. As such, these results provide, in part, a novel molecular basis for the protection mechanism afforded the bacteria by alginate. One may speculate that anionic oligosaccharides on mammalian cell surfaces could perform an analogous scavenger function. As further details of peptide interactions with polysaccharides emerge, suitable manipulation of peptide hydrophobicity, charge, and length can potentially produce peptides, which more effectively penetrate the biofilm matrix and kill P. aeruginosa."

We have analyzed two human Eg5/KSP motors, Eg5-367 and Eg5-437, and both are monomeric based on results from sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation as well as analytical gel filtration. The steady-state parameters were: for Eg5-367: kcat = 5.5 s-1, K1/2,Mt = 0.7 μm, and Km,ATP = 25 μm; and for Eg5-437: kcat = 2.9 s-1, K1/2,Mt = 4.5 μm, and Km,ATP = 19 μm. 2′(3′)-O-(N-Methylanthraniloyl)-ATP (mantATP) binding was rapid at 2-3 μm-1s-1, followed immediately by ATP hydrolysis at 15 s-1. ATP-dependent Mt·Eg5 dissociation was relatively slow and rate-limiting at 8 s-1 with mantADP release at 40 s-1. Surprisingly, Eg5-367 binds microtubules more effectively (11 μm-1s-1) than Eg5-437 (0.7 μm-1s-1), consistent with the steady-state K1/2,Mt and the mantADP release K1/2,Mt. These results indicate that the ATPase pathway for monomeric Eg5 is more similar to conventional kinesin than the spindle motors Ncd and Kar3, where ADP product release is rate-limiting for steady-state turnover.

The aim of this study was to establish the kinetic basis of force generation of Eg5 in direct comparison to conventional kinesin and other well characterized spindle motors, Kar3 and Ncd. We have utilized kinetic and thermodynamic approaches to define the mechanochemistry of two truncated human Eg5 motors, Eg5-367 and Eg5-437. Eg5-367, containing the N-terminal 367 amino acids, represents a single Eg5 catalytic domain (33Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Chem.

Surprisingly, we found that Eg5-437, designed to yield a dimeric motor, is monomeric based on results from sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation as well as analytical gel filtration. The kinetics and equilibrium binding characteristics for Eg5 presented here reveal a unique ATPase mechanism more similar to KinN kinesins, such as conventional kinesin, compared with the well studied KinC spindle motors, Kar3 and Ncd. Experimental Conditions—Experiments were performed at 25 °C in ATPase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% sucrose). All concentrations reported for experiments are final after mixing. Expression and Purification of Eg5—We have expressed two human Eg5 constructs as described previously (33Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Eg5-367 contains the N-terminal 367 amino acids, Met1-Gln367 followed by a His6 tag (molecular mass = 41.7 kDa without MgADP and 42.1 kDa with MgADP), and Eg5-437 contains the N-terminal 437 amino acids, Met1-Thr437, followed by a His6 tag (molecular mass = 49.8 kDa without MgADP and 50.2 kDa with MgADP). Both recombinant Eg5 motors were expressed in the Escherichia coli cell line BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified using column chromatography. Briefly, cells were diluted after induction to 1 g/6 ml in lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The soluble cell lysate was loaded onto a 100-ml S-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) column to select for the Eg5 motor domain. Eg5 was eluted from the S-Sepharose column using a linear NaCl gradient (20-600 mm NaCl). Fractions enriched in Eg5 were pooled and dialyzed against nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02 mm ATP). The dialysate was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) column, and Eg5 was eluted using a linear imidazole gradient (0-200 mm imidazole). Fractions enriched in Eg5 were pooled and dialyzed against ATPase buffer plus 200 mm NaCl to remove the imidazole. The dialysate was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore Centriprep 30, Bedford, MA) and further dialyzed against ATPase buffer with 5% sucrose. We determined the Eg5 protein concentration by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with IgG as the protein standard. This purification method yielded 40-150 mg of Eg5 protein per 30 g of E. coli cells at >99% purity. Microtubules for Kinetic Experiments—Microtubules were prepared from bovine brain tubulin, and on the day of each experiment an aliquot of tubulin was thawed, cycled, and stabilized with 20 μm Taxol (paclitaxel, Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted at 42,000 rpm, and a sedimentation equilibrium experiment was carried out at 17,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) equipped with absorbance optics and an An60Ti rotor. Velocity and equilibrium data were collected at a wavelength of 235 nm. The conditions for sedimentation velocity experiments included ATPase buffer with and without 50 μm AMP-PNP 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)-triphosphate; Mt, microtubule; mant, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); AXP, ATP or ADP; GST, glutathione S-transferase.

The reported weight average sedimentation coefficient values (s20,w) obtained from DCDT+ were corrected for the solution density and viscosity (75Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A.

Gel Filtration and Stokes Radii Calculations—Purified proteins were resolved by using a Superose-6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in ATPase buffer at 25 °C using the System Gold high-pressure liquid chromatography system (Beckman Coulter Inc.) (Fig. 1B). The elution volumes (Ve) of proteins were determined by intrinsic protein fluorescence detection (Jasco FP-2020, Victoria, British Columbia). The Stokes radii (Rs) of Eg5-367, Eg5-437, and Drosophila kinesin heavy chain (K401) were calculated as described previously (77Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the partition coefficients (Kav) were calculated for four standard proteins of known Stokes radii (Rs): ovalbumin, 3.05 nm; aldolase, 4.81 nm; catalase, 5.22 nm; and ferritin, 6.10 nm.

Open table in a new tab Phosphocreatine Kinase Coupled Assay—The concentration of active Eg5 sites was determined by performing phosphocreatine kinase coupled assays as previously described (78Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, Eg5 (5 μm final concentration) was incubated with trace amounts of [α-32P]ATP for 90 min to convert all radiolabeled ATP to ADP (data not shown). In some experiments, additional non-radiolabeled ADP was then added to yield a final concentration of 5-15 μm [α-32P]ADP. The Eg5·[α-32P]ADP complex was combined with a creatine kinase/phosphocreatine-based ATP regeneration system to convert unbound [α-32P]ADP to [α-32P]ATP. However, ADP tightly bound at the Eg5 active site was inaccessible to the creatine kinase and therefore protected from enzymatic conversion to ATP. This assay measures the Eg5 concentration based on ADP tightly bound at the Eg5 active site. The protected [α-32P]ADP was quantified as a function of time by incubating the Eg5·[α-32P]ADP complex with the regeneration system with or without 2.5 mm unlabeled MgATP (Fig 2A). Each data set was fit to the following single exponential function, [ADP]=A exp(−kofft)+C(Eq. 1) where the active site concentration is the sum of the amplitude (A) and the constant term (C) to extrapolate to zero time (t). In the experiment with excess unlabeled MgATP, koff is the first-order rate constant for ADP release in the absence of microtubules. Steady-State ATPase Kinetics—Eg5 steady-state ATPase activity was determined by following [α-32P]ATP hydrolysis to form [α-32P]ADP·Pi as previously described (78Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B, the rate of ATP turnover was plotted as a function of microtubule concentration, and the data were fit to the following quadratic equation,Rate=0.5×kcat×{(E0+K1/2,Mt+Mt0)−[(E0+K1/2,Mt+Mt0)2−(4E0Mt0)]1/2}(Eq. 2) where the Rate is the amount of hydrolysis product formed per second per active site, kcat is the maximum rate constant of product formation at saturating substrate, E0 is the Eg5 site concentration, K1/2,Mt is the tubulin concentration as microtubules needed to provide one-half the maximal velocity, and Mt0 is the microtubule concentration. Mt·Eg5 Cosedimentation Assays—Eg5 at 2 μm was incubated with varying microtubule concentrations (0-6 μm tubulin) in the absence (Fig. 3A) or presence (Fig. 3C) of increasing MgADP concentrations for 30 min, followed by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge (Beckman Coulter Inc.) at 30 p.s.i. (100,000 × g) for 30 min as described previously (67Foster K.A. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35307-35318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The microtubule pellet was resuspended in ATPase buffer to equal the volume of the supernatant. Gel samples for the pellet and supernatant were prepared in 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The gels were analyzed with a Scan Maker X6EL scanner (Microtek, Carson, CA), and the proteins were quantified using National Institutes of Health Image (version 1.62) to determine the fraction of Eg5 in the supernatant and pellet at each microtubule concentration. The fraction of Eg5 that partitioned to the pellet was plotted as a function of microtubule concentration (Fig. 3A), and the data were fit to the following quadratic equation,Mt·E/E0=0.5×{(E0+Kd+Mt0)−[(E0+Kd+Mt0)2−(4E0Mt0)]1/2}(Eq. 3) where Mt·E/E0 is the fraction of Eg5 partitioning with the microtubule pellet, E0 is total Eg5 concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, and Mt0 is the microtubule concentration. For Fig. 3C, the fraction of Eg5 that partitioned to the pellet was plotted as a function of MgADP concentration. Mt·Eg5·[α-32P]ADP Cosedimentation Assays—Eg5 at 5 μm was incubated with microtubules (6 and 8 μm tubulin for Eg5-367 and Eg5-437, respectively) and with varying concentrations of radiolabeled MgADP (2.5-100 μm) for 30 min as described previously (72Mackey A.T. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3527-3535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, the unwashed pellet was resuspended in 4 n NaOH, and the volume of the pellet was adjusted with buffer to equal the volume of the supernatant. Control reactions were performed at each microtubule concentration in the absence of Eg5 to determine the amount of radiolabeled nucleotide that was non-specifically trapped in the microtubule pellet. The concentration of [α-32P]ADP for each Mt·Eg5 reaction was corrected for [α-32P]ADP that partitioned with microtubules in the absence of motor. Fig. 3B shows the data fit to the following quadratic equation,Mt·E·ADP=0.5×{(E0+Kd+ADP)−[(E0+Kd+ADP)2−(4E0ADP)]1/2}(Eq. 4) where Mt·E·ADP is the concentration of ADP bound to the Mt·Eg5 complex, E0 is total Eg5, ADP is the total nucleotide present, and Kd is the dissociation constant for ADP. Acid-quench Experiment—The pre-steady-state kinetics of MgATP hydrolysis for Eg5 in the presence of microtubules was defined in this assay. A preformed Mt·Eg5 complex was rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of radiolabeled MgATP plus 100 mm KCl in a quench-flow instrument (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX). We added the additional salt in the ATP syringe to lower steady-state turnover without affecting the pre-steady-state burst of product formation (Fig. 5A). The reaction was incubated (from 10 ms to 1 s) and quenched with formic acid, and radiolabeled product formation was quantified after separating [α-32P]ADP plus Pi from unreacted [α-32P]ATP by thin layer chromatography (78Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The concentration of [α-32P]ADP was plotted as a function of time (Fig. 5B), and the data were fit to the following burst equation,Product=(A×[1−exp(−kbt)])+ksst(Eq. 5) where A is the amplitude of the initial rapid exponential phase, which corresponds to the formation of [α-32P]ADP·Pi at the Eg5 active site during the first turnover, kb is the rate constant of the exponential burst phase, t is time in seconds, and kss is the rate constant of the linear phase (μm ADP·s-1) corresponding to steady-state turnover. The exponential rate of the pre-steady-state burst (kb) and burst amplitude (A) (Fig. 5C) were plotted as a function of MgATP concentration, and each data set was fit to a hyperbola. Pulse-chase Experiment—This experiment measures the time course of the formation of a kinetically stable Mt·Eg5·ATP intermediate prior to ATP hydrolysis (48Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the time course of ATP turnover (from 10 ms to 1 s) was measured by chasing the Mt·Eg5·[α-32P]ATP intermediate with ∼5 mm MgATP (15 mm MgATP in the quench syringe) for 4 s (8-10 half-lives) in the quench-flow instrument. The reaction mixture was terminated with formic acid, and the radiolabeled product was quantified. The data in Fig. 6 (A and C) were fit to Equation 3, and each data set in Fig. 6B was fit to a hyperbola. Stopped-flow Experiments—The pre-steady-state kinetics of mantAT"

Myosin VI, an actin-dependent, minus-end directed mechanoenzyme, has been implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in epithelial cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether myosin VI regulates CFTR endocytosis.

The tail domain of myosin VI, a dominant-negative recombinant fragment, displaced endogenous myosin VI from interacting with Dab2 and CFTR and increased the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane by reducing CFTR endocytosis. However, the myosin VI tail fragment had no effect on the recycling of endocytosed CFTR or on fluid-phase endocytosis. CFTR endocytosis was decreased by cytochalasin D, an actin-filament depolymerizing agent. Taken together, these data indicate that myosin VI and Dab2 facilitate CFTR endocytosis by a mechanism that requires actin filaments.

In addition, ΔF508-CFTR has a greatly reduced half-life in the plasma membrane compared with wild type (wt)-CFTR (9Lukacs G.L. Chang X.B. Bear C. Kartner N. Mohamed A. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), most likely because of defects in endocytosis and/or endocytic recycling. Accordingly, correction of the ΔF508-CFTR defect in CF patients is likely to require combined therapy that will include: (1) promoting ΔF508-CFTR exit from the endoplasmic reticulum; (2) activating ΔF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane; and (3) increasing the half-life of ΔF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the half-life or number of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane and, thus, the rate of transepithelial Cl- secretion.Activation of protein kinase A by cyclic AMP enhances Cl- secretion in part by inhibiting endocytic removal of CFTR from the plasma membrane and by stimulating the insertion of CFTR channels into the plasma membrane (12Schwiebert E.M. Gesek F. Ercolani L. Wjasow C. Gruenert D.C. Karlson K. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C272-C281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the cellular mechanisms that regulate the endocytic trafficking of CFTR. Endocytic trafficking involves: (1) the sequestration and internalization of channels and receptors from the cell surface into endocytic vesicles (i.e. endocytosis); (2) the fusion of endosomes with intracellular endocytic compartments; and (3) the recycling of proteins in endosomal vesicles back to the plasma membrane (i.e. endocytic recycling) (13Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 14Mousavi S.A. Malerod L. Berg T. Kjeken R. Biochem.

Endocytosis begins with the clustering of cell surface proteins into coated pits. The coat is composed of clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which is present exclusively at the plasma membrane. The μ2 subunit of AP-2 contains a binding site for tyrosine-based endocytic signals (YXXØ), such as the YDSI signal found in the C terminus of CFTR (16Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 276: 46251-46259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas the β2 subunit binds to clathrin (17Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, AP-2 links clathrin to receptors and channels as they cluster in the plasma membrane during endocytosis. AP-2 also recruits accessory proteins to clathrin-coated pits. The accessory proteins may participate in selecting cargo (i.e. CFTR) for incorporation into the growing coated pit or in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. After a clathrin-coated vesicle has budded from the plasma membrane, it becomes an uncoated vesicle, whereupon AP-2 and clathrin dissociate and recycle back to the plasma membrane as soluble proteins. Subsequently, the uncoated vesicle fuses with an early endosome.CFTR is endocytosed in clathrin-coated vesicles (18Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; 267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction between the μ2 subunit of AP-2 and the tyrosine-based endocytic motif (YDSI) in the cytoplasmic C terminus of CFTR is thought to facilitate CFTR endocytosis (16Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A.

Recent evidence demonstrates that myosin VI regulates early steps of TfR endocytosis, including uptake of TfR into clathrin-coated pits and formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (36Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3676-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), as well as the later stages of TfR endocytosis, including movement of uncoated vesicles toward the early endosomes on actin filaments (41Aschenbrenner L. Lee T. Hasson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2728-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 47Aschenbrenner L. Naccache S.N. Hasson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2253-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that myosin VI plays a role in CFTR endocytosis. CFTR in the apical membrane formed a complex with myosin VI, the myosin VI adaptor protein Disabled 2 (Dab2), and clathrin. Displacement of endogenous myosin VI by the tail domain of myosin VI, a dominant-negative recombinant fragment, increased expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane by reducing CFTR endocytosis. However, the myosin VI tail had no effect on CFTR endocytic recycling or on fluid-phase endocytosis. CFTR endocytosis was decreased by cytochalasin D, an actin filament depolymerizing agent. Taken together, these data indicate that myosin VI facilitates CFTR endocytosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Cell Culture—Calu-3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in tissue culture flasks (Costar, Corning Corporation, Corning, NY) at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium containing 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2/95% air incubator at 37 °C as described previously (48Loffing J. Moyer B.D. McCoy D. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C913-C920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calu-3 cells were also grown on Transwell permeable supports (24-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size; Corning Corporation) in air-liquid interface culture for 14 to 21 days (48Loffing J. Moyer B.D. McCoy D. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C913-C920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Calu-3 cells become polarized (48Loffing J. Moyer B.D. McCoy D. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C913-C920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium n-butyrate (5 mm) was added to the Calu-3 cell culture medium 48 h before experiments to stimulate CFTR expression. Sodium n-butyrate treatment did not affect the expression of endogenous myosin VI and Dab2. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were seeded in tissue culture flasks coated with Vitrogen plating medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), human fibronectin (10 μg/ml; Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), 1% Vitrogen 100 (Collagen, Palo Alto, CA), and bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml; Sigma) (48Loffing J.

Sodium n-butyrate (5 mm) was added to the HEK293 cell culture medium 24 h before experiments to stimulate CFTR expression. Sodium n-butyrate treatment did not affect the expression of endogenous myosin VI or Dab2 or the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-MyoVI-Tail and GFP-Dab2 transgenes.Plasmids—Plasmids containing GFP-Myosin VI globular tail (GFPMyoVI-Tail), wt-CFTR (CFTR), and GFP-wt-CFTR (GFP-CFTR) constructs were generated as described (41Aschenbrenner L.

All constructs were sequence verified by ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Transient Transfections—Transient transfections of HEK293 cells were carried out using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RT-PCR—The tail domain of myosin VI is alternatively spliced, leading to the generation of two predominant splice variants (36Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3676-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 46Breckler J. Au K. Cheng J. Hasson T. Burnside B. Exp.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). RT-PCR studies were conducted to identify which myosin VI splice variants are expressed in Calu-3 and HEK293 cells. Total RNA was isolated using the Purescript RNA Isolation kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN) and DNase treated with DNA-Free (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove contaminating DNA. Two-step RT-PCR was performed using Retroscript Reverse Transcriptase with random hexamers (Ambion) and Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers flanking the tail region containing the 31-amino acid insertion (sense, 5′-AGAAAGGAAGAGGAGGAAAGGCG-3′; and anti-sense, 5′-GGGCGGATGAATG GGATGCGGAAG-3′) were designed using Oligo6.1 Primer Analysis Software (Plymouth, MN) and synthesized by the Dartmouth College Molecular Biology Core Facility. These primers were used to amplify myosin VI isoforms from polarized and nonpolarized Calu-3 and HEK293 cells. The amplified PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1 Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the sequence was verified by ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems).Antibodies—Affinity-purified, polyclonal anti-myosin VI tail domain antibody was used as described previously (43Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The antibodies monoclonal anti-GFP JL-8, polyclonal anti-GFP, monoclonal anti-clathrin heavy chain, and monoclonal anti-p96 Dab2 were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Other antibodies used were monoclonal anti-human CFTR C terminus, clone 24-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), monoclonal anti-CFTR, clone M3A7 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), polyclonal anti-Dab2, clone H-110 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse IgG1 Negative Control (DAKO), rabbit Immunoglubulin Fraction (normal; DAKO), and goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). All purchased antibodies were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—CFTR and myosin VI were immunoprecipitated from Calu-3 and HEK293 cell lysates by methods described previously (54Loffing J.

Briefly, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% IGEPAL (Sigma), and Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min to pellet insoluble material, the soluble lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A or protein G, as appropriate, conjugated to Sepharose beads (Pierce). Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the antibody-protein A or -protein G complexes, as appropriate. Antibody M3A7 was used to immunoprecipitate CFTR. The antibody against the myosin VI tail domain was used to immunoprecipitate myosin VI. The polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate GFP fusion proteins. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein G or protein A-Sepharose complexes, as appropriate, by incubation at 85 °C for 5 min in sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 10% glycerol, and 80 mm dithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an appropriate primary antibody and an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody using the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus detection system (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA).Cell Surface Biotinylation, Endocytic Assay, and Endocytic Recycling Assay—Cell surface biotinylation, endocytic assays, and endocytic recycling assays were performed on HEK293 cells as described previously (55Swiatecka-Urban A.

Subsequently, biotinylated proteins were eluted from the streptavidin beads by a 10-min incubation at room temperature, followed by a 5-min incubation at 85 °C in elution buffer containing 1% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from the biotinylated protein fraction with antibody M3A7 in Calu-3 cells and with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody in transfected HEK293 cells conjugated to protein G- and protein ASepharose beads, respectively. The immunoprecipitated CFTR was eluted from the protein A- and G-Sepharose beads as described above.Fluid-phase Endocytosis—Studies were conducted to determine whether myosin VI affects the cellular uptake of Alexa 647-dextran (10,000 molecular weight; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a fluorescent marker of fluid phase endocytosis (56Lu H. Sun T.X. Bouley R. Blackburn K. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F233-F243Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with CFTR and either GFP-MyoVI-Tail or GFP control and grown on glass coverslips for 48 h. Alexa 647-dextran (1 mg/ml) was added to the cell culture medium (37 °C) for 15 min. Subsequently, surface Alexa-647 dextran was removed by thorough washing at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde before being mounted in antifade medium (ProLong, Molecular Probes). At least 10 random fields of cells expressing CFTR with either GFP (control) or GFP-MyoVI-Tail were examined from six different slides using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope with a ×40 objective. All images were collected using the same setting for laser intensity, pinhole aperture, and photomultiplier gain and offset. Transfected cells expressing CFTR and GFP or GFP-MyoVI-Tail were identified by GFP fluorescence. Alexa 647 fluorescence was quantified using Velocity 2.6.1 Software (Improvision, Lexington, MA).F-Actin Depolymerization—Cytochalasin D, an actin depolymerizing agent (2 μm, Sigma) or vehicle control (0.1% Me2SO) were added to the cell culture medium at 4 °C for 60 min before endocytic assays to depolymerize F-actin.To determine whether cytochalasin D affected actin polymerization, cell attachment, or cell morphology, HEK293 cells stably expressing CFTR were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h and treated with cytochalasin D or vehicle as described above. After washing, cells were fixed at room temperature for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 4 min with Triton X-100 (0.1%). After being washed in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated for 30 min with Alexa-647 phalloidin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). Thereafter, cells were washed in PBS and mounted in antifade medium (ProLong, Molecular Probes). Samples were observed with an Olympus 1X70 light microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu ORCA 12-bit digital output CCD camera controlled by Openlab 3.5.1 Software (Improvision). In addition, DIC images of fixed cells were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope. The effects of cytochalasin D on fluid-phase endocytosis were monitored by measuring the uptake of Alexa-647 dextran, as described above. Ten random fields were examined from three different slides"

The molecular mechanisms that link the γ-secretase multicomponent amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing complex to biochemical properties of BACE generating the N terminus of the amyloid β-peptide have not, as yet, been identified. We found that in human brain tissue, BACE occurred as a dimer. The overall stability of the BACE homodimer was based on intermolecular interactions that were not affected by high salt, nonionic detergents or reducing conditions. BACE homodimers could only partially be separated even under strong denaturing conditions and revealed dramatic differences in the surface charge distribution compared with the monomer. In contrast, the soluble ectodomain of truncated BACE revealed a seemingly lower avidity to the prototypic aspartate protease inhibitor pepstatin and exclusively occurred in the monomeric form. Immunocytochemical studies colocalized APP and BACE in the plasma membrane of cells expressing endogenous levels of BACE and overexpressing APP. In cells that were cotransfected with APP and a putative active site D289A mutant of BACE, colocalization persisted. Remaining enzyme activity was found to be attributable to the mutant protease. Accordingly, inactivation of the carboxyl-terminal active site motif of BACE without an impairment of overall enzyme activity suggests that the enzyme may act as a dimer. Thus, homodimerization of BACE may help the enzyme to acquire specific mechanisms to associate with its substrates to exert catalytic activity. β-Site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is a membrane-bound aspartyl protease with no strict primary preference for cleavage.

A possible explanation is that truncated recombinant BACE has a loose substrate specificity and displays poor kinetic constants toward its known substrates as shown for APP wild-type and APP Swedish (35Grüninger-Leitch F.

BACE as part of a multiprotein complex could be more active than the soluble monomer, and oligomerization may play a critical role for enzyme-substrate interactions. Here, we report a novel possible mechanism for the regulation of BACE activity including dimerization in vivo, colocalization of BACE with APP and a functional elucidation of the BACE active sites. Inactivation of one-half of the enzyme by mutating one of the active sites reveals that the enzyme may act as a dimer, which will be critical for future drug design. Characterization of Native BACE from Human Brain and of Soluble BACE—Human brain tissue was obtained from the German Brain Bank “Brain-Net.” Human post-mortem brain tissue samples were homogenized with five volumes of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% Nonidet P-40, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete tablets; Protease Inhibitors Technical Guide; Roche Applied Science). Aliquots of the homogenate were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE or used to enrich BACE by column chromatography. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was applied onto a column of Q-Sepharose (column size HR10/10, FPLC; Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, without protease inhibitors). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A to buffer B (800 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) within 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Likewise, the conditioned medium from transfected HEK293 cells expressing the truncated BACE-NT derivative generated by inserting stop codons after amino acid 454 (32Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M.

Eluted fractions were analyzed for BACE content by Western blotting using the polyclonal C-terminal BACE GM168 for human BACE or monoclonal BSC-1 (35Grüninger-Leitch F. Schlatter D. Kung E. Nelbock P. Dobeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4687-4693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) for truncated BACE-NT as primary antibodies. BACE Expression Constructs—A full-length BACE construct in pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) was generated by PCR to add an EcoRI at the 5′-end and a XhoI site at the 3′-end. The forward primer used was B1-fwd (5′-GCGCGAATTCATGGCCCAAGCCCTGCCCT-3′), and the reverse primer was B1-rev (5′-CGCGCTCGAGTCACTTCAGCAGGGAGATGT-3′), respectively. Site directed mutagenesis of BACED289A mutant was performed by PCR using a mismatch forward primer (5′-GACAAGAGCATTGTGGCCAGTGGCACCACC-3′) and a T7 standard reverse primer. In a second amplification step, the generated “megaprimer” was used with the T3 standard primer on the same template. The second PCR product and pBluescript vector were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then ligated. The generated constructs were digested with NotI and XhoI, and the BACE encoding region was ligated with expression vector pCDNA3.1/zeo(+). The truncated BACE construct (BACE-NT) for transfection of SH-SY5Y cells was generated by using the reverse primer (5′-GGATATCGCGGCCGCCTAGACATAGGCTATGGTCATGAGGGTTGACTCATC-3′). PCR was performed together with BACE forward primer B1-fwd and full-length pBluescript BACE as template. The PCR product and pCDNA3.1/zeo(+) BACE were digested with EcoRI and NotI and then ligated. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC number: CRL-2266) were stably transfected with pCEP4/c-Myc-tagged APP695 or pCEP4 using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 4 μg of vector in 50% confluent 10-cm dishes. Medium was replaced after 24 h, and transfectants were selected using 200 μg/ml hygromycin or hygromycin and Zeocin-selective medium after 48 h. Stably transfected cells were subjected to cotransfection with pCDNA3.1/zeo(+) BACE and BACE-D289A with LipofectAMINE plus as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Conditioned media from cotransfected SH-SY5Y cells (APP·BACE wild type and APP·BACED298A) were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with 3 μl/ml polyclonal antibody 879 (Norvatis) and Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After a 4-h incubation at room temperature with continuous end-over-end rotation, samples were centrifuged and repeatedly washed, and the precipitate was denatured and then subjected to 8% Tris/glycine PAGE (Anamed). After separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes utilizing a tank blot system (Bio-Rad). Filters were incubated with the monoclonal antibody 22C11 and the goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega), and bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were quantified by measuring the relative optical densities and areas of the corresponding bands using a computerized image analysis system (AlphaEase FC Software Version 3.2.1; Alpha Innotech Corp.). Affinity Chromatography—BACE-containing fractions from Q-Sepharose were pooled and buffer-exchanged into 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm MnCl2 by 1:5 dilution with PBS. Lentil lectin-Sepharose (Sigma) was added and gently mixed by end-over-end rotation for at least 4 h. The lectin-Sepharose was repeatedly washed with 1× PBS and eluted with 150 mm NaCl; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; methyl-α-glucopyranoside, methyl-α-mannopyranoside, N-acetylglucosamine, d-galactose (500 mm each); and 50 mm EDTA. Fractions eluting from the Q-Sepharose or the lectin column were directly applied to an affinity column of pepstatin A-agarose (Sigma). The affinity column was repeatedly washed with 1× PBS and eluted with free pepstatin (88% purity grade, 0.5 mg/ml in 50% methanol/PBS) or by 70% acetic acid. Alternatively, Q-Sepharose fractions were applied to heparin-Sepharose (Sigma) and eluted with 300-700 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Anti-BACE Antibodies—A peptide corresponding to the pro-segment of BACE (amino acids 22-45) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as antigen for production of the rabbit polyclonal antibody GM190 (32Capell A.

Other peptides derived from the protease domain of BACE (amino acids 64-100, 106-139, and 279-318) and from the C-terminal domain (amino acids 482-501) were directly used as antigens for the generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies including GM168. The mouse monoclonal antibody BSC-1 directed against the ectodomain of BACE (35Grüninger-Leitch F. Schlatter D. Kung E. Nelbock P. Dobeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4687-4693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. M. Brockhaus, and the polyclonal 879 was from Novartis. The mAb 5308 was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The epitope is the last 21 amino acids of the C terminus of rat BACE and shows no reactivity to BACE-2 by Western blot analysis (Chemicon). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—BACE was analyzed after QSepharose and size exclusion chromatography on isoelectric focusing gels with an immobile pH gradient (pH 3-10, 13 cm, IPGphor Isoelectric Focusing System; Amersham Biosciences). Protein was resuspended in 125 μl of isoelectric focusing sample buffer containing 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% (w/v) Chaps, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris base, 2% (v/v) Pharmalyte, pH 3-10, and 2 mm Pefabloc SC. The isoelectric focusing was carried out as described (36Regula J.T. Ueberle B. Boguth G. Gorg A. Schnolzer M. Herrmann R. Frank R. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3765-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Prior to SDS gel electrophoresis, the strips (gels) were incubated in a solution of 90 mm dithiothreitol, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerine, 2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, for 10 min and subsequently in a solution of 260 mm iodoacetamide in the same buffer for 10 min. SDS-PAGE was performed in 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The second dimension was run until the bromphenol blue front reached the end of the gel. Gels were subjected to Western blotting with GM168. Electron Microscopic Immunolocalization—COS-7 cells were stably transfected with c-Myc-tagged APP695 and grown on glass coverslips to 70-90% confluence. Coverslips were rinsed in PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C, and cells were fixed for 30 min in 2.0% freshly prepared formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, dipped into PBS, and washed twice for 5 min with PBS, containing 50 mm ammonium chloride. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (polyclonal antibody 40090 raised against APP homodimers was diluted 1:100 in PBS) for 4-6 h at room temperature and were incubated after three washes with PBS with the respective secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to 5-nm gold particles to detect APP. For double labeling of ectopically expressed APP and endogenous BACE (recognized by monoclonal antibody BSC-1 diluted to 100 μg/ml), a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to 10-nm gold particles was used. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:3 in PBS and incubated overnight at RT. After three washes in PBS, cells were fixed for electron microscopy in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (0.05% sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2) for 10 min at 4 °C followed by 30 min in 2% OsO4. Dehydration, embedding, thin sectioning, and staining were performed as described (37Kartenbeck J. Schmid E. Muller H. Franke W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 133: 191-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken with a Zeiss EM 10A electron microscope. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—Cells were treated and fixed as described for electron microscopy and incubated with the first antibody for 1h at room temperature using the following dilutions of primary antibodies in PBS: 1:100 for 40090 and 100 μg/ml for mAb 5308. After three washes with PBS, COS-7 cells were incubated for 1 h with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Dianova) at a dilution of 1:20 in PBS or the goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy3 (Dianova) in PBS. SY5Y cells incubation was performed with goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy2 (Dianova) and goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Cy3, each diluted 1:400. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide added to the diluted secondary antibodies. Coverslips were rinsed in PBS three times, followed by rinsing in double distilled water and 100% ethanol and were mounted with fluoromount. Immunofluorescence was performed by confocal laser scanning with a Leica DM IRBE or a Leica DM IRB apparatus for the standard technique. BACE Is a Dimer in Human Brain—BACE defines a novel family of aspartic acid proteases by possessing a carboxyl-terminal and a transmembrane domain. These carboxyl-terminal extensions are absent in single chain eukaryotic aspartic proteases. To study the significance of the extra domains, the expression pattern of endogenous BACE on the protein level was analyzed under in vivo conditions. We used a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of BACE. This antibody was specific for BACE as characterized by Western blotting. Human brain specimens were homogenized using a combination of detergent extraction and Dounce homogenization. Immunoblotting analyses of the 10,000 × g supernatant fraction (containing the detergent-soluble extract) and of the 10,000 × g pellet (containing the detergent-insoluble extracts) were performed with C-terminal or pro-peptide domain-specific BACE antibodies. Western blot analysis revealed the appearance of two polypeptides, each migrating as doublets of ∼135 and ∼120 kDa in the soluble extract and an additional band of ∼110 kDa, which was exclusively found in the pellet (Fig. 1A). The well characterized antibody GM190 to the pro-peptide domain of BACE detected the same bands of ∼135 and ∼110 kDa but was unable to recognize the ∼120-kDa form, which accordingly corresponds to an oligomeric BACE complex lacking the pro-peptide domain (Fig. 1A). This indicates that BACE already dimerizes before maturation and pro-peptide cleavage. The majority of BACE accumulated in the pellet with an apparent molecular mass of ∼110 kDa, a molecular weight corresponding to the dimeric unmodified molecule from the endoplasmic reticulum (32Capell A.

In addition to the oligomeric forms of BACE, we also consistently found smaller amounts of a ∼65-kDa polypeptide in the 10,000 × g supernatant, representing the monomeric form of holo-BACE (Fig. 1A). Notably, the level of this form was highest in the soluble extract. In the presence of reducing agent, BACE migrated as the characteristic doublet band (38Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The presence of SDS-stable dimers of BACE was also analyzed within the crude homogenate of various regions of human brain (Fig. 1B). In the different brain regions analyzed, the majority of BACE immunoreactivity is found in Alzheimer's disease-vulnerable regions, such as the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, and hippocampus. A much lower portion was observed in nonvulnerable regions, such as rostral pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum. This finding suggests that the enzyme is the crucial factor for Aβ production independent of the supply of substrate. This is in agreement with increasing BACE activity levels with aging in the brain of different species that were suggested to be due to age-related posttranslational changes, an allosteric modulation of BACE activity (39Fukumoto H. Rosene D.L. Moss M.B. Raju S. Hyman B.T. Irizarry M.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), or to the formation of a high complex of BACE that is more active than the monomer (31Marlow L. Cain M. Pappolla M.A. Sambamurti K. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Characterization of BACE from Human Brain Tissue—To achieve an enrichment of BACE and a separation of monomers and putative dimers, Q-Sepharose chromatography was performed (Fig. 2A). The pattern of BACE from human tissue separated by anion exchange chromatography showed immunoreactivity in an ascending salt gradient between 550 and 800 mm NaCl (Fig. 2A). Smaller species started to elute first together with the monomer migrating uniquely as a ∼62-kDa band and the dimer as a ∼120-kDa band. Separation of monomeric and dimeric BACE was achieved by a gradient elution at high salt (Fig. 2A), whereas monomers and dimers as well as initially co-fractionated dimers could be separated without showing any dissociation of subunits during purification at high salt concentrations.

In vivo, 90% of ADP-ribose polymers are attached to the automodification domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), the main enzyme catalyzing this modification reaction. This enzyme forms complexes with transcription initiation, DNA replication, and DNA repair factors. In most known cases, the interactions occur through the automodification domain. However, functional implications of the automodification reaction on these interactions have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we created fluorescent protein-tagged PARP-1 to study this enzyme in live cells and focused on the interaction between PARP-1 and topoisomerase I (Topo I), one of the enzymes that interacts with PARP-1 in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that PARP-1 co-localizes with Topo I throughout the cell cycle. Results from bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays suggest that the co-localization is because of a direct protein-protein interaction. In response to DNA damage, PARP-1 de-localization and a reduction in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer signal because of the automodification reaction are observed, suggesting that the automodification reaction results in the disruption of the interaction between PARP-1 and Topo I. Because Topo I activity has been reported to be promoted by PARP-1, we then investigated the effect of the disruption of this interaction on Topo I activity, and we found that this disruption results in the reduction of Topo I activity. These results suggest that a function for the automodification reaction is to regulate the interaction between PARP-1 and Topo I, and consequently, the Topo I activity, in response to DNA damage.

Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, when PARP-1 is automodified, the affinity of the zinc fingers of PARP-1 for DNA breaks is reduced by the negative charges of the polymers attached to the automodification domain, leading to the dissociation of PARP-1 from DNA breaks (13Zahradka P. Ebisuzaki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). During the 1980s, PARP-1 was considered a DNA repair enzyme (2Cleaver J.E. Morgan W.F. Mutat. Res. 1991; 257: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that PARP-1 itself has enzymatic activity to repair DNA breaks, as breaks can be efficiently repaired in the absence of PARP-1 (3Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 14Vodenicharov M.D. Sallmann F.R. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6186-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recent models suggest that the ADP-ribose polymers have a function in recruiting DNA repair enzymes to DNA damages (18Caldecott K.W. Cell. 2003; 112: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Leppard J.B. Dong Z. Mackey Z.B. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5919-5927Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We have also recently proposed an alternative model in which PARP-1 automodification plays a role in transcription regulation at the level of elongation, because the zinc finger motifs of PARP-1 can bind to RNA with high affinity, leading to negative regulation of RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase II, and, following PARP-1 automodification, the binding affinity of the zinc fingers for RNA is reduced, resulting in up-regulation of transcription (20Vispe S.

In addition to these studies, which focused on poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, accumulated evidence in recent years suggest that PARP-1 has roles in these various fundamental cellular processes through interaction with other factors and enzymes. For example, PARP-1 has been reported to form complexes with transcription initiation factors, including Oct-1 (21Nie J. Sakamoto S. Song D. Qu Z. Ota K. Taniguchi T.

In addition, co-expression of PARP-1 with B-MYB or NF-κB leads to increased transcription levels of specific genes (23Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol.

Thus, PARP-1 has been proposed to be a factor involved in regulating transcription initiation (33Kraus W.L. Lis J.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 677-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The role of PARP-1 in DNA replication has also been proposed mainly based on the observation that PARP-1 can be co-purified with DNA polymerase α (34Yoshida S. Simbulan C.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Dantzer F. Nasheuer H.P. Vonesch J.L. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1891-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Other lines of evidence suggest that PARP-1 plays a role in DNA repair through interaction with XRCC-1 (36Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 37Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8601-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Finally, PARP-1 has been reported to bind to topoisomerase I (Topo I) (39Jongstra-Bilen J. Ittel M.E. Niedergang C. Vosberg H.P. Mandel P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Bauer P.I. Chen H.J. Kenesi E. Kenessey I. Buki K.G. Kirsten E. Hakam A. Hwang J.I. Kun E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is an enzyme required for DNA replication and transcription (41Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 42Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that PARP-1 is an enzyme playing roles in transcription initiation, DNA replication, and DNA repair through interaction with several different factors and enzymes. Interestingly, in some cases, the interacting domain of PARP-1 with these factors and enzymes has been identified; the interactions between PARP-1 and XRCC-1 (37Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), NF-κB (25Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 240: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and Topo I (40Bauer P.I. Chen H.J. Kenesi E. Kenessey I. Buki K.G. Kirsten E. Hakam A. Hwang J.I. Kun E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) occur through the automodification domain of PARP-1. Thus, ADP-ribose polymer formation on the automodification domain is likely to have an effect on the interactions between PARP-1 and these factors and enzymes. In fact, Chang and Alvarez-Gonzalez (26Chang W.J. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47664-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) suggested, using a gel retardation assay, that the interaction between NF-κB and PARP-1 can be disrupted by automodification of PARP-1 in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, von Kobbe et al. (38von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. May A. Opresko P.L. Dawut L. Cheng W.H. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8601-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) recently reported that automodified PARP-1 cannot bind to the Werner syndrome protein in vitro. As disruption of the interaction between PARP-1 and these various factors and enzymes likely has an effect on transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair, automodification may play critical roles in the regulation of these processes in response to DNA damage. However, little is known about the effect of PARP-1 automodification on the interactions between PARP-1 and these various factors and enzymes. To obtain a better understanding of the functional roles of the interactions between PARP-1 and these other factors and enzymes, we have created fluorescent protein-tagged PARP-1 to study PARP-1 in live cells. As a factor that interacts with PARP-1, we focused on Topo I, because: 1) Topo I is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is present at similar amounts as PARP-1 in vivo (43Vosberg H.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 114: 19-102PubMed Google Scholar, 44Yamanaka H. Penning C.A. Willis E.H. Wasson D.B. Carson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3879-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2) Topo I has been reported to interact with the automodification domain of PARP-1 in vitro (40Bauer P.I. Chen H.J. Kenesi E. Kenessey I. Buki K.G. Kirsten E. Hakam A. Hwang J.I. Kun E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); 3) Topo I is involved in both DNA replication and transcription, both at the level of initiation and elongation (42Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 45Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar); and 4) Topo I activity is known to be promoted by PARP-1 in vitro (46Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Comstock J.A. Kun E. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 533-540PubMed Google Scholar), which allows us to investigate the effect of disrupting the PARP-1-Topo I interaction on the activity of Topo I. Thus, we have also constructed fluorescent protein-tagged Topo I and carried out co-expression experiments using live cells. Here we demonstrate that PARP-1 co-localizes with Topo I in the nucleus and that this co-localization is maintained throughout the cell cycle. To confirm that the co-localization is, in fact, because of direct protein-protein interactions, the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay was employed, and results suggest that PARP-1 directly interacts with Topo I in vivo. These results demonstrate that Topo I is one of the enzymes that indeed interacts with PARP-1 in vivo. Interestingly, in G1 phase cells, PARP-1 and Topo I were localized in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli, whereas both enzymes were concentrated into S-phase foci during the S phase. As Topo I is an enzyme required for both transcription and DNA replication, results from these co-localization experiments suggest that PARP-1 indeed has functions in both transcription and DNA replication. In response to DNA damage, PARP-1 de-localization because of PARP-1 automodification was observed. BRET signal was also reduced by the automodification, suggesting that PARP-1 automodification results in the disruption of the interaction between PARP-1 and Topo I. Because Topo I activity is reported to be promoted by addition of PARP-1 into DNA supercoil relaxation assays (46Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Comstock J.A. Kun E. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 533-540PubMed Google Scholar), we then investigated the effect of disrupting the PARP-1-Topo I interaction on Topo I activity, and we found that the disruption results in a reduction in Topo I activity as compared with Topo I activity measured under conditions allowing the PARP-1-Topo I interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that PARP-1 automodification has a function to regulate the interaction between PARP-1 and Topo I and, consequently, the Topo I activity, in response to DNA damage. Plasmid Constructs—pET32a-PARP-1-His and pET3228d-His-PCNA, expression constructs for a C-terminal histidine-tagged PARP-1 and a N-terminal histidine-tagged proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), respectively, were provided by Dr. Y. Matsumoto. Expression constructs of the 24- (pET32a-24 kDa-His), and the 89-kDa (pET32a-89 kDa-His) PARP-1 fragments were prepared using PCR to amplify the sequences corresponding to Met1–Asp214, and Gly215–Trp1014, respectively. These fragments were then cloned into pET32a. The Renilla luciferase (RLuc) gene was amplified by PCR from pRL-SV40 (Promega). To construct pRLuc-N1, the yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) gene of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) was replaced with the RLuc gene. The RLuc gene was also cloned into the multiple cloning site of pEYFP-N1 to obtain the BRET positive control plasmid. pDsRed-N1 was prepared by replacing the EYFP gene of pEYFP-N1 with the red fluorescent protein (DsRed) gene, which was excised from pDsRed 1-1 (Clontech). The PARP-1 gene was excised from pET32a-PARP-1-His and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pEYFP-N1 and pDsRed-N1 to construct pPARP-1-EYFP and pPARP-1-DsRed, respectively. Similarly, p24 kDa-DsRed and p89 kDa-EYFP were constructed using pET32a-24 kDa-His and pET32a-89 kDa-His, respectively. The cDNA of human PCNA was PCR amplified from pET3228d-His-PCNA and cloned into pEYFP-N1 to obtain pPCNA-EYFP. The cDNA of human Topo I (kindly provided by Dr. L. Liu) was PCR amplified and cloned into pRLuc-N1, pEYFP-N1, and pDsRed-N1 to obtain pTopo I-RLuc, pTopo I-EYFP, and pTopo I-DsRed, respectively. Antibodies, Enzymes, Cells, and Recombinant Proteins—Anti-PARP-1 antibodies, C-II-10 (automodification domain) and F1–23 (second zinc finger), anti-ADP-ribose polymer antibody, LP-96-10, and poly- (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase were obtained from G. G. Poirier. Anti-Topo I antibody (Sarcoma sera) and purified human Topo I were purchased from TopoGen. Recombinant Topo I was obtained from Sigma. GMO6315A cells were purchased from the NIGMS Human Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Analysis of PARP-1 and Topo I by Western Blotting—COS-7 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 1.6 μg of pPARP-1-EYFP, pPARP-1-DsRed, pTopo I-EYFP, or pTopo I-RLuc, each mixed with 2.4 μg of pMACS KK.II (a mouse H-2KK expression construct) using Effectene (Qiagen). After 48 h, transfected cells co-expressing mouse H-2KK were purified by colloidal superparamagnetic microbeads (MACSelect KK MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec)) (47Ho E.L. Satoh M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7032-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 48Vispe S. Ho E.L. Yung T.M. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35279-35285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These purified cells were used for Western blotting with C-II-10, anti-Topo I, or anti-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)/EYFP (Clontech) antibodies. Alternatively, extracts were prepared from these cells and used for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation assays. Cell Extract Preparation—Cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and an anti-protease mixture. In certain samples, 10 mm EDTA and 50 μm ADP-dihydroxypyrollidine (Calbiochem) were included. After freeze-thawing, cellular debris was spun down and the supernatant was used for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and DNA supercoil relaxation assays. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation Assay—Cell extracts (2 μg/ml) were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl (EX Buffer), containing 1 μg/ml ΦX174 DNA-HaeIII digest, 32 nm NAD+, and 10 μCi/ml [32P]NAD+, in the presence or absence of 250 μm NAD+, for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were fractionated on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel. 32P activity was visualized by autoradiography. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded in Delta T4 Culture Dishes (Bioptechs) or on 40-mm round coverslips (Bioptechs). pPARP-1-DsRed (1.5 μg/ml) and pTopo I-EYFP (0.5 μg/ml) were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate method. In some cases, pPARP-1-DsRed or pPARP-1-EYFP (2 μg/ml) alone, pPARP-1-DsRed (1.9 μg/ml) and pPCNA-EYFP (0.1 μg/ml), p89 kDa-EYFP (1.0 μg/ml), and p24 kDa-DsRed (1.0 μg/ml), or pPARP-1-EYFP (0.5 μg/ml) and pTopo I-DsRed (1.5 μg/ml) were transfected instead. The cells were cultured for another 48 h. For live cell analyses of less than 2 h, the Delta T4 Culture Dishes were mounted onto the stage of an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a Delta T4 Culture Dish Controller (Bioptechs) and kept at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium, in the presence or absence of 500 μm 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinilone (DHQ). Then, 100 μmN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was added to the dish. Images acquired through a ×60 1.4 NA objective were captured by the FLUOVIEW FV300 confocal scanning unit (Olympus). For multiple-channel imaging, fluorescence from each channel was imaged sequentially to eliminate cross-talk between channels. EYFP fluorescent protein was exited with a 488-nm argon-ion laser line and the fluorescence was imaged using a 570-nm beamsplitter and the combination of a 510–530-nm band pass emission filter and 510-nm long pass emission filter. DsRed fluorescent protein was exited with a 543-nm helium-neon laser line and the fluorescence was imaged using a 570-nm beamsplitter and a 575–630-nm band pass emission filter. In this configuration, cross-talk between EYFP and DsRed was below detectable limits (see Fig. 2F, co-expression experiments with 24- and 89-kDa PARP-1 fragments tagged with DsRed (24 kDa-DsRed) and EYFP (89 kDa-EYFP), respectively). To minimize toxicity potentially introduced by laser lines, the output from argon and helium-neon lasers was attenuated to 10 and 40%, respectively. Excitation of fluorophores by laser could produce reactive oxygen species, which could induce DNA damage. However, the localization of both PARP-1 and Topo I was not affected by laser scanning itself, under similar experimental conditions and scanning frequencies that we used (data not shown). Green, red, and merged color images were created by FLUOVIEW 300 version 3.3 software (Olympus). Then, color contrasts were adjusted using the Photoshop version 6.0 software. For live-cell analyses of up to 24 h and for cell cycle phase determination, the 40-mm coverslips were assembled into an FCS2 live cell chamber (Bioptechs), in which complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was constantly replenished at a flow rate of 1 ml/h and kept at 37 °C by an FCS2 controller (Bioptechs). Mitotic or G1 cells were selected and images were captured at various time points and processed as described above. To reduce phototoxicity, minimal laser intensities, image capture times, and image resolution were used for this analysis. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Escherichia coli HMS174 (DE3) pLys-S (Novagen) was transformed with pET32a-PARP-1-His, pET32a-24 kDa-His, or pET32a-89 kDa-His. Expression of recombinant histidine-tagged human PARP-1 (PARP-1-His), 24-, or 89-kDa fragment was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After sonicating the E. coli, the proteins were purified by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography (Qiagen) (47Ho E.L. Satoh M.S.

Preparation of Automodified PARP-1—Automodified PARP-1-His was prepared following a method described previously (20Vispe S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H. Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, PARP-1-His was applied to double-strand DNA cellulose resin. PARP-1-His that was retained on the resin was incubated with EX Buffer containing 250 μm NAD+, respectively. Automodified PARP-1-His, released from the resin, was used for assays. To prepare 32P-labeled PARP-1-His and 32P-labeled automodified PARP-1-His, PARP-1-His that was retained on the resin was incubated with EX Buffer containing 32 nm NAD+ and 250 μCi/ml [32P]NAD+. 32P-Labeled PARP-1-His was eluted with EX Buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Alternatively, the resin was incubated with EX Buffer containing 250 μm NAD+ to prepare 32P-labeled automodified PARP-1-His. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa S3 cell extracts (30 μg of protein) containing 10 mm EDTA and 50 μm ADP-dihydroxypyrollidine were mixed with either anti-Topo I antibody (100-fold dilution) or non-immune sera for 1 h on ice in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 50 μm ADP-dihydroxypyrollidine, and an anti-protease mixture (IP buffer). Alternatively, purified 89-kDa fragment (300 ng) was mixed with various amounts of Topo I in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 30 min, and the mixture was incubated with anti-Topo I antibody (100-fold dilution) for 1 h on ice. Protein-G-Sepharose (5 μl) was added to the mixtures containing the cell extracts or purified proteins and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the protein G-Sepharose with 100 μl of IP buffer, protein retained on the resin was analyzed by Western blotting with C-II-10, F1–23, or anti-Topo I antibodies. PARP-1-Topo I Interaction Assay—Topo I (10 units) was mixed with 2 μg of 32P-labeled PARP-1-His or 32P-labeled automodified PARP-1-His in a 100-μl mixture containing 5 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose resin in EX Buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was spun down, washed with EX Buffer (10 volumes), and resuspended in 25 μl of EX Buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluates were loaded onto SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gels. 32P-Labeled PARP-1 and 32P-labeled automodified PARP-1 were visualized by autoradiography. Topo I was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Topo I antibody. BRET Assays—The donor construct (pRLuc-N1 or pTopo I-RLuc, 0.5 μg/ml) and acc"
https://openalex.org/W2016542899,"Plasmin is a major extracellular protease that elicits intracellular signals to mediate platelet aggregation, chemotaxis of peripheral blood monocytes, and release of arachidonate and leukotriene from several cell types in a G protein-dependent manner. Angiostatin, a fragment of plasmin(ogen), is a ligand and an antagonist for integrin α9β1. Here we report that plasmin specifically interacts with α9β1 and that plasmin induces of cells expressing migration recombinant α9β1 (α9-Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells). Migration was dependent on an interaction of the kringle domains of plasmin with α9β1 as well as the catalytic activity of plasmin. Angiostatin, representing the kringle domains of plasmin, alone did not induce the migration of α9-CHO cells, but simultaneous activation of the G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 with an agonist peptide induced the migration on angiostatin, whereas PAR-2 or PAR-4 agonist peptides were without effect. Furthermore, a small chemical inhibitor of PAR-1 (RWJ 58259) and a palmitoylated PAR-1-blocking peptide inhibited plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells. These results suggest that plasmin induces migration by kringle-mediated binding to α9β1 and simultaneous proteolytic activation of PAR-1.

Angiostatin, representing the kringle domains of plasmin, alone did not induce the migration of α9-CHO cells, but simultaneous activation of the G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 with an agonist peptide induced the migration on angiostatin, whereas PAR-2 or PAR-4 agonist peptides were without effect. Furthermore, a small chemical inhibitor of PAR-1 (RWJ 58259) and a palmitoylated PAR-1-blocking peptide inhibited plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells. These results suggest that plasmin induces migration by kringle-mediated binding to α9β1 and simultaneous proteolytic activation of PAR-1. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors that regulate many critical cellular processes including cell migration, adhesion, signal transduction, and gene expression. By controlling such cellular behaviors, they play a role in mediating important biological functions such as embryonic development, differentiation, and wound healing as well as pathological processes such as inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumor progression. Integrin α9β1 is constitutively expressed in liver and smooth and skeletal muscles as well as in squamous and airway epithelium (1Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Its role in activated neutrophils may involve binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule on endothelial cells resulting in chemotaxis across endothelial monolayers by interaction with vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 during inflammation (5Taooka Y.

Med. 2000; 10: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). α9β1 recognizes many other ligands such as tenascin-C (7Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R.

Thus, this integrin may potentially play a crucial role in inflammatory responses and metastasis as well as during development and wound healing. Some coagulation cascade proteases play a role in wound healing, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and metastasis, both by extracellular matrix degradation and by regulating cell migration and proliferation (11Carmeliet P. Collen D. Thromb. Res. 1998; 91: 255-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). One such protease, plasmin, is generated from its precursor plasminogen. Plasminogen is first converted to the two-chain serine protease plasmin by the cleavage of a single Arg561-Val562 peptide bond by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAR, protease-activated receptor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; pal, palmitoylated inhibitory peptide for PAR. and plasmin serves as both the substrate and enzyme for the generation of angiostatin (12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Angiostatin contains either the first three or first four kringle domains of plasminogen (13O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y.

Biol. 1998; 20: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After plasminogen is cleaved by uPA, the kringle domain of plasmin is still attached to the catalytic domain by interchain-disulfide linkage. It has been demonstrated in various systems that plasmin can activate signaling leading to protein phosphorylation, Ca2+ mobilization, and activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C (15Chang W.C. Shi G.Y. Chow Y.H. Chang L.C. Hau J.S. Lin M.T. Jen C.J. Wing L.Y. Wu H.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C271-C281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schafer A.I. Adelman B. J. Clin.

Plasmin has been shown to increase arachidonate release in bovine artery endothelial cells and to trigger leukotriene B4 release in peripheral monocytes in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (15Chang W.C. Shi G.Y. Chow Y.H. Chang L.C. Hau J.S. Lin M.T. Jen C.J. Wing L.Y. Wu H.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C271-C281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weide I. Tippler B. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A few recent reports suggest that plasmin can induce cell migration, e.g. in human peripheral blood monocytes, and other processes important in angiogenesis (19Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is known regarding the mechanisms and molecules participating in plasmin signaling. Recent studies suggest that plasmin may also mediate its effects through activation of a G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling pathway (20Kimura M. Andersen T.T. Fenton II, J.W. Bahou W.F. Aviv A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C54-C60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This is supported by the fact that some effects of plasmin are sensitive to pertussis toxin, which inhibits Gi/o family proteins, suggesting the involvement of such a G protein (15Chang W.C. Shi G.Y.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction mechanism downstream of plasmin activation remains largely unknown. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by N-terminal cleavage to expose a tethered ligand (23Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar, 24Kahn M.L. Hammes S.R. Botka C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23290-23296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors are known to induce stimulation of heterotrimeric G proteins and can regulate various signaling cascades leading to cellular responses such as gene expression, mitogenesis, and cell motility. Thrombin, the major protease in the coagulation cascade, elicits its responses through activation of PARs. PAR-1 (thrombin receptor) and PAR-4 are expressed on human platelets, and their activation mediates platelet aggregation and plays a role in hemostasis and thrombosis. PARs also have been shown to play a role in cell invasion during breast carcinoma metastasis and placental implantation (25Even-Ram S. Uziely B. Cohen P. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Reich R. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The role of PARs in metastasis and invasion relies on its ability to regulate chemotaxis, mitogenesis, and adhesion by PAR-1 signaling in a αvβ5-dependent manner (26Even-Ram S.C. Maoz M. Pokroy E. Reich R. Katz B.Z. Gutwein P. Altevogt P. Bar-Shavit R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that plasmin may signal through PAR-1 (22Pendurthi U.R. Ngyuen M. Andrade-Gordon P. Petersen L.C. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is somewhat surprising that PAR-1, which is an ideal substrate for thrombin, also serves as the signaling receptor for plasmin that has very different substrate specificity. However, the concept is emerging that co-receptors play important roles in regulating the activation of PARs. PAR-1 has been shown to be activated efficiently by receptor-targeted proteases in the initiation of coagulation (by the tissue factor-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex) (27Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and of the anticoagulant pathway (by activated protein C bound to the endothelial cell protein C receptor) (28Riewald M. Kravchenko V.V. Petrovan R.J. O'Brien P.J. Brass L.F. Ulevitch R.J. Ruf W. Blood. 2001; 97: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Whether integrins play similar roles as co-receptors in plasmin signaling through PARs has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrate that plasmin, a serine protease and the parent molecule of angiostatin, specifically binds to integrin α9β1 through its kringle domains to induce signaling. The pro-migratory activity of plasmin requires α9β1 and the catalytic activity of plasmin. We show that PAR-1 is involved in plasmin-induced cell migration using PAR agonist peptides and small molecule PAR-1 inhibitors. Thus, both α9β1 and PAR-1 are critical for plasmin-induced cell migration. Materials—GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were purchased from Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY). Human plasmin, ϵ-aminocaproic acid, purified mouse IgG, aprotinin, and fibronectin were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) KH72 (anti-integrin α5) was provided by K. Miyake (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). Y9A2 (anti-integrin α9) (2Wang A. Yokosaki Y. Ferrando R. Balmes J. Sheppard D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was provided by D. Sheppard (University of California, San Francisco, CA). P1F6 (anti-αvβ5) was a kind gift from D. Cheresh (The Scripps Research Institute). Angiostatin (K1–3), human Glu-plasminogen, and mAb 51 were kindly provided by L. Miles (The Scripps Research Institute). mAb 51 reacts with plasminogen K1–3 and plasminogen K4 (29Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The PAR-1 inhibitor RWJ58259 was kindly provided by P. Andrade-Gordon (Johnson & Johnson). Cells—D. Sheppard kindly provided Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human α9β1 (designated α9-CHO cells). As a control, CHO cells were transfected only with vector (pBJ-1) together with the neomycin gene and selected for G418 resistance (designated mock-CHO cells). Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were performed as previously described (30Tarui T. Majumdar M. Miles L.A. Ruf W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33564-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We coated wells in 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing substrates at a concentration of 50–500 nm and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. We blocked the remaining protein-binding sites by incubating with 0.2% BSA (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.02% BSA) supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h unless stated otherwise. After non-bound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with the same buffer, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity (32Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For inhibition assays, cells were preincubated with mAbs and peptides on ice for 10 min before cells were added to plasmin-coated wells. Migration Assays—Cell migration was analyzed using tissue culture-treated 24-well Transwell plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with polycarbonate membranes of a pore size of 8 μm. The lower side of the filter was coated with various concentrations of substrates and blocked with 0.5% BSA. Coated filters were placed into serum-free migration buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mm Hepes, 0.5% BSA, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin), and cells (100 μl) suspended in the same buffer (2 × 105 cells/ml) were added to the upper chamber. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 h. Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by gently wiping with a cotton swab, and cells that migrated to the lower surface of the filters were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 2% ethanol and counted using high magnification microscopy. The result is the mean cell number of four randomly selected, high magnification microscopic fields from duplicate wells in two or three separate experiments. To verify quantification of the mean number of migrated cells, we took a picture of the stained membrane and determined the number of cells on the entire lower surface of the membrane using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). We obtained essentially identical results using either method. Anti-integrin mAbs (10 μg/ml), angiostatin (500 nm), or other inhibitory peptides or mAbs were preincubated with cells for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the assay. When the effect of aprotinin on plasmin-induced cell migration was tested, aprotinin at designated concentrations was incubated with immobilized plasmin. Free aprotinin was removed before starting the migration assays. Staining Stress Fibers—Stress fiber staining was carried out as described previously (34Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Visualization of cell spreading and morphology on substrates and actin fiber staining was carried out in cells that were incubated in 0.5% serum for 18 h and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode buffer with 2 mm MgCl2 at 2 × 104 cells/coverslip before plating on poly-l-lysine-, fibronectin-, plasmin-, or angiostatin-coated coverslips. After allowing cells to spread for 90 min at 37 °C, they were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and visualized by phase-contrast microscopy. For actin fiber staining, the fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The actin fibers of these fixed cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin. Actin fiber morphology was visualized using confocal microscopy. Immunoblotting of PAR-1 in CHO Cells—Membrane proteins of CHO cells were prepared essentially as described previously (33McClaren M. Isseroff R.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Confluent CHO cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.25 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and bestatin) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the extraction buffer containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40, rocked on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (containing membrane proteins) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels (15 μg of protein/lane) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) for immunoblotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against PAR-1 (H-111, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or with control rabbit serum at 4 °C overnight. Bound IgG was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmin Binding to Integrin α9β1—Because α9β1 on endothelial cells binds to angiostatin but not to plasminogen (35Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it is possible that proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin produces a similar conformational change to expose the integrin-binding sites located in the kringle domains. We found that plasmin supported the adhesion of α9-CHO cells to a greater extent than it did of mock-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1A) (30Tarui T. Majumdar M. Miles L.A. Ruf W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33564-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Anti-α9 mAb Y9A2 significantly blocked the adhesion of α9-CHO cells to plasmin, but control anti-α5 (KH72) or anti-αvβ5 mAb (P1F6) did not block adhesion (Fig. 1B). RGD peptides did not completely block the adhesion of α9-CHO cells to plasmin (consistent with other reported α9β1-ligand interactions). This finding also indicates that the integrin-binding sites within the kringle domain of plasminogen are exposed by proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin. The kringle domains of plasminogen have multiple Lys-binding sites (36Castellino F.J. McCance S.G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 46-60PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that a Lys analogue (ϵ-aminocaproic acid) almost completely blocked plasmin binding to α9β1. Also, a mAb against plasminogen kringles (mAb 51) blocked interaction between plasmin and this integrin (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that plasmin specifically binds to α9β1 through the kringle domains as in the case of angiostatin. We previously found that angiostatin did not induce cell spreading or stress fiber formation in αvβ3-expressing β3-CHO cells (35Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here. we find that α9-CHO cells also did not spread or form stress fibers on angiostatin (Fig. 2). In contrast, plasmin induced cell spreading and stress fiber formation in α9-CHO cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that plasmin transduces signals that cause cytoskeletal reorganization upon binding to integrins. Control experiments with mock-CHO (vector-transfected) on these substrates demonstrate that these cells do not spread on poly-l-lysine, angiostatin, or plasmin (data not shown). Thus, plasmin specifically signals through integrin α9β1 (Fig. 2) and integrin αvβ3 (35Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) to induce cell spreading, whereas plasmin does not signal through endogenous integrins on mock-transfected CHO cells (e.g. α5β1, αvβ5, or αvβ1). Plasmin Induces Haptotaxis of α9-CHO Cells in an Integrin- and Catalytic Activity-dependent Manner, and Angiostatin (K1–3) Blocks the Plasmin-induced Migration—It has been reported that plasmin is a potent chemoattractant for human peripheral monocytes (19Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied whether plasmin induces migration in an integrin-dependent manner using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Notably, plasmin induced haptotaxis of α9-CHO cells but not significantly of mock-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3A). α9-CHO cells migrated at a much higher rate than mock-transfected CHO cells. This is consistent with the previous observation that α9β1 significantly enhances cell migration (37Young B.A. Taooka Y. Liu S. Askins K.J. Yokosaki Y. Thomas S.M. Sheppard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3214-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An anti-α9 mAb Y9A2 effectively blocked plasmin-induced haptotaxis of α9-CHO cells, whereas the anti-αvβ5 mAb P1F6 did not block migration (Fig. 3B), suggesting that α9β1 integrin in particular is critical for plasmin-induced migration. Notably, we found that soluble angiostatin effectively blocked plasmin-induced haptotaxis of α9-CHO cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Because angiostatin does not induce migration of these cells (35Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the serine protease activity of plasmin may be important for plasmin-induced migration. Consistently, aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, effectively blocked the haptotaxis of these cells on plasmin (Fig. 3D). Mock-transfected CHO cells do not migrate to a significant extent on plasmin and are not affected by aprotinin under the conditions used. These results suggest that the catalytic activity of plasmin is critical for plasmin-mediated migration and that blocking plasmin-induced migration of endothelial cells is a potential mechanism by which angiostatin can exert its effects. The Role of PAR in Plasmin Signaling.—It has recently been reported that plasmin transduces signals through activating PAR-1 (22Pendurthi U.R. Ngyuen M. Andrade-Gordon P. Petersen L.C. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether integrins are required for this signaling process. We have tested whether PARs are involved in plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells. Tethered ligands (PAR agonist peptides TFLLRN for PAR-1, SLIGRL for PAR-2, and GYPGQV for PAR-4) activate PARs without proteolysis. We tested whether PAR agonist peptides can mimic the possible plasmin activation of PARs and stimulate cell migration. We used angiostatin that binds to α9β1 but does not by itself induce migration of α9-CHO cells as a haptotactic substrate. We found that PAR-1 agonist, but not PAR-2 or PAR-4 agonist, significantly induced the migration of α9-CHO cells on angiostatin (Fig. 4). These results suggest that PAR-1 is a likely candidate that mediates plasmin-induced signaling. RWJ 58259 is a synthetic PAR-1 antagonist that efficiently blocks PAR-1-mediated signaling (38Zhang H.C. Derian C.K. Andrade-Gordon P. Hoekstra W.J. McComsey D.F. White K.B. Poulter B.L. Addo M.F. Cheung W.M. Damiano B.P. Oksenberg D. Reynolds E.E. Pandey A. Scarborough R.M. Maryanoff B.E. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found that RWJ 58259 inhibited plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells (Fig. 5). These results support the notion that PAR-1 is primarily responsible for plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells. We also found that a palmitoylated peptide, which specifically recognizes the third intracellular loop of PAR-1 and blocks G protein activation (pal1, also known as pepducin) (39Covic L. Misra M. Badar J. Singh C. Kuliopulos A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), can significantly block PAR-1 agonist peptide-induced migration of α9-CHO cells, whereas a similar palmitoylated inhibitory peptide for PAR-4 (pal4) did not induce migration (Fig. 6A). Mock-transfected CHO cells did not respond to stimulatory PAR-1 and PAR-4 agonist peptides or inhibitory pal1 and pal4 peptides. This finding suggests that PAR-1 signaling specifically cooperates with α9β1. Plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells is also significantly inhibited by pal1 but not by pal4 (Fig. 6B). These experiments further support a role for PAR-1 in plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells. We have confirmed the expression of PAR-1 in CHO and α9-CHO cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 6C), which is consistent with the previous report that CHO cells express functional hamster PAR-1 (27Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that integrins α9β1 serves as a migration-stimulating co-signaling receptor for plasmin and displays specificity to PAR-1.Fig. 6Palmitoylated inhibitory peptides inhibit agonist peptide- and plasmin-induced cell migration. Data are the means ± S.D. from two independent experiments performed in triplicate relative to the migration level of α9-CHO cells on non-coated wells. A, the effect of palmitoylated, inhibitory peptides against PAR-1 and PAR-4 (pal1 and pal4, respectively) was determined by preincubating cells with inhibitory and agonist PAR peptides for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the assay on Transwells coated with K1–3 (500 nm) (see “Experimental Procedures”). B, the effect of PAR inhibitors peptides on plasmin-induced α9-CHO cell migration was determined by preincubation of cells with inhibitory peptides (pal1 or pal4) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the assay on non-coated or plasmin-coated wells. C, expression of PAR-1 in CHO and α9-CHO cells. The membrane protein fractions of CHO and α9-CHO cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15 μg of protein per lane) and immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against PAR-1 or with control rabbit serum. We detected PAR-1 (55 kDa) in both CHO (lane C) and α9-CHO (lane α9). We did not detect PAR-4 under the conditions used (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that, whereas angiostatin binds to integrin α9β1, plasminogen does not bind (35Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These results establish that plasmin, similar to angiostatin, binds to integrin α9β1 through the kringle domains. Our results suggest that the α9β1-binding sites in the kringle domains are exposed by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen. It should be noted that the kringle domain of plasmin is still attached to the catalytic domain by interchain-disulfide linkage. This study demonstrates that plasmin binding to α9β1 is required for cell migration and that the catalytic activity of plasmin is also essential for this process. α9-CHO cells showed much more pronounced migration than mock-transfected CHO cells, which is consistent with the previous observation (37Young B.A. Taooka Y. Liu S. Askins K.J. Yokosaki Y. Thomas S.M. Sheppard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3214-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and plasmin further enhanced the migration of α9-CHO cells. α9β1-expressing CHO cells did not form stress fibers on poly-l-lysine or angiostatin (K1–3) but did spread and form stress fibers on plasmin. Control experiments with mock-CHO cells on these substrates demonstrate that these cells do not spread well on poly-l-lysine, angiostatin, or plasmin. These results suggest that plasmin signaling requires α9β1. However, mock-CHO cells do show a low level of binding and migration, which may be because of the binding of other integrins (e.g. α5β1, αvβ5, and αvβ1) that are endogenous in CHO cells. Such endogenous receptors may also be the cause of the partial inhibition of adhesion of α9-CHO cells seen on plasmin by the RGD peptide and the anti-α9 mAb. We also provide direct evidence that PAR-1 is involved in plasmin-induced signaling in α9-CHO cells using PAR agonist peptides that substitute for the catalytic activity of plasmin and induce migration of α9-CHO cells on angiostatin. Consistently, we also found that the inhibition of PAR-1 activation by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor, RWJ 58259, or a palmitoylated inhibitory peptide against PAR-1 (pal1) is effective in blocking plasmin-induced migration of α9-CHO cells. Taken together, the present evidence suggests that PAR-1 is critical for plasmin-mediated migration of α9-CHO cells. Plasmin has an ∼10-times lower affinity for PAR-1 in comparison to thrombin (40Altrogge L.M. Monard D. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of PAR-1 requires a mechanism to concentrate plasmin on the cell surface. The binding of plasmin to α9β1 would significantly increase the cell surface plasmin concentration. The binding of plasmin to the integrins through the kringle domain would also prevent the inactivation of plasmin, because circulating abundant α2-antiplasmin rapidly inactivates free plasmin dependent on interactions with the kringle domain of plasmin (for a review, see Ref. 41Lijnen H.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, uPA and uPA receptor are widely expressed by proliferating tumor cells (for review, see Ref. 42Ghiso J.A. Alonso D.F. Farias E.F. Gomez D.E. de Kier Joffe E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because uPA/uPA receptor binding can convert plasminogen to plasmin, tumor cells will generate plasmin locally and a high pericellular plasmin level can be expected in tumor cells. It has recently been reported that plasmin induces PAR-1 activation, leading to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation at very low plasmin concentrations on fibroblast (22Pendurthi U.R. Ngyuen M. Andrade-Gordon P. Petersen L.C. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is not consistent with a previous report (43Vouret-Craviari V. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Rasmussen U.B. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8367-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that claims that plasmin cleaves PAR-1 only inefficiently. We suspect that plasmin may be concentrated at the cell surface of fibroblasts through binding to one or more integrins in this case as well. The present study establishes that plasmin-induced cell migration requires both the binding of plasmin to integrin α9β1 through the kringle domains and activation of PAR-1 by the catalytic activity of plasmin. We have reported that endothelial cells (bovine artery endothelial cells) express both α9β1 and αvβ3 (35Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and are involved in plasmin signaling. We also found using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis that calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells, which have been widely used for angiogenesis studies (44Maeshima Y. Manfredi M. Reimer C.

These findings suggest that both α9β1 and αvβ3 may support plasmin-induced signals in endothelial cells and may be involved in the inhibitory effect of angiostatin. We have previously shown that plasmin-induced haptotaxis of β3-CHO cells required the catalytic activity of plasmin and binding to αvβ3 integrins and that angiostatin effectively blocked plasmin-induced haptotaxis of β3-CHO cells. αvβ3 integrin is highly expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells in tumors, wounds, or inflammatory tissues (30Tarui T. Majumdar M. Miles L.A. Ruf W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33564-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although angiostatin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis by blocking endothelial cell proliferation and migration (48Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hojrup P. Everitt L. Hubchak S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) provides insight into a possible mechanism by which angiostatin may inhibit angiogenesis when αvβ3 integrin is involved. The present findings indicate that angiostatin would simultaneously block plasmin-induced migration of cells that express αvβ3- as well as α9β1-integrins. Angiostatin may similarly exert effects on α9β1-dependent migration in neutrophils, hepatocytes, smooth muscle, or epithelial cells (that express α9β1). It has been shown that the α9-cytoplasmic domain (like the highly homologous α4-cytoplasmic domain) preferentially enhances cell migration (37Young B.A. Taooka Y. Liu S. Askins K.J. Yokosaki Y. Thomas S.M. Sheppard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3214-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is interesting that both α9β1 and α4β1 integrins are expressed on leukocytes, which are cells that are required to migrate rapidly at sites of inflammation. However, α9β1 and α4β1 appear to regulate different signaling pathways that both lead to increased migration. The present study used cells overexpressing α9β1 to study plasmin-induced migration and signaling in a manner specific to α9β1. The use of this artificial system would be justified and essential to study α9β1-specific plasmin signaling considering that endothelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and other natural cells express several integrins other than α9β1 that interact with plasmin and angiostatin (e.g. αvβ3 and perhaps other integrins). Elucidating the signaling pathways downstream of α9β1 and their potential inhibitory agents (e.g. angiostatin, PAR-1 inhibitory compounds, serine protease inhibitors, and so on) may be relevant to understanding processes such as inflammation and wound healing in these systems.

https://openalex.org/W1980384853,"The lysophospholipid sphingosine 1-phosphate and the cytokine-transforming growth factor β are both released from degranulating platelets at wound sites, suggesting a broad spectrum of effects involved in wound healing. Interestingly, both of these molecules have been previously shown to induce chemotaxis but to strongly inhibit the growth of keratinocytes, while stimulating the proliferation of fibroblasts. In contrast to sphingosine 1-phosphate, the signaling cascade of the growth factor has been extensively examined. Specifically, Smad3 has been shown to be an essential mediator of transforming growth factor β-dependent chemotaxis of keratinocytes and mediates, in part, its growth-inhibitory effect. Here we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate, independently of transforming growth factor β secretion, induces a rapid phosphorylation of Smad3 on its C-terminal serine motif and induces its partnering with Smad4 and the translocation of the complex into the nucleus. Moreover, sphingosine 1-phosphate fails to induce chemotaxis or inhibit the growth of Smad3-deficient keratinocytes, suggesting that Smad3 plays an unexpected functional role as a new target in sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling. Both sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors and the transforming growth factor β-type I receptor serine/threonine kinase are essential for activation of Smad3 by this lysophospholipid and the dependent biological responses, indicating a novel cross-talk between serine/threonine kinase receptors and G-protein coupled receptors.

Kolesnick R. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys.

A well known source of S1P are human platelets, which release it upon activation by physiological stimuli, suggesting that S1P may play a role in endothelial injury, inflammation, thrombosis, angiogenesis, and wound healing (4Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 5Ruwisch L. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. Naunyn. Schmiedebergs. Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Like other crucial phospholipid mediators, S1P has been suggested to exert its actions either intracellularly as a second messenger following its formation from sphingosine by the activation of sphingosine kinase or extracellularly as a ligand for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that were originally known as the endothelial differentiation gene-1 (Edg1) family of proteins but were recently renamed S1P receptors (6Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). To date, five members of the S1P receptor family have been cloned, namely S1P1 (Edg1), S1P2 (Edg5), S1P3 (Edg3), S1P4 (Edg6), and S1P5 (Edg8) (7Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Depending on the expression of S1P1–5 and the involvement of different G-proteins, S1P is able to influence a wide array of signal transduction pathways in diverse cell types (8Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy, that all S1P receptors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell migration (8Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of S1P1 and S1P3 by S1P results in an enhanced migratory response of a variety of cells, whereas S1P2 stimulation conversely inhibits chemotaxis of these cells (9Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Among the cell types responsive to S1P, it has been shown to be a potent chemoattractant for keratinocytes (10Vogler R. Sauer B. Kim D.S. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 693-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Indeed, migration of this cell type is crucial for reepithelialization suggesting a positive role of S1P on cutaneous wound closure. However, whereas S1P is generally known as an important mitogenic stimulus for many cell types, it strongly inhibits the proliferation and induces differentiation of human epidermal cells. Growth inhibition of keratinocytes forestalls wound closure and implies a more complex regulatory role of S1P in preventing excessive epidermal proliferation (10Vogler R. Sauer B. Kim D.S. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 693-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although it is remarkable for an effector to both stimulate and inhibit cell growth, it is not unprecedented. To our knowledge, the only other factor that mimics the action of S1P on migration and proliferation of dermal and epidermal cells is transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β) (11Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 12Alexandrow M.G. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3928-3932PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Chen L. Xu X. Li C. Huang C. Deng C.X. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). TGF-β is secreted by many cells including platelets and mediates a multiplicity of biological effects depending on the cell type and its differentiation state (14Roberts A.B. Flanders K.C. Heine U.I. Jakowlew S. Kondaiah P. Kim S.J. Sporn M.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 327: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling from the surface to the nucleus requires a series of interdependent events. It is initiated by the association between TGF-β and the TGF-β type II receptor, TβRII, resulting in recruitment of the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) into a heteromeric complex, thereby enabling activation of TβRI by the TβRII receptor serine/threonine kinase (15Wotton D. Massague J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar). The anchor protein SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) recruits the cytoplasmic signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3, classified as receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads) to the TβRI kinase domain, resulting in their phosphorylation on serine residues in the C-terminal SSXS motif (16Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Activated R-Smads dissociate from the receptor complex and associate, caused by conformational changes at the phosphorylation sites, with the common partner Smad4. The resulting heteromeric Smad complexes are translocated into the nucleus, where they directly or indirectly regulate the transcription of target genes (17Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3987) Google Scholar, 18Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the effects of TGF-β on keratinocyte migration and proliferation are due to activation of a specific member of the Smad family, namely Smad3. Keratinocytes prepared from Smad3 null mice show little or no TGF-β-induced chemotaxis and partly reduced inhibition of growth following treatment with TGF-β (19Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B.

Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, agents not belonging to the TGF-β superfamily can also activate Smad2 and Smad3. Thus, it has been reported that the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) can stimulate Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. Although this activation occurs in the absence of endogenous or exogenous TGF-β, it requires the TβRII, implying an interaction between IGFBP receptors and TGF-β receptors (21Fanayan S. Firth S.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7255-7261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). S1P receptors are also known to cross-communicate with other GPCRs as well as other plasma membrane receptors, including receptor-tyrosine kinases (24Van Brocklyn J.R. Behbahani B. Lee N.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Salim K. Fenton T. Bacha J. Urien-Rodriguez H. Bonnert T. Skynner H.A. Watts E. Kerby J. Heald A. Beer M. McAllister G.

For example, S1P and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) have been shown to act via PDGF-β- and S1P1-receptor complexes in airway smooth muscle cells (27Waters C. Sambi B. Kong K.C. Thompson D. Pitson S.M. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6282-6290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Given the strong functional overlap of the actions of TGF-β and S1P on keratinocytes, we have examined possible cross-talks between the TGF-β signaling pathway and that of S1P. We now report that S1P can stimulate phosphorylation of Smad3 in human as well as mouse keratinocytes requiring both S1P receptors and TGF-β receptors. Moreover, we have used both antisense technology and Smad3 null mouse keratinocytes to show that this activation is essential for the stimulation of migration and the inhibition of proliferation of the epidermal cells.

Keratinocyte basal medium, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, hydrocortisone, bovine pituitary extract, gentamicin sulfate, and amphotericin B were from Cell Systems (St. Katharinen, Germany). Cell Culture—Human keratinocytes were isolated from juvenile foreskin from surgery as described recently (10Vogler R. Sauer B. Kim D.S. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 693-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, skin was incubated at 4 °C in a solution of 0.25% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA for 20 h, and trypsinization was terminated by the addition of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Keratinocytes were scraped from the epidermis, washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in keratinocyte growth medium that was prepared from keratinocyte basal medium by the addition of 0.1 ng/ml recombinant EGF, 5.0 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.15 mm Ca2+, 30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin B. Keratinocytes were pooled from several donors and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For all experiments, only cells of the second or third passage were used. Murine keratinocytes were isolated from polymerase chain reaction-genotyped Smad3 wild-type and knockout newborn mice as described (28Leibovich S.J. Ross R. Am. J. Pathol. 1975; 78: 71-100PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, skin of sacrificed mice was numbered and disinfected by iodine solution. Mice were washed three times in 70% ethanol, and tails from each mouse were removed for reverse transcriptase-PCR. The entire skin was mechanically separated and incubated at 4 °C in a solution of 0.25% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA for 20 h. According to the results of the reverse transcriptase-PCR, the epidermal layers of homozygote wild-type and Smad3 knockout mice were pooled separately and homogenized. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min, washed with PBS, and resuspended in growth medium that was prepared from Eagle's minimal essential medium by the addition of 8% fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mm Ca2+, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The next day, the medium was switched to Eagle's minimal essential medium/serum containing 0.05 mm Ca2+. Deletion of Smad3 and S1P1 Using Antisense—Smad3 and S1P1 antisense oligonucleotides were designed to surround the translational initiation site, a place empirically known to be most effective for inhibition of gene expression. Smad3 antisense oligonucleotides 5′-gCAggATggACgACAT-3′ were synthesized based on the mammalian Smad3 cDNAs. Same-length control oligonucleotides (with the same nucleotides but randomly scrambled sequence) to Smad3 were also synthesized: 5′-gTggACAgCTAgAgAC-3′. To reduce S1P1 protein expression, the following oligonucleotide was used: 5′-gACgCTggTgggCCCCAT-3′. The following oligonucleotide served as control: 5′-ATggggCCCACCAgCgTC-3′. Antisense and scrambled oligonucleotides were added to keratinocytes directly after attachment for 24 h in an aqueous solution to achieve a final concentration of 20 μm. Targeted Deletion of Smad3 in Mice—Smad3(ex8/ex8) mice were generated by targeted disruption of the Smad3 gene by homologous recombination. Targeted embryonic stem cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to obtain germ line transmission. Mice heterozygous for the targeted disruption were intercrossed to produce homozygous offspring, and genotypes were determined by PCR (29Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Smad Proteins—Smad immunoprecipitation and blotting were performed as described recently (30Poncelet A.C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes seeded in 6-well plates were cultured for 24 h, and then medium was replaced by HEPES buffer (1 m) for 2 h. Cells were treated with TGF-β or S1P in different concentrations and time periods. Keratinocytes were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS), containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. 100 μg of lysate protein was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 0.2 μg of anti-Smad3 or anti-Smad2 antibodies, followed by a precipitation with 10 μl of protein G plus agarose at 4 °C for 90 min. After four washes with complete RIPA buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol). Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitates (20 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were blotted overnight onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk (for anti-Smad3-, anti-Smad4-, and anti-phospho-Smad3-antibodies) or 3% bovine serum albumin (for anti-phosphoserine) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (0.1%) overnight at 4 °C, membranes were incubated with anti-Smad3, anti-Smad4, anti-phospho-Smad3 (each 0.2 μg/ml), or antiphosphoserine antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline-Tween followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies (anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase, anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h. After washing, the blots were developed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolation of Nuclei—Nuclei were isolated as described (31Bunce C.M. Thick J.A. Lord J.M. Mills D. Brown G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were washed with PBS, scraped into PBS, and then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 5 × 106 cells/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed rapidly at 37 °C, and then passed through a 25-gauge needle 15 times. The homogenate was layered on top of 200 μl of a sucrose gradient (50% sucrose in buffer A) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min. Intact nuclei, pelleted through the cushion, were suspended in RIPA buffer and lysed by freeze thawing. For determination of the nuclei purity, activities of marker enzymes for cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, lactate dehydrogenase, and α-glucosidase II were measured. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was examined according to the manufacturer's protocol, and α-glucosidase II activity was measured as described (32Fujimoto A. Fluharty A.L. Stevens R.L. Kihara H. Wilson M.G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1976; 68: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucoside was used as substrate in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100), and assays were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 250 mm potassium glycine (pH 10.3), and the release of 4-methylumbelliferone was measured (365-nm excitation, 450-nm emission). Binding of the Smad3-Smad4 Complex to Biotinylated DNA—Human keratinocytes were plated into 100-mm dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish) and cultured until a confluence of 30–40% was reached. Cells were stimulated as described above, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and harvested into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA), which was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min followed by protein detection, 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with a biotinylated double-stranded DNA (30 pm) composed of three tandemly repeated CAGA sequences in the presence of 12 μg of poly(dI-dC). DNA-bound proteins were precipitated with 80 μl of streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C for 30 min, washed several times with lysis buffer, and eluted by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using anti-Smad3 antibodies. Cross-communication of TβRI and S1P1 Receptors—Human keratinocytes (5 × 105/10-cm dish) were cultured for 12 h in keratinocyte growth medium and then transfected with HA-tagged TβR-I receptor plasmids (1 μg of DNA/ml; 1:2 complex with Fugene™). Transfection control was performed by the use of a control plasmid (1:2 complex with Fugene™). After 24 h, medium was replaced again by fresh keratinocyte growth medium followed by a stimulation with control vehicle or 10 μm S1P. Keratinocytes were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in complete RIPA buffer. After centrifugation and protein determination, 10 μg of each lysate was prepared for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibodies to reveal an equally high transfection efficacy. 1 mg of lysate protein was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-HA antibodies, followed by a precipitation with 40 μl of protein G plus agarose at 4 °C for 90 min. After four washes with complete RIPA buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-gels. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-S1P1 antibodies as primary antibodies. Measurement of TGF-β Secretion—Cells were stimulated with S1P (10 μm) over a time period of 1 h. Then TGF-β was quantified by selective enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits following the instructions of the manufacturer. Samples were analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader from Merlin (Bornheim, Germany). The detection limit was 4 pg/ml. DNA Synthesis—Keratinocytes (4 × 104 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates for 24 h. Then medium was replaced by fresh keratinocyte growth medium, and cells were incubated with the indicated substances for 72 h and pulsed with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine per well. After 23 h, medium was removed, and cells were washed twice each with PBS and ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%). The precipitated material was dissolved in 0.3 n NaOH solution, and incorporated [methyl-3H]thymidine was determined in a scintillation counter (MicroBeta™ Plus, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). Migration Assays—Migration of human keratinocytes was measured using a modified Boyden chamber as recently described (10Vogler R. Sauer B. Kim D.S. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 693-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lower chamber, separated by a fibronectin-coated membrane, was supplemented with S1P, serum, or TGF-β in the indicated concentrations. Cells that had migrated through the membrane were fixed, stained by Giemsa, and counted. Each value represents the average number of cells migrated from triplicate wells. Murine keratinocytes were cultured until a confluence of ∼30–40%. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium. Keratinocytes were added to the upper well of a chemotaxis chamber, which was separated from the serum-, TGF-β-, or S1P-supplemented test medium by a fibronectin/collagen-I-coated membrane. Cells that had migrated through the membrane after 5 h at 37 °C were stained with ethanol for 1 min, hematoxilen and eosin each for 1 min, and counted. S1P Induces Smad3 Activation in Human Native Keratinocytes—Based on the similarity between the actions of S1P and TGF-β on keratinocytes (10Vogler R. Sauer B. Kim D.S. Schafer-Korting M. Kleuser B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 693-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and the requirement for Smad3 to mediate the chemotactic as well as the antiproliferative properties of TGF-β (19Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Smad3 might also be a direct or indirect mediator of S1P on keratinocyte actions. To eliminate possible artifacts based on overexpression systems using transformed cells, we examined effects of TGF-β and S1P on Smad3 activation in primary human keratinocytes. In agreement with previous studies using transformed cells, TGF-β induced a transient phosphorylation of Smad3, in the absence of effects on its level of expression. A phosphorylation was detectable 10 min after exposure to TGF-β, which returned to basal levels after 90 min (Fig. 1A). Most interestingly, treatment of keratinocytes with S1P also resulted in phosphorylation of Smad3 on its C terminus (Fig. 1B). The kinetics of S1P phosphorylation of Smad3 were slightly more rapid than that seen for activation by TGF-β. Keratinocytes responded to S1P in a rapid activation of Smad3 after 10 min, which declined to base line after 90 min. The phosphorylation process induced by S1P was also dose-dependent. A significant increase was detected at a concentration of 1 μm S1P, whereas a maximal effect occurred at 10 μm (Fig. 1C), inducing a phosphorylation similar to that of the most effective dose of TGF-β. It should be mentioned that also a transient Smad2 phosphorylation occurred in response to TGF-β and S1P (Fig. 1D). S1P Induces the Dimerization of Smad3 and Smad4, the Translocation of the Complex into the Nucleus, and Its Binding to DNA Target Promoters—To verify that Smad3 phosphorylation is specific for S1P and not a consequence of S1P metabolites, we also examined the effects of exogenously added sphingosine and ceramide on Smad3 activation. As presented in Fig. 2A, neither sphingosine nor the short chain C2-ceramide at micromolar concentrations induced a phosphorylation of Smad3 after 10 min. A similar result was obtained in response to a stimulation period of 30 and 45 min. To further substantiate the particular role of S1P, we also measured downstream events after phosphorylation of Smad3. Phosphorylation on the C-terminal SSXS motif of Smad3 enables it to dimerize with Smad4 and correlates with translocation of the complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and binding to promoters of Smad3-responsive genes. Based on this, we examined whether phosphorylation of Smad3 by S1P is accompanied by the formation of a functional Smad3-Smad4 complex. Immunoprecipitation of keratinocyte lysates with anti-Smad3 antibodies followed by Western blotting for Smad3 or Smad4 showed that Smad3 expression levels were not influenced by the treatment with TGF-β or S1P. As expected, no Smad4 co-immunoprecipitated under control conditions. However, Smad3-Smad4 complexes were detected not only after stimulation with TGF-β but also after exposure to S1P (Fig. 2B). Similar to the phosphorylation experiments, both TGF-β and S1P led to a Smad3-Smad4 complex formation after 10 min and peaked at 30 min (data not shown). We also investigated whether S1P would induce nuclear translocation of"
https://openalex.org/W2097516096,"The vasculoprotective effects of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) correlate with cholesterol lowering. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also disrupt cellular processes by the depletion of isoprenoids and dolichol. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling appear particularly prone to such disruption as intracellular receptor processing requires dolichol for correct N-glycosylation, whereas downstream signaling through Ras requires the appropriate prenylation (farnesol). We determined how HMG-CoA reductase inhibition affected the mitogenic effects of IGF-I and metabolic actions of insulin in 3T3-L1 cells and examined the respective roles of receptor glycosylation and Ras prenylation. IGF-I- and insulin-induced proliferation was significantly reduced by all statins tested, although cerivastatin (10 nm) had the greatest effect (p < 0.005). Although inhibitors of Ras prenylation induced similar results (10 μm FTI-277 89% ± 7.4%, p < 0.01), the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition could only be partially reversed by farnesyl pyrophosphate refeeding. Treatment with statins resulted in decreased membrane expression of receptors and accumulation of proreceptors, suggesting disruption of glycosylation-dependent cleavage. Glycosylation inhibitors inhibited IGF-I-induced proliferation (tunicamycin p < 0.005, castanospermine p < 0.01, deoxymannojirimycin p < 0.01). High concentrations of statin were necessary to impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake (300 nm = 33% ± 12% p < 0.05), and this process was not effected by farnesyl transferase inhibition. Gycosylation inhibitors mimicked the effect of statin treatment (tunicamycin p < 0.001, castanospermine p < 0.05, deoxymannojirimycin p < 0.05), and there was insulin proreceptor accumulation. These data imply that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors disrupt IGF-I signaling by combined effects on Ras prenylation and IGF receptor glycosylation, whereas insulin signaling is only affected by disrupted receptor glycosylation. The vasculoprotective effects of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) correlate with cholesterol lowering. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also disrupt cellular processes by the depletion of isoprenoids and dolichol.

Tomita N. Ogihara T. Curr. Drug Targets. 2002; 3: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although their benefits are largely attributed to low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering, there is increasing interest in the pleiotropic effects of these agents. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce the formation of mevalonic acid, an early precursor in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (2Soma M.R. Corsini A. Paoletti R. Toxicol. Lett. (Amst.). 1992; (Spec No. 64–65): 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). However, mevalonic acid depletion also results in decreased levels of dolichol and isoprenoids (3Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); dolichol is intimately involved in the process of N-linked glycosylation of membrane-targeted proteins, whereas isoprenoids are necessary for the prenylation, subsequent membrane anchoring, and activity of downstream growth factor signaling components such as Ras. Thus statins may exert additional effects through modulation of post-translational glycosylation and isoprenylation. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II are polypeptides with significant structural homology to insulin. Consequently, they have acute anabolic effects on carbohydrate and protein metabolism, although importantly, they are also potent regulators of cellular replication, differentiation, and survival (4Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1005-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). We and others have recently found that abnormally low levels of IGF-I are associated with the premature development of type 2 diabetes (5Sandhu M.S. Heald A.H. Gibson J.M. Cruickshank J.K.

Sampayo J. Taylor W. Fraser W. White A. Gibson J.M. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conversely, IGF-I is also known to promote many of the processes involved in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions and cardiovascular disease since IGF-I stimulates macrophage chemotaxis; endothelial cell migration (7Grant M. Jerdan J. Merimee T.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1987; 65: 370-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration (8Gockerman A. Prevette T. Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also primes macrophages and monocytes for cytokine release (9Renier G. Clement I. Desfaits A.C. Lambert A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4611-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These studies clearly demonstrate that the IGF and insulin signaling systems are involved in the aetiopathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. A reduction in mevalonic acid synthesis results in the depletion of dolichyl phosphate. Dolichyl phosphate acts as a carbohydrate donor during N-linked glycosylation of membrane-targeted proteins (10Schenk B. Fernandez F. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 61R-70RCrossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although most cell surface receptors do not depend on N-linked glycosylation for correct processing, such glycosylation is essential in the formation of mature, functional type 1 IGF and insulin receptors since, unusually, correct α-subunit glycosylation is vital for proreceptor cleavage (11Collier E. Carpentier J.L. Beitz L. Carol H. Taylor S.I. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus deficient glycosylation causes proreceptor retention within the endoplasmic reticulum (11Collier E. Carpentier J.L. Beitz L. Carol H. Taylor S.I. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Hwang J.B. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The depletion of farnesyl pyrophosphate may inhibit IGF and insulin actions as these molecules are required for the prenylation of key signaling intermediates. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is necessary for the prenylation of Ras, and consequently, the association of Ras with the cell membrane (13Yoshimatsu K. Gan to Kagaku Ryoho (Jpn. J. Cancer Chemother.). 1997; 24: 1495-1502PubMed Google Scholar, 14Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a crucial process in mitogenic signaling induced by both the type 1 IGF receptor and the structurally similar insulin receptor. Treatment with farnesyl transferase inhibitors results in cytosolic Ras and decreased signaling in response to ligand (15Solomon C.S. Goalstone M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined and compared the roles of IGF and insulin receptor glycosylation and Ras farnesyltion in rapidly proliferating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and terminally differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes under conditions of mevalonic acid depletion induced by a broad selection of currently available HMG-CoA reducatase inhibitors. Materials—HMG-CoA reducatse inhibitors were a kind gift of Bayer pharmaceuticals PLC and AstraZeneca PLC. Deoxymannojirimycin and the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 were purchased from Calbiochem. Castanospermine was purchased from Alexis Corp. Farnesyl pyrophosphate was purchased from Sigma. Insulin and IGF receptor rabbit polyclonal antibodies for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protease inhibitor (set I) was purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor (3T3-IR) or human IGF receptor (NWTb3) were generously provided by Professor LeRoith (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and cultured in 3T3-L1 medium containing 0.05 mg/ml geneticin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. [3H]Thymidine Uptake Assay—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated in serum-free medium with or without HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for 24 h before the addition of IGF-I (10 ng/ml (1.3 nm)) or insulin (5 μm). 20 h later, [methyl-3H]thymidine was added to a final concentration of 0.05 μCi/ml, and after a further 4 h, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS before incubation with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then solubilized with 0.1 m NaOH for assessment of total protein concentration and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml (day 0) and grown until 2 days post-confluent (day 8). Differentiation was then induced by supplementing the growth medium with 2 μm insulin, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 0.25 μm dexamethasone for 2 days. Triglyceride droplets could be observed in differentiated cells from day 14. In all experiments using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, more than 90% of the cells had acquired the adipocyte phenotype as demonstrated by oil red O staining. Glucose Uptake by Mature 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 adipocytes were transferred to serum-free medium with or without inhibitor for 24 h and then placed in Hepes-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) for 1 h before the addition of IGF-I or insulin (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Glucose (2 mm 2-deoxy-glucose, 10 μCi/ml [3H]2-deoxy-glucose) was added to each well, and after 15 min, uptake was stopped by the addition of 2 mm phloretin. Adipocytes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.1 m NaOH for analysis of protein content and [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake. Biotinylation of Cell Membranes—A confluent flask (75 cm2) of 3T3-IR or NWTb3 cells was washed three times with cold PBS, incubated on ice for 15 min, and then treated with 5 ml of sodium metaperiodate (10 mm) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed three times with cold PBS and slowly agitated with 2 ml of 5 mm biotin hydrazide for 30 min before the addition of solid sodium cyanoborohydride (50 mm) and a further 30-min incubation. After washing three times with cold PBS, cells were scraped into radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitors (CalBiochem). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting of Insulin and IGF Receptors—Lysates of surface biotinylated cells (100 μg) were incubated with polyclonal anti-IGF receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-insulin receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies overnight at 6 °C and then with anti-rabbit IgG antibody (SacCel; IDS, Tyne & Wear, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and then resuspended in reducing SDS loading buffer (0.125 m Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue). Immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed on SDS/polyacrylamide (6%) gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and blocked (0.15 m NaCl, 1% Marvel). Biotinylated receptors were incubated with streptavidin linked to horseradish peroxidase and detected by ECL. Native receptors were incubated with either type I IGF or insulin receptor rabbit polyclonal antibodies (SC-9038, SC-711 respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and detected by ECL. Determination of Apoptosis—Preadipocytes were either treated for 24 h with cerivastatin (0.3–300 nm) or treated for 24 h with 1 μm staurosporine. Following treatment, the medium was removed, and detached cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Attached cells were trypsinized and combined with detached cells. Cells were cytospun onto polylysine slides (Merck) and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Apoptosis was quantified by examining the nuclear morphology of cells stained with 4 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 (Molecular Probes). Each experiment was repeated three times, and in each experimental condition, more than 1000 single cells were scored for apoptosis. Ras Localization—Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with or without 300 nm cerivastatin for 24 h, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped into 50 mm HEPES plus protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and sonicated for 3 × 5 s at an amplitude of 20 μm). Intact cells were removed by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min), the total protein content of the remaining supernatant was determined, and then equal amounts of protein (1 mg) were taken for membrane isolation by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min 4 °C. Membrane pellets were resuspended in SDS loading buffer, electrophoresed on a SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with a rat monoclonal anti-Ras antibody. Bound antibody was detected by an anti-rat IgG antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and ECL. The Effect of HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibition on IGF-I-stimulated Proliferation and Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—IGF-I (10 ng/ml (1.3 nm)) stimulated a 23-fold increase (p < 0.005) in [3H]thymidine uptake by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in mid-log growth (Fig. 1A). From dose-response experiments, it was determined that 5 μm insulin was required to achieve a similar fold induction to that of 10 ng/ml (1.3 nm) IGF-I (data not shown). The effects of both IGF-I and insulin could be significantly reduced by exposing cells to cerivastatin (10 nm; p < 0.005), fluvastatin (50 nm; p < 0.005), simvastatin (50 nm; p < 0.01), atorvastatin (500 nm; p < 0.05), or pravastatin (10,000 nm; p < 0.05) for 24 h prior to stimulation (Fig. 1). Since cerivastatin was the most potent drug tested, it was subsequently used to investigate the possibility of statin-induced apoptosis. Reduced proliferation was not due to drug-induced apoptosis since survival (determined by assessment of nuclear morphology) of cells treated with 3–300 nm cerivastatin for 24 h was similar to that of cells maintained in medium alone (Fig. 2A). Only by prolonged exposure (72 h) at a high dose of cerivastatin (300 nm) were we able to induce the level of apoptosis (29%) observed in response to a 24-h incubation with the known apoptotic agent staurosporine (Ref. 16Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and data not shown). Preadipocyte clonal expansion and subsequent differentiation is also dependent on a signal through the type 1 IGF receptor (17Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when cells were incubated with 3 or 30 nm cerivastatin, concentrations shown to significantly inhibit IGF-I-stimulated proliferation, clonal expansion, as assessed by the determination of cell number, was not significantly different from cells maintained in differentiation medium alone (Fig. 2B). Only exposure to 300 nm cerivastatin resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in cell number. Effect of HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibition on [3H]2-Deoxyglucose Uptake by 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—[3H]2-deoxy-glucose uptake by mature adipocytes was used to assess the effect of cerivastatin on the metabolic actions of IGF-I. Fig. 3A demonstrates that in contrast to its effect on the mitogenic actions of IGF-I, high doses of cerivastatin (300 nm) were necessary to evoke even a modest inhibition of IGF-I-(100 ng/ml) stimulated [3H]2-deoxy-glucose uptake (28%; p < 0.005). During adipocyte differentiation, insulin receptors are especially up-regulated, whereas IGF receptors are maintained at the level expressed by the preadipocyte; consequently, the mature cell responds to insulin as well as IGF-I, and we and others have shown that the two hormones are equipotent in promoting glucose uptake (19Shimizu M. Torti F. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 53Siddals K.W. Westwood M. Gibson J.M. White A. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 174: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HMG-CoA reductase inhibition also abrogated the metabolic actions of insulin, but again, high doses (300 nm) were needed to attenuate significantly (32% reduction; p < 0.05) the stimulatory effect of insulin (Fig. 3B). HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Alter Processing of IGF and Insulin Receptors—HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lead to the cellular depletion of mevalonate, and consequently, dolichyl phosphate, an essential cofactor in the process of N-linked protein glycosylation. It is therefore possible that mevalonate depletion might mediate its effect on IGF and insulin actions by disruption of receptor processing and thus receptor presentation at the cell surface. Initially, Western immunoblotting was used to assess the effect of cerivastatin on IGF and insulin receptor production. Fig. 4A shows that in preadipocytes incubated with cerivastatin (0.3–30 nm) for 24 h, there is a marked increase in the proportion of IGF-I proreceptors. Similarly, cerivastatin treatment of mature adipocytes led to an increase in the amount of insulin proreceptor, and in these cells, an alternate high molecular weight form of the insulin proreceptor was also observed (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that cerivastatin-treated cells are less efficient at processing the proreceptor to the mature α- and β-subunits. This should lead to decreased expression at the cell surface, and indeed, immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from surface biotinylated NWT3b and 3T3-IR cells demonstrated reduced levels of IGF-I and insulin (respectively) receptor subunits as a result of treatment with cerivastatin (Fig. 5)Fig. 5The effect of mevalonate depletion on cell surface expression of type 1 IGF and insulin receptors. NWTb3 (A) or 3T3-IR (B) cells were treated with cerivastatin (300 nm) for 24 h before biotinylation of cell surface proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell lysates were incubated with an anti-IGFR (A) or an anti-insulin receptor (B) antibody, and immune complexes were precipitated with an anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to cellulose. The resulting peptides were electrophoresed on an SDS 6% polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and visualized by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and ECL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Affect Prenylation of Proteins Associated with IGF-I Signaling Pathways—Since HMG-CoA reductase inhibition reduced the cell surface expression of receptors for both IGF-I and insulin, then altered receptor glycosylation alone cannot account for the differential affect of mevalonate depletion on the mitogenic and metabolic actions of IGF-I. We therefore investigated whether a reduction in farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranyl pyrophosphate, which also occurs as a consequence of cellular mevalonate depletion, altered the isoprenylation of proteins involved in the signaling pathways activated during a mitogenic response to IGF-I. The effect of cerivastatin on the prenylation of Ras, a known IGF-I signaling intermediary, was assessed using Western immunoblotting to visualize the proportion of Ras associated with the cellular membrane. Fig. 6A shows that cerivastin-induced inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake is coupled with a reduction in membrane-associated Ras. Furthermore, the effect of cerivastatin could be partially reversed by providing mevalonate-depleted cells with farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fig. 6B). Using specific inhibitors of glycosylation (tunicamycin, castanospermine, and deoxymannojirimycin) and farnesylation (FTI-277), we then investigated the relative importance of these post-translational modifications in transmission of IGF mitogenic and metabolic signals. IGF-I-stimulated proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was dose dependently decreased by all glycosylation inhibitors (0.25 μg/ml tunicamycin, p < 0.005, 10 μg/ml castanospermine, p < 0.01, 1 mm DMJ, p < 0.01), with tunicamycin, unsurprisingly, having the most severe effect (Fig. 7A). The farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 also inhibited IGF-I-mediated mitogenesis, suggesting that the severe effect of cerivastatin on IGF-I-stimulated cellular proliferation is due to a combination of disrupted receptor glycosylation and altered prenylation of intracellular signaling molecules. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was also inhibited by all glycosylation inhibitors (25 μg/ml tunicamycin, p < 0.01, 500 μg/ml castanospermine, p < 0.05, 20 mm DMJ, p < 0.05) with tunicamycin again having the most severe effect (Fig. 7B). FTI-277 had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, confirming that the insulin metabolic pathway is sensitive to changes in receptor glycosylation but is not dependent on a prenylated signaling intermediate. These studies clearly demonstrate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are potent inhibitors of insulin- and IGF-mediated proliferation in 3T3-L1 cells. This high degree of potency is due to the combined disruption of prenylation pathways and glycosylation-dependent proreceptor cleavage of IGF receptors. In terminally differentiated adipocytes, the metabolic effects of insulin or IGF-I on glucose uptake are substantially less affected by HMG-CoA reductase inhibition; in these cells, prenylation pathways are of lesser importance with the major abnormality remaining impaired insulin and IGF receptor processing. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are a group of drugs suggested to have significant pleiotropic effects (20Bellosta S. Bernini F. Ferri N. Quarato P. Canavesi M. Arnaboldi L. Fumagalli R. Paoletti R.

We show that in 3T3-L1 cells, it is the combined effect of these mechanisms that markedly abrogate mitogenic response of the cells to IGF-I, whereas their effect on metabolic signaling, only affected by one mechanism, is less markedly reduced. IGF- and insulin-stimulated cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by all the HMG-CoA reducatse inhibitors tested. Cerivastatin was the most potent, significantly inhibiting IGF-induced proliferation at 10 nm (p < 0.005), whereas pravastatin was the least potent, requiring 10 μm before achieving substantial inhibition of IGF-mediated cell proliferation. The order of potency, at inhibiting IGF-stimulated proliferation, correlates with their degree of hydrophobicity (ceriva > simva > fluva > atorva > prava), not their potency in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (atorva > ceriva > simva > fluva > prava) (35McTaggart F. Buckett L. Davidson R. Holdgate G. McCormick A. Schneck D. Smith G. Warwick M. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 87: 28B-32BAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although hepatocytes take up statins by an active mechanism, fibroblasts do not (35McTaggart F. Buckett L. Davidson R. Holdgate G. McCormick A. Schneck D. Smith G. Warwick M. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 87: 28B-32BAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus in cell types without an active uptake mechanism, it appears that hydrophobicity confers the greatest effect on prenylation and glycosylation pathways. The dramatic reduction in cell proliferation resulting from statin exposure occurs at concentration and exposure times far less than those necessary to induce apoptosis. Only after prolonged treatment with a high concentration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor were we able to demonstrate that IGF signaling had been disrupted sufficiently to induce apoptosis. Other studies have detected statin-induced apoptosis in a variety of cells (36Reedquist K.A. Pope T.K. Roess D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Padayatty S.J. Marcelli M. Shao T.C. Cunningham G.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Res. 1998; 83: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Similarly, these studies required either very high concentrations of statins over short periods (38Guijarro C. Blanco-Colio L.M. Ortego M. Alonso C. Ortiz A. Plaza J.J. Diaz C. Hernandez G. Egido J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) or prolonged exposure to lower concentrations (36Reedquist K.A. Pope T.K. Roess D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Metab. 1997; 82: 1434-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may alter signaling through the IGF and insulin pathways is through aberrant glycosylation of the IGF and insulin receptors. HMG-CoA reductase inhibition reduces formation of dolichyl phosphate, a carbohydrate donor during N-linked glycosylation of membrane-targeted proteins (10Schenk B. Fernandez F. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 61R-70RCrossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 39Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Due to their unusual requirement for correct N-linked glycosylation prior to the appropriate pro-receptor cleavage (11Collier E. Carpentier J.L. Beitz L. Carol H. Taylor S.I. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the insulin and IGF receptor systems appear particularly prone to disruption by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (12Hwang J.B.

We have clearly shown that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition markedly alters both the processing and the cell surface expression of both the IGF and the insulin receptors in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes, respectively. This concurs with studies in melanoma and Ewing's sarcoma cells in which an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin down-regulated the number of IGFRs at the cell surface (30Carlberg M.

Xie Y. Nilsson G. Dricu A. Wejde J. Larsson O. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 2000; 15: 67-72PubMed Google Scholar). Similar changes in receptor processing were demonstrated by Hwang and Frost (12Hwang J.B. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in which glycosylation of insulin receptors was disrupted by depriving mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes of glucose. Under these conditions, increased amounts of lower molecular weight proreceptors were formed that were subsequently degraded. We have shown that selective disruption of receptor glycosylation using specific inhibitors for the presence, length, and complexity of the carbohydrate moiety profoundly abrogates IGF and insulin receptor function. These findings are atypical. Most other membrane proteins appear less sensitive to changes in their glycosylation status (44Burke B. Matlin K. Bause E. Legler G. Peyrieras N. Ploegh H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The transport of lysosomal acid phosphatase was dependent on the presence but not the complexity of its N-linked oligosaccharides (45Gottschalk S. Waheed A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. HoppeSeyler. 1989; 370: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), whereas lipoprotein lipase requires carbohydrate presence for secretion and activity, but prevention of glycan processing with DMJ had no effect (46Masuno H. Schultz C.J. Park J.W. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Mateo C. Scow R.O. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mevalonate depletion also affects the isoprenylation of membrane-associated proteins, such as Ras. The depletion of farnesyl pyrophosphate with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors leads to decreased signaling through Ras. Mitogenic but not metabolic signaling was inhibited by the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277, and inhibition of proliferation by cerivastatin was partially reversed by co-treatment with exogenous farnesyl pyrophosphate. Disturbed farnesylation is thus in part responsible for the inhibition of proliferation caused by cerivastatin, a process confirmed by reduced Ras association with isolated cell membranes in treated cells. Similar results have been obtained with lovastatin. In SK-MEL-2 cells, mevalonate depletion by lovastatin resulted in Ras prenylation being inhibited by 50% (47Dricu A. Wang M. Hjertman M. Malec M. Blegen H. Wejde J. Carlberg M. Larsson O. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Lovastatin also induced apoptosis in malignant mesothelioma cell lines, which was partially reversed by farnesol refeeding (48Rubins J.B. Greatens T. Kratzke R.A. Tan A.T. Polunovsky V.A. Bitterman P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 1616-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In these cells, there was a relocalization of Ras from the membrane to the cytosol. In human glioma cell lines, lovastatin decreased cellular proliferation by 80% due to decreased signaling through Ras (31Bouterfa H.L. Sattelmeyer V. Czub S. Vordermark D. Roosen K. Tonn J.C. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 2761-2771PubMed Google Scholar). Prior exposure of cells to insulin (and possibly IGF-I) may potentiate the subsequent actions of other mitogens (49Goalstone M.L.

By blunting the effect of insulin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may abrogate this effect on two levels, by decreasing the insulin activation of farnesyl transferase and by depleting the cell of farnesyl pyrophosphate. In summary, mevalonate depletion affects IGF and insulin signaling via at least two distinct but related and synergistic mechanisms: reduced prenylation of signaling intermediates such as Ras and disruption of insulin and IGF proreceptor processing. IGF-induced mitogenic processes in rapidly proliferating cells are more potently affected than insulin-mediated metabolic processes in terminally differentiated cells. Although the effects on receptor processing in most terminally differentiated cells may have little influence, those cells with active uptake mechanisms for statins may be substantially affected. In such cell types, insulin and IGF resistance might be anticipated."

To determine signals controlling the nuclear and subnuclear localization of the 18-kDa FGF-2, its full-length cDNA was fused to that of green fluorescent protein (GFP).

Lys119 and Arg129 are the key amino acid residues in both nuclear and nucleolar localization, whereas Lys128 regulates only nucleolar localization of 18-kDa FGF-2.

Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3005.1-3005.9Crossref Google Scholar). A single FGF-2 mRNA encodes five protein isoforms. Differential initiation of translation from upstream CUG codons yields four high molecular mass isoforms of FGF-2 (22-34 kDa). The high molecular weight FGF-2s contain an N-terminal extension in which two nuclear localization signals are located (2Dono R. James D. Zeller R.

The 18-kDa FGF-2 isoform is translated from the AUG codon and can be secreted through a pathway independent of the endoplasm reticulum and Golgi apparatus (reviewed in Ref. 4Bikfalvi A. Klein S.

In addition to this signaling pathway, the presence of 18-kDa FGF-2, high molecular weight FGF-2s, and FGF-2 receptors in the nucleus suggests that FGF-2 participates in an intracrine signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 6Keresztes M.

Kin H. Xu C. Riordan J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, Hsia et al. (10Hsia E. Richardson T.P. Nugent M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 1214-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) found that nuclear translocation of 18-kDa FGF-2 was dramatically inhibited by heparinase treatment or in heparin-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface are involved in the nuclear translocation of exogenous 18-kDa FGF-2. Endogenous 18-kDa FGF-2 also accumulates in the nucleus (11Tessler S. Neufeld G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Dell'Era P. Presta M. Ragnotti G.

In transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, 18-kDa FGF-2 concentrated in the nucleus, whereas in untransfected BHK-21 cells endogenous FGF-2 was detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus (11Tessler S. Neufeld G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Suramine, a compound that specifically inhibits the binding of FGF-2 to its receptors, blocked the endocytosis of FGF-2 in GM7372 bovine endothelial cells. However, the amount of 18-kDa FGF-2 in the nucleus of these cells did not change, suggesting that 18-kDa FGF-2 may translocate into the nucleus directly from the cytoplasm (12Dell'Era P. Presta M. Ragnotti G. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Human and rat 18-kDa FGF-2 overexpressed in COS cells was present in both nuclei and cytoplasm (13Powell P.P.

Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 18-kDa FGF-2 tagged with fluorescence proteins (GFP or dsRed) localized in the nuclei of rabbit corneal endothelial cells (CEC) and rat Schwann cells (15Choi J.

Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2254-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that mouse and human 18-kDa FGF-2 accumulated in the nucleus when overexpressed in mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells. However, other reports suggested that 18-kDa FGF-2 was predominantly cytoplasmic (18Renko M. Quarto N. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 19Quarto N. Finger F.P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell.

(21Presta M. Gualandris A. Urbinati C. Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Isacchi A. Caccia P. Bergonzoni L. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) evaluated the nuclear localization capabilities of the sequence (27KDPKR31) in the N terminus of 18-kDa FGF-2 based on its similarity to the NLS of FGF-1 (23YKKPK27) (22Zhan X. Hu X. Frieman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, altering basic amino acid residues to glutamine in the sequence did not prevent nuclear translocation of 18-kDa FGF-2 in COS-1 cells, suggesting that the NLS is located in another region (21Presta M. Gualandris A. Urbinati C. Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Isacchi A. Caccia P. Bergonzoni L. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Claus et al. (16Claus P. Döring F.

A serial deletion of the C terminus of mouse 18-kDa FGF-2 revealed that the nuclear localization of 18-kDa FGF-2 is regulated by C-terminal sequences, but the specific amino acid residues responsible for the localization were not identified (17Foletti A. Vuadens F. Beermann F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2254-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Those data suggest that the C terminus of FGF-2 contains an NLS. The nucleolus is the center of ribosomal biogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 23Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Growth factors or growth-regulatory proteins such as FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-3, angiogenin, and parathyroid hormone-related peptide have been detected in the nucleolus (reviewed in Ref. 24Pederson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Exogenously added 18-kDa FGF-2 translocated into the nucleus and accumulated in the nucleolus (7Bouche G. Gas N. Prats H.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Similarly, endogenous 18-kDa FGF-2 overexpressed in the CEC and Schwann cells also localized to the nucleolus (15Choi J. Ko M.K. Kay E.P. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 222-231PubMed Google Scholar, 16Claus P. Döring F. Gringel S. Müller-Ostermeyer F. Fuhlrott J. Kraft T. Grothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Studies of nucleolar proteins revealed that signals are required for nucleolar localization, but no consensus sequence has been determined (25Timmers A.C. Stuger R. Schaap P.J. van't Riet J. Raué H.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Shu-Nu C. Lin C.H. Lin A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Rowland R.R.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several nucleolar localization sequences, resembling NLSs (clusters of basic amino acid residues) have been identified in a nucleocapsid protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and ribosomal proteins S22, S25, and L22 (25Timmers A.C. Stuger R. Schaap P.J. van't Riet J. Raué H.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Shu-Nu C. Lin C.H. Lin A.

An interesting feature of these nucleolar localization sequences is that they overlap with NLSs in these proteins (25Timmers A.C. Stuger R. Schaap P.J. van't Riet J. Raué H.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Shu-Nu C. Lin C.H. Lin A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Rowland R.R. Yoo D. Virus Res. 2003; 95: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, a nucleolar localization sequence found in the N terminus of US11, a herpes simplex virus type 1 protein, lacks clusters of basic amino acid residues (28Catez F. Erard M. Schaerer-Uthurralt N. Kindbeiter K. Madjar J.J. Diaz J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Signals that are essential for nucleolar localization of 18-kDa FGF-2 have not been reported. Here we demonstrate that 18-kDa FGF-2 accumulates in the nucleus and nucleolus of COS-7 and HeLa cells. Examination of the sequence of FGF-2 revealed a nonclassical bipartite NLS in the C terminus. Fusing the NLS to GFP drove the resulting fusion protein into the nucleus. Mutating basic amino acid residues in this region markedly decreased the nuclear and nucleolar localization of 18-kDa FGF-2. The identification of this motif clarifies the mechanism underlying the nuclear translocation and nucleolar accumulation of 18-kDa FGF-2. Plasmid Construction—To construct pEGFP-N1-FGF-2 encoding the fusion protein GFP-FGF-2, the full-length cDNA of human 18-kDa FGF-2 (gift of R. Florkiewicz) was amplified in a PCR using forward (5′-ACGAGCTGTACAAGATGGCAGCCGGGAGCATCACC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGAGTCGCGGCCGCTTAAAATCAGCTCTTAGCAGA-3′) primers containing BsrGI and NotI sites, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with BsrGI and NotI and then ligated to the corresponding sites at the 3′-end of GFP cDNA in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The full-length cDNA of FGF-2 was also placed at the 5′-end of GFP cDNA by first amplifying it using forward (5′-TTTAAGCTTATGGCAGCCGGGAGCATCACC-3′) and reverse (5′-TTTCTGCAGGCTCTTAGCAGACATTGGAAG-3′) primers containing HindIII and PstI sites, respectively. To construct plasmid pFGF-2-3×FLAG-CMV™-14 encoding FGF-2-FLAG, the cDNA of 18-kDa FGF-2 was amplified using a forward primer (5′-ATATATAAGCTTATGGCAGCCGGGAGCATCACC-3′) containing a HindIII site and a reverse primer (5′-ATATGGTACCGAGCTCTTAGCAGACATTGGAAGAAA-3′) containing a KpnI site. After digesting the amplified DNA with HindIII and KpnI, the resulting product was inserted into the corresponding sites in p3×FLAG-CMV™-14 (Sigma). The pN1 control plasmid and plasmids coding for untagged versions of FGF-2 (pN1-FGF-2) and FGF-2 mutants (pN1-FGF-2-K128G, pN1-FGF-2-K128G/R129G, pN1-FGF-2-R116G/R118G/K119G, and pN1-FGF-2-R116G/R118G/K119G/K128G/R129G) were constructed by using HindIII and BsrGI to remove the cDNA of GFP from the corresponding pEGFP-N1 plasmids described above and below (see “Site-directed Mutagenesis”). The overhangs were filled in with Klenow, and the resulting blunt ends were ligated. A 17-amino acid sequence containing the NLS of the 18-kDa form of FGF-2 was fused to GFP by synthesizing two complementary DNAs corresponding to the sequence 114TYRSRKYTSWYVALKRT130 and containing a 5′-overhang of an XhoI site and a 3′-overhang of a BamHI site. After annealing, the double-stranded DNA was inserted into the corresponding sites at the 5′-end of GFP cDNA in plasmid pEGFP-N1. The two complementary DNAs were 5′-TCGAGGAATTCATGACTTACCGGTCAAGGAAATACACCAGTTGGTATGTGGCACTGAAACGAACTCTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCAGTTCGTTTCAGTGCCACATACCAACTGGTGTATTTCCTTGACCGGTAAGTCATGAATTCC-3′. To generate pNLS-dEGFP-N1, in which the NLS of 18-kDa FGF-2 is fused to a GFP dimer, GFP cDNA was amplified with primers containing BsrGI sites. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-ATATATTGTACAAGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC-3′ and 5′-CTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAG-3′, respectively. The amplified GFP cDNA was then digested with BsrGI and inserted into the corresponding site at the 3′-end of GFP cDNA in pNLS-EGFP-N1. The plasmid pdEGFP-N1 encoding a GFP dimer was constructed by first digesting pNLS-dEGFP-N1 with XhoI and BamHI to remove the NLS, blunting the product with DNA polymerase, and finally ligating the ends together. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To obtain a plasmid encoding wild type 18-kDa FGF-2, two stop codons were introduced between FGF-2 and GFP cDNA in pFGF-2-EGFP-N1 using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-CCAATGTCTGCTAAGAGCTGATGACTGCAGTCGACG-3′ and 5′-CGGTACCGTCGACTGCAGTCATCAGCTCTTAGCAGA-3′, respectively. The resulting plasmid (pFGF-2STOP-EGFP-N1) encodes 18-kDa FGF-2. To make mutants R116G, R118G, K119G, K128G, R129G, R116G/R118G, R118G/K119G, and K128G/R129G, mutations were introduced into GFP-FGF-2 using site-directed mutagenesis. The forward and reverse primers for mutant R116G were 5′-AACTACAATACTTACGGGTCAAGGAAATACACCAGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACTGGTGTATTTCCTTGACCCGTAAGTATTGTAGTT-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for R118G were 5′-TACAATACTTACCGGTCAGGGAAATACACCAGTT-3′ and 5′-AACTGGTGTATTTCCCTGACCGGTAAGTATTGTA-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for K119G were 5′-ACAATACTTACCGGTCAAGGGGGTACACCAGTTGGTAT-3′ and 5′-ATACCAACTGGTGTACCCCCTTGACCGGTAAGTATTGT-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for mutant K128G were 5′-TGGTATGTGGCACTGGGACGAACTGGGCAGTAT-3′ and 5′-ATACTGCCCAGTTCGTCCCAGTGCCACATACCA-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for mutant R129G were 5′-TATGTGGCACTGAAAGGAACTGGGCAGTATAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTATACTGCCCAGTTCCTTTCAGTGCCACATA-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for mutant R116G/R118G were 5′-AACTACAATACTTACGGGTCAGGGAAATACACCAGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACTGGTGTATTTCCCTGACCCGTAAGTATTGTAGTT-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for mutant R118G/K119G were 5′-AATACTTACCGGTCAGGGGGGTACACCAGTTGGTAT-3′ and 5′-ATACCAACTGGTGTACCCCCCTGACCGGTAAGTATT-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for mutant K128G/R-129G were 5′-TGGTATGTGGCACTGGGAGGAACTGGGCAGTATAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTATACTGCCCAGTTCCTCCCAGTGCCACATACCA-3′, respectively. To make mutants R116G/K119G, R116G/R118G/K119G, and R116G/K128G/R129G, K119G, R118G/K119G, and K128GR129G mutations were introduced, respectively, into the mutant R116G. Forward and reverse primers for R116G/K119G were 5′-ACTTACGGGTCAAGGGGGTACACCAGTTGGTAT-3′ and 5′-ATACCAACTGGTGTACCCCCTTGACCCGTAAGT-3′, respectively. The forward and reverse primers for R116G/R118G/K119G were 5′-AACTACAATACTTACGGGTCAGGGGGGTACACCAGTTGGTAT-3′ and 5′-ATACCAACTGGTGTACCCCCCTGACCCGTAAGTATTGTAGTT-3′, respectively. Primers for R116G/K128G/R129G were the same as those used in generating K128G/R129G. Mutants R118G/K128G/R129G, R119G/K128G/R129G, R116G/R118G/K128G/R129G, and R118G/K119G/K128G/R129G were generated, respectively, by introducing R118G, R119G, R116G/R118G, or R118G/K119G into the mutant K128G/R129G using primers described above. K119G was introduced into the mutant R116G/K128G/R129G to obtain R116G/K119G/K128G/R129G using the same primers for K119G. Mutations K128G and R129G were introduced into the mutant R116G/R118G to generate R116G/R118G/K128G and R116G/R118G/R129G, respectively, using the corresponding primers described above. R116G/R118G/K119G/K128G/R129G was obtained by introducing K128G/R129G into the mutant R116G/R118G/K119G using the same primers for K128G/R129G described above. The sequences of all inserts and mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Monkey kidney fibroblast COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin. Human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin. For transient transfection, COS-7 or HeLa cells were trypsinized and counted. Cells (8 × 104) were plated onto a glass coverslip in a 24-well plate. After overnight incubation, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into cells using 1 μl of LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously with minor modifications (29Ojakian G.K. Nelson W.J. Beck K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2781-2794PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, transiently transfected cells on glass coverslips were fixed in Buffer A (4% paraformaldehyde in full phosphate-buffered saline containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) for 30 min at room temperature. Then cells were permeabilized in Buffer B (0.2% Triton X-100 in full phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were blocked in Buffer C (1% goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in full phosphate-buffered saline) for at least 1 h at room temperature. Mouse monoclonal FGF-2 antibody (1:20-100 diluted in Buffer C) (Oncogene) or mouse monoclonal nucleolin antibody (1:10 diluted in Buffer C) (gift from Dr. Piñol-Roma, New York) was incubated with cells for 16-24 h at 4 °C. Afterward, cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100 diluted in Buffer C) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. For some experiments, FGF-2 and its fusion protein FGF-2-FLAG were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50 diluted in Buffer C) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and the nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (4 μg/ml in Buffer C) (Sigma). Samples were mounted in SlowFade™ antifade solution (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and observed using a Radiance 2000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Confocal images (1024 × 768 pixels) were obtained using a 40× objective lens. Nuclear Localization Analysis—NIH Image J version 1.30 software was used to quantify the nuclear localization of GFP fusion proteins. All confocal images were quantified using settings where the intensity of GFP fluorescence was linear and ranged from 10 to 160 pixel values (30Piston D.V. Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 31-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Usually, 8-10 sections encompassing an entire cell were taken at 2.0-μm intervals. To examine the nuclear localization of GFP and GFP fusion proteins, a square with an area of 225 pixels was used to measure the mean intensities of three different regions in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of a representative cell from each of three transfections. Thus, three representative cells yielded a total of nine areas from the nucleus and nine areas from the cytoplasm. Relative nuclear localization is reported as the ratio of the mean intensity of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus and cytoplasm (nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio). Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Transfected cells were collected by scraping and then centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. SDS gel-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10% (v/v) glycerol) was added directly to the cell pellets. Cell lysates were clarified using sonication (10 s) and then centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge. Because heating converts FGF-2 into small peptides (31Thompson S.A. Protter A.A. Bitting L. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 96-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and FGF-2 has a propensity to oligomerize (32Davis J.C. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raj P.A. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cell lysates were treated with 20 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 10 min and then incubated with 100 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C before SDS-PAGE (33Sheng Z. Chang S.B. Chirico W.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described previously (33Sheng Z. Chang S.B. Chirico W.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, separated proteins were transferred onto the polyvinylidene difluoride sequencing membrane (Immobilon™-PSQ; Millipore Corp.), and the blot was blocked overnight in 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). GFP and GFP fusion proteins were detected using the mouse monoclonal GFP antibody (1:2000 diluted in TBST) (Clontech) and the mouse monoclonal FGF-2 antibody (1:1000 diluted in TBST) (Oncogene), respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10000 diluted in TBST) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody. The secondary antibody was detected using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 18-kDa FGF-2 Accumulated in the Nucleus—Although the nuclear translocation of exogenous and endogenous 18-kDa FGF-2 has been reported (7Bouche G.

In order to investigate signals controlling the subcellular localization of 18-kDa FGF-2, we fused its cDNA to the 3′-end of GFP cDNA. Plasmids encoding either GFP or GFP-FGF-2 were transfected into COS-7 cells, and expression of the proteins was verified using Western blotting. A 45-kDa protein was recognized by a GFP and an FGF-2 antibody, indicating that it was a fusion of GFP (27 kDa) and FGF-2 (18 kDa) (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4). GFP, but not FGF-2, was detected in cells transfected with the control plasmid (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). Endogenous FGF-2 was not detected, because it is expressed at very low levels in COS-7 cells (34Sohn Y.D. Lim H.J. Hwang K.C. Kwon J.H. Park H.Y. Chung K.H. Cho S.Y. Jang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of GFP and the GFP-FGF-2 fusion protein in COS-7 and HeLa cells was examined using fluorescence microscopy. GFP was distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 1B, a), whereas GFP-FGF-2 was predominantly localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1B, d). The position of the nucleus was determined using propidium iodide (Fig. 1B, b and e). Merged images confirmed that GFP-FGF-2 accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, c and f). Quantifying confocal images revealed that the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of GFP and GFP-FGF-2 in COS-7 cells was 2.4 and 10, respectively (Fig. 1C, gray bars). The same subcellular distribution of GFP and GFP-FGF-2 was observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C, white bars). We also placed FGF-2 cDNA at the 5′-end of GFP cDNA to produce an FGF-2-GFP fusion protein (Supplemental Data, Fig. S4, lane 1). The fluorescence patterns indicated that the subcellular distributions of FGF-2-GFP (Supplemental Data, Fig. S1, a) and GFP-FGF-2 (Fig. 1B, d) were identical. The subcellular distribution of GFP-F"

The herpes simplex virus UL13, varicella-zoster virus ORF47, and Epstein-Barr virus BGLF4 genes all show protein kinase domains in their protein sequences. Mutational analysis of these herpesviruses demonstrated that the viral kinase is important for optimal virus growth. Previous studies have shown that ORF36 of Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) has protein kinase activity and is autophosphorylated on serine. The gene for ORF36 is expressed during lytic growth of the virus and has been classified as a late gene. Inspection of the ORF36 sequence indicated potential motifs that could be involved in activation of cellular transcription factors. To analyze the function of ORF36, the cDNA for this viral gene was tagged with the FLAG epitope and inserted into an expression vector for mammalian cells. Transfection experiments in 293T and SLK cells demonstrated that expression of ORF36 resulted in phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Autophosphorylation of ORF36 is important for JNK activation because a mutation in the predicted catalytic domain of ORF36 blocked its ability to phosphorylate JNK. Western blot analysis, using phosphospecific antibodies, revealed that mitogen-activated kinases MKK4 and MKK7 were phosphorylated by ORF36 but not by the kinase-negative mutant. Binding experiments in transfected cells also demonstrated that both the wild type and kinase-negative mutant of ORF36 form a complex with JNK, MKK4, and MKK7. In addition, using a tetracycline-inducible Rta BCBL-1 cell line (TREx BCBL1-Rta), JNK was phosphorylated during lytic replication, and inhibition of JNK activation blocked late viral gene expression but not early viral gene expression. In summary, these studies demonstrate that KSHV ORF36 activates the JNK pathway; thus this cell signaling pathway may function in the KSHV life cycle by regulating viral and/or cellular transcription. α-, β-, and γ-Herpesviruses encode putative viral protein kinases.

Based on molecular and biological properties, the Herpesviridae family has been subdivided into the α-herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus), β-herpesvirus (human cytomegalovirus), and γ-herpesvirus (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 1The abbreviations used are: EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HSV, herpes simplex virus; VZV, varicella-zoster virus; KSHV, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEKK, MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; bZIP, basic region-leucine zipper; JIP, JNK-interacting protein; JSAP-1, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein-1; JNKi, JNK inhibitor.1The abbreviations used are: EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HSV, herpes simplex virus; VZV, varicella-zoster virus; KSHV, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEKK, MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; bZIP, basic region-leucine zipper; JIP, JNK-interacting protein; JSAP-1, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein-1; JNKi, JNK inhibitor. and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)) subfamilies (1Roizman B. Pellet P.E. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2381-2397Google Scholar). These double-stranded DNA viruses can remain latent and persist as an episome, expressing a limited number of viral genes, and thereby establish a lifelong infection in the natural host. Immunosuppression or stress can lead to reactivation of latent virus to produce pathogenic manifestations; examples include Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hodgkin's disease associated with EBV (for a review, see Ref. 2Kieff E. Rickinson A. Knipe D. Howley P. 4th Ed. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2576-2673Google Scholar) and Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphomas, and multicentric Castleman's disease associated with KSHV (for reviews, see Refs. 3Bubman D.

Reactivation of these latent herpesviruses leads to sequentially regulated expression of viral genes that play an essential role in the replication and assembly of infectious virions (2Kieff E.

During the lytic cycle of infection, herpesviruses express genes that are predicted to encode protein kinases (for a review, see Ref. 5Kawaguchi Y. Kato K. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These protein kinases are conserved among the Herpesviridae family, and analysis of the amino acid sequence reveals motifs that are shared by mammalian serine/threonine protein kinases. Located within the catalytic region of these viral proteins are 11 conserved subdomains that are common to cellular protein kinases. Recent studies have revealed that mutation of a conserved lysine residue within subdomain II abolishes phosphorylation; this finding shows that this region is necessary for the catalytic activity of these protein kinases (6Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 7Smith R.F. Smith T.F. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 450-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein kinases of herpesviruses appear to mimic the function of cellular protein kinases, including Cdc2 and cellular translational factor EF-1δ, by phosphorylating the same amino acid residues on their cognate protein targets (5Kawaguchi Y. Kato K. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Kawaguchi Y. Matsumura T. Roizman B. Hirai K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4456-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore the viral protein kinases are associated with the virion and may promote dissociation and entry of the virus particle by phosphorylating the viral tegument proteins (9Morrison E.E.

The importance of herpesvirus protein kinases for viral replication and disease has been investigated. Kinase-null mutants generated in α-, β-, and γ-herpesviruses demonstrate decreased replication in tissue culture (13Prichard M.N. Gao N. Jairath S. Mulamba G. Krosky P. Coen D.M. Parker B.O.

Decreased virulence of HSV and VZV kinase-null mutants has been shown in the mouse model (16Coulter L.J. Moss H.W. Lang J. McGeoch D.J. J. Gen.

However, the protein kinase of VZV appears to be dispensable for the establishment of latency in rodent models (14Sato H. Pesnicak L. Cohen J.I. J.

Studies on cells productively infected with α-, β-, and γ-herpesviruses have demonstrated that various members of the stress kinase pathway are activated. HSV activates JNK, p38, and AP1 (19McLean T.I. Bachenheimer S.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8415-8426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zachos G. Clements B. Conner J. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); and VZV activates AP1, Jun, Fos, and ATF-2 (23Rahaus M. Wolff M.H. Virus Res. 2003; 92: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For EBV, the latent membrane protein LMP2A regulates c-Jun through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (24Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the immediate early proteins of EBV, BZLF1 and BRLF1, activate ATF-2, p38, and JNK (25Adamson A.L. Darr D. Holley-Guthrie E. Johnson R.A. Mauser A. Swenson J. Kenney S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the K15 membrane protein of KSHV activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathways (26Brinkmann M.M. Glenn M. Rainbow L. Kieser A. Henke-Gendo C. Schulz T.F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9346-9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the role of the viral protein kinase in activating the stress kinase pathway for these herpesviruses remains to be determined. In KSHV, ORF36 encodes a serine protein kinase, which is localized in the nucleus of infected cells. In vitro kinase assays have indicated that this viral protein is autophosphorylated, and the lysine residue in the kinase subdomain II is essential for protein kinase activity (27Park J. Lee D. Seo T. Chung J. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Conservation of the viral protein kinases among the Herpesviridae family implies that these enzymes are indispensable for herpesvirus survival. Based on transcriptional kinetics and sensitivity to DNA replication inhibitors, ORF36 has been classified as a late gene (27Park J. Lee D. Seo T. Chung J. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Sun R. Lin S.F. Staskus K. Gradoville L. Grogan E. Haase A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2232-2242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactivation of KSHV in BCBL-1 cells (B-lymphocytes latently infected with KSHV) induces transcription of the viral protein kinase (27Park J. Lee D. Seo T. Chung J. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Understanding the cellular events that are regulated by the KSHV protein kinase may provide a basis for defining molecular mechanisms that control viral gene expression. Our studies demonstrate the ability of KSHV ORF36 to activate the JNK pathway and the cellular transcription factor c-Jun, and inhibition of JNK activation resulted in the inhibition of late KSHV viral gene expression. Antibodies—Phosphospecific antibodies for SEK1/MKK4 (Thr-261), MKK7 (Ser-271/Thr-275), stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), ATF-2 (Thr-71), c-Jun (Ser-63), cAMP-response element-binding protein (Ser-133), ELK-1 (Ser-383), and p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-phosphothreonine and -phosphoserine were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. MEK-4 (C-20), MEK-7 (H-160), JNK1 (full-length), c-Jun (N terminus), c-Myc, and tubulin (H-300) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG M2 was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies to KSHV K8.1 A/B were obtained from Advanced Biotechnologies Inc. (Columbia, MD). Cloning and Plasmids—The pND vector for expression in mammalian cells (a generous gift from Dr. G. Rhodes, University of California, Davis, CA) was used in the cloning of KSHV ORF36. cDNA was synthesized using RNA extracted from BCBL-1 (B-lymphocytes latently infected with KSHV) cells after 48 h of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment. KSHV ORF36 was amplified by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotide primers (5′-AAAAGATCTGCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGCGCTGGAAGAGAATGGAGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-AAAGCGGCCGCTCAGAAAACAAGTCCGCGGGT-3′) and cloned into pND. The resulting construct was designated pND-nFLAG-KSHV-ORF36. The forward primer generated a FLAG sequence at the N terminus. The QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used in the construction of pND-nFLAG-KSHV-ORF36(K108Q). Briefly pND-nFLAG-KSHV-ORF36 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′-TCCGAGGATCTGTGTGTTGCAGCAGTTTGATAGCCGCCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGCGGCTATCAAACTTGCTGCACACACAGATCCTCGGA-3′ to generate a kinase-negative mutant of KSHV ORF36 (lysine at position 108 mutated to glutamine). Cells and Transfections—293T and SLK cells (human endothelial cell origin, generous gift from Drs. Sophie Leventon-Kriss, Tel-Aviv, Israel and Jay A. Levy, University of California, San Francisco, CA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and cultures were maintained at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient expression of KSHV-ORF36 and KSHV-ORF36(K108Q) was performed by transfecting pND-nFLAG-KSHV-ORF36 or pND-nFLAG-KSHV-ORF36(K108Q) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Cells were used 24 h after transfection. Anisomycin-treated cells served as positive controls for JNK activation. The TREx BCBL1-Rta cell line (a generous gift from Dr. Jae U. Jung) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 250 μg/ml blasticidin S HCl (Invitrogen), and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). KSHV lytic replication was induced in this cell line with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Clontech). Cells were harvested 24 h postinduction. JNK Inhibition Assays—TREx BCBL1-Rta cells were treated with 50 nm JNK inhibitor II (SP600125) or 20 μm JNK inhibitor negative control (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) in the presence of 1 μg of doxycycline/ml for 24 h. Cells were harvested for Western blot. Preparation of Cell Extracts—For detection of phosphorylated cellular proteins or viral proteins, cells were treated with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue), sonicated for 15 s, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and cooled on ice. For immunoprecipitation, cells were treated with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged to remove cell debris. Western Blot Analysis—For detection of phosphoproteins, cells extracts were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blocking buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) was added to the membrane for 30 min at room temperature. Phosphospecific antibodies were diluted in primary antibody dilution buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin), and membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with wash buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Phosphoproteins were detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For detection of total JNK, MKK4, MKK7, K8.1, K-bZIP, and c-Myc (Rta), the respective primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature and then detected with rabbit or mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase and SuperSignal substrate. ORF36 Viral Protein Kinase Is Phosphorylated on Serine— The conserved lysine residue in the kinase subdomain II has been shown to be essential for kinase activity and autophosphorylation of ORF36 (27Park J. Lee D. Seo T. Chung J. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Smith G.A. Young P.L. Mattick J.S. Arch. Virol. 1991; 119: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that ORF36 was phosphorylated on serine and that the lysine at position 108 was important for its phosphorylation, we transfected 293T cells with plasmids expressing KSHV ORF36 or the mutant K108Q. Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognized phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine was used to analyze immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged ORF36 and the mutant K108Q proteins in transfected cells. A band that had the same molecular weight as FLAG-tagged ORF36 was detected with phosphoserine antibody (Fig. 1) but not with phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). The K108Q mutant protein of ORF36 was not detected with any of these three phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This finding demonstrates that the lysine at position 108 is important for the autophosphorylation of ORF36. ORF36 Activates c-Jun N-terminal Kinase—To evaluate the ability of KSHV ORF36 to phosphorylate the MAP kinase pathway, SLK cells were transfected with plasmids expressing ORF36 or the kinase-negative mutant K108Q. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed to prepare extracts for Western blot analysis. Cells transfected with the empty pND vector served as negative controls, and cells treated with anisomycin were positive controls for cell activation. As shown in Fig. 2, ORF36 activated the p54 isoform of JNK, which was phosphorylated on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185; the phosphospecific antibody for JNK recognizes JNK only when phosphorylated on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185. The p46 isoform of JNK was not phosphorylated by ORF36. The K108Q mutant was unable to phosphorylate either the p46 or p54 isoform of JNK. The p38 pathway and its downstream targets, ATF-2, cAMP-response element-binding protein, ELK-1, p44/42, and MKK3/MKK6, were analyzed to determine whether ORF36 exclusively activated the stress-activated protein kinase/JNK pathway. Western blot analysis demonstrated that these target proteins were not phosphorylated by either the wild type ORF36 or kinase-negative mutant K108Q (Fig. 2). ORF36 Activates JNK via MKK4 and MKK7—MKK4 and MKK7 function as non-redundant activators of JNK in vivo. Synergistic activation of MKK4 and MKK7 is required for optimal JNK activation. Maximal enzyme activity of JNK is achieved through phosphorylation of threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 with MKK4 having a preference for phosphorylating the tyrosine residue and MKK7 having a preference for the threonine residue (30Lisnock J.

To determine whether the viral kinase utilizes MKK4 and MKK7 in the activation of JNK, lysates from transfected cells expressing ORF36 or the mutant K108Q were analyzed by Western blot with appropriate antibodies. Fig. 3 demonstrates that both MKK4 and MKK7 were activated by ORF36 but not by the kinase-negative mutant K108Q. These observations reveal that the phosphorylation of JNK by ORF36 was dependent on the activation of both MKK4 and MKK7, and autophosphorylation of ORF36 at serine was important for this activity. Phosphorylation of c-Jun by ORF36 via JNK—Activated JNK regulates transcription by phosphorylating c-Jun, ATF-2, and other transcription factors. JNK phosphorylates the serine residues 63 and 73 of the transcription factor c-Jun, which in turn binds to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements and thereby increases c-Jun expression (34Hibi M.

To demonstrate whether KSHV ORF36 activation of JNK results in c-Jun phosphorylation, total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis for phosphorylation of c-Jun. Fig. 4 demonstrates that activation of JNK by KSHV ORF36 results in c-Jun phosphorylation; the kinase-negative mutant K108Q did not lead to phosphorylation of c-Jun. ORF36 Interacts with MKK4, MKK7, and JNK—Immunoprecipation studies demonstrated that scaffolding proteins, such as JIP-1/2 (JNK-interacting protein 1/2), JSAP-1 (JNK/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein-1), and β-arrestin-2, interact physically with their downstream targets. JIP-1 and JIP-2 form complexes with JNK, mixed lineage kinase, and MKK7 (38Ikeda A. Hasegawa K. Masaki M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Kozutsumi Y. Oka S. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem.

Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These enzyme complexes produce “MAP kinase modules,” which facilitate activation and enhance specificity of their respective target proteins (39Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). To assess the in vivo association of ORF36 with proteins in the JNK pathway, 293T cells were transfected with ORF36 or the mutant K108Q. Immunoprecipitation of total cell lysates with the FLAG, MKK4, MKK7, or JNK antibody demonstrated physical interaction of ORF36 with these cellular enzymes (Fig. 5). The kinase-negative mutant K108Q was also able to associate with MKK4, MKK7, and JNK. Thus, autophosphorylation of ORF36 was not important for association with MAP kinase modules and proceeded in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Activation of JNK during KSHV Reactivation—The KSHV viral protein Rta encoded by ORF50 is a transcriptional activator and acts as a molecular switch for KSHV reactivation. Expression of Rta efficiently induces lytic replication in latently infected KSHV cell lines. The TREx BCBL1-Rta cell line is a derivative of the BCBL-1 cell line (B-cell lymphoma cell line latently infected with KSHV) in which Rta is under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. This cell line was demonstrated to fully induce lytic replication and produce infectious viral progeny in the presence of tetracycline. In addition, the TREx BCBL1-Rta cell line was demonstrated to induce KSHV gene expression in a more powerful and efficient manner than that induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation of BCBL-1 cells (41Nakamura H. Lu M. Gwack Y. Souvlis J. Zeichner S.L. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4205-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TREx BCBL-1-Rta cells with doxycycline for 24 h stimulated the expression of Rta, and expression levels did not change with the addition of JNK inhibitor (JNKi) II or the JNKi negative inhibitor (Fig. 6). Anisomycin or untreated cells did not express Rta. The same cell lysates were used to determine the activation of JNK and c-Jun. Induction of lytic replication activated JNK and c-Jun, and this activation was abrogated in the presence of JNKi II. Inhibition of JNK also prevented expression of K8.1 (a KSHV glycoprotein that serves as a marker for viral late gene expression) but not K-bZIP (an early lytic gene identified as a basicleucine zipper protein) (Fig. 6). KSHV, a γ-2 herpesvirus, encodes a serine protein kinase (27Park J. Lee D. Seo T. Chung J. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results support previously published data, using phosphoamino acid analysis, that this kinase is phosphorylated on serine (Fig. 1) (27Park J. Lee D. Seo T. Chung J. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation was abrogated by mutating the lysine residue in the catalytic subdomain II of ORF36 (Fig. 1). In this study, we established a mechanism by which the viral protein kinase activates the mitogen-activated stress kinase pathway. Using transient transfection experiments, JNK was activated by KSHV ORF36 but not by the kinase-negative mutant K108Q (Fig. 2). This finding indicates that autophosphorylation of ORF36 was important for JNK activation. The p44/42, MKK3/6, and p38 pathways were not activated by ORF36, showing specificity for JNK activation (Fig. 2). Both MKK4 and MKK7 act synergistically to activate JNK (30Lisnock J. Griffin P.

J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates that ORF36 activates MKK4 and MKK7. These findings imply that JNK activation by ORF36 is via phosphorylation of MKK4 and MKK7. Recent data show that scaffolding proteins, such as JIP-1/2 and JSAP-1, associate with MEKK1, mixed lineage kinase, MKK4, MKK7, and JNK, forming enzyme complexes and facilitating the activation of the mitogen/stress-activated protein kinase pathway (38Ikeda A. Hasegawa K. Masaki M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Kozutsumi Y. Oka S. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J.

Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To demonstrate whether ORF36 associates with these complexes, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with antibodies specific for MKK4, MKK7, or JNK. These studies showed that KSHV ORF36 was associated with MKK4, MKK7, and JNK and that this association was independent of the phosphorylation state of ORF36. The significance of ORF36 activation of JNK is attributed to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor c-Jun. In addition, we demonstrated that inhibiting the activation of JNK during KSHV reactivation severely represses expression of the late lytic viral gene K8.1 but had no effect on the expression level of the early lytic gene K-bZIP (Fig. 6). This demonstrates that initiation of lytic infection and the transcription of early lytic genes may not require the activation of the JNK pathway. Conversely expression levels of K8.1, a structural glycoprotein component of KSHV particles, are dramatically reduced in the presence of SP600125. The physiological role of ORF36 for KSHV replication is not defined, but possible clues to its function have emerged from studies performed on homologous protein kinases found in other herpesviruses. Previous work demonstrated that α-, β-, and γ-herpesviruses encode viral protein kinases, which are represented by HSV-1 ULl3, VZV ORF47, human cytomegalovirus UL97, human herpesvirus-6 U69, EBV EGLF4, KSHV ORF36, and rhesus rhadinovirus ORF36 (5Kawaguchi Y.

Takahashi E. Hirai K. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similar to cellular serine/threonine protein kinases, these viral kinases contain 11 subdomains; a conserved lysine residue in subdomain II was important for kinase activity (44Chee M.S. Lawrence G.L. Barrell B.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 45Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). Conservation of these viral protein kinases among the Herpesviridae family and their homology to cellular serine kinases indicate indispensability for herpesvirus survival. A number of studies using kinase-null viral mutants demonstrated the importance of the kinase for regulating viral gene expression, replication, or tissue tropism. HSV UL13 kinase mediates post-translational processing and influences expression of several viral genes (46Purves F.C. Ogle W.O. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Human cytomegalovirus UL97 kinase-null mutants show replication deficiency in tissue culture, and the UL97 protein kinase is important for phosphorylation of multiple cellular targets (13Prichard M.N.

In addition to phosphorylating viral targets, cellular targets including casein kinase II β, EF-1δ, p60, and RNA polymerase II serve as substrates for herpesvirus protein kinases (5Kawaguchi Y. Kato K. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42Kawaguchi Y. Kato K. Tanaka M. Kanamori M. Nishiyama Y. Yamanashi Y. J.

Dis. 2003; 187: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Demonstrating conserved function between herpesvirus protein kinases, chimeric viruses expressing substituted protein kinases from other herpesviruses are partially able to compensate for lost function (54Ng T.I. Talarico C. Burnette T.C. Biron K. Roizman B. Virology. 1996; 225: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, these viral protein kinases were found in purified virus particles, suggesting a role in the assembly of virions or in virion entry into cells (10Overton H.A. McMillan D.J. Klavinskis L.S. Hope L. Ritchie A.J. Wong-kai-in P. Virology. 1992; 190: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12van Zeijl M. Fairhurst J. Baum E.Z. Sun L. Jones T.R. Virology. 1997; 231: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activation of the mitogen-activated stress kinase pathway is important for enhancing herpesvirus replication. Infection with HSV-1 resulted in the activation of JNK, c-Jun, p38, and AP1; enhancement of viral replication (19McLean T.I. Bachenheimer S.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8415-8426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zachos G. Clements B. Conner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5097-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); and phosphorylation of the transcription factor Sp1 (21Kim D.B. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6473-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). During VZV infection, activation of c-Jun, Fos, ATF-2, and AP1 was important for regulating viral genes (23Rahaus M. Wolff M.H. Virus Res. 2003; 92: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas activation of stress-activated MAP kinases up-regulated transgenes in cytomegalovirus infection (22Bruening W. Giasson B. Mushynski W. Durham H.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These observations on other herpesviruses have implications for our findings on the KSHV ORF36 kinase. Accordingly ORF36 might enhance viral replication by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase and hence modulating cellular transcription by activation of transcription regulated by c-Jun. KSHV and EBV also encode proteins that are capable of activating the mitogen-activated stress kinase pathway (24Chen S.Y. Lu J. Shih Y.C. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Adamson A.L. Darr D. Holley-Guthrie E. Johnson R.A. Mauser A. Swenson J. Kenney S. J.

Virol. 2003; 77: 9346-9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Functional studies to demonstrate the significance of these findings will provide clues to the relevance of the mitogen-activated stress kinase pathway in herpesvirus survival and transcription. Such studies could be based on the analysis of kinase-null mutants of the virus, dominant negative JNK pathway mutants, and specific inhibitors for the JNK pathway. Another possible role for ORF36 phosphorylation of JNK may be the activation of transcription factors encoded by KSHV. Marek disease virus, also a γ-herpesvirus, encodes MEQ, which mimics c-Jun. The MEQ protein shares extensive homology with the Jun/Fos family of transcription factors within the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain. In addition, MEQ dimerizes with itself and other cellular transcription factors and can functionally substitute for c-Jun (55Liu J.L. Kung H.J. Virus Genes. 2000; 21: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KSHV also encodes a gene with a basic region-leucine zipper domain; this protein has been designated K-bZIP and shows homology with BZLF1, an EBV protein essential for viral reactivation and replication (56Lin S.F. Robinson D.R. Miller G. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Izumiya Y. Lin S.F. Ellison T. Chen L.Y. Izumiya C. Luciw P. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ORF36 plays a role in the activation of KSHV transcription by activating viral homologs of cellular c-Jun. Consequently KSHV ORF36 (a viral late protein) might target an immediate early viral protein, such as K-bZIP. This proposed model is supported by the finding that herpesvirus protein kinases are found in purified virions (10Overton H.A. McMillan D.J. Klavinskis L.S. Hope L. Ritchie A.J. Wong-kai-in P. Virology. 1992; 190: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12van Zeijl M. Fairhurst J. Baum E.Z. Sun L. Jones T.R. Virology. 1997; 231: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In fact, using in vitro kinase assays, ORF36 was shown to phosphorylate K-bZIP. 2M. S. Hamza, R. A. Reyes, Y. Izumiya, R. Wisdom, H.-J. Kung, and P. A. Luciw, unpublished results. Future studies to define the role of ORF36 in KSHV replication and transcription will provide clues into the mechanism by which herpesviruses modulate host cell signaling pathways and maintain their survival within the infected host.

https://openalex.org/W2088300767,"This work compares the effect of photogenerated singlet oxygen (O2(1Δg)) (type II mechanism) and free radicals (type I mechanism) on cytochrome c structure and reactivity. Both reactive species were obtained by photoexcitation of methylene blue (MB+) in the monomer and dimer forms, respectively. The monomer form is predominant at low dye concentrations (up to 8 μm) or in the presence of an excess of SDS micelles, while dimers are predominant at 0.7 mm SDS. Over a pH range in which cytochrome c is in the native form, O2 (1Δg) and free radicals induced a Soret band blue shift (from 409 to 405 nm), predominantly. EPR measurements revealed that the blue shift of the Soret band was compatible with conversion of the heme iron from its native low spin state to a high spin state with axial symmetry (g ∼ 6.0). Soret band bleaching, due to direct attack on the heme group, was only detected under conditions that favored free radical production (MB+ dimer in SDS micelles) or in the presence of a less structured form of the protein (above pH 9.3). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the heme group and the polypeptide chain of cytochrome c with Soret band at 405 nm (cytc405) revealed no alterations in the mass of the cytc405 heme group but oxidative modifications on methionine (Met65 and Met80) and tyrosine (Tyr74) residues. Damage of cytc405 tyrosine residue impaired its reduction by diphenylacetaldehyde, but not by β-mercaptoethanol, which was able to reduce cytc405, generating cytochrome c Fe(II) in the high spin state (spin 2).

Damage of cytc405 tyrosine residue impaired its reduction by diphenylacetaldehyde, but not by β-mercaptoethanol, which was able to reduce cytc405, generating cytochrome c Fe(II) in the high spin state (spin 2). The association of cytochrome c with lipid bilayers is modulated by the heme iron redox states (1Nantes I.L. Zucchi M.R. Nascimento O.R. Faljoni-Alario A. J. Biol.

Med. 2000; 28: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These reactions produce free radicals and excited states, both able to attack cytochrome c amino acid side chains and heme group. In this regard, the reaction of cytochrome c with t-butyl-hydroperoxide leads to bleaching of the Soret band, with conversion of the hemeprotein from its low spin form with rhombic symmetry to a high spin form with axial and rhombic symmetry (3Nantes I.L. Faljoni-Alario A. Vercesi A.E. Santos K.E. Bechara E.J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this case, the damage in the heme group was promoted by free radicals, but similar effects are also expected from excited species. Among the excited species, singlet oxygen O2(1Δg) is of particular interest because of its high electrophilicity and relatively long lifetime (2–4 μs in H2O and ∼700 μs in CCl4) (5Moroe B.M. Frimer A.A. Singlet O2. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 177-224Google Scholar). This excited species, which can be generated by an energy transfer mechanism (6Foote C.S. Photochem.

In the case of hemeproteins, this excited species can damage both the apoproteins and the prosthetic group (21Michaeli A. Feitelson J. Photochem.

Because the vital biological function of these proteins is dependent on the integrity of the heme group, it is to be expected that the heme group is particularly resistant to modifications by reactive species, including O2(1Δg). In fact, when hemoglobin and c-phycocyanin are exposed to O2(1Δg), chemical modifications of the chromophore constitute only a minor reaction pathway. However, although data reported in the literature have demonstrated O2(1Δg)-induced modifications in the heme group of Neurospora crassa catalase, the chemical nature of the modifications is still under investigation (24Michan S.

The mechanism of tumoral destruction involves the direct oxidation (type I mechanism) of biological targets (membranes, proteins, and DNA), as well as oxidation mediated by O2(1Δg) (type II mechanism) (30Foote C.S. Science. 1968; 162: 963Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In the type II mechanism, O2(1Δg) is generated through energy transferred from excited triplet species to molecular oxygen (30Foote C.S. Science. 1968; 162: 963Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The use of sensitizers that accumulate in proliferating cells to treat tumors and other diseases is currently widespread. In this regard, methylene blue (MB+) 1The abbreviations used are: MB, methylene blue; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; EPR, electron spin resonance; cytc405, cytochrome c with Soret band at 405 nm; DPAA, diphenylacetaldehyde. is a sensitizer used in vitro for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and photodynamic therapy (31Tuiete E.M. Kelly J.M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 21: 103-124Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c is a mitochondrial protein fundamental to the cell's respiratory process. The fact that the apoptosis cascade involves cytochrome c-promoted caspase activation (32Yang J. Liu X.S. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 33Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 7770-7775Crossref Scopus (4289) Google Scholar) demonstrates that, in the cells, cytochrome c plays a broader role than the transport of electrons in the respiratory chain. Therefore, O2(1Δg)-mediated alterations in cytochrome c structure and reactivity can influence activation of caspases in the apoptosome. On the other hand, photodynamic generation of O2(1Δg) is also accompanied by free radical production (34Severino D. Junqueira H. Gabriele D. Gugliotti M. Baptista M.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 77: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and discriminating the effect of each reactive species on the cytochrome c structure still poses a challenge. Chemicals—Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III) and SDS were acquired from Sigma. MB+ was purchased from Aldrich and double recrystallized from ethanol. Diphenylacetaldehyde was purchased from Aldrich. Ile7-angiotensin III (AngIII), human adrenocorticotropic hormone fragments 18–36 (hACTH-(18–36)), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, sinapinnic acid, and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Upsala, Sweden). Sequencing grade trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Water was bidistilled from an all-glass apparatus and further purified via a Millipore Milli-Q system. Generation of O2(1Δg) by Photosensitization of MB+—Samples were irradiated at 35 °C in a glass chamber, in either deionized water or 5 mm phosphate buffer. A 500-watt halogen light bulb, set at a distance of 30 cm, was used with a cutoff glass filter (500 nm ± 50 nm; wavelength mean value ± half bandwidth, Melles Griot). The glass chamber was cooled by circulating water. Wherever indicated, irradiation was done in deuterium oxide (D2O). Other additions are indicated in the figure captions. Purification of Cytochrome c Modified by Reactive Species—The samples containing cytochrome c with Soret band peaking at 405 nm (cytc405) were purified with Chelex 100®, which exhibits a binding affinity to MB+. Purification of MB+ with Chelex 100® particles was monitored by spectrophotometry, indicating the disappearance of the MB+ absorbance spectrum. SDS-Polyacrylamide Slab Gel Electrophoresis—Aliquots of native cytochrome c and cytc405 were subjected to electrophoresis performed according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Electronic Absorption Spectrometry—Electronic absorption measurements of cytochrome c were conducted in a photodiode spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, MD), using quartz cuvettes of 1-cm light path and a slit of 0.5 nm. EPR Spectrometry—Direct EPR measurements of cytochrome c (100 μm) were taken using an EPR Bruker system ELEXSYS model E-580. The measurement conditions were gain: 5 × 103, modulation amplitude: 1.0 mT (for heme iron); microwave power: 4 milliwatts, temperature: 11 K, time constant: 1.28 ms, and conversion time: 81.92 ms. The samples were introduced into an EPR quartz tube and precooled in liquid nitrogen before being placed in the microwave cavity at low temperature. Heme Group Removal from Native Cytochrome c and cytc405—The heme group of native and oxidized cytochrome c was removed as described previously (36Goldberg M.E. Schaeffer F. Guillou Y. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16052-16061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 100 mg of holocytochrome c were dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water and supplemented first with 160 mg of silver sulfate dissolved in 18 ml of water and then with 1.6 ml of pure acetic acid. The mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 4 h and then centrifuged to obtain the pellet containing the heme group. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Time-of-flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometry—The MALDI-TOF MS analyses were performed using an Ettan MALDI-TOF Pro system equipped with a quadratic-field reflectron and a timed ion gate. Protein identification was conducted in reflectron mode with positive ionization at 20 kV. The sample was, in this case, mixed with an equal volume of 50% acetonitrile, and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. A 0.5 μl of the mixture (containing 8 pmol of protein) was loaded onto the stainless steel MALDI slides for analysis. The external calibration was performed before protein identification with AngIII and hACTH-(18–36). The data were analyzed using the Ettan MALDI-ToF Pro software system. Effect of pH on O2(1Δg)-induced Oxidative Modifications on Cytochrome c—Cytochrome c was exposed to O2(1Δg) generated by irradiation of MB+ (methylene blue), over a pH range of 3.0 to 12.0. Fig. 1 and its inset show alterations in the cytochrome c spectra promoted by O2(1Δg) at pH 7.4. The inset shows spectral changes in the cytochrome c Q bands obtained after subtraction of the spectral contribution of MB+ in the visible range. The spectrum of cytochrome c in the presence of MB+, obtained before irradiation (time 0), was typical of native cytochrome c Fe(III) low spin state (thick solid line). This result suggests that MB+ did not induce any significant alteration in the cytochrome c structure and heme iron spin states. Upon irradiation, two phenomena occurred concomitantly: the reduction of cytochrome c by excited MB+ and irreversible conversion of cytochrome c Fe(II) to Fe(III) mediated by O2(1Δg) associated with bleaching and blue shift of the Soret band (left panel and inset). In the early stages of irradiation, the reduction of cytochrome c was predominant, and the spectrum corresponded to the partial conversion of cytochrome c from ferric to ferrous form (dotted line, left panel and inset). At this time, the bleaching of the Soret band was already evident. As the irradiation progressed, irreversible heme iron oxidation took place (thin solid line, left panel and inset). Progressive bleaching of MB+ 664 nm occurred throughout the irradiation (Fig. 1, right panel). Similar results were obtained in a phosphate-buffered solution of D2O, at pD 7.8 (not shown), but the rate of the irreversible heme iron oxidation was rose 6.5-fold (kobs in water = 0.81 ± 0.08 ms–1 and kobs in D2O = 5.4 ± 0,75 ms–1). The rate of cytochrome c reduction and oxidation was measured over a pH range of 3.0 to 9.0 in which cytochrome c remains in its native conformation and spin state. Within this range of pH, different rates of cytochrome c reduction promoted by MB+ and the irreversible heme iron re-oxidation produced by O2(1Δg) were obtained. Fig. 2A shows the kinetic curves for cytochrome c reduction and subsequent re-oxidation obtained in carbonate buffer, pH 6.1, 7.2, and 9.1, according to changes in the intensity of Q bands (insets). Fig. 2B shows the titration curves for the two processes compared with the pH curve for the O2(1Δg) quantum yield resulting from the energy transfer from 3MB+* (triplet MB+) to O2 in the triplet ground state O2(3Σg-) and obtained from Ref. 37Bonneau R. Pottier R. Bagno O. Joussot-Dubien J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1975; 21: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar. In this work, the authors demonstrated that the quantum yield of 3MB+* produced by irradiation and the generation of O2(1Δg) by energy transfer both obey the same pH curve, since the former gives rise to the latter. According to Fig. 2B, only the pH curve for the irreversible oxidation (pKa = 6.3) remained close to the pH curve for the O2(1Δg) quantum yield previously determined, which displays a pKa value = 7.0. Complete cytochrome c reduction, without subsequent blue shift of the Soret band, was detected during irradiation of MB+, when the O2(1Δg) yield was drastically decreased by N2 purging of the medium or by chemical and physical trapping by histidine or urate added to the solution (not shown). These results suggested that the oxidative damage in the cytochrome c structure was dependent on the triplet MB+ and O2(1Δg) quantum yields, but the limiting-rate factor for the photochemical reduction of cytochrome c heme iron did not depend on the quantum yield of triplet species.Fig. 2A, kinetic curves for cytochrome c heme iron reduction (upper panel) and subsequent re-oxidation (lower panel) during irradiation in the presence of MB+. The kinetic profiles for both processes were obtained according to changes in Q bands (increased absorbance intensity at 549 nm) shown in the insets. The spectra shown in the insets were obtained after subtracting the contribution of MB+ spectra in this region. The inset in the upper panel shows cytochrome c spectra obtained at 0, 1, 2, and 3 min at pH 7.2 while the inset in the lower panel corresponds to 4, 10, 15, and 30 min at pH 7.2. The experiments were carried out in 5 mm carbonate buffer in pH 6.1 (open circle), 7.2 (solid diamond), and 9.1 (solid circle) at 35 °C. B, pH curves for the cytochrome c heme iron reduction and re-oxidation compared with the pH curve for photochemically generated O2(1Δg) yield obtained from data of Ref. 40Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J.

The experiments were carried out in 5 mm carbonate buffer at 35 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At highly alkaline pH values (11.0–12.0), where cytochrome c is not in the native conformation, the irradiation of the protein in the presence of MB+ with visible light led to a progressive bleaching of the Soret band, without significant alterations in the maximal peak wavelength (not shown). Similar results were obtained when the reaction was performed in D2O phosphate buffer, but bleaching was considerably faster (not shown). The rate constant (kobs) for the O2(1Δg)-mediated Soret band bleaching was calculated at 0.21 ms–1 in buffered water and at 1.4 ms–1 in buffered D2O. Therefore, in this condition, the quantum yield of O2(1Δg) was also the limiting-rate factor for the oxidative damage of the protein. The intense bleaching observed at high pH values (above cytochrome c pI) suggested damage in the protein's prosthetic group. In the Presence of SDS Micelles It Was Possible to Discriminate the Effect of Free Radicals and O2(1Δg) on Cytochrome c Structure—In aqueous aerated solution, photosensitized MB+ can give rise to both type I and II mechanisms. In order to clarify the specific contribution of the oxidative species, O2(1Δg) and free radicals, cytochrome c was exposed to conditions that favored either type I or II mechanisms (38Junqueira H.C. Severino D. Dias L.G. Gugliotti M.S. Baptista M.S. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2002; 230: 111-119Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that, at pH 7.4, in the presence of excess SDS micelles, type II mechanism predominated, and the irradiation of cytochrome c led to a blue shift of the Soret band without previous detection of heme iron reduction. In this condition, after the blue shift, only discrete bleaching of the Soret band was detected. At the same pH value, when type I mechanism was predominant, only bleaching of the Soret band (Fig. 3B) was detected. Bleaching of the cytochrome c Soret band has already been observed upon exposure of cytochrome c to free radicals generated in the course of the reaction between cytochrome c heme iron and t-butyl hydroperoxide (4Nantes I.L. Faljoni-Alario A. Nascimento O.R. Bandy B. Gatti R. Bechara E.J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These alterations in cytochrome c Soret band were associated to different cytochrome c spin states detectable by direct EPR of the heme iron. Concentration of cytochrome c samples was a limiting factor to detect heme iron EPR signal. Therefore, all EPR data were obtained in high protein (higher than 100 μm) and dye concentrations and were accompanied by simultaneous UV-vis spectra (not shown) in order to ensure the presence of either MB+ dimer or monomer forms. In this condition, a longer irradiation time (50 min) was required to obtain the same alterations in the spectrum of cytochrome c obtained in shorter irradiation times in low protein and dye concentrations. This may be attributed to the effect of an internal filter produced by the high concentration of the dye and the protein. In a homogeneous medium, under the experimental conditions required to acquire EPR spectra, MB+ was predominantly in the dimer form (not shown) and therefore, under irradiation, generated predominantly free radicals. The EPR spectra were analyzed considering the different proportions of cytochrome c high spin states obtained in 50 min of irradiation, with g = 6.0, assigned to protein with amino acid residues oxidized and with g = 4.3, assigned to protein with damage in both amino acid residues and prosthetic group. Fig. 4A, spectrum a, shows the EPR spectrum (X-band) of 100 μm cytochrome c in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 11 K, a condition in which cytochrome c is in the native form. Spectrum a corresponds to the well-known Fe(III) low-spin form with a rhombic symmetry that displays signals at g// = 3.07 and g⊥ = 2.23. After 30 s of irradiation, the EPR signal of Fe(III) low spin form was drastically decreased (spectrum b), which was coherent with cytochrome c reduction previously observed in the early stages of irradiation (Fig. 1, dashed line, left panel and inset). In the subsequent spectra, obtained at different MB+ irradiation times, it was possible to see the appearance and increase of two forms of heme iron spin states represented by spectrum c. Spectrum c indicates the presence of the high spin Fe(III) form with axial symmetry (g = 6.0) and a small amount of the high spin Fe(III) form with rhombic symmetry (g = 4.3). The intensity of the signal of each high spin state was quantified and the proportion of the high spin states expressed as the ratio of the maximal intensity obtained for each spectra (g = 6.0/g = 4.3 ratio). After 50 min of irradiation in aerated medium, the g = 6.0/g = 4.3 ratio was ∼4.0. In this sample, a change of cytochrome c low spin species to high spin species was accompanied by a blue shift with discrete bleaching of the Soret band (not shown). According to data in the literature (3Nantes I.L. Faljoni-Alario A. Vercesi A.E. Santos K.E. Bechara E.J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), these results suggested the loss of the heme iron sixth coordination due to oxidation of the Met80 residue by free radicals. In N2 saturated buffer, the EPR spectrum obtained after 30 s of irradiation showed significant loss of the heme iron low spin state signal, which was compatible with the conversion of cytochrome c from ferric to ferrous form (spectrum d). After 50 s of irradiation, a small amount of g = 6.0 and 4.3 species was detected (spectrum e) and the g = 6.0/g = 4.3 ratio was ∼2.0. In this case, the impairment of heme iron oxidation by molecular oxygen prevented the detection of the EPR signal from native and damaged protein. During irradiation in the high field region, the appearance of a free radical spectrum was evident (solid line). A computational simulation revealed g0 = 1/3 (g1 + g2 + g3) equal to 2.0079, where g1 = 2.0100, g2 = 2.0088, and g3 = 2.0050. This free radical signal was also evident when the experiments were performed at pH 12.0 (not shown). EPR spectra of cytochrome c heme iron obtained during irradiation at pH 12 exhibited a higher yield of the species, with g = 4.3, since the g = 6.0/g = 4.3 ratio decreased to ∼0.9 (spectra not shown). This result was coherent with a major exposure of the heme group to the attack by free radicals. Similarly to what was observed at pH = 7.4, the yield of g = 6.0 was impaired when irradiation occurred in an N2 atmosphere. In this condition, the yield of g = 4.3 species remained the same and the g = 6.0/g = 4.3 ratio decreased to 0.35 (spectra not shown). Considering the less compact cytochrome c structure at pH 12.0, this result suggested that a free radical-mediated attack on the heme group would be improbable without concomitant re-oxidation of the heme iron. In the experimental conditions for EPR measurements, the exclusive monomer form of MB+ and predominant generation of O2(1Δg), can only be achieved in the presence of high SDS concentrations (above 15 mm). In this condition, g = 6.0/g = 4.3 ratio increased to 20.0 due to a high yield of the high spin Fe(III) form with axial symmetry (g = 6.0) (Fig. 4B). In the micellar medium, the absence of significant amounts of the g = 4.3 species characteristic of oxidized porphyrin (4Nantes I.L. Faljoni-Alario A. Nascimento O.R. Bandy B. Gatti R. Bechara E.J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicated that, in the presence of SDS micelles, O2(1Δg) attacks the cytochrome c heme group less efficiently than free radicals. Photochemically generated O2(1Δg) Attacks Cytochrome c Side Chain Amino Acids and Changes the Reactivity of the Hemeprotein—Two mechanisms may account for the O2(1Δg)-mediated cytochrome c conversion from low to high spin state with g = 6.0 and Soret band peaking at 405 nm, herein named cytc405: attack on the heme group or attack on amino acid side chains leading to changes in the protein structure. The main amino acid residues that are targets for O2(1Δg) are present in the cytochrome c structure, but with differing degrees of accessibility. Cytochrome c structure exhibits two methionine residues (65 and 80), four tyrosine residues (48, 67, 74, and 98), one tryptophan residue (59), and three histidine residues (18, 26, and 33). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of cytochrome c fragments obtained by digestion with trypsin, exposed for different lengths of time to photochemically generated O2(1Δg), revealed, after 30 s of irradiation, a mass increase of 16 units in the fragment containing amino acid residues from 56 to 73 (Table I). In this fragment, both Met65 and Tyr67 are candidate targets for the pro-oxidant species. However, it is more probable that the oxidation process occurred in Met65 since it is more accessible in cytochrome c structure. In this case, the mass increase of 16 units was compatible with the formation of sulfoxide derivate (Table I). Besides the Met65 oxidation, the protein fragments containing oxidized Met80 and Tyr74 (increase of 16 units) were also observed after trypsin digestion of samples subjected to irradiation for 5 and 120 min (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2034916432,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a family of mammalian serine/threonine phosphatases that is involved in the control of many cellular functions including those mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. While investigating the reversible antiproliferative effect of the dietary lectin, jacalin, which binds the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (galactose β1–3 N-acetylgalactosamine α-), we have found that this lectin (30 μg/ml) induces rapid, transient, tyrosine phosphorylation of putative human HLA-DR-associated protein I (PHAPI, also known as the tumor suppressor pp32) in HT29 human colon cancer cells. This is accompanied by the release of PP2A from association with PHAPI, allowing increased phosphatase activity of PP2A (by 42 ± 10% at 10 min) and consequent complete dephosphorylation of the ERK kinase, MEK1/2, by 10 min and of ERK1/2 by 60 min. PHAPI knockdown by RNA interference abolished the effects of jacalin on PP2A activation and MEK inhibition. Thus phosphorylation of PHAPI/pp32 is a critical regulatory step in PP2A activation and ERK signaling."

Recently, we have demonstrated that the ALS2 protein specifically binds to the small GTPase Rab5 and acts as a GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) for Rab5. We have also shown that its Rab5GEF-requisite domain resides within the C-terminal 640-amino acid region spanning membrane occupation and recognition nexus motifs and the vacuolar protein sorting 9 domain. Transiently expressed ALS2 localized onto early endosomal compartments and stimulated endosome fusions in neuronal and non-neuronal cells in an Rab5GEF activity-dependent manner. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of ALS2 plays a crucial role in endosomal dynamics by its Rab5GEF activity. Here we delineate a molecular feature of the ALS2-associated function through the C-terminal region-mediated homo-oligomerization. A yeast two-hybrid screen for interacting proteins with the ALS2 C-terminal portion identified ALS2 itself. ALS2 forms a homophilic oligomer through its distinct C-terminal regions. This homo-oligomerization is crucial for the Rab5GEF activity in vitro and the ALS2-mediated endosome enlargement in the cells.

Although RCC1 acts as a GEF for Ran (Ras-related nuclear) GTPase (9Ohtsubo M. Kai R. Furuno N. Sekiguchi T. Sekiguchi M. Hayashida H. Kuma K. Miyata T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. Matsubara K. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the functions for RLD domains are still unclear. RLD is followed by a tandem organization of Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which is a hallmark for GEFs for Rho (Ras homologous member) GTPases (14Schimit A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of ALS2 harbors a vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9) domain, which has been found in Rab5 (Ras-related in brain 5) GEFs, including Vps9 (15Burd C.G. Mustol P.A. Schu P.V. Emr S.D.

The small GTPases generally control a wide range of fundamental cellular processes, including nuclear transport, cytoskeletal reorganization, transcription, cell migration, and membrane trafficking (22Dasso M.

They serve as binary switches, cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states (28Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2662) Google Scholar). GEFs are known to activate the small GTPases by stimulating the release of GDP in exchange for GTP (29Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). In light of conserved GEF domains of ALS2, it appears to act as an activator of particular small GTPases, thereby regulating specific cellular processes. We have recently demonstrated that one of three conserved GEF domains, VPS9, functions as an essential element for the ALS2-associated Rab5GEF activity (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Transiently expressed ALS2 localized onto early endosomal compartments and facilitated the enlargement of endosomes in primary cultured cortical neurons (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of the ALS2 fragment comprising aa 660–1657 lacking RLD (ALS2_660–1657), which functioned as a constitutive active form, induced the prominent enlargement of endosomes (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, two Rab5GEF-defective VPS9 mutants, including ALS2_660–1657 (P1603A) and ALS2_660–1657 (L1617A), showed no enlarged endosome phenotypes (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), implying that the Rab5GEF activity is primarily important. We have also shown that the functional domain for the Rab5GEF activity resides within the C-terminal 640-aa region spanning MORN and VPS9 domains. Based upon these findings, it is certain that the MORN/VPS9 region of ALS2 is one of the requisite domains for the ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism by which the ALS2 C-terminal MORN/VPS9 region takes part in early stages of the endocytic pathway is largely unknown. To gain an insight into the molecular functions inherent in MORN/VPS9 domains, we investigated the C-terminal domain-interacting proteins by a Y2H screen. Surprisingly, the ALS2 protein itself was identified as an interactor for the C-terminal region of ALS2. In this study, we delineate the molecular basis of the ALS2 self-interaction and its implication in the Rab5GEF activity as well as endosomal dynamics. Y2H showed that this self-interaction was mediated by two distinct C-terminal regions both of which were mapped within the MORN/VPS9 region. Immunoprecipitation and gel filtration analyses demonstrated that ALS2 homo-oligomerized in mammalian cells. The oligomerization-defective ALS2 mutant completely abolished the Rab5GEF activity in vitro and its endosomal localization in the cells, despite the intactness of its binding ability to Rab5A in vitro. Thus, the ALS2·Rab5 binding is not sufficient enough to activate Rab5, but rather ALS2 oligomer formation should be an important determinant for the ALS2-associated Rab5GEF activity. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that ALS2 homo-oligomerization is crucial for its physiological function involving endosome dynamics. Antibodies and Materials—Monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2), anti-HA, anti-Rab5, and anti-early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) antibodies were purchased from Stratagene, Sigma, BD Transduction Laboratories, and BD Biosciences, respectively. Anti-ALS2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (MPF 1012–1651) was raised with the purified His-tagged mouse ALS2_1012–1651 fragment, followed by affinity purification using an antigen-coupled Sepharose column. MPF 1012–1651 allowed the detection of both mouse and human ALS2 proteins (data not shown). All other regents were from commercial sources and of analytical grade. Plasmid Constructs—All the cDNA expression constructs used in this study were obtained by subcloning the PCR or the reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified fragments into the appropriate expression vectors. The DNA sequence of the insert as well as the flanking regions in each plasmid construct were verified by sequencing. For the Y2H assay, the PCR-amplified cDNA fragments of ALS2 were subcloned into pLexA (Clontech) and pB42AD (Clontech) to generate pLexA-ALS2 constructs (bait) and pB42AD-ALS2 constructs (prey), respectively. For co-immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, in vitro GEF assay, and in vitro Rab5A binding experiments, the cDNA fragments of ALS2 and Trio (aa 1233–1628), a RhoGEF, were subcloned into the modified pCI-neo Mammalian Expression Vector (Promega), allowing the production of the N-terminally FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins. The previously generated pCIneoFLAG-ALS2_L (full-length), pCIneoFLAG-ALS2_1018–1657, and pGEX6P-Rab5A were also utilized (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs expressing deletion mutant forms of ALS2, including pCIneoFLAG-ALS2_1018–1657 (Δ1515–1531), and pCIneoFLAG-ALS2_L (Δ1280–1335) were generated by a PCR-based method. pCIneoFLAG-ALS2_1100–1657 (Δ1280–1335) were generated by subcloning the reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified ALS2 splicing variant, which lacked the entire exon 25. For the subcellular localization studies, N-terminally enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-fused ALS2 proteins expression plasmids pEGFP-ALS2_695–1657, pEGFP-ALS2_695–1657 (Δ1280–1335), and pEGFP-ALS2_695–1657 (Δ1515–1531) were generated by subcloning the PCR-amplified ALS2 fragment, or deletion mutant forms of the same fragments, into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A Y2H screen was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions by utilizing the MATCHMAKER LexA Two-Hybrid System (Clontech). A human brain cDNA library (Clontech) in the pB42AD vector was screened with ALS2_1041–1351 as a bait. Briefly, the yeast strain, EGY48 [p8op-LacZ], was sequentially transformed with pLexA-ALS2_1041–1351 and then with a brain cDNA library. Co-transformants were selected on synthetic dropout (DO) media (Clontech) lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, but including 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) by activation of both the leucine and the LacZ reporter genes. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Transfections were performed by using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were transfected with pCI-neoFLAG-ALS2 constructs and/or pCIneoHA-ALS2 constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with 150 mm NaCl and lysed in buffer A consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)/50 ml of the buffer. After gently rotating for 1 h at 4 °C, supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, followed by immunoprecipitation with Ezview™ Red ANTI-FLAG® M2 affinity gel (Sigma) (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The M2 affinity gels were washed three times with the ice-cold buffer A containing 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 instead of 1% IGEPAL CA-630. Appropriate amounts of the immunoprecipitates were used for Western blot analysis with either the anti-FLAG M2 or anti-HA antibodies. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples in Laemmli SDS-sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h and probed with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:3000), anti-HA antibody (1:3000), or anti-ALS2 polyclonal antibody (MPF 1012–1651) (1:3000), followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG sheep secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were visualized by the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences) and BioMax x-ray films (Kodak). Preparation of FLAG-tagged ALS2 and Trio Proteins—FLAG-tagged ALS2 fragments and Trio DH/PH domain (aa 1233–1628) were prepared as described previously (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The N-terminally FLAG-tagged ALS2 or Trio proteins bound to the anti-FLAG M2-beads were resuspended in the appropriate buffers (described below in each section) for the gel filtration, GEF assay, or in vitro Rab5A binding experiments. A portion of the proteins was subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody or SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to estimate the amount of conjugating FLAG-tagged proteins on the beads. Gel Filtration—FLAG-tagged ALS2_L and FLAG-tagged ALS2_ 1018–1657 proteins on the beads were re-suspended in buffer B consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 and subsequently eluted with buffer B containing 500 ng/ml 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. ∼30 pmol of FLAG-tagged ALS2_L or FLAG-tagged ALS2_1018–1657 was applied to a Superdex 200 column (HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with buffer B beforehand. Elution was carried out at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with a fraction volume of 0.5 ml. Fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-ALS2 polyclonal antibody (MPF 1012–1651). The elution profile of the column was calibrated with the sizing standards (Amersham Biosciences) of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa). GEF Assay—The in vitro GEF assay was conducted as previously described (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, the N-terminally FLAG-tagged ALS2 proteins were purified by the immunoprecipitations from COS-7 cells transfected with the appropriate pCIneoFLAG constructs. The small GTPase Rab5A was also prepared as previously described (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). 4 pmol of the [3H]GDP-preloaded Rab5A was subjected to the in vitro GDP/GTP exchange reaction in the presence of FLAG M2 gel beads alone or FLAG M2 beads conjugating 2 pmol of the immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged ALS2 proteins. The percentages of bound [3H]GDP on Rab5 after 1-h incubation at 30 °C were calculated. In Vitro Rab5A Binding to the FLAG-tagged ALS2 Proteins—Purified Rab5A (4 pmol) was incubated with FLAG M2 beads conjugating 4 pmol of the immunopurified FLAG-tagged ALS2 proteins in 100 μl of the modified GEF buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CHAPS, 0.1% (w/v) skim milk for 2 h at 30 °C. After washing four times with the same buffer without skim milk, the FLAG M2 beads were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Rab5 or anti-FLAG M2 antibodies. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence studies were carried out as previously described (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP-ALS2 constructs were washed with PBS (–) twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (–) for 30 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (–) for 30 min. Anti-EEA1 monoclonal antibody, diluted in PBS (–) containing 1.5% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100, were added to the fixed cells and incubated for 12 h. Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes) was utilized as a secondary antibody to detect endogenous EEA1. Finally, images of serial optical sections with 1- to 2-μm thickness were captured and analyzed by Leica TCS_NT confocal-microscope systems (Leica). Identification of the ALS2 Self-interaction—As we have previously described, the ALS2 protein is thought to involve in endosomal dynamics in vivo through the Rab5GEF activity mediated by the C-terminal MORN/VPS9 region of ALS2. The Rab5GEF-defective mutants of ALS2 lost their functions (30Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how the MORN/VPS9 domains play the role in endosomal dynamics. To gain more insight into the molecular functions inherent in MORN/VPS9 domains, we screened a human brain cDNA library for the C-terminal domain-interacting proteins by the Y2H system. A screen with ALS2_1041–1351 (Fig. 1A, part a) as a bait isolated two independent clones that strongly interacted with ALS2_1041–1351. Both of these two clones contained the partial cDNAs encoding the C-terminal parts of the ALS2 protein (Fig. 1A, parts b and c). These results indicate that ALS2 could be self-associated. Bait e auto-activation is not suitable for the Y2H screen. ALS2 Self-interaction in Yeast Cells—To confirm the self-interaction and, at the same time, to define minimum required regions for self-interaction in yeast cells, we generated various truncated ALS2-expressing constructs (Fig. 1A) and used them in the Y2H test. As a result, we found that two distinct C-terminal regions of ALS2 that, when coded by fragment f-deleting consecutive MORN motifs and fragment e, were essential for the strong self-interaction in yeast (Fig. 1B). Fragment j, deleting the VPS9 domain, exhibited a weak but significant interaction with fragment f. On the other hand, deletion of the N-terminal portion of fragment e, i.e. fragment h, completely abolished the interaction. Furthermore, fragments d or i, containing either MORN motifs or the VPS9 domain, solely showed no interactions with any fragments tested. All together, these results suggest that two distinct consecutive regions of ALS2, aa 1233–1351 and aa 1351–1454, are indispensable for the ALS2 self-interaction in yeast cells, whereas both MORN motifs and the VPS9 domain are dispensable for that. Self-interaction of the ALS2 Protein in Mammalian Cells— To investigate whether the ALS2 proteins interact with each other in mammalian cells, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We transfected pCIneoFLAG-ALS2_L (full-length) along with pCIneoHA-ALS2_L into COS-7 cells and then performed co-immunoprecipitation using the anti-FLAG M2 beads. As shown in Fig. 2A, HA-tagged ALS2_L was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged ALS2_L. FLAG-tagged ALS2_L was also detected in the pellets together with HA-tagged ALS2_L, when immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Consistent with the results of the Y2H screen, HA-tagged ALS2_1018–1657, which contained all of the required region for the self-interaction in yeast, was also co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged ALS2_1018–1657 (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that ALS2 proteins interact with each other through their C-terminal region, suggesting that ALS2s could either homo-dimerize or homo-oligomerize in mammalian cells. Homo-oligomerization of the ALS2 Protein—To determine whether the ALS2 protein existed as a homo-oligomerized or homo-dimerized form in the cells, we conducted a gel exclusion analysis. We prepared the FLAG-tagged ALS2_L and ALS2_1018–1657 proteins from COS-7 cells transfected with each expression plasmid. Purified ALS2 proteins were subjected to a gel filtration column, and the eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-ALS2 polyclonal antibody (MPF 1012–1651). As shown in Fig. 3, FLAG-tagged ALS2_L (∼180 kDa in SDS-PAGE) and ALS2_1018–1657 (∼75 kDa in SDS-PAGE) were eluted at apparent peak molecular masses of ∼1,200 kDa and ∼600 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). These molecular masses indicate that ALS2 is likely to form a homophilic oligomer (presumably octamer) rather than a dimer in native conditions. Because ALS2_1018–1657 (MORN/VPS9 region) lacking the N-terminal RLD and DH/PH domains also oligomerized in the same manner as the full-length ALS2 (ALS2_L), the C-terminal region of ALS2 might be the region requisite for oligomerization. It is also noteworthy that monomeric forms for FLAG-tagged ALS2_L"

We recently demonstrated in non-transformed human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells that NT treatment caused activation of a Ras-mediated MAP kinase pathway that significantly contributes to NT-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. Here we used NCM460 cells, which normally express low levels of NTR1, and NCM460 cells stably transfected with NTR1 to identify the upstream signaling molecules involved in NT-NTR1-mediated MAP kinase activation. We found that inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by either an EGFR neutralizing antibody or by its specific inhibitor AG1478 (0.2 μm) blocked NT-induced MAP kinase activation. Moreover, NT stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, and pretreatment with a broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat reduced NT-induced MAP kinase activation. Using neutralizing antibodies against the EGFR ligands EGF, heparin-binding-EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), or amphiregulin we have shown that only the anti-TGFα antibody significantly decreases NT-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and MAP kinases. Furthermore, inhibition of the EGF receptor by AG1478 significantly reduced NT-induced IL-8 promoter activity and IL-8 secretion. This is the first report demonstrating that NT binding to NTR1 transactivates the EGFR and that this response is linked to NT-mediated proinflammatory signaling. Our findings indicate that matrix metalloproteinase-mediated release of TGFα and subsequent EGFR transactivation triggers a NT-mediated MAP kinase pathway that leads to IL-8 gene expression in human colonic epithelial cells.

Two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been described for NT, a high affinity (NTR1) and a low affinity (NTR2) receptor (16Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol.

Several studies underline the importance of NTR1 in several intestinal pathologic conditions. For example, administration of the specific NTR1 antagonist SR 48692 to rats inhibits colonic mucin and prostaglandin E2 secretion and mast cell activation in response to immobilization stress (18Castagliuolo I. Leeman S.E. Bartolak-Suki E. Nikulasson S. Qiu B. Carraway R.E. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12611-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). NTR1 antagonism also reduces colonic secretion and inflammation mediated by Clostridium difficile toxin A (19Castagliuolo I. Wang C.C. Valenick L. Pasha A. Nikulasson S. Carraway R.E. Pothoulakis C.

We report here that NTR1 engagement leads to EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which is responsible for ERK1/2 activation in NT-treated non-transformed human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells. Our results also indicate that the mechanism of NT-induced EGF receptor transactivation involves metalloproteinase-dependent TGFα release. Cell Lines and Reagents—Non-transformed human colonic epithelial cells NCM460 and NTR1-overexpressed NCM460 cells (NCM460-NTR1) have been described previously (20Zhao D. Keates A.C. Kuhnt-Moore S. Moyer M.P. Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44464-44471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NT was purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Belmont, CA). Cell culture medium M3D for NCM460 and NCM460-NTR1 cells was obtained from INCELL Corp. (San Antonio, TX). Antibodies against total and phosphorylated EGF receptor were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HB-EGF, TGFα, amphiregulin, and their respective neutralizing antibodies were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). EGF and EGF receptor neutralizing antibody were from Sigma and Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). AG1478 and pertussis toxin were from Calbiochem and batimastat (BB94) from British Biotech (Oxford, UK). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts of cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 400 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with each primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. Peroxidase activity was detected by SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). TGFα Measurements—The levels of TGFα in conditioned media were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, 96-well Nunc immunoplates (Fisher Scientific) were coated with 0.4 μg/ml TGFα capture antibody (R&D Systems) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) three times, and then incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing once with PBST, each well was incubated with 100 μl of conditioned media or TGFα standard serially diluted in M3D media for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed, incubated with 0.3 μg/ml biotin-conjugated anti-TGFα (R&D Systems) for 60 min, washed three times, and then incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Peroxidase activity was detected by TMB peroxidase substrate reagents (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Luciferase Reporter Assay—A reporter construct containing 1521 bp (nucleotides –1481 to +40) of the promoter region of the human IL-8 gene was used to measure transcription of the IL-8 gene as described previously (20Zhao D. Keates A.C. Kuhnt-Moore S. Moyer M.P. Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44464-44471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine the IL-8 promoter activity in response to NT, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (0.2 × 106 cells/well) overnight and transiently transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) with IL-8 promoter luciferase constructs or a control luciferase construct pRL-TK (Promega) or other DNA constructs as indicated. Transfected cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with the indicated pharmacological inhibitors followed by exposure to NT for 4 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell extracts were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The relative luciferase activity was then calculated by normalizing IL-8 promoter-driven firefly luciferase activity to control Renilla luciferase activity. Data from all experiments are presented as the relative luciferase activity (mean ± S.E.) from at least two independent sets of experiments, each with triplicate measurements. Statistical Analyses—Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using the SIGMA-STAT™ professional statistics software program (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Analyses of variance with the protected t test were used for intergroup comparison. NT Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the EGF Receptor—To determine whether NT can activate the EGF receptor, NCM460 and NCM460-NTR1 cells were treated with NT (10–7m) for various times. Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated EGF receptor and total EGF receptor. The results show that NT induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor with a maximal level at 2 min after stimulation (Fig. 1A). To examine whether NT induces phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in a dose-dependent manner, quiescent NCM460 cells were treated with NT (10–10 to 10–6m) for 2 min. Equal amounts of cell proteins were used to measure EGF receptor phosphorylation as described above. The data show that NT activates phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal stimulation at a concentration of 10–6m (Fig. 1B). However, concentrations of 10–8 and 10–9m were also able to induce this response (Fig. 1B). NT is known to bind to three receptors including the high affinity GPCR, NTR1, and two low affinity receptors (one GPCR and another intracellular sortillin) (16Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that NCM460 cells express high affinity receptor NTR1, which mediates NT-induced ERK1/2 activation (20Zhao D. Keates A.C. Kuhnt-Moore S. Moyer M.P. Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44464-44471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To further confirm that NT-induced EGFR phosphorylation is also mediated by NTR1, NCM460 cells were pretreated with a specific NTR1 antagonist SB48692 (1 μm) and then treated with NT (10–7m) for 2 min. The data show that the NTR1 antagonist almost completely inhibited NT-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation, indicating that this receptor mediates NT-induced EGF receptor activation in these cells (Fig. 1C). It was previously shown that NT-induced ERK1/2 activation was partially inhibited by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), which selectively blocks the Gi/o subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins in NTR1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (25Poinot-Chazel C. Portier M. Bouaboula M. Vita N. Pecceu F. Gully D. Monroe J.G. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To examine whether Gi/o G proteins are also involved in NT-induced ERK1/2 activation in NCM460 cells, NCM460 or NCM460-NTR1 cells were pretreated with PTX (100 ng/ml) overnight and then stimulated with NT (10–7m) or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 25 μm) for 5 min. LPA was used a positive control because it is known to mediate ERK1/2 activation primarily through PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins in several cell types (38Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that LPA-mediated ERK1/2 activation was almost completely inhibited by PTX (Fig. 1D). However, PTX pretreatment had no effect on NT-induced ERK1/2 activation in both NCM460 and NCM460-NTR1 cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that the Gi/o proteins are not required in this NT response. Inhibition of EGFR Activation Blocks NT-induced ERK Phosphorylation—Although it is known that EGF receptor activation triggers the Ras-Raf-1-MEK-ERK cascade, whether this pathway is involved in NT-induced ERK1/2 activation remains to be determined. Two separate approaches were used to examine this possibility. First, quiescent cells were pretreated with different concentrations of AG1478, a specific pharmacologic inhibitor of the EGF receptor, for 30 min and stimulated with NT (10–7m) for 10 min. Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against dual phospho-ERK1/2. To confirm equal protein loading, a polyclonal antibody against total ERK1/2 was also used. We found that low concentrations of AG1478 (up to 0.1 μm) almost completely inhibited NT-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2A). Next, we used an EGF receptor neutralizing antibody to further examine EGF receptor involvement in NT-induced ERK1/2 activation. First, we confirmed that phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in response to NT (10–7m, 2 min), EGF (10 ng/ml, 2 min), or TGFα (10 ng/ml, 2 min) was blocked by pretreatment with the EGF receptor neutralizing antibody (20 μg/ml) but not by equal amounts of a control antibody (Fig. 2B). To determine whether this neutralizing antibody inhibits NT-induced ERK1/2 activation, cells were pretreated for 30 min with two different doses of the EGF receptor neutralizing antibody or a control antibody and stimulated with NT (10–7m) for 10 min. The results showed that pretreatment with the EGF receptor neutralizing antibody significantly reduced NT-induced ERK1/2 activation in both parental NCM460 cells and NCM-NTR1 cells (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings indicate that both extracellular ligand binding and intracellular kinase activity of the EGF receptor are required for NT-induced ERK1/2 activation. TGFα Release Is Involved in NT-induced ERK Activation— Our EGF receptor neutralization experiments described above (Fig. 2) also suggested that NT-induced ERK1/2 activation involves an extracellular ligand of the EGF receptor. It is known that the EGF receptor can be bound and activated by four different ligands: EGF, HB-EGF, TGFα, and amphiregulin. To identify the specific EGF receptor ligand(s) involved in NTR1 signaling, we pretreated cells for 30 min with neutralizing antibodies against EGF (20 μg/ml), HB-EGF (20 μg/ml), amphiregulin (20 μg/ml), or TGFα (10 and 20 μg/ml) or their respective control antibodies at the same concentration followed by stimulation with NT (10–7m, 10 min) EGF (10 ng/ml, 5 min), HB-EGF (10 ng/ml, 5 min), or TGFα (10 ng/ml, 5 min). Our results indicate that pretreatment with neutralizing antibodies against either EGF, HB-EGF, or amphiregulin had no effect on NT-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3A), whereas TGFα antibody pretreatment significantly reduced NT-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3B). Next we examined whether NT stimulates TGFα release. Quiescent cells were treated with NT (10–7m) for the indicated times, and equal amounts of conditioned media were used to measure TGFα concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that in parental NCM460 cells, NT significantly increased the release of TGFα into the extracellular space 2 min after NT treatment (Fig. 4A). However, no significant increase in TGFα levels was noted after 5 and 10 min of NT exposure (Fig 4A). In transfected NCM460-NTR1 cells, which express higher levels of NTR1, NT also induced TGFα release 2 min after NT administration to levels comparable with the parental NCM460 cells (Fig. 4B). However, in contrast to the parental cells, TGFα levels in the conditioned media continued to rise up to 10 min after NT exposure (Fig. 4B). Taken together, our results demonstrate that NT-induced TGFα release is, at least in part, responsible for NT-induced ERK1/2 activation.Fig. 4NT induces TGFα release. Quiescent NCM460 (A) or NCM460-NTR1 (B) cells were stimulated with NT (10–7m) for the indicated periods of time. Equal volumes of the conditioned media were used to measure the concentrations of TGFα as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are expressed as picograms TGFα/ml ± S.E. The results are representative of three individual experiments, each with quadruplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Metalloproteinase Activity Is Required for NT-induced TGFα Release and Activation of the EGF Receptor and ERK—Because several G protein-coupled receptors activate the EGF receptor and ERK1/2 through metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of precursors of the EGF receptor ligands, we examined whether metalloproteinase activity is required for NT-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Cells were pretreated with AG1478 or batimastat, a broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor, for 30 min and stimulated with NT (10–7m) for 2 min. Equal amounts of cell proteins were used to determine tyrosine phosphorylation as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data show that pretreatment with AG1478 or batimastat blocked NT-induced activation of the EGF receptor (Fig. 5A). Cells were also pretreated with batimastat for 30 min and treated with NT for 10 min, and equal amounts of cell proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using a dual phospho-ERK-specific antibody. Our results demonstrate that batimastat significantly reduced NT-induced ERK activation (Fig. 5B). To further examine whether the effect of the MMP inhibitor on NT-induced activation of the EGF receptor and ERK is because of inhibition of TGFα release, cells were pretreated with batimastat for 30 min and treated with NT for 10 min. Equal volumes of the conditioned media were used to determine TGFα concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results indicate that pretreatment with batimastat significantly inhibited NT-induced TGFα release in the NCM460 (Fig. 6A) and NCM460-NTR1 cells (Fig. 6B) to similar levels. Our results also show that in the parental NCM460 cells basal levels of TGFα are higher than those in the transfected NCM460 cells (Fig. 6). Because TGFα levels were measured as pg/ml of cell supernatant, this difference may reflect a higher cell number used in the experiments with NCM460 cells versus transfected NCM460-NTR1 cells. Effects of Batimastat and AG1478 on NT-induced IL-8 Promoter Activity—Previously we showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 activation reduced NT-induced IL-8 promoter activity (20Zhao D. Keates A.C.

To further examine whether NT-induced activation of MMPs and the EGF receptor is involved in NT-induced IL-8 gene expression, cells were first transiently transfected with an IL-8 promoter-luciferase reporter construct together with an internal control plasmid. Cells were then rendered quiescent, pretreated with batimastat or AG1478 for 30 min, and then treated with NT for 4 h. Equal amounts of cell extracts were used to measure luciferase activity as described under “Materials and Methods,” and IL-8 promoter activity was normalized to equal control luciferase activity. Our results showed that pretreatment with AG1478 or batimastat significantly reduced NT-induced IL-8 promoter activity (Fig. 7). It is well established that NT stimulates MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation in several cell types, including nontransformed and transformed human colonic epithelial cells (20Zhao D.

https://openalex.org/W2095163170,"Interferon γ (IFN-γ) plays an important role during inflammation by repressing collagen and activating major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) expression. Activation of MHC-II by IFN-γ requires regulatory factor for X-box 5 (RFX5) complex as well as class II transactivator (CIITA). We have shown that the RFX family binds to the COL1A2 transcription start site (Sengupta, P. K., Fargo, J., and Smith, B. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 24926–24937), and the RFX5 complex represses COL1A2 gene expression during IFN-γ response (Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49134–49144). In this report, we demonstrate that CIITA is a key mediator of COL1A2 repression by IFN-γ. IFN-γ up-regulates the expression of CIITA in a time-dependent manner in lung fibroblasts and promotes CIITA protein occupancy on COL1A2 transcription start site in vivo as judged by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. There are coordinate decreases in the occupancy of RNA polymerase II on the collagen transcription start site with increasing CIITA occupancy during IFN-γ treatment. In addition, we are able to specifically knockdown the IFN-γ-stimulated expression of CIITA utilizing short hairpin interference RNA (shRNA) against CIITA. This leads to the alleviation of COL1A2 repression and MHC-II activation by IFN-γ. RFX5 recruits CIITA to the collagen site as evidenced by DNA affinity chromatography. The presence of RFX5 complex proteins enhances the collagen repression by CIITA reaching levels occurring during IFN-γ treatment. Co-expression of CIITA with deletion mutations and collagen promoter constructs demonstrates that CIITA represses collagen promoter mainly through its N-terminal region including the acidic domain and the proline/serine/threonine domain. Our data suggest that CIITA is a crucial member of a repressor complex responsible for mediating COL1A2 transcription repression by IFN-γ. Interferon γ (IFN-γ) plays an important role during inflammation by repressing collagen and activating major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) expression. Activation of MHC-II by IFN-γ requires regulatory factor for X-box 5 (RFX5) complex as well as class II transactivator (CIITA). We have shown that the RFX family binds to the COL1A2 transcription start site (Sengupta, P. K., Fargo, J., and Smith, B. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 24926–24937), and the RFX5 complex represses COL1A2 gene expression during IFN-γ response (Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49134–49144). In this report, we demonstrate that CIITA is a key mediator of COL1A2 repression by IFN-γ. IFN-γ up-regulates the expression of CIITA in a time-dependent manner in lung fibroblasts and promotes CIITA protein occupancy on COL1A2 transcription start site in vivo as judged by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. There are coordinate decreases in the occupancy of RNA polymerase II on the collagen transcription start site with increasing CIITA occupancy during IFN-γ treatment. In addition, we are able to specifically knockdown the IFN-γ-stimulated expression of CIITA utilizing short hairpin interference RNA (shRNA) against CIITA. This leads to the alleviation of COL1A2 repression and MHC-II activation by IFN-γ. RFX5 recruits CIITA to the collagen site as evidenced by DNA affinity chromatography. The presence of RFX5 complex proteins enhances the collagen repression by CIITA reaching levels occurring during IFN-γ treatment. Co-expression of CIITA with deletion mutations and collagen promoter constructs demonstrates that CIITA represses collagen promoter mainly through its N-terminal region including the acidic domain and the proline/serine/threonine domain. Our data suggest that CIITA is a crucial member of a repressor complex responsible for mediating COL1A2 transcription repression by IFN-γ. Disordering of the lung architecture through a variety of injuries often results in deposition of excess connective tissues leading to pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis is characterized by aberrant up-regulation of extracellular matrix production resulting in excess collagen deposition. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease with no known etiology or effective treatment.

Giri S.N. Exp. Lung Res. 1995; 21: 791-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Okada T. Sugie I. Aisaka K. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 87-91PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, IFN-γ has long been reported to reduce collagen synthesis (3Jimenez S.A. Freundlich B. Rosenbloom J. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 74: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Rosenbloom J. Feldman G. Freundlich B. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It suppresses collagen production in a time- and dose-dependent manner primarily at the transcriptional level. Both type I collagen chains, α1(I) and α2(I), are regulated coordinately by IFN-γ. Although the mechanism underlying this regulation remains largely unknown, IFN-γ has been tested in numerous clinical trials. Early results indicated that IFN-γ treatment leads to favorable reductions of collagen accumulation and cytokines that induce collagen synthesis (5Ziesche R. Hofbauer E. Wittmann K. Petkov V. Block L.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 6Ziesche R. Block L.H. Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 2000; 112: 785-790PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that there are problems with increased inflammatory response (7Raghu G. Brown K.K. Bradford W.Z. Starko K. Noble P.W. Schwartz D.A. King Jr., T.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as an anti-fibrotic agent, IFN-γ is also a key cytokine that induces the expression of major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) complex (8Steimle V. Siegrist C.A. Mottet A. Lisowska-Grospierre B. Mach B. Science. 1994; 265: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 9Montani V. Taniguchi S.I. Shong M. Suzuki K. Ohmori M. Giuliani C. Napolitano G. Saji M. Fiorentino B. Reimold A.M. Ting J.P. Kohn L.D. Singer D.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MHC-II plays a central role during inflammation by presenting antigens to CD4+ T cells, which serves as a crucial control of peripheral T-cell activation and thymic selection (10McDevitt H.O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11McDevitt H. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 185: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Failure to express MHC-II in patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome is caused by mutations belonging to four complementary groups (12Mach B. Steimle V. Martinez-Soria E. Reith W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The expression of MHC-II thus depends on the transcription factors encoded by the genes defined in these complementary groups. Complementation group A is caused by mutations in Class II transactivator (CIITA). This protein is referred to as the master regulator of MHC-II transcription and is important for both constitutive expression of MHC-II in B-cells or dendritic cells as well as cytokine-induced expression of MHC-II in a variety of other cell types including fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells (13Bontron S. Ucla C. Mach B. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Boss J.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). CIITA expression is stimulated by IFN-γ even in cells such as fibroblasts through two of its four promoters, promoter III and IV (15Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar, 16Piskurich J.F. Linhoff M.W. Wang Y. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CIITA has several functional domains including the N-terminal acidic domain and proline-rich domains followed by a serine- and threonine-rich region (PST) (17Chin K.C. Li G.G. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The acidic domain activates MHC-II transcription possibly through its interactions with transcription machinery (TFIIB, TAFIIs) and coactivators (CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300) (18Mahanta S.K. Scholl T. Yang F.C. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6324-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Fontes J.D. Jiang B. Peterlin B.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2522-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Sisk T.J. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PST region can be phosphorylated in vivo, which, in turn, facilitates oligomerization and accumulation of CIITA on the MHC-II promoter (21Tosi G. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5467-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The question of which kinase or combinations of kinases might phosphorylate CIITA to enhance its activity is still unanswered. CIITA also has a GTP binding domain with homology to the RAS superfamily that is important for self-association, nuclear localization, and activation of MHC-II (17Chin K.C. Li G.G. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Linhoff M.W. Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Martin B.K. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell.

In addition, there is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) at the C terminus that is necessary for self-assembly, nuclear import, and dominant-negative function for MHC-II (25Hake S.B. Masternak K. Kammerbauer C. Janzen C. Reith W. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7716-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Harton J.A. O'Connor Jr., W. Conti B.J. Linhoff M.W. Ting J.P. Hum.

Immunol. 2004; 16: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Patients with group A bare lymphocyte syndrome are deficient in the LRR region of CIITA, thus losing the capacity to activate MHC-II expression (28Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 29Bontron S. Steimle V. Ucla C. Eibl M.M. Mach B. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CIITA is considered a scaffolding protein forming cooperative interactions with several DNA binding proteins without being able to bind to DNA directly (30Zhu X.S. Linhoff M.W. Li G. Chin K.C. Maity S.N. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6051-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). CIITA requires RFX5 complex to activate MHC-II expression. The RFX5 complex contains three proteins (RFX5, RFXB, and RFXAP) and mutations in any of these proteins cause bare lymphocyte syndrome similar to CIITA mutants. Therefore, interactions between RFX5 and CIITA on the MHC-II promoter have been extensively studied. RFX5 complex forms cooperative interactions with several other proteins, including CBF/NF-Y and bZip proteins within an enhancer region located upstream of the MHC-II promoter. The formation of this enhanceosome allows the recruitment of CIITA to the MHC-II promoter to activate transcription. Although CIITA was initially described as a master regulator of MHC-II transcription (28Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 31Silacci P. Mottet A. Steimle V. Reith W. Mach B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it is now clear that it both activates other genes (32Nagarajan U.M. Bushey A. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5078-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and suppresses transcription of several genes such as collagen (33Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7078-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Gourley T.S. Patel D.R. Nickerson K. Hong S.C. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and thyroid-specific genes (9Montani V. Taniguchi S.I. Shong M. Suzuki K. Ohmori M. Giuliani C. Napolitano G. Saji M. Fiorentino B. Reimold A.M. Ting J.P. Kohn L.D. Singer D.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mechanism for repression is not clear and seems to be gene-and cell-type specific. Previously, we demonstrated that IFN-γ stimulates the expression of RFX5 complex proteins and promotes the assembly of RFX5 complex on the collagen start site suggesting that RFX5 proteins are potential mediators for collagen repression by IFN-γ (34Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24926-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we report that IFN-γ promotes the recruitment of CIITA to the collagen promoter in part through binding to RFX5 complex. Abrogation of IFN-γ-induced expression of CIITA alleviates the activation of MHC-II and the repression of collagen. CIITA requires the presence of RFX5 complex for maximal repression of collagen transcription. Finally, we have identified two important CIITA domains responsible for collagen repression. Our results identify a critical role for CIITA in collagen IFN-γ repression. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Human lung fibroblasts, IMR-90, (IMR) and rat fibroblasts, FR (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone). Prior to transfection, cells were plated in 6-well culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 (for IMR-90) or 6 × 105 cells (for FR cells) per well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16–24 h. Transfections were performed in serum-free DMEM using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three hours after transfection, cells were transferred to DMEM with 10% FBS and harvested 24 h later. Cells were then lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activities were assayed using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Experiments were routinely performed in duplicate plates. The ratio of experimental to control (reporter plasmid with empty vector) was calculated for each experiment with the control values set at 1. Values from three or more experiments were averaged and presented in this study. In several studies, IMR-90 cells were treated with IFN-γ. IMR-90 fibroblasts were plated in p35 tissue culture dishes at 4 × 105 cells/dish for mRNA studies or in p150 tissue culture dishes at 4 × 106 cells/dish for ChIP studies and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS for 16–24 h. Cells were pretreated in DMEM with 0.4% FBS for 16 h prior to IFN-γ treatment (100 units/ml in 0.4% DMEM for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, or 24 h). Plasmids—The COL1A2-luciferase construct (pH20) (38Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains sequences from –221 to +54 bp of mouse COL1A2 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene. A larger COL1A2-luciferase construct (pGL3-Col-Luc) containing sequences from –357 to +55 bp of mouse COL1A2 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene was a gift from Dr. Jenny Ting (33Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7078-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Full-length FLAG-RFX5, FLAG-RFXB/ANK, FLAG-CIITA, FLAG-CIITA-(300–1130), FLAG-CIITA-(335–1130), FLAG-CIITA-(613–1130), FLAG-CIITA-(1–335), and FLAG-CIITA-(Δ59–94) constructs were also kindly provided by Dr. Jenny Ting. FLAG-CIITA-(253–1130), FLAG-CIITA-(1–410), FLAG-CIITA-(253–410), and FLAG-CIITA-(Δ253–410) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Matija Peterlin (21Tosi G. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5467-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Full-length His-RFXAP was constructed in this laboratory as previously described (37Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Real-time PCR—Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using a SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR reactions were performed on ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Open table in a new tab Western Blots—For detection of expressed proteins, fibroblasts were extracted using RIPA buffer {1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS} with freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml RIPA), and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). For certain experiments to examine the effects of IFN-γ treatment on CIITA localization, nuclear and cytoplasmic protein was separated as previously described (39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. W., S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in extracts were separated by 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with prestained markers (Bio-Rad) for estimating molecular weight and efficiency of transfer to blots. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a Mini-Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) (0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) buffer at 4 °C overnight and incubated for 3 h to monoclonal antibody anti-CIITA (7–1H, 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-β actin (1:1000) (Sigma), monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:1000) (Sigma), polyclonal anti-RFX5 (194, 1:1000) (Rockland), or polyclonal anti-RFX1 (1:100) (I-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, either anti-goat IgG (Sigma), anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, for another 1 h at room temperature. Then protein blots were visualized using ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a Kodak image station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence—Human lung fibroblasts were plated at 200,000 cells per 35-mm glass bottom culture dish and allowed to grow for 24 h in 10% serum before pretreatment in 0.4% serum for 16 h. Cells were treated with IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 6, 16, or 24 h before fixation. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were made permeable using 0.25% Triton X-100 in TBST. After four more washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were incubated in blocking buffer with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with polyclonal anti-CIITA (1:400) (N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 4% bovine serum albumin in TBST. After four washes with TBST, the slides were incubated with an anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fluorescence was observed by an Olympus 1X7O inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a Kodak professional EOS.DCS digital camera. The intensity of fluorescence was analyzed using ImagePro Plus software. Three digitized images from three different experiments were analyzed by picking pixels that covered the nucleus. The program computed the mean intensity in the nuclei and the standard deviation. Statistical test of significance of the mean intensity difference between time points was performed using ANOVA (analysis of variance) employing Scheffe's post-hoc procedure. DNA Affinity Pull-down Assay—The collagen sequence (COL1A2–25/+30, Genbank™ accession number AF004877) with a HindIII overhang was synthesized as complementary strands and annealed as previously described (40Sengupta P.K. Erhlich M. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36649-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Double-stranded collagen DNA was biotin-labeled by incubating with Klenow fragment (NE Biolabs) and biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen) supplemented with regular dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was phenol/chloroform-extracted and alcohol-precipitated to remove unincorporated biotin. Nuclear protein extracts were obtained as previously described (37Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 100–200 μg of nuclear protein was used per DNA affinity pull-down assay. The streptavidin beads (Promega) were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclear proteins were precleared by incubating with the washed beads for 30 min at 4 °C on a shaking platform. Precleared nuclear proteins were harvested by capturing the beads on a magnetic stand and removing the supernatant. The supernatant was then incubated with biotin-labeled collagen DNA probe (–25/+30) for 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with bovine serum albumin, poly-dIdC, and sonicated salmon sperm DNA to remove nonspecific binding. The DNA-protein complex formed was captured by the magnetic beads and washed extensively with binding buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100 and 100 mm KCl. The bound proteins were eluted with 1× electrophoresis sample buffer by incubating at 90 °C for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels. In certain experiments, nuclear protein was incubated with anti-RFX5 antibody (194, Rockland) and captured by protein A/G plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight to deplete RFX5 protein. ChIP Assays—Chromatin in control and IFN-γ-treated cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min at room temperature, sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline, Solution I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.75% Triton X-100), and Solution II (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DNA was fragmented into ∼500-bp pieces using a Branson 250 sonicator. Aliquots of lysates containing 200 μg of protein were used for each immunoprecipitation reaction with anti-CIITA (generously provided by Dr. Jeremy Boss), anti-Pol II (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TBP (SI-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-TFIIB (SI-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies followed by adsorption to protein A/G plus-agarose beads. Precipitated DNA-protein complexes were washed sequentially with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), LiCl buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), respectively. DNA-protein cross-link was reversed by heating the samples to 65 °C overnight. Proteins were digested with proteinase K (Sigma), and DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted and precipitated by 100% ethanol. Dried DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of deionized distilled water, and 10 μl was used for each real-time PCR reaction. The primers for real-time PCR have been described previously (37Xu Y. Wang L.

PCR Shagging-based RNA Interference (RNAi)—Three different reverse primers were designed by RNAi oligo retriever program on the Cold Spring Harbor Web site (katahdin.cshl.org:9331/RNAi/html/rnai.html) and are shown in Table II. A pGEM1-U6 vector was used as the template. PCR reactions were performed by 95 °C 3 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel, sliced from the gel, purified by a Qiagen gel extraction kit, and ligated into pLenti6-V5-TOPO vector using a Viralpower directional cloning kit. Ligation products were transformed into TOP10 competent cells, and positive clones were screened by restriction digestion and direct sequencing. Viral packaging cells (293FT, Invitrogen) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Three shRNA clones were transfected into 293FT cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Viruses were harvested 48 h post-transfection and used to infect IMR-90 cells. 48 h after infection, IMR-90 cells were treated with 100 units/ml IFN-γ or left untreated for additional 24 h before harvesting. Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot. RNAs were extracted and analyzed as described before.Table IISequences cloned into lentiviral vectorsLentivirusLocationaAccession number is NM000246. in CIITASequencesbThe sequence in bold is the short hairpin sequence.

https://openalex.org/W1974789469,"Desensitization induced by chronic nicotine exposure has been hypothesized to trigger the up-regulation of the alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the central nervous system. We studied the effect of acute and chronic nicotine exposure on the desensitization and up-regulation of different alpha4beta2 subunit ratios (1alpha:4beta, 2alpha:3beta, and 4alpha:1beta) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The presence of alpha4 subunit in the oocyte plasmatic membrane increased linearly with the amount of alpha4 mRNA injected. nAChR function and expression were assessed during acute and after chronic nicotine exposure using a two-electrode voltage clamp and whole-mount immunofluorescence assay along with confocal imaging for the detection of the alpha4 subunit. The 2alpha4:3beta2 subunit ratio displayed the highest ACh sensitivity. Nicotine dose-response curves for the 1alpha4:4beta2 and 2alpha4:3beta2 subunit ratios displayed a biphasic behavior at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 300 microm. A biphasic curve for 4alpha4:1beta2 was obtained at nicotine concentrations higher than 300 microm. The 1alpha4:4beta2 subunit ratio exhibited the lowest ACh- and nicotine-induced macroscopic current, whereas 4alpha4:1beta2 presented the largest currents at all agonist concentrations tested. Desensitization by acute nicotine exposure was more evident as the ratio of beta2:alpha4 subunits increased. All three alpha4beta2 subunit ratios displayed a reduced state of activation after chronic nicotine exposure. Chronic nicotine-induced up-regulation was obvious only for the 2alpha4: 3beta2 subunit ratio. Our data suggest that the subunit ratio of alpha4beta2 determines the functional state of activation, desensitization, and up-regulation of this neuronal nAChR. We propose that independent structural sites regulate alpha4beta2 receptor activation and desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2024033254,"Mutations in the Drg1/RTP/Rit42 gene are commonly identified in hereditary neuropathies of the motor and sensory systems. This gene was also identified as a p53 target gene and a differentiation-related, putative metastatic suppressor gene in human colon and prostate cancer. In this study, we show that the Rit42 protein is a microtubule-associated protein that localizes to the centrosomes and participates in the spindle checkpoint in a p53-dependent manner. When ectopically expressed and exposed to spindle inhibitors, Rit42 inhibited polyploidy in several p53-deficient tumor cell lines and increased the population of cells in mitotic arrest. Blocking endogenous Rit42 expression by small interfering RNA in normal human mammary epithelial cells resulted in the disappearance of astral microtubules, and dividing spindle fiber formation was rarely detected. Moreover, these cells underwent microtubule inhibitor-induced reduplication, leading to a polyploidy state. Our findings imply that Rit42 plays a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and the maintenance of euploidy."
https://openalex.org/W2079616481,"We used degenerate primers for the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the rod domains of intermediate filament proteins in reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments to identify and clone cytokeratins 8 and 19 (K8 and K19) from cardiac muscle of the adult rat. Northern blots showed that K8 has a 2.2-kb transcript and K19 has a 1.9-kb transcript in both adult cardiac and skeletal muscles. Immunolocalization of the cytokeratins in adult cardiac muscle with isoform-specific antibodies for K8 and K19 showed labeling at Z-lines within the muscle fibers and at Z-line and M-line domains at costameres at the sarcolemmal membrane. Dystrophin and K19 could be co-immunoprecipitated and co-purified from extracts of cardiac muscle, suggesting a link between the cytokeratins and the dystrophin-based cytoskeleton at the sarcolemma. Furthermore, transfection experiments indicate that K8 and K19 may associate with dystrophin through a specific interaction with its actin-binding domain. Consistent with this observation, the cytokeratins are disrupted at the sarcolemmal membrane of skeletal muscle of the mdx mouse that lacks dystrophin. Together these results indicate that at least two cytokeratins are expressed in adult striated muscle, where they may contribute to the organization of both the myoplasm and sarcolemma.

Nearly two decades ago, Craig, Lazarides and their colleagues (1Pardo J.V. Siliciano J.D. Craig S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because of the “rib-like” appearance of these structures at the sarcolemmal membrane, Craig (1Pardo J.V. Siliciano J.D. Craig S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dmytrenko G.M. Winkelmann J.C. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). One overlies the M-lines of superficial myofibrils, consistent with ultrastructural findings of connections between the sarcolemma and M-lines (6Pierobon-Bormioli S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1981; 2: 401-413Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Street S.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 346-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 8Shear C.R. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 240-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The other costameric domain is oriented parallel to the long axis of the muscle cells and has not yet been correlated with sarcomeric structures. These three “costameric” domains, which we refer to as “Z-line domains,” “M-line domains” and “longitudinal” or “L domains,” form an extensive rectilinear lattice at the sarcolemma of rodent muscle (5Porter G.A.

The specific factors that align these and other proteins in the costameres with the underlying contractile apparatus are still unknown. Ultrastructural studies have shown that the sarcolemmal regions lying between the costameres can bulge outwards during muscle contractions, whereas the costameres remain tightly connected to the Z disks of the nearby myofibrils (6Pierobon-Bormioli S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1981; 2: 401-413Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Street S.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 346-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 8Shear C.R. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 240-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the nature of these connections remains unknown, biochemical evidence suggests that they may be composed of actin microfilaments, whereas ultrastructural images reveal similarities to intermediate filaments (6Pierobon-Bormioli S.

All intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; K8, cytokeratin 8; K19, cytokeratin 19; Dys-ABD, actin-binding domain of dystrophin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; L domain, longitudinal domain; RT, reverse transcriptase; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; K8, cytokeratin 8; K19, cytokeratin 19; Dys-ABD, actin-binding domain of dystrophin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; L domain, longitudinal domain; RT, reverse transcriptase; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. proteins have a central α-helical rod domain that is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. Overall sequence identity between members of the IF superfamily varies widely, but a key feature of all IFs is the high homology near the beginning and end of the central rod domain.Desmin is the major IF protein of striated muscle (16Lazarides E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 219-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). It is found together with other type III intermediate filament proteins, including syncoilin, paranemin, and synemin (also known as desmuslin) at the Z-lines of mature skeletal muscle (18Price M.G.

Other IF proteins, including vimentin, nestin, and cytokeratins, are expressed in developing muscle but are thought to be down-regulated as the muscle matures (24Gard D.L. Lazarides E.

The keratins, which form the largest group of IFs, are categorized as Type I (acidic, K9–K23) and Type II (basic, K1–K8) IF proteins. Although desmin can self-assemble to form IFs, the keratins only form filaments as heterodimers comprised of Type I and Type II subunits. They are not thought to co-polymerize with other types of IF proteins, such as desmin (27Osborn M. Franke W. Weber K. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 125: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28, McCormick, M. B., Coulombe, P. A., and Fuchs, E. (199) J. Cell Biol. 113, 1111–1124Google Scholar). Like other IFs, cytokeratin filaments function primarily to provide mechanical support to cells, but recent evidence also implicates the cytokeratins in such roles as cell signaling and apoptosis (29Kirfel J. Magin T.M. Reichelt J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).In striated muscle, the desmin-based IFs at the Z-line may play a role in aligning the myofibrils in the sarcoplasm and may also link the Z disks of the superficial myofibrils to the sarcolemma, at the Z-line domains of costameres (14Li Z.

Recent work by our laboratory (33O'Neill A. Williams M.W. Resneck W.G. Milner D.J. Capetanaki Y. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2347-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) suggests that desmin preferentially stabilizes the Z-line domains of costameres but that it is not necessary for the stability of M-line and L domains. These studies examined costameres in skeletal muscle from mice lacking desmin because of homologous recombination and found that many of the M-line and L domains, as well as some Z-line domains, were still intact (33O'Neill A. Williams M.W. Resneck W.G. Milner D.J. Capetanaki Y. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2347-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As our preliminary cloning data (34Ursitti J.A. McNally M. O'Neill A. Resneck W.G. Bowie A.L. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 40aGoogle Scholar) indicated that the cytokeratins were potential candidates for the role of organizing the costameres in adult striated muscle, O'Neill et al. (33O'Neill A. Williams M.W. Resneck W.G. Milner D.J. Capetanaki Y. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2347-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) immunolabeled skeletal muscle with Pan-specific cytokeratin antibodies. The results showed that the cytokeratins were present at all domains of costameres. However, the identity of those cytokeratins and the mode of their association with the sarcolemmal membrane remain unknown.To identify additional IFs that play a role in organizing costameres at the sarcolemmal membrane of striated muscle, we designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers to the regions of high identity located at both ends of the central rod domain, for use in RT-PCR experiments. Using this information in combination with the results of Northern blots and immunofluorescence studies, we have identified cytokeratins 8 and 19 (K8 and K19, respectively) as the two major cytokeratins expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles of the adult rat. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the cytokeratins associate directly or indirectly with the costameric protein, dystrophin. Cellular transfection experiments indicate that, when assembled into heteropolymeric filaments, K8 and K19 interact specifically with the amino-terminal actin-binding domain of dystrophin. We propose that K8 and K19 at costameres work in conjunction with desmin to stabilize the Z-line domains and alone to stabilize the M-line and L domains, where they may interact directly with dystrophin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Preparation—The heart and gastrocnemius muscles were collected from adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Zivic-Miller, Zelienople, PA) and adult CD-1 mice. In addition, the tibialis anterior muscles were collected from dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. Animals were anesthetized and perfused through the left ventricle with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Roche Diagnostics Corp.) or 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (for mdx tissue only). The muscle tissue was excised and frozen in one of two ways. Tissue to be used for RNA purification or homogenization was immediately plunged into liquid nitrogen. Tissue to be used for frozen sections was snap frozen in a slush of liquid nitrogen, to reduce freeze damage. Dissociated mouse cells were prepared as described previously (35duBell W.H. Gigena M.S. Guatimosim S. Long X. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H38-H48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the heart cells were fixed with ice-cold ethanol for at least 1 h prior to immunolabeling.Antibodies—Antibodies against purified bovine α-fodrin (αII-spectrin) were prepared in rabbits and antibodies against human erythroid βI-spectrin were prepared in chickens. The antibodies were affinity purified as previously described (36Zhou D. Ursitti J.A. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and were used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for immunofluorescence experiments. Antibodies against γ-actin were prepared in rabbits and used at a dilution of 1:200 for Western blots (kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Bulinski, Columbia University Medical Center, New York). Subunit-specific sheep antibodies to cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 were purchased from The Binding Site (Birmingham, United Kingdom). These antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:50 for immunofluorescence experiments and 1:500 for Western blots. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to cytokeratin 19 (clone Ks19.1, purchased from Progen, Heidelberg, Germany), dystrophin (Clone NCL-DYS2, purchased from Novocastra Laboratories LTD., New Castle upon Tyne, UK), and a control mouse IgG1 (MOPC21, purchased from Sigma) were used in immunoprecipitation experiments, as described below. Pan-specific antibodies to the cytokeratins, which recognize multiple isoforms but are specific for the cytokeratins, were purchased from Biogenex (San Ramon, CA). All were used at dilutions of 1:500 for Western blots. Two additional antibodies were employed in transfection experiments: a monoclonal antibody specific for human cytokeratin 19 (Sigma), used at a dilution of 1:50, and a monoclonal antibody specific for the myc epitope tag (Invitrogen), used at a dilution of 1:500. Purified non-immune rabbit and sheep IgGs were from Sigma and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA), respectively. Secondary antibodies included donkey anti-chicken IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine, and goat anti-mouse conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as well as Alexa Fluor 488 goat antirabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch.Immunofluorescence Labeling—Dissociated cardiocytes were prepared from adult mouse or rat hearts and immunolabeled in suspension. Cells were allowed to sediment at unit gravity between steps in the labeling procedure. After fixation in ice-cold ethanol, the cells were washed and incubated in a solution containing 5% normal goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for a minimum of 30 min, to block nonspecific labeling prior to adding the primary antibody. Samples were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing, washed with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1–2 h at room temperature. Frozen sections of mdx skeletal muscle were cut at 20 μm on a Reichert-Jung cryostat (Cambridge Instruments, Deerfield, IL), collected on slides, and double labeled with chicken antibodies to β-spectrin and pan-specific mouse antibodies to cytokeratins. Blocking and labeling solutions and times were as described above. All samples were mounted on slides with Vectashield anti-fade (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) to reduce photobleaching. Slides were examined with a Zeiss 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Tarrytown, NY) with pinholes set at 18 and a resolution in the x and y directions of 0.124 μm. Figures were prepared with Corel Draw 10 (Corel Corporation Limited, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).Immunoblotting—We tested the specificity of the cytokeratin antibodies by immunoblotting. Purified recombinant human cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) were heated for 10 min at 65 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) and loaded onto a 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose (38Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar) and the blots were incubated in Blotto (3% dry milk solids in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 10 mm sodium azide) for 2 h. The blots were probed with the subunit-specific antibodies to the cytokeratins (see above), followed by incubation with donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Western Light Detection, Tropix Laboratories, Bedford, MA).Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitations, gastrocnemius or cardiac muscle from adult rats were homogenized with a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer (Switzerland) at a w/v ratio of 0.05 in 2% Empigen (39Lowthert L.A. Ku N.O. Liao J. Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in PBS, pH 7.2, with protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were incubated on ice for 1 h before centrifugation at 12,000 × g and collection of the supernatant. Immunoprecipitations were performed from 1 mg of this homogenate with goat anti-mouse M450 Dynabeads (Dynal, Lake Success, NY), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and monoclonal antibodies to cytokeratin 19, dystrophin, or a monoclonal control antibody (see above). After separation on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gel, proteins in the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted as described above.Partial Purification of the Dystrophin-associated Glycoprotein Complex—The dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex was partially purified using the procedure reported by Ervasti et al. (40Ervasti J.M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with several modifications. In brief, homogenates of adult cardiac muscle were prepared as above in 1% digitonin, 2% Empigen, or 1% Nonidet P-40 in 140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with added protease inhibitors. The homogenates were mixed overnight at 4 °C with 1-ml aliquots of WGA-agarose (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The samples were washed first with buffer containing 0.1% of the appropriate detergent in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, followed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline. In control samples, the WGA-agarose was preincubated with a solution of 0.3 mN-acetylglucosamine in phosphate-buffered saline prior to addition of the homogenate. In addition, 0.3 mN-acetylglucosamine was added to the homogenate and was present in all subsequent washing steps. After washing, the beads were heated for 10 min at 65 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) and loaded onto either 3–8 or 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. The proteins were immunoblotted as described above.RT-PCR—RNA was purified from adult rat heart using TRIzol (Sigma) and following the manufacturer's directions. Aliquots containing 5 μg of RNA were used in a First Strand cDNA synthesis (Amersham Biosciences). Primers and Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) were added to the first strand reaction and placed in the thermocycler to generate the PCR products. Initially, degenerate primers were designed to the regions of high homology found at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the rod domains of intermediate filaments. The first set of degenerate primers that successfully yielded cytokeratin products included: sense, 5′-TTCCTGGAG(G/C)AG(G/C)AGAA(C/T)-3′, and antisense, 5′-(C/T)TCCAGCAG(C/T)(G/T)TCC(G/T)GTAGGT-3′. Subsequent primers were either designed to match cloned regions of the cytokeratins or to match sequences obtained from the GenBank™ data base (rat cytokeratin 8 under GenBank™ accession number M63482; mouse cytokeratin 19 under GenBank™ accession number M28698).Northern Blots—Northern blots were prepared with the Northern-Max™ Kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with minor modifications. Briefly, 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA aliquots from adult rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and skin (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) were separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to BrightStar-Plus nylon transfer membrane (Ambion, Inc.). The resulting Northern blot was blocked and probed at high stringency with portions of cDNAs encoding cytokeratins 8 and 19, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1, using QuikHyb (Stratagene). Probes that had less than 90% identity failed to produce a signal under these high stringency conditions. Labeled blots were exposed to film under an intensifier screen at –80 °C. Size markers, in kb, are shown in the center of the Northern blots of Fig. 1.Transfections—cDNA encoding the actin-binding domain of dystrophin (Dys-ABD) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pDys246, kindly provided by Dr. J. Ervasti (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The cDNA, encoding the Dys-ABD in the NH2-terminal 246 amino acids of dystrophin (41Orlova A. Rybakova I.N. Prochniewicz E. Thomas D.D. Ervasti J.M.

Primers were designed according to the dystrophin cDNA sequence obtained from the GenBank™ data base (GenBank™ accession number M18533).cDNA encoding cytokeratin 8 (K8) was amplified from plasmid p8.1.1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with primers designed according to the sequence obtained from the GenBank™ data base (GenBank™ accession number NM02273). The coding sequence of K8 was subcloned into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the pCMV-Myc vector to yield Myc-K8. The human cytokeratin 19 plasmid (PPA125) was kindly provided by Dr. P. Coulombe (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). PPA125 contains K19 in a GW1 vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. DH5α cells were transformed with all of the resulting plasmids.For transfections, COS-7 cells were grown on 13-mm coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin in an humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected when ∼30% confluent. Transient transfections utilized the calcium phosphate method and were performed with 1 μg each of the appropriate plasmids. After transfection, cultures were incubated for 24 h before they were prepared for immunofluorescence. Cells were then fixed for 15 min in 2% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Additional steps for immunofluorescence or fluorescence imaging were as above. Primary antibodies were either anti-myc (1:500) or anti-human K19 (1:50, Sigma), followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies. Images were collected by confocal microscopy, as described above.Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all materials were the highest grade available from Sigma.RESULTSPrevious work from our laboratory (33O'Neill A. Williams M.W. Resneck W.G. Milner D.J. Capetanaki Y. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2347-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that examined skeletal muscle from desmin-deficient mice suggested that additional IF proteins, possibly cytokeratins, might help to connect the contractile apparatus to costameres at the sarcolemmal membrane. We therefore designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers for use in RT-PCR experiments to identify other, possibly novel IF proteins in adult striated muscle.Cloning of Cytokeratins 8 and 19 from Rat Cardiac Muscle—We first designed oligonucleotide primers to the highly conserved regions at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the rod domain (17Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar) of both desmin and paranemin. These primers were used in RT-PCR experiments with mRNA from adult rat cardiac muscle. The first clone we identified using this method encoded 100 amino acids of the rod domain of cytokeratin 8 (K8). We used primers that exactly matched the sequence for K8 (accession number M63482) to clone the entire open reading frame (see Fig. 1A) and portions of the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions from the myocardium of the adult rat (GenBank™ accession number AY464139). Below the diagrams in Fig. 1, bars indicate the individual clones obtained and sequenced to compile the full-length sequences. An asterisk indicates the specific clone used in Northern blot experiments (see below). The translated sequence for K8 from cardiac muscle is 100% identical to the recently reported amino acid sequence for rat cytokeratin 8 and 99% identical to the nucleotide sequence (GenBank™ accession number XM343335), although we did identify a single clone in which Trp-123 was replaced with a Gly. The open reading frame contains 1449 nucleotides encoding 483 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 54,019 Da.Because the cytokeratins form heteromeric filaments composed of acidic and basic filaments, we performed additional RT-PCR experiments to iden"

The PDGF family of ligands is comprised of A, B, C, and D chains. Here, we provide the first functional characterization of the PDGF-C promoter. We examined 797 bp of the human PDGF-C promoter and identified several putative recognition elements for Sp1, Ets Egr-1, and Smad. The proximal region of the PDGF-C promoter bears a remarkable resemblance to a comparable region of the PDGF-A promoter (1Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Binding and transient transfection analysis in primary vascular smooth muscle cells revealed that PDGF-C, like PDGF-A, is under the transcriptional control of the zinc finger nuclear protein Egr-1 (early growth response-1). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using both smooth muscle cell nuclear extracts and recombinant protein revealed that Egr-1 and Sp1 bind this region of the PDGF-C promoter (Oligo C, –35 to –1). Egr-1 competes with Sp1 for overlapping binding sites even when the former is at a stoichiometric disadvantage. Reverse transcriptase PCR and supershift analysis demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) stimulates both Egr-1 and PDGF-C mRNA expression in a time-dependent and transient manner and that FGF-2-inducible Egr-1 binds the proximal PDGF-C promoter. FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C expression was completely abrogated using catalytic DNA (DNAzymes) targeting Egr-1 but not by its scrambled counterpart. Moreover, using pharmacological inhibitors we demonstrate the critical role of ERK but not JNK in FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C expression. These findings thus demonstrate that PDGF-C transcription, activated by FGF-2, is mediated by Egr-1 and its upstream kinase ERK.

Studies over the last two decades have implicated PDGF-A and -B, the classical PDGFs, in pathophysiologic processes such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis (2Heldin C.

Neointima formation in atherosclerosis or post-angioplasty restenosis is mediated by a complex series of signaling and transcriptional events involving smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the hallmark cell type in these vascular occlusive disorders. Studies have shown that PDGF-C, like PDGF-A and -B, is a potent mitogen for SMCs (12Dijkmans J. Xu J. Masure S. Dhanaraj S. Gosiewska A. Gessin J. Sprengel J. Harris S. Verhasselt P. Gordon R. Yon J.

Moreover, PDGF-C has recently been identified as a platelet α-granule secretory protein (11Fang L. Yan Y. Komuves L.G. Yonkovich S. Sullivan C.M. Stringer B. Galbraith S. Lokker N.A. Hwang S.S.

Biol. 2004; 24: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) similar to the classical PDGFs, suggesting common functions between PDGF ligand family members. PDGF-A and PDGF-B also share common mechanisms of gene regulation. The promoters of each gene are controlled, at least in part, by the nuclear activity of the zinc finger proteins Egr-1 and Sp1 (1Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Khachigian L.M. Halnon N.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Resnick N. Collins T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Egr-1 and Sp1 have affinity for overlapping G + C-rich binding sites in the proximal region of the PDGF-A and PDGF-B promoters. Interplay between these factors mediates inducible PDGF-A and PDGF-B transcription in cells exposed to chemical stresses such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and environmental stresses such as altered fluid shear stress and mechanical injury (1Khachigian L.M.

Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Egr-1/Sp1 interplay is also a feature common to the inducible expression of other vascular genes such as tissue factor (16Cui M.Z. Parry G.C. Oeth P. Larson H. Smith M. Huang R.P. Adamson E.D. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whether Egr-1 and/or Sp1 play a role in PDGF-C and PDGF-D promoter regulation is not known, because neither promoter has yet been characterized. Here we provide the first functional characterization of the PDGF-C promoter. We show that PDGF-C transcription is governed by Egr-1, which binds the proximal region of the PDGF-C promoter, competes with Sp1 for overlapping binding sites, and mediates FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C expression in an ERK but not a JNK-dependent manner. Cell Culture—Primary rat aortic SMCs were cultured in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Invitrogen), pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At confluence, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline solution and passaged by incubating with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution (BioWhittaker) for 7–10 min at 37 °C. The cells were resuspended in growth medium. All experiments were performed using cells between passages 5 and 8. Cells were growth-arrested for 24 h prior to the addition of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2; Promega) at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. Plasmid Construction—The 1288-bp region upstream from the PDGF-C ATG start site was amplified from human genomic DNA (Roche Applied Science) by PCR using the primers 5′-ATGCTAGCCCTGAACACAAGCCACAAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCTCGAGTTGTTGCTGGAAAACTGGAA-3′ (reverse). The fragment was cleaved by NheI and XhoI and ligated into the firefly luciferase-based reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega) to create construct pPDGF-C-797. The integrity of the reporter construct was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Transient Transfections—Primary SMCs at 70% confluence (100-mm Petri dishes) were incubated in serum-free medium for 6 h prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's guidelines, with 5 μg of reporter construct pPDGF-C-797 or pGL3-basic and 3 μg of pCB6 or pCB6-Egr-1. Cells were harvested 24h later, and the corresponding luciferase activity was quantified using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega). A double transfection was performed for transfections involving DNAzymes (ED5 and ED5SCR) (27Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Kavurma M.M. Chesterman C.N. Baker A. Atkins D.G. Khachigian L.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) targeting Egr-1. Briefly the cells were growth arrested for 6 h prior to the initial transfection using FuGENE6 and DNAzyme (0.4μm, final concentration). Eighteen hours later, fresh serum-free media was added together with FGF-2 at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. Minutes later, a second but identical transfection mix was added to the cells and incubated for a further 6 h prior to harvesting. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—SMCs treated with or without FGF-2 were washed twice and scraped in 10 ml of cold PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 40 s, and the pellet of nuclei was lysed with 20 μl of cold Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by mixing gently for 20 min at 4 °C. After re-centrifugation at 1400 rpm for 1 min, 20 μl of supernatant was combined with 20 μl of cold Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at –80 °C until use. All buffers contained protease inhibitors. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Binding reactions were carried out in volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon DNA (Sigma), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (100,000 cpm), and 6–10 μg of nuclear extract. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. In supershift studies, 1 μl of the indicated affinity-purified rabbit anti-peptide antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with the extracts for 15 min prior to the addition of the probe. In interplay experiments, binding reactions were carried out for 15 min on ice with the addition of bovine serum albumin (2 μg) and human recombinant Sp1 (12.5–100 ng) (Promega) or human recombinant Egr-1 (20–80 ng) (Alexis Biochemicals). Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and vacuum dried at 80 °C for 1 h before visualization by autoradiography. Total RNA Preparation and mRNA Expression Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) according the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated using 5 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT), and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Promega) according the manufacturer's instructions. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: PDGF-C, 98 °C for 30 s, 62.5 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 40 cycles; β-actin, 98 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 18 cycles; and Egr-1, 98 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. The relative primers are as follows: PDGF-C, 5′-TCCAGCAACAAGGAACAGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGAAGGGGGTAGCTCTGAA-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′ (reverse); Egr-1, 5′-GCATGTAACGCGGCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGAACGGGTCAGAGAT-3′ (reverse). The mitogen-activated kinase kinase inhibitors PD98059 and SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, to date there are no reports of the functional characterization of the PDGF-C promoter in any cell type. We isolated a 1.395-kb fragment of human genomic PDGF-C DNA from a commercial source (Roche Applied Science) using primers engineered to contain restriction sites for NheI or XhoI. The 5′ primer targeted position –797 (as the extreme 5′ nucleotide upstream from the predicted transcriptional start site defined by the University of California Santa Cruz genome data base), whereas the 3′ primer targeted position 598 bp spanning the entire 5′ untranslated region. The 797-bp promoter region lacks a consensus TATA box but contains putative binding sites for Sp1, Egr-1, Ets-1, and Smad (Fig. 1A). The nucleotide sequence immediately adjacent to the 5′ untranslated region is extremely G + C-rich. The 1288-bp PDGF-C genomic sequence is ∼80% homologous between human and mouse. To begin to investigate the transcriptional regulation of PDGF-C, we subcloned this fragment into the corresponding restriction sites in the firefly luciferase-based reporter construct pGL3-basic. Identification of a G + C-rich region in the PDGF-C Proximal Promoter that Physically Interacts with Egr-1 and Sp1—Upon examination of the PDGF-C promoter (Fig. 1A), we discovered that a 35-bp G + C-rich region (spanning bp –35 to –1) possesses striking similarity to a comparably sized region (–6 to –47) in the proximal human PDGF-A promoter (Fig. 1B). This region of the PDGF-A promoter contains overlapping binding elements for Egr-1 and Sp1 (1Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which led us to hypothesize that the proximal region of the PDGF-C promoter might also support the interaction of Egr-1 and Sp1 (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, we performed EMSA using a 32P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning bp –35 to –1 of the PDGF-C promoter (32P-Oligo C –35 to –1) and nuclear extracts of SMCs that had been growth-arrested in serum-free media for 24 h. Six nucleoprotein complexes formed, i.e. three major (complexes N1, N5, and N6) and three minor (complexes N2, N3, and N4) (Fig. 2A). Cold competition analysis using a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled Oligo A (–76 to –47) bearing the proximal PDGF-A promoter sequence inhibited the formation of all six complexes (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the same fold molar excess of unlabeled Oligo Ets (bearing a consensus Ets binding site) failed to alter the profile of these complexes (Fig. 2A). Unlabeled Oligo C (–35 to –1) inhibited formation of the same complexes as Oligo A (compare Fig. 2, A and B). The fact that the formation of complex N5 was not completely inhibited at this molar excess of either unlabeled oligonucleotide as compared with other complexes (Fig. 2, A and B) indicates that the protein components of these complexes bind the DNA with different affinities. The capacity of Oligo A (–76 to –47) to specifically compete with Oligo C (–35 to –1) suggests the possibility that similar proteins bind to each oligonucleotide. Supershift analysis using antibodies raised against Egr-1 and Sp1 revealed that the 32P-Oligo C (–35 to –1) complex N1 contains Sp1 (Fig. 2B) and that complex N3 contains Egr-1 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the nucleoprotein complex profile was not affected by Sp3 antibodies (Fig. 2B). To further confirm the physical interaction of Egr-1 and Sp1 with the PDGF-C promoter, we performed EMSA using human recombinant Sp1 and/or Egr-1 and 32P-labeled Oligo C (–35 to –1). Both recombinant proteins bound to the oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A). The formation of multiple complexes (Fig. 3A; S1–S2 for Sp1 and E1–E4 for Egr-1) suggests either the existence of multiple sites for each protein in this region of the promoter, self-association, or binding by partially degraded species. Because Egr-1 and Sp1 bind to overlapping binding sites in the PDGF-A promoter, we performed protein-protein competition analysis using EMSA and the two recombinant proteins with 32P-Oligo C (–35 to –1). When increasing amounts of Egr-1 were added to a reaction containing fixed amounts of Sp1, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in Sp1 binding as Egr-1 binding became more apparent (Fig. 3B). No “super” species was observed when Sp1 and Egr-1 were co-incubated with the oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B), indicating that these proteins do not simultaneously occupy the promoter fragment. This data (Fig. 3B), supported by cross-competition studies with Oligo A (–76 to –47) and Oligo C (–35 to –1) (Fig. 2B) indicates the existence of interplay in the proximal PDGF-C promoter. Moreover, because Egr-1 is induced by multiple pro-atherogenic stimuli (14Khachigian L.M. Halnon N.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Resnick N. Collins T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Khachigian L.M. Linder V. Williams A.J. Collins T.

Res. 1997; 81: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), PDGF-C transcription may be positively regulated by Egr-1 in SMCs exposed to pathophysiologically relevant stimuli. Egr-1 Activation of the PDGF-C Promoter—To determine the functional consequence of the interaction of endogenous and recombinant Egr-1 with the PDGF-C promoter, we performed transient co-transfection analysis using pPDGF-C-797 and pCB6-Egr-1, which generates exogenous Egr-1 (Fig. 4). pCB6-Egr-1 activated the PDGF-C promoter >5-fold as compared with the backbone, pCB6, alone (Fig. 4). In contrast, no difference was observed when pCB6-Egr-1 or pCB6 was co-transfected with pGL3-basic, the empty luciferase vector (Fig. 4). FGF-2 Induces Egr-1 and PDGF-C mRNA Expression in SMCs—FGF-2 is a key mediator of cell growth and differentiation under physiological and pathological conditions (25Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; (http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/3/REVIEWS/3005)PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that Egr-1 is under the transcriptional control of FGF-2 (26Santiago F. Lowe H.C. Day F.L. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 154: 937-944Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that FGF-2 mediates Egr-1-dependent PDGF-C activation. Serum-starved SMCs were treated with FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) for various times prior to the assessment of steady-state mRNA levels by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (Fig. 5). PDGF-C mRNA expression increased in response to FGF-2 in a time-dependent manner, maximally at 4 h (Fig. 5, top section). FGF-2 induced Egr-1 mRNA expression maximally at 2 h and prior to returning to basal levels by 24 h (Fig. 5, middle section). β-Actin levels demonstrate unbiased loading between the samples (Fig. 5, bottom section). Interestingly, low levels of basal PDGF-C expression in the absence of FGF-2 coincide with weak Egr-1 expression (Fig. 5) and Egr-1 DNA binding (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. 6). These findings, which illustrate the tight temporal relationship between Egr-1 and FGF-2 expression, demonstrate for the first time that FGF-2 is an agonist of PDGF-C expression.Fig. 6Induction of Egr-1 DNA-binding activity by FGF-2. EMSA was performed using 32P-Oligo C (–35 to –1) and nuclear extracts (NE) from serum-starved SMCs treated with or without FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) for 2 or 4 h. Complexes N1–N6 are indicated by arrows. Supershift analysis demonstrates the specificity of the FGF-2-induced nucleoprotein complex (IND) as Egr-1. Nuclear extracts were corrected for protein concentration prior to assay. α, antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FGF-2 Induces Egr-1 Binding to the PDGF-C Proximal Promoter in SMCs—EMSA using nuclear extracts of SMCs treated with FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) and 32P-Oligo C (–35 to –1) revealed the formation of complexes N1–N6 (Fig. 6). Of these, only one complex (N3) was transiently induced (Fig. 6, IND) upon exposure to FGF-2 (Fig. 6). Complex N3 was clearly apparent within 2 h; then intensity levels fell within the subsequent 2 h (Fig. 6). Supershift analysis revealed that the nucleoprotein complex was eliminated with antibodies to Egr-1 (Fig. 6) but not to Sp1 (Fig. 6). The weak intensity of complex N3 in Fig. 2, A and B, reflects the use of extracts from growth-quiescent (unstimulated) SMCs. These data indicate that FGF-2 stimulates the synthesis and nuclear accumulation of Egr-1, which then translocates to the nucleus and binds the proximal PDGF-C promoter coincident with increased PDGF-C expression. Egr-1 DNAzymes Block FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C mRNA Expression—To directly establish whether FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C expression is critically dependent upon the activation of Egr-1, we assessed PDGF-C levels in SMCs that had previously been transfected with the Egr-1 DNAzyme ED5. DNAzymes are sequence-specific “gene knock-down” agents, which we used previously to inhibit neointima formation in rat carotid arteries after balloon injury (27Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Kavurma M.M. Chesterman C.N. Baker A. Atkins D.G. Khachigian L.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and in pig coronary arteries following stenting (28Lowe H.C. Fahmy R.G. Kavurma M.M. Baker A. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Serum-starved SMCs were transfected either with ED5 (27Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Kavurma M.M. Chesterman C.N. Baker A. Atkins D.G. Khachigian L.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which targets and cleaves the translational start site of rat Egr-1 mRNA (27Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Kavurma M.M. Chesterman C.N. Baker A. Atkins D.G. Khachigian L.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), or ED5SCR, the scrambled counterpart to ED5. After treatment with FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) for 6 h, we observed no activation of PDGF-C expression in cells transfected with ED5 (Fig. 7). In contrast, PDGF-C expression was still induced in SMCs transfected with ED5SCR and exposed to FGF-2 (Fig. 7). PDGF-C expression under these latter conditions did not differ from that of cells stimulated with FGF-2 alone (Fig. 7). FGF-2 Induces PDGF-C via an ERK but Not a JNK-dependent Signaling Pathway—FGF-2-induced signal transduction is known to involve the activation of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases such as ERK and JNK. These pathways are important for many fundamental cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. To determine the signaling pathway mediating FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C expression, we incubated serum-starved SMC with either PD98059 (10 μm) or SP600125 (25 nm) for 1 h prior to treatment with FGF-2 (25 ng/ml). FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C mRNA expression was blocked by the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 8) but not by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 8). These findings, consistent with our previous demonstration that FGF-2 stimulates Egr-1 expression through the specific activation of ERK (26Santiago F. Lowe H.C. Day F.L. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 154: 937-944Scopus (111) Google Scholar), therefore indicates the involvement of the ERK-Egr-1 axis in FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C expression. The formation of the neointima in occlusive vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis is mediated by a complex series of signaling and transcriptional events that alter the SMC phenotype. Growth factors such as FGF-2 are constitutively expressed by SMC and endothelial cells in the normal and diseased artery wall and serve as reservoirs of mitogens that are released upon vascular injury. The release of FGF-2 may trigger the expression of other mitogens, thereby starting a cascade of autocrine/paracrine growth and consequential intimal thickening. The PDGF-C chain is expressed by SMCs in the intact artery wall and is a potent mitogen for this cell type (12Dijkmans J. Xu J. Masure S. Dhanaraj S. Gosiewska A. Gessin J. Sprengel J. Harris S.

Alitalo K. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2242-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that FGF-2 stimulates PDGF-C expression in SMCs via the ERK-dependent zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1, which is itself rapidly and transiently induced by arterial injury (7Aase K. Abramsson A. Karlsson L. Betsholtz C. Eriksson U. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Khachigian L.M. Linder V. Williams A.J. Collins T.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As such, this study, through the use of agonists, overexpression, and novel knockdown approaches, is the first to provide key insights into the transcriptional mechanisms regulating PDGF-C activation in any cell type. It also points out the remarkable similarity between the proximal G + C-rich regions of the PDGF-A (bp –76 to –47) and PDGF-C (–35 to –1) promoters and how Egr-1/Sp1 interplay is a common theme to both these promoters, as it is to those of PDGF-B, u-PA, PAI-1, and tissue factor (15Khachigian L.M. Linder V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to activate multiple pathophysiologically important genes involved in cell growth, migration, cell adhesion, and coagulation, strategies targeting Egr-1 may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of vascular occlusive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2083901212,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of structurally related proteins with the collective capability to degrade all components of the extracellular matrix. Although MMP-mediated degradation of the extracellular matrix occurs physiologically, numerous pathological conditions exhibit increased MMP levels and excessive matrix degradation. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that interferon-γ inhibits MMP-9 expression in a manner dependent upon STAT-1α. Here we extend our previous observations and show that the class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator (CIITA), a transcriptional target of STAT-1α, is also capable of inhibiting MMP-9 expression. By using stable cell lines that inducibly express CIITA or various mutant forms of CIITA, we show that CIITA requires the ability to bind the CREB-binding protein (CBP) to effectively inhibit MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, we show that CIITA-mediated inhibition of the <i>MMP-9</i> gene does not rely on the transcriptional capability of CIITA. These findings support a model wherein CIITA inhibits MMP-9 expression by binding to and sequestering CBP, which reduces the levels of CBP at the <i>MMP-9</i> promoter, inhibits levels of acetylated histone 3 at the <i>MMP-9</i> promoter, and subsequently inhibits MMP-9 expression."

New Biol. 1973; 242: 148-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) for the analysis of the metastatic properties of melanoma cells (Fig. 1). In this assay, cells of interest are injected into the tail vein of mice and allowed to proliferate and/or metastasize. After several weeks, pulmonary metastases are observed in the case of strongly metastatic melanoma cells, while relatively few metastases are formed after injection of cells with limited metastatic potential. This assay allows the selection of strongly metastatic cells from a heterogeneous population of weakly metastatic tumor cells (18Fidler I.J. Nat.

Thus, the assay allows not only the study of the metastatic characteristics of melanoma cells but also the isolation of strongly metastatic cells. In the present study, we used this mouse model and mouse B16F0 melanoma cells, a weakly metastatic melanoma cell line, to investigate the applicability of a library of ribozymes in vivo, to isolate ribozymes that converted weakly metastatic melanoma cells to strongly metastatic cells by the apparent disruption of expression of specific gene(s), and to identify genes related to metastasis. Construction of a Ribozyme Library—A library of ribozymes was constructed based on the retrovirus expression vector pMXpuro (20Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). First, fragments of DNA carrying randomized hammerhead ribozymes were obtained by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide DNAs as follows, a sense primer (5′-TCC CCG GTT CGA AAC CGG GCA-3′), an antisense primer (5′-GCT TGC ATG CCT GCA GGT CGA CGC GAT AGA AAA AAA GAT ATC CGG GGT-3′), and a template (5′-TCC CCG GTT CGA AAC CGG GCA CTA CAA AAA CCA ACT TTN NNN NNNN CTG ATG AGG CCG AAA GGC CGA AAN NNN NNNG GTA CCC CGG ATA TCT TTT TTT-3′, where N represents A, T, G, or C). The fragments were cloned into a plasmid vector, pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI), then were digested with Csp45I and KpnI, and were again cloned into pPUR-KE (21Koseki S. Tanabe T. Tani K. Asano S. Shioda T. Nagai Y. Shimada T. Ohkawa J. Taira K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, fragments encoding tRNAVal-fused randomized ribozymes were obtained by digestion of the library of ribozymes based on pPUR-KE with EcoRI and BamHI. Finally, the fragments were inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites in pMXpuro. Cell Culture and Retroviral Infection—B16F0 melanoma cells (number CRL-6322; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and an antibiotics mixture (Invitrogen). Retroviral preparation and infection with the retroviral vector pMXpuro and the packaging cell line Plat-E (kindly provided by Professor Toshio Kitamura, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) were performed as described elsewhere (14Suyama E.

Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Infected cells were treated with medium that contained puromycin (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 4 weeks. Experimental Metastasis Assay—5 × 105 of B16F0 cells, infected with retroviruses carrying a ribozyme library or not, were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; STIM1, stromal interaction molecule 1 gene; Polg2, polymerase γ2 accessory subunit gene; Cyp2d22, cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily d, polypeptide 22 gene.; Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and intravenously injected into the lateral tail vein of C57BL/6NCrj mice (Charles River Japan, Yokohama, Japan). Two weeks after injection, lungs were removed from the mice and were washed with ice-cold PBS. The pulmonary metastases on the surface of the lungs were observed and counted. Then the nodules were removed, minced, and cultured in dishes. RT-PCR Analysis and Ribozyme Rescue—Total RNA was prepared from cells using the Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Using the cDNA as templates, PCR amplification was performed with primers as follows: ribozyme sense, 5′-TCC CCG GTT CGA AAC CGG GCA-3′; ribozyme antisense, 5′-GCT TGC ATG CCT GCA GGT CGA CGC GAT AGA AAA AAA GAT ATC CGG GGT-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GCA CGG CAT CGT CAC CAA CT-3′; and β-actin antisense, 5′-AAG GCT GGA AGA GTG CCT CA-3′. The amplified fragments of DNA were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments carrying ribozymes that were derived from the metastatic nodules were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. Search of DNA Data Bases—By searching of mouse cDNA databases with the BLAST program, identification of target genes of the selected ribozymes was performed (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) (www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Parameters for the data base searches were set to optimize searches for short, nearly exact sequences. Construction and Transfection of siRNA Expression Plasmid—Plasmid vectors encoding siRNAs for four of the eight identified targets were constructed as described (23Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Rev. Mutat. Res. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Two target sites for each of the genes were selected using an algorithm (www.igene-therapeutics.co.jp). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Typically, 3 μg of plasmid DNA was used per 80% confluent 6-cm dish culture. Transfected B16F0 cells were selected in medium containing puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for 48 h and then subjected to RT-PCR analysis and in vitro scratch-wound assay. The expression of targeted genes was examined by gene-specific primers, STIM1 (sense: 5′-GGG AAG ACC TCA ATT ACC A-3′ and antisense: 5′-CAG CTG CAG CTT CTG CCT GT-3′), Polg-2 (sense: 5′-GGG AAG CAA ACT TTA CTA CAA CT-3′ and antisense: 5′-ATC CAA AGC GAC CTT AAT AG-3′), and Cyp2d22 (sense: 5′-AAG GAG GAA GCT GGA TTC CTA CC-3′ and antisense: 5′-CCC TAT GAC TTC ATC GAT TT-3′), on standard condition for RT-PCR (25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, –54 °C for 60 s, –72 °C for 60 s). Scratch-wound Assay—B16F0 cells that had been treated with siRNA expression plasmid were allowed to form a monolayer on a fibronectin (10 μg/ml)-coated dish surface. A wound was made in the monolayer of cells by completely scratching the cells in a line with a pipette tip. Cells were washed a few times with PBS to remove cell debris and fed with fresh medium as described (14Suyama E. Kawasaki H. Nakajima M. Taira K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5616-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The time of the scratching wound was designated as time 0. Cells were allowed to proliferate and migrate into the wound during the next 30 h. Migration of cells into the wound was recorded under a phase contrast microscope with a 10× phase objective. We constructed a library of ribozymes that was based on the retroviral expression vector pMXpuro (20Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Retroviruses carrying randomized ribozymes were prepared in the packaging cell line Plat-E as described elsewhere (14Suyama E. Kawasaki H. Nakajima M. Taira K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5616-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Then we infected weakly metastatic B16F0 cells with the retroviruses for the selection of ribozymes that enhanced the metastatic properties of the cells (Fig. 2, A and B). After antibiotic (puromycin) selection, we confirmed the expression of randomized ribozymes in cells by RT-PCR analysis with primers specific for the parent ribozyme (Fig. 2C). Then we injected 5 × 105 control or randomized ribozymes harboring B16F0 cells intravenously into the lateral tail vein of individual C57BL/6N mice. Cells with enhanced metastatic properties were selected by their isolation from lung as pulmonary tumors. Only a few pulmonary metastases were detected in the mice injected with parent B16F0 cells as reported earlier (18Fidler I.J. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 242: 148-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 19Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A and B, show the difference in terms of the resultant pulmonary metastases between cells that had been treated with the ribozyme library and untreated cells, 2 weeks after injection. The number of metastatic melanoma nodules derived from library-treated cells was clearly higher than those derived from untreated cells. Thus, certain ribozymes in the library appeared to have promoted the pulmonary metastasis of B16F0 cells (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 3Selection in vivo of ribozymes that enhanced the metastatic properties of B16F0 melanoma cells, using a mouse model and cells treated with the library of randomized ribozymes.

B, number of pulmonary tumors isolated after the injection of B16F0 cells that had been treated with randomized ribozymes (RRz) or tRNAVal alone (RRz minus).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we removed the pulmonary nodules of melanoma cells derived from ribozyme harboring cells (Fig. 3A), and we collected cells from these nodules by mincing and treating them with trypsin. The resultant cells were cultured, and RNA was isolated from these cells. Then ribozymes were amplified by RT-PCR strategy and cloned into plasmid vector (15Nelson L.D. Suyama E. Kawasaki H. Taira K. Targets. 2003; 2: 191-200Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), and the results of sequencing of the ribozymes indicated that the selected ribozymes represented eight types of ribozyme that contained specific substrate-recognition arms (Table I). By this way, we recovered ribozymes that appeared to have raised the metastatic potential of B16F0 cells.Table ISelected ribozymes and their target genes Open table in a new tab We then identified their target genes by searching data bases with the BLAST program, using settings that optimized searches for short, nearly exactly matching sequences (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) (www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) (Table I). Among the selected ribozymes, our search indicated that ribozyme A targeted the transcript of the gene known as stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). STIM1 is a gene for a transmembrane glycoprotein. This gene is located at human chromosome region 11p15.5, which is involved in tumorigenesis. Moreover, overexpression of STIM1 causes growth arrest and cell death in several lines of cells (24Sabbioni S. Barbanti-Brodano G. Croce C.M. Negrini M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar, 25Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Williams R.T. van Stekelenburg L. Pearson R.B. Dziadek M. Smith P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These earlier observations indicate that STIM1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, our identification of a ribozyme that targets STIM1 in our assay of metastasis by cells treated with a ribozyme library seems eminently reasonable. Our data base search also identified genes whose functions have not yet been well characterized, such as the sequence AW551984, expressed in the mouse, which contains a VWA domain that seems to mediate adhesion of eukaryotic cells (a target for ribozyme B; GenBank™ accession number NM_178737.1; Table I). We next constructed siRNA expression vectors against four (STIM1, AW551984, Polg2, and Cyp2d22) out of the eight identified genes and examined their functional involvement in metastasis by carrying out a scratch-wound assay that is commonly used to study the ability of cells to migrate (26Magdalena J. Millard T.H. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Ettenson D.S. Gotileb A.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a reliable parameter for metastasis. We prepared two different siRNA expression vectors for each of target genes (Table II). Cells harboring the expression plasmid were selected in puromycin supplemented medium. We examined suppression of the expression of target genes and confirmed reduced levels of expression of three genes, STIM1, Polg2, and Cyp2d22 (unfortunately, AW551984 transcript could not be detected by RT-PCR analysis) (Fig. 4A). Then we subjected the cells to the scratch-wound assay (Fig. 4B). Targeting of all the four genes led to significant acceleration of migration, which is one of the properties of metastatic cells. AW551984- and Polg2-targeted B16F0 cells moved more than 90% of the width of the wound in 30 h, whereas control cells, which had been treated with empty vector, only initiated to migrate into the wound. Parallel observation on STIM1- and Cyp2d22-targeted cells revealed about 50% movement into the wound (Fig. 4B). Although siRNA-induced suppression of AW551984 could not be confirmed due to technical difficulty in RT-PCR analysis, the change in phenotype (increased migration) was obtained in two independent experiments. Taken together, these four genes appeared to have a role in control of the metastatic properties of B16F0 melanoma cells. Further investigation of genes identified in this study would provide important clues to the complex mechanism(s) of metastasis.Table IIsiRNA target sequenceGeneTarget siteSequenceSTIM1Site 1GGGAAGACCTCAATTACCASite 2GGCCAAGAAGACATTTATAAW551984Site 1GAACAAACTTCTATCTTTASite 2AGTCAAACTTGTAAATAGAPolg2Site 1GAAGCAAACTTTACTACAASite 2GGGAAAGGAGCCAATAGAACyp2d22Site 1GAAGGAAACTCTTAAGGAASite 2GCGCCGAGTACAACAGGAA Open table in a new tab To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the applicability of a ribozyme library to the identification of genes using animal model.

https://openalex.org/W1985907519,"β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) of all species are N-linked glycosylated at amino terminus residues ∼6 and ∼15. However, the human β2AR has a potential third N-glycosylation site at ECL2 residue 187. To determine whether this residue is glycosylated and to ascertain function, all possible single/multiple Asn → Gln mutations were made in the human β2 AR at positions 6, 15, and 187 and were expressed in Chinese hamster fibroblast cells. Substitution of Asn-187 alone or with Asn-6 or Asn-15 decreased the apparent molecular mass of the receptor on SDS-PAGE in a manner consistent with Asn-187 glycosylation. All receptors bound the agonist isoproterenol and functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase. However, receptors without 187 glycosylation failed to display long term agonist-promoted down-regulation. In contrast, loss of Asn-6/Asn-15 glycosylation did not alter down-regulation. Cell surface distribution and agonist-promoted internalization of receptors and recruitment of β-arrestin 2 were unaffected by the loss of 187 glycosylation. Furthermore, acutely internalized wild-type and Gln-187 receptors were both localized by confocal microscopy to early endosomes. During prolonged agonist exposure, wild-type β2AR co-localized with lysosomes, consistent with trafficking to a degradation compartment. However, Gln-187 β2AR failed to co-localize with lysosomes despite agonist treatments up to 18 h. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this third glycosylation site is found in humans and other higher order primates but not in lower order primates such as the monkey. Nor is this third site found in rodents, which are frequently utilized as animal models. These data thus reveal a previously unrecognized β2AR regulatory motif that appeared late in primate evolution and serves to direct internalized receptors to lysosomal degradation during long term agonist exposure. β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) of all species are N-linked glycosylated at amino terminus residues ∼6 and ∼15.

These data thus reveal a previously unrecognized β2AR regulatory motif that appeared late in primate evolution and serves to direct internalized receptors to lysosomal degradation during long term agonist exposure. Like many other G-protein-coupled receptors the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) 1The abbreviations used are: β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; 125I-CYP,125I-cyanopindolol. undergoes a loss of cellular signaling during prolonged agonist exposure. This phenomenon, termed desensitization, serves to integrate β2AR function within the context of a cell that is receiving many signals (1Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In pathologic conditions, this adaptive response can also contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease and can limit therapeutic effectiveness of agonists administered over prolonged periods of time (1Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Early molecular events during short term agonist activation include phosphorylation of the β2AR by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases and protein kinase A, which act to rapidly regulate receptor function along a minute-by-minute time frame. With long term agonist exposure, an additional series of events leads to a net loss of cellular receptors, termed down-regulation, which markedly reduces the cellular response (such as cAMP production). The basis of receptor down-regulation includes degradation of the β2AR protein, which is linked to early desensitization events, because G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation of β2AR leads to recruitment and binding of β-arrestin, which, via its scaffolding functions, facilitates internalization (2Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A sorting of internalized receptors can result in reinsertion into the cell membrane or movement of a receptor into a degradative pathway with an ultimate loss of the intact receptor (3Sorkin A. von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The structural features of the β2AR that appear to be involved in internalization, recycling, and/or down-regulation, include G-protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites in the intracellular tail (4Ferguson S.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the third intracellular loop protein kinase A phosphorylation site (5Bouvier M. Collins S. O'Dowd B.F. Campbell P.T. Deblasi A. Kobilka B.K. MacGregor C. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10776-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Expression or trafficking of some G-protein-coupled receptors, such as the β2AR, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, and the V2-vasopressin receptor is dependent on post-translational modifications including Nand O-linked glycosylation (8Rands E. Candelore M.R. Cheung A.H. Hill W.S. Strader C.D. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10759-10764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Benya R.V. Kusui T. Katsuno T. Tsuda T. Mantey S.A.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All β2AR genes identified to date from multiple species have two sites for N-linked glycosylation within the amino terminus of the receptor at amino acid positions ∼6 and ∼15. Removal of these sites in the hamster β2AR by mutagenesis results in receptors that have an impaired capacity to insert into the membrane. Nevertheless, ∼50% of the total receptor compliment is ultimately expressed on the cell surface (8Rands E. Candelore M.R. Cheung A.H. Hill W.S. Strader C.D. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10759-10764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human β2AR has an additional potential N-glycosylation site, localized to the second extracellular loop, at amino acid 187; this consensus sequence is not found in a wide variety of non-primate species reported to date (see Fig. 1). This prompted us to examine the role of Asn-187 of the human β2AR with the idea that this modification may represent a specific mechanism for receptor trafficking that occurred late in mammalian evolution and serves a unique function necessary for primate homeostasis. Constructs and Transfections—Site-directed mutagenesis of the human β2AR cDNA was carried out so as to substitute Gln for Asn at amino acids 6, 15, and 187, both singly and in combination. This resulted in eight cDNAs encoding receptors with all possible glycosylation combinations, denoted as NNN (wild-type), QNN, NQN, NNQ, QQN, QNQ, NQQ, and QQQ. These cDNAs were subcloned into a pFLAG-CMV construct, which contained the 5′-FLAG epitope (DYKD-DDDK) in-frame with the β2AR. Chinese hamster fibroblasts (CHW-1102 cells) were stably transfected by a calcium precipitation technique as described, and selection was performed in 300 μg/ml G418. Cells were maintained in 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For β-arrestin recruitment studies, human embryonic kidney-293 cells were transiently co-transfected by a calcium precipitation method with the β2AR construct of interest and a construct consisting of a β-arrestin 2-green fluorescent protein fusion gene as described (11Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and detached by scraping in 5 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. This and subsequent buffers contained 5 μg/ml of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, and benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell particulates were homogenized with a Polytron and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 75 mm Tris, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Competition and saturation radioligand binding studies with these membranes were carried out using 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) as described previously (12Green S.A. Spasoff A.P. Coleman R.A. Johnson M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24029-24035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To quantitate only the cell surface β2AR, radioligand binding was carried out using adhered intact cells in 12-well dishes with the hydrophilic radioligand 3H-CGP12177 (6 nm) in the absence or presence of 1.0 μm propranolol used to define nonspecific binding as described (13Green S. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 4 °C for 4 h. Then cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline, and the contents were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Additional experiments to ascertain internal versus cell surface β2AR utilized intact cell binding with 125I-CYP, in competition with 0.3 μm unlabeled CGP12177 (identifies cell surface receptors) and 1.0 μm propranolol (identifies total cellular pool of receptors) as described else-where in detail (14Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the 125I-CYP binding experiments, reactions were terminated by a dilution in 5 mm Tris 2 mm EDTA buffer at 4 ° C, and bound radioligand was separated from free by vacuum filtration over glass fiber filters. Adenylyl Cyclase Activities—Membranes were incubated with 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 120 μm ATP, 60 μm GTP, 2.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.2 μg of myokinase, 100 μm cAMP, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C as described (15Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). [32P]cAMP was separated from [α-32P]ATP by chromatography over alumina columns. A[3H]cAMP standard included in the stop buffer accounted for individual column recovery. Activities were determined in the presence of vehicle (basal), 10 μm isoproterenol, or 100 μm forskolin. Confocal Microscopy—To localize β2AR, β-arrestin 2, and various intracellular organelles, confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning microscope and a 63/1.4 oil immersion lens (β-arrestin 2-green fluorescent protein) or 63/1.2 water immersion lens (others). For β2AR localization, studies were performed on fixed cells. In a typical experiment, attached cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were treated with agonist for the indicated times at 37 °C in 5% CO2, washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with –20 °C methanol. β2AR receptors were identified with a mouse anti-FLAG-M2 primary antibody (Sigma) and the goat anti-mouse secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probe). Lysosome compartments were stained with a rabbit anti-cathepsin-D primary antibody (Santa Cruz) (16Moore R.H. Tuffaha A. Millman E.E. Dai W. Hall H.S. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 543. The early endosome compartment was stained with a rabbit anti-EEA1 primary antibody (Affinity BioReagents) (17Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol.

Images were obtained with excitations of 488 or 543 nm and emission spectra of 505–530 or 560 nm, respectively. For β-arrestin recruitment studies in live cells, cells transfected with β2AR and β-arrestin 2-green fluorescent protein (11Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with the indicated agonist, and real time confocal microscopy was carried out using excitation at 488 nm and a 515–540 nm emission filter. Other—For Western blots, cell membranes were solubilized in radio-immune precipitation assay buffer, and the proteins were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. They were blotted with primary antibody (mouse anti-FLAG-M2) at a titer of 1:750 and a secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for chemiluminescence detection. For fractionation experiments, membranes were separated using a self-generating Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient as described (18Green S.A. Zimmer K.P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Six 1.5-ml fractions were collected and probed by Western blot with the cathepsin-D and EEA1 antibodies or were used for radioligand binding studies to quantitate β2AR. Protein concentrations were determined by the copper bicinchoninic acid method (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding and kinetic data were fit to standard models using the program Prism (GraphPad Software). Western blots of membranes from transfected cells expressing the wild-type and seven mutated β2ARs are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, an individual removal of position 6 or 15 glycosylation sites resulted in decreases in apparent molecular mass of the major high molecular mass form (from ∼60 to ∼56 kDa), and the loss of both sites reduced the molecular mass proportionately. Consistent with position 187 also being glycosylated, the NNQ receptor also had a lower apparent molecular mass like that of the QNN and NQN receptors. Removal of the position 187 site, in combination with those at 6 and/or 15, had the expected additive decrease in apparent molecular mass of the major receptor species as shown. Each of the expressed receptors had similar binding affinities for isoproterenol, and functionally stimulated adenylyl cyclase (Table I). The consequences of long term (18 h) exposure of cells expressing each of the eight receptors on down-regulation are shown in Fig. 3. A striking and consistent effect imparted by the removal of the glycosylation site at position 187 was observed. As shown, wild-type β2AR underwent a 34 ± 3.4% down-regulation. A similar extent of down-regulation was also observed for the single and doubly substituted QNN, NQN, and QQN receptors. In contrast, single removal of the 187-glycosylation site (NNQ receptor) resulted in a complete loss of agonist-promoted down-regulation, and in fact an increase in expression was noted (15 ± 6.7%, p s< 0.01 versus wild-type). This same phenotype was observed with all mutant β2ARs (NNQ, QNQ, NQQ, and QQQ) where the position 187 was mutated, regardless of the presence or absence of the other glycosylation sites (Fig. 3). The QQQ receptor displayed the greatest increase in expression during agonist exposure. This may be because of the fact that the QQN receptor has some-what less down-regulation than wild-type and thus less impediment to the up-regulation events imposed by QQQ, as compared with NNQ. Additional studies were also performed using the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Chinese hamster fibroblast cells expressing wild-type β2AR at 50% confluency were treated for 12 h with 0.25 μg/ml tunicamycin in the media and then for an additional 12 h with 10 μm isoproterenol. Tunicamycin-treated cells underwent only 46 ± 1.3% of the isoproterenol-promoted down-regulation observed with non-tunicamycin-treated cells. These results further support the notion that it is the loss of glycosylation imposed by the mutation at 187 that leads to the altered down-regulation phenotype of the NNQ receptor.Table IPharmacologic properties of the human β2AR mutated at various glycosylation sitesReceptorKi ISOISO stimulation of adenylyl cyclaseBmaxnm% forskolinfmol/mgNNN253 ± 4233.7 ± 6207 ± 55QNN374 ± 7737.2 ± 5207 ± 33NQN257 ± 7642.3 ± 5133 ± 14QQN247 ± 2924.1 ± 1304 ± 48QNQ371 ± 13638.4 ± 1226 ± 15NNQ183 ± 7027.2 ± 2133 ± 17NQQ111 ± 1449.1 ± 5381 ± 70QQQ295 ± 11335.4 ± 4388 ± 62 Open table in a new tab The basis for the marked phenotype imposed by the glycosylation deficiency at position 187 was further explored with the NNQ mutant, thereby maintaining wild-type glycosylation at positions 6 and 15. At base line (i.e. absence of agonist exposure) both wild-type and NNQ β2AR were predominantly expressed at the cell surface, as qualitatively shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4) and quantitatively determined by whole-cell radioligand binding with hydrophilic and hydrophobic ligands (95 ± 8.3 versus 90 ± 2.4% of the total receptor complements were at the cell surface for wild-type versus NNQ, respectively, n = 4). One of the earliest events in internalization of β2AR upon agonist binding is the recruitment of β-arrestin from the cytosol to the cell-surface-expressed receptors. β-arrestin-green fluorescent protein translocation was ascertained by confocal microscopy in live cells (Fig. 5). Agonist (10 μm isoproterenol) exposure resulted in a time-dependent recruitment of β-arrestin in cells expressing either receptor. As shown, in wild-type (NNN)-expressing cells, the predominantly intracellular distribution of β-arrestin becomes mostly cell surface by 5 min of exposure to isoproterenol. The translocation of NNQ was qualitatively indistinguishable from the wild-type β2AR. Consistent with these observations, agonist-promoted receptor internalization as determined by quantitative hydrophilic radioligand binding with intact cells revealed identical kinetics both in terms of the maximal response (45 ± 4.4 versus 49 ± 6.2% internalized) and the rate constant (k = 0.16 ± 0.029/min versus 0.12 ± 0.022/min, n = 4) for the NNN and NNQ receptors, respectively (Fig. 6). Taken together, these data indicate that the initial events in agonist-promoted down-regulation, which leads to the redistribution of cell surface β2AR to the cell interior, are not perturbed by the absence of glycosylation at Asn-187 of the receptor.Fig. 5Agonist-promoted β-arrestin 2 recruitment is maintained with the NNQ β2AR. Confocal images revealing agonist-promoted recruitment of β-arrestin 2-green fluorescent protein to the cell surface during the exposure of NNN and NNQ cells to 10 μm isoproterenol for the indicated times are shown. Results are representative images from 5 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Agonist-promoted internalization of the position 187 glycosylation-deficient β2AR is unimpaired. Cells were exposed to 10 μm isoproterenol for the indicated times and then washed, and whole-cell radioligand binding with the hydrophilic radioligand 3H-CGP12177 was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are from 4 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We considered then that the agonist-promoted up-regulation observed with the glycosylation site 187-deficient β2AR could be the result of an altered (enhanced) synthesis of new receptors during agonist exposure, or internalized receptors that are not targeted in a wild-type manner to the degradation pathway. New receptor synthesis in the presence of agonist was quantitated by radioligand binding after the exposure of the cells to an irreversible receptor-alkylating agent (Pindobind, Sigma). Cells were treated with 10 nm Pindobind for 2 h (which alkylated ∼70% of the receptors), washed, and placed back in the incubator. At various time points up to 12 h, cells were harvested, and 125I-CYP saturation binding was undertaken. Newly synthesized receptors appear as an increase in 125I-CYP binding over time. (Of note, pretreatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide resulted in no increase in 125I-CYP binding, consistent with the technique identifying newly synthesized receptors.) The rate of new receptor synthesis in the presence of 10 μm isoproterenol, which is the condition relevant to the agonist-promoted up-regulation of NNQ, was not significantly different, and, if anything, the trend was toward being less for NNQ compared with NNN (k = 0.07 ± 0.02/min versus 0.12 ± 0.04/min, n = 4). It thus appears that the accumulation of NNQ receptors evoked by the agonist is not based on decreased receptor internalization or increased de novo receptor synthesis, suggesting that the NNQ receptor has altered entry into the degradation pathway(s) after internalization. The fate of internalized receptors was assessed by confocal microscopy of fixed cells, with an emphasis on co-localization of NNN or NNQ with early endosomes (a short term event) and lysosomes (a long term event). Results of studies with the EEA1 antibody, which identifies early endosomes, are shown in Fig. 7. For both NNN and NNQ receptors, a 15-min exposure to isoproterenol resulted in internalization (Fig. 7, d and j) and co-localization with early endosomes (f and l). Similar findings were observed with incubations up to 4 h (data not shown). Taken together with the other short term agonist data shown in Figs. 5 and 6, it appears that NNQ internalizes and is localized to the early endosomes in a wild-type manner. However, as shown in Fig. 8, NNQ fails to co-localize with lysosomes during prolonged agonist incubation. For the NNN wild-type β2AR, one can clearly observe a loss of cell surface and total receptor expression (a versus d) and intracellular accumulation of receptor after 4 h of agonist exposure (d). The intracellular wild-type receptors co-localized with the lysosomal marker cathepsin-D (Fig. 8f). In contrast, overall expression of the NNQ receptor was maintained under the same agonist exposure conditions (Fig. 8, g versus j), and although internalized receptors were observed, they failed to co-localize with the lysosomal marker (l). Four hours of agonist exposure represents an optimal time point for co-localization of wild-type receptor with lysosomes, as longer exposures result in degradation and a decreased signal. Nevertheless, even with more prolonged agonist exposure (up to 18 h), we never observed the co-localization of NNQ with lysosomes (data not shown). To further support the confocal findings, cells expressing NNN or NNQ were treated with vehicle or isoproterenol for 4 h, whole-cell homogenates were prepared, and the proteins were fractionated on a Percoll gradient. Consistent with the findings of others (25van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), one of the six fractions (fraction 5) was enriched in lysosomes as determined by Western blots using the cathepsin-D antibody. 125I-CYP radioligand binding was performed on the proteins from this lysosomal fraction to ascertain whether agonist exposure increased receptors in this pool for NNN-expressing cells and had no effect on the pool of NNQ receptors. Although this fraction undoubtedly contains other compartments/proteins in addition to the specific lysosomes identified by confocal microscopy, we indeed observed increased agonist-promoted receptors in the fraction from NNN cells (from 123 ± 24 to 218 ± 42 fmol/mg, p = 0.03, n = 8), but not NNQ cells (from 65 ± 12 to 65 ± 17 fmol/mg). Although the magnitude of the agonist effect with the wild-type is modest in this assay, the lack of any change with the NNQ mutant is consistent with the confocal results.Fig. 8The NNQ-β2AR fails to enter the lysosomal degradation pathway. For wild-type (NNN) β2AR, agonist exposure resulted in a net loss of β2AR and a redistribution of the receptor to the cell interior (a versus d). Most internalized receptors co-localized with lysosomes as indicated by the merged image with cathepsin-D (f). In contrast, there is no apparent net loss of the NNQ receptor because of agonist exposure (g versus j), and the intracellular NNQ receptor does not co-localize with the lysosomal marker (l). Shown are representative images from 4 to 5 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The phenotype of the NNQ receptor, then, appears to be one in which the agonist-promoted down-regulation process is per-turbed at the recycling step because of a lack of glycosylation at this third extracellular site. The net effect is a lack of down-regulation and, in fact, a net increase in cellular receptors due to the continued synthesis of new receptors in an environment of decreased degradation. Thus a previously unrecognized site necessary for agonist-promoted down-regulation has been identified. However, it is noted that the β2ARs of other species that lack Asn-187 (e.g. hamster, guinea pig, rat β2AR) (20Auman J.T. Seidler F.J. Tate C.A. Slotkin T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R1895-R1901Google Scholar, 21Elfellah M.S. Reid J.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 182: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Tuisl E. Schutz W.

Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 775-779PubMed Google Scholar) nevertheless have been reported to undergo agonist-promoted down-regulation in vivo, although the phenomenon has been minimally explored in recombinant cells expressing non-human β2ARs (23Molenaar P. Smolich J.J. Russell F.D. McMartin L.R. Summers R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 393-400PubMed Google Scholar). This may suggest that other sites/mechanisms are in place in these receptors that abrogate the necessity of Asn-187. As noted earlier, this site is absent in a wide variety of diverse species despite the high degree of surrounding sequence homology (Fig. 1). However, of the 11 β2AR genomic sequences reported from primates, 5 have the Asn glycosylation site at the second intracellular loop residue, as is observed in the human receptor (Table II). These five Asn-187-containing primates are higher order primates (human, greater and lesser apes), whereas those without this glycosylation site are all lower order primates (monkey, lemur, tamarin, and galago). This suggests that perhaps Asn-187 provides a specific role for receptor regulation in the larger higher order primates. This mechanism may have evolved because of (i) pressure for this specific type of glycosylation-dependent trafficking or (ii) as a compensatory consequence to retain receptor down-regulation after the evolutionary loss of an alternate down-regulatory motif. β2AR sequence comparisons of primate species that carry Asn-187 with those that do not and comparisons with non-primates are hampered by the lack of full-length sequences in primates. Thus scenario (ii) above cannot be adequately explored at this time. Nevertheless, the current study has identified a previously unrecognized site that is essential for long term agonist-promoted down-regulation and has apparently appeared late in primate evolution.Table IISequence comparisons of the second extracellular loops of primate β2ARs Open table in a new tab"

In addition to its essential role in γ-secretase activity, we and others have reported that PS1 plays a role in intracellular trafficking of select membrane proteins including nicastrin. Here we examined the fate of PEN-2 in the absence of PS expression or γ-secretase activity. We found that PEN-2 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and has a much shorter half-life in PS-deficient cells than in wild type cells, suggesting that PSs are required for maintaining the stability and proper subcellular trafficking of PEN-2. However, the function of PS in PEN-2 trafficking is distinct from its contribution to γ-secretase activity because inhibition of γ-secretase activity by γ-secretase inhibitors did not affect the PEN-2 level or its egress from the endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, membrane-permeable γ-secretase inhibitors, but not a membrane-impermeable derivative, markedly increased the cell surface levels of PS1 and PEN-2 without affecting that of nicastrin. In support of its role in PEN-2 trafficking, PS1 was also required for the γ-secretase inhibitor-induced plasma membrane accumulation of PEN-2. We further showed that γ-secretase inhibitors specifically accelerated the Golgi to the cell surface transport of PS1 and PEN-2. Taken together, we demonstrate an essential role for PSs in intracellular trafficking of the γ-secretase components, and that selective γ-secretase inhibitors differentially affect the trafficking of the γ-secretase components, which may contribute to an inactivation of γ-secretase.

https://openalex.org/W2094633404,"The scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells (SREC) was isolated from a human endothelial cell line and consists of two isoforms named SREC-I and -II. Both isoforms have no significant homology to other types of scavenger receptors. They contain 10 repeats of epidermal growth factor-like cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domains and have unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domains with Ser/Pro-rich regions. The extracellular domain of SREC-I binds modified low density lipoprotein and mediates a homophilic SREC-I/SREC-I or heterophilic SREC-I/SREC-II trans-interaction. However, the significance of large Ser/Pro-rich cytoplasmic domains of SRECs is not clear. Here, we found that when SREC-I was overexpressed in murine fibroblastic L cells, neurite-like outgrowth was induced, indicating that the receptor can lead to changes in cell morphology. The SREC-I-mediated morphological change required the cytoplasmic domain of the protein, and we identified advillin, a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin regulatory proteins, as a protein binding to this domain. Reduction of advillin expression in L cells by RNAi led to the absence of the described SREC-I-induced morphological changes, indicating that advillin is a prerequisite for the change. Finally, we demonstrated that SREC-I and advillin were co-expressed and interacted with each other in dorsal root ganglion neurons during embryonic development and that overexpression of both SREC-I and advillin in cultured Neuro-2a cells induced long process formation. These results suggest that the interaction of SREC-I and advillin are involved in the development of dorsal root ganglion neurons by inducing the described morphological changes.

Mammalian cells have several different classes of scavenger receptors, and their relative contributions to lipid metabolism in pathophysiological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, are the subject of intense investigation (2Greaves D.R. Gough P.J. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells express several distinct scavenger receptors, such as SR-BI (3Acton S.L.

We cloned a novel scavenger receptor from a DNA library prepared from human umbilical vein endothelial cells employing expression cloning and termed it SREC (scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells)-I (8Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we also succeeded in cloning a homologous protein, SREC-II, by a data base search (9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These two receptors are now classified as type F scavenger receptors (2Greaves D.R. Gough P.J. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both SREC-I and -II have no significant homology to other types of scavenger receptors. They contain 10 repeats of epidermal growth factor-like cysteine-rich motifs in their extracellular domains and unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domains with Ser/Pro-rich regions (8Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). SREC-I mediates the binding and degradation of AcLDL and OxLDL in endothelial cells, whereas SREC-II has little scavenger receptor activity, making it likely that these type F scavenger receptors have biological functions not linked to scavenger receptor activity. We showed previously (9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that SREC-I and -II display respective homophilic interaction through their extracellular domains between separate cells (trans-interaction) and strong SREC-I/SREC-II heterophilic trans-interaction. The homophilic and heterophilic trans-interactions of SREC-I and -II were effectively suppressed by the presence of scavenger receptor ligands, such as AcLDL and OxLDL. The cytoplasmic domains of SREC-I and -II consisting of ∼400 amino acids contain several potential phosphorylation sites for kinases A, C, and G, suggesting that these domains transduce intracellular signals generated by the receptors. SREC-I and -II may transduce different signals because of low sequence similarity and different potential phosphorylation sites. However the biological role of the cytoplasmic domain of SRECs is so far totally unknown. In this study, we focused on the function of the SREC-I cytoplasmic domain. We previously employed murine L cells to elucidate the receptor/receptor trans-interaction (9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol.

In the experiments, we had noticed that prolonged culture of SREC-I-transfected L cells induced striking morphological cell changes. Based on these preliminary observations, we show here that SREC-I, but not SREC-II, induces neurite-like long processes after overexpression in murine fibroblastic L cells and that the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-I is a prerequisite for this activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that advillin, a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin regulatory proteins, binds specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-I and is required for this morphological cell change. The biological implications of this activity are discussed. Cell Culture—Murine L cells (CCL-1, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Chinese hamster ovary cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The murine neuroblastoma line Neuro-2a cells (CCL-131, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Plasmid Construction—The EcoRI-XhoI fragment of the mouse cDNA for SREC-I, SREC-I cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant that lacks amino acid residues 451-820 (SREC-I-ΔC370), SREC-II, SR-A, SR-BI, and advillin were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and expression plasmids were termed pcDNA3-SREC-I, pcDNA3-SREC-I-ΔC370, pcDNA3-SREC-II, pcDNA3-SR-A, pcDNA3-SR-BI, and pcDNA3-advillin, respectively. We noted that a hemagglutinin tag was added at the C terminus of advillin in pcDNA3-Advillin. Uptake of DiI-AcLDL—L cells (1 × 105 cells/well) in 24-well plates were mock transfected or transfected with either pcDNA3-SREC-I, pcDNA3-SREC-I-ΔC370, pcDNA3-SREC-II, pcDNA3-SR-A, or pcDNA3-SR-BI using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 72 h, incubated again in the presence of 2 μg/ml DiI-AcLDL (Biomedical Technologies Inc.) for 2 h, washed, and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The presence of fluorescent DiI in the fixed cells was determined by visual inspection using fluorescence microscopy. GST Fusion Proteins—The EcoRI-SalI fragment encoding the first half (C1, amino acid residues 451-643), the central part (C2, amino acid residues 561-752), or the last half (C3, amino acid residues 643-820) of the cytoplasmic domain of mouse SREC-I was subcloned into a multi-cloning site downstream of the sequence for GST in pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Corporation). This plasmid was transformed into the JM109 strain of Escherichia coli and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to produce GST fusion proteins. The bacteria were suspended in PBS, and vigorous sonication was performed before centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column and then eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.6, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm glutathione). Purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. GST Affinity Chromatography and Peptide Sequence Analysis—L cells (6 × 107 cells) were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was used as the cytosolic extract. Recombinant GST-C1 or -C2 fusion proteins, bound to the glutathione-Sepharose column, were used to affinity-purify C1- or C2-binding protein(s). L cell cytosolic extracts were loaded onto the GST-C1 or -C2 glutathione-Sepharose columns and then eluted with the elution buffer. The eluted fractions of affinity chromatography were collected, precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. A Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained band of 90 kDa was cut out and digested with Acromobacter protease I (API; a gift from Dr. Masaki, Ibaraki University) (14Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on tandemly connected DEAE-5PW (1 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and Capcel Pak C18 UG120 (1 × 50 mm; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) columns with a 0-80% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Isolated peptides were analyzed by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer model 477A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) connected on line to a PTH Analyzer model 120A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using an in-house-generated gas phase program and were also examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry with a Reflex MALDI-TOF (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear mode, with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole used as a matrix. Antibodies—The polyclonal antibodies against SREC-I and advillin were prepared as follows. Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal domain of mouse SREC-I (NH2-KEQEEPLYENVVPMSVPPQH-COOH) and mouse advillin (NH2-DGEPKYYPVEVLLKGQNQEL-COOH) were synthesized. The synthesized peptides were conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin using an Imject sulfhydryl-reactive antibody production Kit (Pierce). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin peptides were gel-purified and emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Female Wistar rats were immunized with the emulsions. These rat sera were collected and purified using an affinity column (Sulfolink Coupling Gel, Pierce) to which the corresponding antigen peptide was coupled. Small Interference RNA—The mammalian expression vector pSUPER was used for expression of siRNA in the L cells. Three parts of the gene-specific targeting sequence (19-nucleotide sequences: 1, 5′-AGAAGCCATGCCACTGGTA-3′; 2, 5′-CCGCAGCAGAAAGACGTCG-3′; and 3, 5′-CACAAGGATCAAGGATGAC-3′) from the target transcript separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer (TTCAAGAGA) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence were inserted in pSUPER. These vectors were referred to as pSUPER-advillin/RNAi-1, -2, and -3, respectively. L cells were transfected with either pSUPER-advillin/RNAi, control vector (pSUPER), pcDNA3-SREC-I plus pSUPER, pcDNA3-SREC-I plus pSUPER-advillin/RNAi, or pcDNA3-GFP plus pSUPER-advillin/RNAi as described above, and the cells were cultured for 72 h. Total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 18,600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-advillin or anti-SREC-I antibodies. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—L cells were transfected with pcDNA3-SREC-I and pSUPER-advillin/RNAi vector or control vector (pSUPER), incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with the anti-SREC-I antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed 4 times with PBS, incubated again with an Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat IgG(H+L) antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed thoroughly with PBS, embedded, and then visualized using a fluorescent microscope. Neuro-2a cells were transfected with pcDNA3-SREC-I and pcDNA3-advillin, and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with the anti-SREC-I antibody and anti-hemagglutinin antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After that, the cells were washed four times with PBS, incubated again with an Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat IgG(H+L) antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed thoroughly with PBS, embedded, and then visualized using a fluorescent microscope. Western Blot Analysis—C57/BL6 mice (adults or 18-day embryos) were perfused with ice-cold SET buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Thereafter, the brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were rapidly excised, as described previously (15Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21264-21270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The brain and spinal cord were homogenized in 4 volumes (w/v) of SET buffer and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were used as the brain and spinal cord total protein lysates. The DRG was homogenized in SET buffer and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was concentrated by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The resultant pellets were suspended in SET buffer and used as the DRG total protein lysate. The protein concentrations of samples were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Each total protein lysate (100 μg/lane) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk (Wako, Osaka, Japan) in TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20) and incubated with anti-advillin or anti-SREC-I antibodies in TTBS. The levels of protein were analyzed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation—DRG extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The DRG extracts were precleared for 2 h with protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated overnight with anti-SREC-I antibody at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose beads for 45 min, washed three times with lysis buffer, and boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. SREC-I-induced Morphological Change of L Cells—First, L cells were transfected with vectors for various scavenger receptors, and morphological changes were monitored. As shown in Fig. 1, transfection of the expression vector for SREC-I into the cells caused significant morphological changes with generation of neurite-like long processes. On the other hand, no change in cell morphology was observed when other scavenger receptors, such as SR-A, SR-BI, or even SREC-II were overexpressed in these cells. These results suggested that SREC-I is the specific scavenger receptor that can induce neurite-like outgrowth when overexpressed in L cells. When SREC-I was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, no morphological cell change was observed (data not shown). SREC-I contains a large cytoplasmic domain consisting of ∼400 amino acids. To elucidate the role of this cytoplasmic domain, deletion mutants lacking C-terminal fragments of 370 amino acids were created, and their effects on cell shape were examined. We have shown previously (9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that this truncated receptor was expressed in l-cells to a degree similar to the full-length receptor and showed a comparable level of AcLDL uptake activity. In contrast to these findings, the mutant protein did not induce a change in cell morphology (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the cytoplasmic domain is required for the induction of neurite-like outgrowth, and we hypothesized that proteins interacting with this domain are required to mediate the effects of this receptor. Identification of Binding Proteins to the Cytoplasmic Domain of SREC-I—To identify the proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-I, we prepared several expression vectors for GST-fused C-terminal fragments of the SREC-I protein (Fig. 3A, C1-C3). Among others, we could successfully express GST-C1 and -C2 fragments in E. coli and analyze their binding activities. The cytoplasmic fraction prepared from L cells was loaded onto either a GST-C1 or -C2 affinity column, and the proteins bound to the respective column were co-eluted with GST-fused peptide by the addition of glutathione. As shown in Fig. 3B, we could not detect any proteins specifically binding to the C1 fragment. On the other hand, a protein with a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa was specifically detected in the glutathione eluate from a GST-C2 column onto which the cytoplasmic fraction of L cells was loaded, although the column loaded with control solution yielded no such protein. These results indicated that the identified 90-kDa protein could bind to the amino acid sequence between residues 643 and 752 of the SREC-I cytoplasmic domain. The 90-kDa protein was then subjected to amino acid sequencing. Seven peptides derived from the protein were determined, and all were the partial sequences of advillin, an actin regulatory protein belonging to the gelsolin/villin family (16Marks P.W. Arai M. Bandura J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Advillin Is Required for SREC-I-mediated Morphological Cell Change—To examine whether advillin is involved in SREC-I-mediated morphological cell change, the RNAi technique was applied (17Mise-Omata S. Montagne B. Deckert M. Wienands J. Acuto O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar, 19Scherr M. Morgan M.A. Eder M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Doi N. Zenno S. Ueda R. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 8: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar). L cells were treated with several constructs (RNAi-1 to -3; see “Experimental Procedures”) of advillin siRNA. First, we confirmed by Western blotting that murine fibroblastic L cells intrinsically expressed advillin (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 of (a) and (b), Advillin). Moreover, we found that the RNAi-1 vector was most efficient in decreasing the expression of advillin (Fig. 4A). Thereafter, L cells were co-transfected with SREC-I and advillin siRNA (RNAi-1) vectors, and morphological cell change was monitored. The expression vector for SREC-I was transfected into the cells, and the expressed protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Two bands with Mr of 141,000 and 147,000 were observed. These two bands were not detected when the green fluorescent protein expression vector was transfected, indicating the heterogeneity of the expressed SREC-I, most probably because of the varying glycosylation of the protein. Co-transfection of RNAi-1 caused a significant decrease in the expression of endogenous advillin without affecting the expression pattern of SREC-I (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, transfection of the SREC-I vector alone induced neurite-like outgrowth, whereas this phenomenon was impaired significantly by the co-transfection of the RNAi-1 vector. When counting the cells showing long processes, it was apparent that co-transfection of the RNAi-1 vector together with that of SREC-I caused a dramatic decrease in cell number. These results indicate that advillin is required for the SREC-I-mediated induction of neurite-like outgrowth in L cells. It should be noted that unlike in the L cells, advillin was undetectable in Chinese hamster ovary cells in which SREC-I had no apparent ability to induce the described morphological cell change (data not shown). SREC-I Is Expressed in Peripheral Nerve Neurons—Because it was reported that advillin is expressed in the peripheral nervous system in areas such as the DRG and the superior cervical ganglion and plays a role in the neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells (21Ravenall S.J. Gavazzi I. Wood J.N. Akopian A.N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we examined whether SREC-I is also expressed in peripheral nerve neurons. We focused on the embryonic expression of the protein, because it was reported that advillin is expressed in peripheral nerve neurons, especially during embryonic development (16Marks P.W. Arai M. Bandura J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SREC-I protein was barely detectable in the brain, spinal cord, or DRG of the adult mouse but was clearly detectable in each of these tissues in 18-day embryonic mice (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that SREC-I is expressed transiently in the nervous system during fetal development. On the other hand, both in adult and embryonic mice, advillin was detectable in DRG but not in brain or spinal cord. To determine whether SREC-I interacts with advillin in the DRG of 18-day embryonic mice, we performed immunoprecipitation studies with the anti-SREC-I antibody. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the immunoprecipitates contained advillin in addition to SREC-I (Fig. 5B). No anti-SREC-I or anti-advillin signals were detected in the immunoprecipitates treated with normal rabbit serum (data not shown). These results demonstrated that SREC-I interacts with advillin in the DRG of 18-day embryonic mice. Next, we examined whether the interaction of SREC-I and advillin induces neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells. Because most of the neuronal cell lines intrinsically expressed neither SREC-I nor advillin, we used a murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a, to perform transfection experiments. The cells were transfected with the SREC-I and/or advillin vectors, and morphological cell change was monitored. As shown in Fig. 6, the cells co-expressing SREC-I and advillin showed neurite outgrowth, whereas the cells expressing either SREC-I or advillin did not show this phenomenon, indicating that the interaction of SREC-I and advillin induces neurite formation in cultured neuronal cells. The present results demonstrate that SREC-I is capable of interacting with advillin (16Marks P.W. Arai M. Bandura J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through its large Ser/Pro-rich cytoplasmic domain and thereby is capable of inducing neurite-like outgrowth. Members of this actin regulatory protein family are capable of capping and severing actin filaments (16Marks P.W. Arai M. Bandura J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these proteins, advillin is most closely related to villin in its domain structure, including the C-terminal F-actin-binding headpiece domain (16Marks P.W. Arai M. Bandura J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Villin is expressed mainly in differentiated epithelial tissues possessing a brush border, such as intestinal villi or proximal renal tubules (22Ezell R. Chafel M.M. Matsudaira P. Development (Camb.). 1989; 106: 407-419PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gröne H. Weber K. Helmchen U. Osborn M. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 124: 298-302Google Scholar), and most likely plays an important role in the morphogenesis of microvilli (24Franck Z. Footer M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Advillin, however, is highly expressed in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia during embryonic development and only at low levels in adult uterine and intestinal epithelial cells (16Marks P.W. Arai M. Bandura J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of the advillin expression vector to primary cultures of rat DRG sensory neurons resulted in increased neurite outgrowth (21Ravenall S.J. Gavazzi I. Wood J.N. Akopian A.N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein plays a significant role in the morphogenesis of peripheral neurons through an actin-bundling domain. It is therefore reasonable that the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-I binds to advillin and regulates the intracellular cytoskeletal organization, resulting in the generation of neurite-like long processes. Unexpectedly, murine fibroblastic L cells were found to intrinsically express advillin (Fig. 4A). The parent L strain was derived from normal subcutaneous areolar and adipose tissue of male C3H/An mice according to the CCL-1 catalogue. Intrinsic expression of advillin made it possible to elucidate the function of SREC-I in advillin-mediated morphological changes in L cells. Depletion of endogenous advillin protein in L cells by RNAi inhibited the generation of long processes, indicating that advillin is indispensable for this change. Chinese hamster ovary cells, in which advillin was undetectable, displayed no morphological changes upon SREC-I overexpression. This provides further evidence for the necessity of advillin. Our results are the first to show that SREC-I is expressed not only in endothelial cells but also in neuronal cells. Furthermore, SREC-I and advillin are co-expressed and interact with each other in DRG neurons, especially during embryonic development. We also demonstrated that overexpression of both SREC-I and advillin in cultured Neuro-2a cells induces the formation of long processes. These results suggest that the interaction of SREC-I and advillin are involved in the development of DRG neurons by inducing the described morphological changes. SREC-I is characterized by its extremely large cytoplasmic domain. The present data indicate that this domain is a prerequisite for the receptor-mediated morphological change of L cells, which shows that the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-I plays a role in transducing intracellular signals of SREC-I. We showed that advillin binds to the C2 peptide (amino acid residues 562-752) but not to the C1 peptide (amino acid residues 452-643) of the cytoplasmic domain. This suggests that the region within 643-752 is responsible for advillin binding. This region is also rich in Ser and Pro, but it is not similar to the known domains that transduce signals into the cell interior. Interestingly, although ∼20% homology was observed in the entire cytoplasmic domains of SREC-I and -II, this region is less homologous (<10%), which can explain why SREC-II exerted no morphogenetic activity on L cells. It remains unclear how the SREC-I signal is transduced into the cell interior. We have demonstrated previously that SREC-I shows a homophilic trans-interaction between separate cells through its extracellular domain (9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This homophilic trans-interaction of SREC-I may serve as a signal for the induction of neurite-like long processes. However, this may not be the case, because the L cells that display long processes did not necessarily show contact with neighboring SREC-I-expressing L cells (Figs. 1, 2, and 4B). Moreover, although homophilic trans-interaction of SREC-I is effectively disrupted by the addition of AcLDL or OxLDL (9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), these ligands had little effect on the formation of long processes (data not shown), which supports the idea that trans-interaction of SREC-I between cells is not obligatory for the transduction of the signal into the cells. In our preliminary study, we observed that SREC-I forms an oligomer in the membrane (homophilic cis-interaction), possibly a dimer when overexpressed in L cells. The extracellular domain may be indispensable for the oligomerization, because upon co-transfection of native full-length SREC-I and the ΔC370 deletion mutant, which lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain into L cells, both receptors could be co-immunoprecipitated. Interestingly, in most of these cells, long process formation was greatly diminished, indicating that the ΔC370 deletion mutant may function as a dominant negative effector for SREC-I activity. These observations suggest that close association of the SREC-I cytoplasmic domain themselves may send a signal to L cells that induces the formation of long processes. In in vivo situations, some ligands might stimulate SREC-I oligomerization producing a signal in the cells like other growth hormone receptors. SREC-II, which shows a strong heterophilic trans-interaction with SREC-I, is a possible natural ligand for SREC-I. However, in our preliminary experiments, the expression levels of SREC-II in the mouse brain and DRG were very low compared with SREC-I, suggesting that other factor(s) serve as ligands for SREC-I extracellular domains. Further studies are needed to identify the natural ligand in these tissues and to elucidate the mechanism of advillin activation through the SREC-I cytoplasmic domain. SREC-I was originally identified from a human endothelial cell line (9Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells play important roles in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and the repair of injuries along the endothelium (27Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Under these situations, endothelial cells actively migrate along the substratum in a coordinated and polarized fashion. This process involves extension of filopodia and lamellipodia, both of which have specific actin-based architectures. SREC-I might be involved in the formation and disruption of actin bundles through the gelsolin/villin family in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018596625,"The C terminus (ct) of protein kinase C-alpha (PKCalpha) has a type I PDZ binding motif, whereas GluR2 has a type II PDZ binding motif. Both motifs are recognized by the PDZ domain of protein interacting with protein kinase C (PICK1), and PICK1-PKCalpha-controlled phosphorylation regulates the synaptic expression and function of GluR2. Here, we show that a specific mutation within the carboxylate-binding loop of the PDZ domain of PICK1 (K27E; PICK1-KE) results in a loss of interaction with GluR2 but not with PKCalpha. In GST pull-down studies, PICK1-WT (wild type) but not PICK1-KE was retained by GST-ct-GluR2. Furthermore, PICK1-WT co-immunoprecipitated both PKCalpha and GluR2, whereas PICK1-KE only co-immunoprecipitated PKCalpha. In heterologous cells, PICK1-WT, but not PICK1-KE, clustered GluR2 and also clustered GluR1 in a GluR2-dependent manner. However, neither PICK1-WT nor PICK1-KE altered the distribution of PKCalpha, even after phorbol ester-induced redistribution of PKCalpha to the membrane. Finally, PICK1-KE showed no mislocalization when compared with PICK1-WT in neurons. Taken together, it appears that the PDZ domain of PICK1 is less sensitive to mutations for PKCalpha when compared with GluR2 binding. These results suggest that the PDZ domain of PICK1 has distinct PKCalpha and GluR2 binding subsite(s)."

Previous studies in Aspergillus nidulans indicate that a Pho85-like kinase, PHOA, does not regulate the classic PHO system but regulates development in a phosphate-dependent manner. A Pho80-like cyclin has now been isolated through its interaction with PHOA. Surprisingly, unlike PHOA, An-PHO80 does play a negative role in the PHO system. Similarly, an ortholog of Pho4 previously identified genetically as palcA also regulates the PHO system. However, An-PHO81, a putative cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, does not regulate the PHO system. Therefore, there are significant differences between the classic PHO system conserved between S. cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa compared with that which has evolved in A. nidulans. Most interestingly, under low phosphate conditions, the An-PHO80 cyclin also promotes sexual development while having a negative effect on asexual development. These effects are independent of the role An-PHO80 has in the classic PHO system. However, in high phosphate medium, An-PHO80 affects development because of deregulation of the PHO system as loss of palcAPho4 function negates the developmental defects caused by lack of An-pho80. Therefore, under low phosphate conditions the An-PHO80 cyclin regulates development independently of the PHO system, whereas in high phosphate it affects development through the PHO system. The data indicate that a single cyclin can control various aspects of growth and development in a multicellular organism.

The Pho85 cyclin family includes 10 members that have been divided into two subfamilies according to their sequence homology and functional relationship: Pcl1,2 subfamily (Pcl1, Pcl2, Pcl5, Pcl9, and Clg1) and Pho80 subfamily (Pho80, Pcl6, Pcl7, Pcl8, and Pcl10) (13Measday V.

Pho80 was the first identified Pho85 cyclin. Pho80 deletion leads to constitutive expression of acid phosphatase, similar to Pho85 mutants (24Madden S.L. Creasy C.L. Srinivas V. Fawcett W.

Genet. 1992; 231: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Pho80-Pho85 kinase phosphorylates and negatively regulates the basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor. Pho4 promotes the expression of PHO5 as well as PHM/VTC genes. PHO genes are involved in phosphate (Pi) acquisition, whereas PHM/VTC encode vacuolar proteins involved in polyphosphate accumulation (26Cohen A. Perzov N. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26885-26893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Further regulation of the kinase activity of Pho80-Pho85 for Pho4 occurs through Pho81, a Pi-sensitive CDK inhibitor (28Hirst K. Fisher F. McAndrew P.C. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The rest of the Pho80 subfamily members, Pcl6, Pcl7, Pcl8, and Pcl10, are involved in the regulation of glycogen storage and carbon source utilization (29Huang D. Moffat J. Wilson W.A. Moore L.

In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, three CDKs have been identified: NIMXcdc2, PHOA, and PHOB. NIMXcdc2, the homolog of S. cerevisiae Cdc28, functions in cell cycle progression when bound by its cyclin partner NIMEcyclinB (32Osmani A.H. van Peij N. Mischke M. O'Connell M.J. Osmani S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1519-1528PubMed Google Scholar). PHOA was identified as a nonessential homolog of Pho85, which controls the developmental program of A. nidulans in an environment-dependent manner (6Bussink H.J. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Pi concentration, pH, and inoculation density influence development through PHOA. The absence of PHOA results in a switch from asexual to sexual development (at pH 8.0) or the absence of development (at pH 6.0) under the condition of low Pi and high inoculum level (6Bussink H.J. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A. nidulans contains a second Pho85 homolog, PHOB, which is 77% identical to PHOA (33Dou X. Wu D. An W. Davies J. Hashmi S.B. Ukil L. Osmani S.A. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1105-1115PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of phoB causes no phenotype, even in phosphorous-limited growth conditions. However, inactivation of phoA in a ΔphoB background is lethal and leads to defects in nuclear division and polarity, indicating that the Pho85-like kinase pair PHOA and PHOB have an essential function and may be involve in cell cycle control and morphogenesis (33Dou X. Wu D. An W. Davies J. Hashmi S.B. Ukil L. Osmani S.A. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1105-1115PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of cyclin partners and inhibitors that regulate the PHOA CDK family member in A. nidulans should enhance our understanding of the cyclin-dependent class of kinase and their role in differentiation within multicellular eukaryotes. Here we have used the two-hybrid system to isolate a PHOA-interacting protein with homology to the S. cerevisiae Pho80 cyclin and named it An-PHO80 (A. nidulans PHO80). Although the An-pho80 gene is nonessential, it regulates Pi acquisition genes through a mechanism not involving the PHOA or PHOB CDKs. The data further indicate that in addition to regulating the PHO system, An-PHO80 plays a role in the developmental program of A. nidulans. Thus in A. nidulans the PHO system cyclin plays two independent roles during growth and development. A. nidulans Strains and Medium—The A. nidulans strains used in this study are listed in Table I, and all contain the veA1 marker.

This plasmid and the bait plasmid pH1 were used to express PHOA and An-PHO80 protein in vitro using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). Coimmunoprecipitation between the in vitro expressed An-PHO80 and PHOA proteins was performed as described in the manual of Matchmaker Co-IP Kit (Clontech). Immunoprecipitated protein using anti-c-Myc antibody (pull-down PHOA) was separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with anti-HA antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) (detecting An-PHO80) diluted 1:4,000 in blocking solution. Blots were washed in TBST and incubated for 1 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) in TBST with 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were washed and detected using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Prestained rainbow molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences) were used.

Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—The full-length cDNA sequence of An-pho80 was obtained by the RACE method as described previously (6Bussink H.J. Osmani S.A.

RACE PCR products were gel purified and cloned in pCR4-TOPO vector using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) prior to sequencing.Table IIOligonuleotides used in this studyNameGeneSequencesGSP36An-pho80CAACAGAGCGATCAGCGGCAGAGTCATW36UP5An-pho80AAGAATGTCCGCCAAGCGAGTATCW36UP3An-pho80CACGACTGAACGAGGTTCTTCGAGW36DN5An-pho80ACAGCTATTCAGAAGAGTCGGCACW36DN3An-pho80AAGTCTTCGTAATCGCCACTGGTCPG36-5aSequences complementary to W36UP3 and W36DN5, and W81UP3 and W81DN5 are underlined.pyrGCTCGAAGAACCTCGTTCAGTCGTGATTCGCCTCAAACAATGCTCTTCPG36-3aSequences complementary to W36UP3 and W36DN5, and W81UP3 and W81DN5 are underlined.pyrGGTGCCGACTCTTCTGAATAGCTGTCACTGATGCGTGATGCCAAGCTGW36-5An-pho80CGCAATAGTACCGGTCTTGGW36-3An-pho80GCGATTGTTGCGACTGCTAADKp36An-pho80ACGGTACCATGTTAGTTTCTTCGCCTTCGCCDBg36An-pho80GATAGATCTTAGGCCGGACTGGATTTCGTACCW81UP5An-pho81CCTCGCTATCTTGGTCTTGTCTTCW81UP3An-pho81GACGTCAGCACCTGCGGTATACACW81DN5An-pho81CTGTTATCGGAGGCTTGCTGCATCW81DN3An-pho81CATAGTAGCCATGTACGTCCACTGW81PA-5aSequences complementary to W36UP3 and W36DN5, and W81UP3 and W81DN5 are underlined.pyroAGTGTATACCGCAGGTGCTGACGTCACTAGTGGATCCAGGAGTATACGW81PA-3aSequences complementary to W36UP3 and W36DN5, and W81UP3 and W81DN5 are underlined.pyroAGATGCAGCAAGCCTCCGATAACAGTTGAGCCTGAGACCAATGAATACW81-5An-pho81GTTATCAACAGGCCAGAGTCW81-3An-pho81AATCTAGTCCTCCACTCTCGa Sequences complementary to W36UP3 and W36DN5, and W81UP3 and W81DN5 are underlined. Open table in a new tab Deletion of the An-pho80 and An-pho81 Genes—An-pho80 was deleted by replacing its coding region with the nutritional marker pyrG gene (37Oakley B.R. Rinehart J.E. Mitchell B.L. Oakley C.E. Carmona C. Gray G.L. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using a two-step fusion PCR method (38Kuwayama H. Obara S. Morio T. Katoh M. Urushihara H. Tanaka Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The first step involves PCR synthesis of three separate fragments: An-pho80 upstream and downstream sequences along with the pyrG gene cassette. An-pho80 upstream (1721 bp) and downstream (1983 bp) sequences were amplified with primers W36UP5, W36UP3 (for upstream fragment), and W36DN5, W36DN3 (for downstream fragment) using genomic DNA as template. The nutritional marker pyrG gene was amplified with primers PG36-5 and PG36-3, containing the 24-bp 5′-extensions complementary to the primer W36UP3 and W36DN5, respectively (Table II), using plasmid pCDA21 (containing the pyrG gene) as template. The three synthesized fragments were used in a fusion PCR to amplify the whole deletion cassette with primers W36UP5 and W36DN3. The fusion PCR product was transformed into A. nidulans GR5 strain selecting for growth without uridine and uracil. Successful replacement of An-pho80 by the pyrG cassette was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers W36-5 and W36-3 (Table II) anchored out of the An-pho80 gene deletion area. Putative null mutants were verified by Southern blot analysis. Southern blots were probed by an An-pho80-specific DNA fragment or an An-pho80 flanking sequence using ECL random primer labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Deletion of An-pho81 was performed using the same method but a different nutritional marker gene, pyroA (39Osmani A.H. May G.S. Osmani S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23565-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Colony staining for acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphodiesterase was performed as described previously (40Caddick M.X. Arst Jr., H.N. Genet. Res. 1986; 47: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Activity assays of acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase followed the method of Caddick and Arst (40Caddick M.X. Arst Jr., H.N. Genet. Res. 1986; 47: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using 1 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate. Phosphodiesterase activity was assayed as described previously (41Caddick M.X. Brownlee A.G. Arst Jr., H.N. Genet. Res. 1986; 47: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using 1 mmp-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonic acid (pNPP-P) as substrate. Construction of the An-pho80-overexpressing Plasmid—The full-length coding region of An-pho80 was amplified from A. nidulans cDNA by PCR using primers DKp36 and DBg36. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BglII and then ligated with plasmid pAL6 digested with KpnI and BamHI. The constructed plasmid was named pAL36 with An-pho80 C-terminally tagged with two tandem repeats of the HA epitope under control of the inducible alcA promoter. Isolation of An-pho80 Using the Yeast Two-hybrid System—Upon screening of an A. nidulans cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system and the PHOA CDK (6Bussink H.J. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as bait, three PHOA-interacting genes were isolated. One encodes a protein similar to NOT2 (CDC36). The other two genes encode a Pcl7-like and a Pho80-like cyclin (Table III). The PHO80-like cyclin named An-pho80 is the focus of this work.Table IIIPhoA interactive proteins identified by yeast two-hybrid screenGeneGenomeProtein sizeNo. of times islolatedSimilar toInteraction with PHOBamino acidsAn-pho80AN5156.23904Pho80+pclFAN5825.22412Pcl7+An-not2AN5898.24947NOT2− Open table in a new tab Based on comparisons between the genetic and physical maps of A. nidulans (www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/aspergillus/maps.html) An-pho80 lies in the telomere-proximal region of the left arm of linkage group V. RACE analysis showed An-pho80 to lack introns, although the gene encoding protein AN5156.2 (An-PHO80) is predicted to have a single intron by automated annotation. There is therefore a discrepancy at the N-terminal 49 amino acids between AN5156.2 and our predicted protein sequence derived from cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number AY590766). An-pho80 encodes 390 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 42.4 kDa, which shares homology with the Pho80 subfamily of Pho85-interacting cyclins of S. cerevisiae (13Measday V. Moore L. Retnakaran R. Lee J. Donoviel M. Neiman A.M. Andrews B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Of the S. cerevisiae Pho85-associated cyclins, the closest homolog of An-PHO80 is Pho80 (Fig. 1A). Alignment of the putative amino acid sequence of An-PHO80 with the sequences of Pho80-like cyclins from other fungi revealed that An-PHO80 shared 36% identity with the PREG cyclin from Neurospora crassa (42Kang S. Metzenberg R.L. Genetics. 1993; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 64 and 39%, respectively, with hypothetical proteins from Aspergillus fumigatus and Magnaporthe grisea (data not shown) and 26% with Pho80 from S. cerevisiae (24Madden S.L. Creasy C.L. Srinivas V. Fawcett W. Bergman L.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2625-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the main region of similarity between these proteins is located at their C termini. Noticeably, all Pho80-like cyclins identified in filamentous fungi have an N-terminal extension not found in S. cerevisiae Pho80. Overall similarity is highest in the cyclin box domain (residue 312-365 of An-PHO80) in which An-PHO80 shares 74, 98, 75, and 59% identical amino acids, respectively, with Pho80-like cyclins from N. crassa (PREG, 358-411), A. fumigatus (318-371), M. grisea (316-369), and S. cerevisiae (Pho80, 119-172) (Fig. 1B). To test the physical interaction between PHOA and An-PHO80 proteins, the An-pho80 cDNA was subcloned into a vector to incorporate an N-terminal HA epitope tag. phoA was also cloned into a vector to incorporate an epitope tag, which in this case was c-Myc. The tagged genes were expressed in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system. Immunoprecipitates using anti-c-Myc antibody to pull down PHOA also coprecipitated An-PHO80 protein (Fig. 1C), indicating direct association with PHOA in vitro. Control immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Myc antibody to pull down in vitro expressed control c-Myc peptide instead of c-Myc-tagged PHOA failed to precipitate An-PHO80 protein (Fig. 1C). To verify the interaction between the two proteins in vivo, a strain mildly expressing C-terminal HA-tagged An-PHO80 was constructed. Western blotting specifically detected ANPHO80-HA as a doublet both before (Fig. 1D, Loading control) and after immunoprecipitation (HA IP). Both PHOA and PHOB were found to coprecipitate with An-PHO80-HA using antibodies raised against PHOA, which also detects PHOB (6Bussink H.J. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Dou X. Wu D. An W. Davies J. Hashmi S.B. Ukil L. Osmani S.A. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1105-1115PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The interaction between An-PHO80 and PHOB was confirmed using the two-hybrid system (Table III). To determine whether the interaction between An-PHO80 and PHOA and PHOB is specific, the An-PHO80-HA immunoprecipitates were also probed using antibodies that detect another CDK from A. nidulans, α-NIMXcdc2. No interaction was detected between An-PHO80 and NIMXcdc2 (Fig. 1D). The data indicate that the An-PHO80 cyclin specifically interacts with its partner CDKs PHOA and PHOB but not with the related NIMXcdc2 CDK. Deletion of An-pho80 Causes Constitutive Induction of Phosphate-repressible Enzymes in Pi-rich Medium—In budding yeast, deletion of either the PHO85 CDK or its interacting cyclin partner PHO80 leads to constitutive expression of Pi acquisition genes including PHO5 (an acid phosphatase gene) in Pi-sufficient medium (43Bergman L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2298-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Bergman L.W. McClinton D.C. Madden S.L. Preis L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5950-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, phoA, the counterpart of PHO85 in A. nidulans, has no apparent role in regulation of acid phosphatase expression (6Bussink H.J. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether the An-pho80 cyclin has a role in regulation of Pi acquisition, An-pho80 was deleted by replacing its coding sequence with the pyrG nutritional marker (37Oakley B.R. Rinehart J.E. Mitchell B.L. Oakley C.E. Carmona C. Gray G.L. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Four identical An-pho80 null mutant strains were isolated and verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Although deletion of An-pho80 did not cause lethality it generated several interesting phenotypes. It has been shown previously that normal Pi levels (11 mm) are repressing, and low Pi (0.1 mm) is inducing for the expression of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphodiesterase activities in A. nidulans (40Caddick M.X.

Taq polymerase contains a polymerase domain for synthesizing a new DNA strand and a 5′-nuclease domain for cleaving RNA primers or damaged DNA strands. The extended crystal structure of Taq polymerase poses a puzzle on how this enzyme coordinates its polymerase and the nuclease activities to generate only a nick. Using contrast variation solution small angle neutron scattering, we have examined the conformational changes that occur in Taq polymerase upon binding “overlap flap” DNA, a structure-specific DNA substrate that mimics the substrate in strand replacement reactions. In solution, apoTaq polymerase has an overall expanded equilibrium conformation similar to that in the crystal structure. Upon binding to the DNA substrate, both the polymerase and the nuclease domains adopt more compact overall conformations, but these changes are not enough to bring the two active sites close enough to generate a nick. Reconstruction of the three-dimensional molecular envelope from small angle neutron scattering data shows that in the DNA-bound form, the nuclease domain is lifted up relative to its position in the non-DNA-bound form so as to be in closer contact with the thumb and palm subdomains of the polymerase domain. The results suggest that a form of structure sensing is responsible for the coordination of the polymerase and nuclease activities in nick generation.

However, interactions between the polymerase and the nuclease domains can assist in the transfer of the DNA substrate from one active site to the other. In addition to its well known in vitro applications in PCR, in vivo the DNA polymerase I from Thermus aquaticus (Taq polymerase) performs nucleotide replacement reactions in DNA repair and RNA primer removal in Okazaki fragment processing during lagging-strand synthesis (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992Google Scholar). Taq polymerase also utilizes both its polymerase and 5′-nuclease activities in a nucleotide replacement reaction: it catalyzes the upstream addition of deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates to the 3′-hydroxyl terminus of an RNA primer and also cleaves the downstream, single-stranded 5′-nucleotide displaced by the growing upstream strand. On a DNA duplex substrate, upstream primer extension and downstream strand excision must be highly coordinated (2Xu Y. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20949-20955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to leave a ligatable nick, instead of a gap or an overhang, on a DNA duplex that is to be sealed later by a DNA ligase. The structure and functional properties of Taq polymerase are similar to those of the polymerase I of Escherichia coli (3Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taq polymerase has two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (residues 1-289) that has single-stranded 5′-nucleotide cleavage activity (5′-nuclease domain), and a C-terminal domain (residues 306-832) that has DNA polymerase activity (Klentaq domain). Integrated into the Klentaq domain is another domain (residues 306-423) that is structurally analogous to the proof editing 3′ → 5′-exonuclease domain of E. coli polymerase I, but this domain has no known activity in Taq polymerase. The Klentaq and the 5′-nuclease domains are connected by a linker region (residues 290-305). Structural and functional analysis has revealed that the 5′-nuclease of Taq polymerase is a member of a group of structure-specific DNA cleavage nucleases in various viruses, bacteria, archaea, and higher eukaryotes. These 5′-nucleases are either physically linked to polymerases as in Taq polymerase and E. coli polymerase I or exist as subunits within complexes that contain discrete polymerase and nuclease activities. Examples of this latter group include the phage-encoded T5 5′-nucleases (4Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Ceska T.A.

Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and mammalian flap endonuclease I (7Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), all of which share an α/β topology with a common central β-sheet and similar surrounding α-helices. The active site comprises a cleft formed within the central β-sheet; at the bottom of cleft is a set of conserved acidic residues that are essential for binding the three divalent metal ions (two Mn2+ ions and one Zn2+ ion) required for nuclease activity. The structure of native Taq polymerase (8Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) shows that there are three metal ions at the active site of the nuclease domain, two Mn2+ and a Zn2+, consistent with the two-metal ion mechanism proposed for nuclease activity (9Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that the 5′-nuclease of Taq polymerase recognizes and endonucleolytically cleaves a structure-specific DNA substrate that has a bifurcated downstream duplex and an upstream template-primer duplex that overlaps the downstream duplex by 1 bp (overlap flap DNA substrate; see Fig. 1B) (10Lyamichev V. Brow M.A. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1993; 260: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Lyamichev V. Brow M.A. Varvel V.E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6143-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 5′-nuclease cleaves the unpaired 5′-arm of the overlap flap DNA substrate by cutting endonucleolytically at the 1st bp of the duplex at the junction between the upstream and downstream duplexes (see arrow in Fig. 1B). The T5 5′-nuclease and flap endonuclease I also recognize and cleave overlap flap DNA in the same structure-specific manner (12Garforth S.J. Sayers J.R.

In Pyrococcus furiosus flap endonuclease I (16Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and T5 5′-nuclease (4Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a helix-3-turn-helix motif forms a helical clamp that has been proposed to accommodate a threaded unpaired 5′-single-stranded nucleic acid. In the original Taq polymerase crystal structure, this arch region is disordered and missing. The authors nevertheless proposed the existence of a loop that forms a hole (8Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) through which the DNA flap produced by strand displacement can be threaded. Altogether, the evidence so far suggests that recognition and cleavage of the structure-specific DNA substrate is an exclusive characteristic of the 5′-nuclease domain, although experiments do also suggest that the polymerase domain can influence the nuclease domain (11Lyamichev V.

The extended nature of the conformation of apoTaq polymerase in the crystal structure poses a puzzle regarding the mechanisms by which polymerase and 5′-nuclease activities are coordinated to generate a nick in the nucleotide replacement reaction (8Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The maximum molecular dimension of the crystal structure, which is extended, is 130 Å, with the active sites of the polymerase and nuclease domains 70 Å apart. A study by solution small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) 1The abbreviations used are: SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; P(r), length distribution function; Rg, radius of gyration; SANS, small angle neutron scattering. confirms an expanded conformation similar to that in the crystal structure (19Joubert A.M. Byrd A.S. LiCata V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25341-25347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the crystal structure of Taq polymerase bound to an antibody (Fab) inhibitor (20Murali R. Sharkey D.J. Daiss J.L. Murthy H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12562-12567Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Urs U.K. Murali R. Murthy H.M.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) shows that the Klentaq and 5′-nuclease domains can adopt significantly different orientations, and the two active sites are brought significantly closer together, to about 40 Å. However, because the Fab inhibitor does not structurally resemble the DNA substrate, the Taq polymerase-Fab complex structure cannot be used to explain the coordination of the polymerase and the nuclease activities in nick generation. To date, there has been no structural information with Taq polymerase bound to a DNA substrate that is appropriate for an examination of its nick generation function. We have used solution small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to study the conformational changes in Taq polymerase, as well as in individual Klentaq and 5′-nuclease domains, upon binding to the overlap flap DNA substrate. By using the contrast variation technique, SANS can study the conformation changes of the Taq polymerase and DNA substrate components separately because the scattering of neutrons from either the DNA or the protein can be contrast matched by that of the buffer in 65 or 42% D2O, respectively (22May R.P. Lindner P. Zemb T. Neutrons, X-rays, and Light Scattering Methods Applied to Soft Condensed Matter. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2002: 463-480Google Scholar). In this way, either the DNA or the protein is rendered “invisible” to neutrons. The results show that Taq polymerase adopts a more compact conformation when bound to the DNA substrate. However, the conformation change in Taq polymerase is not enough to bring the active sites on the polymerase and 5′-nuclease into close proximity. With recent progress in computational methods for analyzing solution scattering data, a three-dimensional low resolution structure (or “envelope”) of a compact biological macromolecule can be reconstructed from solution small angle scattering profiles (23Chacon P.

A three-dimensional molecular envelope of the Taq polymerase-DNA complex reconstructed from SANS data reveals that the 5′-nuclease domain adopts an orientation that is different from its orientation in the two known crystal structures of Taq polymerase. Moreover, the upstream and the downstream duplex portions of the DNA substrate in the protein-DNA complex form an angle of about 120° with respect to each other. Our SANS results thus support the footprinting results from Taq polymerase (11Lyamichev V. Brow M.A. Varvel V.E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20949-20955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) which find that the polymerase domain and the 5′-nuclease domain can operate independently but collaborate with each other to some extent. Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant expression plasmid for Taq polymerase was constructed by inserting the gene of Taq DNA polymerase (amino acid codons 1-832) into the pET-22b vector (Novagen). The expression plasmids for individual Klentaq and Taq 5′-nuclease proteins were constructed into the pET-28c vector (Novagen), which has a sequence encoding a C-terminal His6 tag. All three plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The cells containing the plasmids were grown at 37 °C in TB medium containing 80 mg/liter ampicillin to an A600 of about 1.0. The cells were then induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 125 mg/liter and then grown for another 2.5 h and harvested. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml/liter culture of buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 4 mg/ml lysozyme/liter of original culture. After the resuspended mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 0.1 mm. The mixture was then sonicated to break open the cells and centrifuged. The resulting lysate was then heat treated at 75 °C for 40 min and then chilled on ice for about 1 h. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added again to 0.1 mm, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for about 20 min. The clarified supernatant containing Taq polymerase was transferred to a clean flask. The DNA was precipitated with the addition polyethylenimine to about 0.25%, and the DNA precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g. The remaining protein was precipitated from the solution by adding 30 g of ammonium sulfate powder and centrifuged at 25,000 × g. The protein pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm NaCl. The resuspended protein was dialyzed against at least three changes of a large volume of buffer of buffer B containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solution containing recombinant Taq polymerase was loaded onto a DEAE fast protein liquid chromatography column and eluted with a NaCl gradient ranging from 0 to 300 mm. Taq polymerase eluted at about 140 mm NaCl. The protein was then loaded on a heparin column and eluted at about 320 mm NaCl using a gradient of 0-1 m NaCl. Klentaq and Taq 5′-nuclease domain proteins were purified from a nickel column using the protocols suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Before SANS experiments, the protein solution was purified further by gel filtration using Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of each of the proteins was higher than 98% as judged from SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. The protein solution was also found to be free of nucleic acid based on the UV spectrum and absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm in 6.0 m guanidinium HCl solution, using the extinction coefficients ϵ278 = 1.19 cm-1 ml mg-1, ϵ278 = 1.14 cm-1 ml mg-1, and ϵ278 = 1.26 for Taq polymerase, Klentaq1, and the 5′-nuclease, respectively. DNA Oligonucleotides—The DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology Inc. (Coralville, IA) and purified by the PAGE method. The sequences of the nucleotides are 5′-CTCAGAAAGAAGGCAACTGGACCGAAGGCG-3′, 5′-GCTATGAACTCCTTCTCCACAAGCGCCTTCGGTCCAGTTGCCTTCTTTCTGAG-3′, and 5′-CAGGTTTCTTAAGCTTGTGGAGAAGGAGTTCATAGC-3′. When assembled together, these three oligonucleotides form an overlap flap structure in which the upstream primer overlaps with the downstream duplex by one nucleotide as shown in Fig. 1. Sample Preparation for SANS Experiments—For apoTaq polymerase, Klentaq, and 5′-nuclease, SANS experiments were conducted in 90% D2O buffer containing 75 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. For the SANS experiments on protein-DNA complexes, the three oligonucleotides were dissolved at a 1:1:1 molar ratio in 65% D2O (or 42% D2O) buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and allowed to anneal at 55 °C for 1 h. The annealed oligonucleotides were then added to solutions of Taq polymerase, Klentaq, or 5′-nuclease domains, at a molar ratio of 1:1. In the absence of Mg2+ and in the presence of EDTA, the 5′-nuclease domain can bind to the overlap flap DNA substrate without cleaving the DNA. The protein-DNA complexes were then purified with gel filtration using Superdex-200 to remove impurities from oligonucleotide synthesis (Fig. 2). For SANS experiments in 90 and 65% D2O buffer, about a 0.5-ml sample or the buffer background was loaded into a 2-mm path length quartz banjo cell and then sealed with paraffin. For SANS experiments in 42% D2O, about a 0.3-ml sample or the buffer background was loaded in 1 mm path-length quartz banjo cell. The protein solution or the protein-DNA complex solutions used for SANS experiments contained about 5 mg/ml protein. SANS Experiments and Data Reduction—SANS measurements were conducted on the 30-m SANS instrument at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research (28Glinka C. Barker J. Hammouda B. Krueger S. Moyer J. Orts W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 430-445Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The incident neutron wavelength was λ = 6 Å with a wavelength resolution of Δ(λ)/λ = 15%. The sample-to-detector distances were set at 13.19 and 1.33 m, respectively, to give a Q range from 0.017 Å-1 to 0.45 Å-1, where Q = (4π/λ)sin(θ/2) (θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength) and is the amplitude of scattering vector. Data acquisition time was about 5 h and 2 h at sample-to-detector distances of 13.19 m and 1.33 m, respectively. The scattering intensity was corrected for background and parasitic scattering, placed on an absolute level using a calibrated secondary standard, and averaged circularly to yield the scattering intensity, I(Q), as a function Q (28Glinka C. Barker J. Hammouda B. Krueger S. Moyer J. Orts W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 430-445Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The incoherent background from the buffer background was measured, corrected by the volume fraction displaced by the proteins dissolved, and subtracted from the reduced SANS data. The data points in the Q range from about 0.35 Å-1 to 0.42 Å-1 were then averaged to yield the estimated incoherent background from the proteins in the solution, which was subtracted from the data as well. The SANS experiments were conducted at temperatures of 25 ± 0.1 °C. SANS Data Analysis—In a dilute, monodisperse solution of a protein or other biological macromolecule, the scattering intensity arises from the intramolecular interference and is characteristic of the size, shape, and the molecular weight of the measured molecule (29Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 119-196Google Scholar, 30Feigen L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small Angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987Crossref Google Scholar, 31van Holde K.E. Johnson W.C. Ho P.S. Principles of Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1998: 325-331Google Scholar). The intensity I(Q) of the scattered neutrons from the nuclei of a macromolecule dissolved in buffer solution can be expressed asI(Q)=(ρP−ρS)2cMWNAν¯p2 P(Q)(Eq. 1) where (ρp - ρs)2 is the square of the neutron scattering length density contrast between the neutron scattering length density of the protein ρp and that of the buffer ρs, c is the protein concentration in (mg/ml); Mw is the molecular weight, NA is Avogadro's number, v̄p is the partial specific volume of the protein in the buffer solution, andP(Q)=1n2∑i=1n∑j=1n(sin QrijQrij)(Eq. 2) is the form factor that contains information about the size and shape of the measured molecules. Here, rij is the distance between pairs of scattering nuclei i and j. The radius of gyration Rg is related to the size and conformation of a globular protein and can be obtained from the Guinier approximationln I(Q)=ln I(0)−13Q2Rg2(Eq. 3) by linear least squares fitting in the QRg ≤ 1 region. Inverse Fourier transformation of I(Q) gives the length distribution function P(r), which is the probability of finding two scattering points at a given distance r from each other in the measured macromolecule (29Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 119-196Google Scholar).P(r)=12π2∫I(Q)Qr sin(Qr)dQ(Eq. 4) The radius of gyration can also be determined from P(r) by Equation 5.Rg2=∫P(r)r2dr2∫P(r)dr(Eq. 5) The value at which P(r) becomes 0 reflects the maximum molecular dimension Dmax of the macromolecule averaged over all orientations. The shape of the P(r) plot and the value of Dmax can be used to deduce the macromolecular shape and the distance between two domains within the protein. Additionally, P(r) can also be derived from the crystal structure coordinates using Equations 2 and 4. One can directly examine the differences between a solution structure and the crystal structure by examining P(r) functions measured by small angle scattering and that calculated from crystal structure. In this study, P(r) was generated from the SANS data by the GNOM program (32Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The scattering curves from the various crystal structures were computed using Equation 2. For a multicomponent system, such as a protein-DNA complex in solution, the scattering intensity is (33Bu Z. Engelman D.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1064-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)I(Q)=(ρp−ρs)2Ip(Q)+(ρp−ρs)(ρD−ρs)IpD(Q)+(ρD−ρs)2ID(Q)(Eq. 6) where ρD is the scattering length density of the DNA, ID(Q) is the scattering from the DNA component, and IpD(Q) is the cross-term reflecting the interference between the scattering amplitudes of the DNA and the protein components. In a SANS experiment, the differences between the scattering length density contrast of a protein and that of a DNA can be employed in contrast match experiments to study the structure of one component in a protein-DNA complex while masking the scattering from the other (22May R.P. Lindner P. Zemb T. Neutrons, X-rays, and Light Scattering Methods Applied to Soft Condensed Matter. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2002: 463-480Google Scholar). As shown in Equation 6, the contributions of the protein and DNA components within the complex to the scattering intensity depend on their scattering length density contrasts ρp -ρs and ρD - ρs. The scattering length density is largely dependent on the hydrogen content of a protein or a DNA molecule and can be either calculated from their atomic compositions or measured experimentally. The scattering length density contrast between the buffer solution and a macromolecule can be changed significantly by utilizing the large difference in magnitude and the opposite sign of the scattering lengths of the isotopes of hydrogen and deuterium. As described in Ref. 22May R.P. Lindner P. Zemb T. Neutrons, X-rays, and Light Scattering Methods Applied to Soft Condensed Matter. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2002: 463-480Google Scholar, the contrast between DNA and buffer becomes 0 in 65% D2O buffer solutions, whereas the contrast between the protein and the buffer is still significant (22May R.P. Lindner P. Zemb T. Neutrons, X-rays, and Light Scattering Methods Applied to Soft Condensed Matter. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2002: 463-480Google Scholar). Then Equation 6 reduces to Equation 1, and only the scattering from the protein is measured. Likewise, in 42% percent D2O buffer solutions the contrast between the protein and buffer becomes 0, and only the scattering from the DNA molecules is detected. Reconstruction of Three-dimensional Molecular Envelopes from SANS Data—In our study, the low resolution three-dimensional molecular structures of the apo and the DNA-bound forms of Taq polymerase and Klentaq were reconstructed by using the program DAMMIN (26Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 34Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) developed by Svergun and Koch to generate a set of PDB-formatted dummy bead coordinates. DAMMIN employs nonlinear minimization to determine the envelope functions, which are parameterized using spherical harmonics and Monte Carlo-based methods to yield models in the form of finite volume element ensembles. The nonlinear constraints on which this algorithm depends are positivity and compactness in scattering density, both of which can usually be satisfied by a natively folded protein. The reconstructed three-dimensional molecular envelopes created from SANS can be docked to the crystal structures in a quantitative manner using the program package Situs developed by Wriggers et al. (35Wriggers W. Birmanns S. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Wriggers W. Chacón P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 773-776Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Situs utilizes vector quantization with topology-representing networks to display three-dimensional structures. A three-dimensional structure is encoded with a set of quantized “codebook vectors” at characteristic positions in the three-dimensional structure. The codebook vectors can identify gross structural features and provide information about the shape and density distribution of a low resolution structure such as those obtained from SANS or of an atomic high resolution structure such as one obtained from x-ray crystallography. The resulting two sets of codebook vectors enable a precise docking and comparison of the low resolution and high resolution structures. In our analysis, the set of PDB-formatted dummy bead coordinates generated by the program DAMMIN from SANS data was transformed into a three-dimensional molecular envelope by Situs to map the coordinates to the three-dimensional density lattice with a hard sphere kernel-convolution of each dummy bead center. The three-dimensional density molecular envelope constructed in this manner was then compared with the crystal structure using the two sets of quantized codebook vectors and the rigid body molecular docking capability of Situs (35Wriggers W. Birmanns S. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Wriggers W. Chacón P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 773-776Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The calculations were performed on an IBM RS6000 computer. Fig. 3, A, B, and C, summarize the SANS results on the apo and DNA-bound forms of Taq polymerase, Klentaq, and 5′-nuclease, respectively. The Guinier plots are linear in the low Q region, indicating the absence of aggregation in the protein"
https://openalex.org/W2132186895,"Rho family small GTPases are critical regulators of multiple cellular processes and activities. Dbl homology domain-containing proteins are the classical guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) responsible for activation of Rho proteins. Recently another group of mammalian Rho-GEFs was discovered that includes CDM (Ced-5, DOCK180, Myoblast city) proteins that activate Rac and zizimin1 that activates Cdc42 via a nonconventional GEF module that we named the CZH2 domain. We report here that zizimin1 dimerizes via the CZH2 domain and that dimers are the only form detected. Dimerization was mapped to a ∼200-amino acid region that overlaps but is distinct from the Cdc42-binding sequences. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy revealed zizimin1 to be a symmetric, V-shaped molecule. Experiments with DOCK180 and homology analysis suggest that dimerization may be a general feature of CZH proteins. Deletion and mutation analysis indicated existence of individual Cdc42-binding sites in the zizimin1 monomers. Kinetic measurements demonstrated increased binding affinity of Cdc42 to zizimin1 at higher Cdc42 concentration, suggesting positive cooperativity. These features are likely to be critical for Cdc42 activation. Rho family small GTPases are critical regulators of multiple cellular processes and activities.

The Rho family of low molecular weight GTPases includes 22 human genes, the best known members being RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (1Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Rho proteins are important regulators of multiple cellular processes and activities. These include control of cell morphology, polarity, migration, adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins or other cells, proliferation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, phagocytosis, vesicular transport, and gene transcription (2Aznar S. Fernandez-Valeron P. Espina C. Lacal J.C. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar, 4Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cdc42 mediates cell polarity, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cell-cell contacts (5Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). The effects of Cdc42 are mediated by several effectors: actin polymerization and reorganization via activation of WASP and p65PAK proteins; microtubule reorganization via PAR-6, IQGAP1, and p65PAK; and vesicle trafficking via PAR-6 and potentially also the coatomer complex (6Etienne-Manneville S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). It is not entirely clear how Rho proteins mediate such diverse and complex effects, but their selective targeting, activation, and inactivation probably play important roles.Like other GTPases, Rho proteins are active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. Conversion of the GDP-bound proteins to the active state is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ND, nucleotide-depleted; DH, Dbl homology; WCE, whole cell extract; EM, electron microscopy; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodi-imide; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ND, nucleotide-depleted; DH, Dbl homology; WCE, whole cell extract; EM, electron microscopy; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodi-imide; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. For nucleotide exchange, the GEF first binds with low affinity to the GDP-bound protein and induces dissociation of GDP from this complex, which leads to formation of a higher affinity intermediate. This intermediate is then dissociated by binding of GTP (7Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). GEFs can therefore be distinguished from other GTPase-interacting proteins by their ability to bind preferentially to the nucleotide-depleted (ND) state compared with GTP- or GDP-bound states (8Hart M.J.

Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The classical GEFs for Rho GTPases share a common motif, designated the Dbl homology (DH) domain, that mediates nucleotide exchange (10Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In mammals, over 60 DH domain-containing proteins have been identified, illustrating the need for selective activation of Rho proteins by different signaling pathways and under diverse conditions (11Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar).Another family of mammalian Rho-GEFs was recently discovered that includes CDM (Ced-5, DOCK180, Myoblast city) proteins that activate Rac, and zizimin1 that activates Cdc42 (9Meller N.

This family includes 11 mammalian genes, which, based on sequence homology, can be divided into a subfamily related to CDM proteins and a subfamily related to zizimin1. The two groups share two conserved domains that we named CZH1 and CZH2 for CDM-zizimin homology 1 and 2, respectively (9Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We propose here to name collectively the superfamily CZH proteins. The CZH2 domain, also called DOCKER or DHR2, is a GEF domain that shows no sequence homology to DH domains. The function of the CZH1 domain, also named DHR1, remains unknown (13Cote J.F. Vuori K. J.

Interestingly a zizimin homolog, named SPIKE1, was identified in Arabidopsis, and it is now known to interact with multiple ROPs (21Qiu J.L. Jilk R. Marks M.D. Szymanski D.B.

Szymanski, personal communication.We report here that zizimin1 forms V-shaped dimers via a 200-amino acid region within the CZH2 domain. Individual Cdc42-binding sites most likely exist in each subunit. Analysis of binding affinity suggests positive cooperativity. These data provide the first insights into the biochemical properties of CZH family exchange factors.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and TransfectionsCOS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum penicillin and streptomycin, all from Invitrogen. 24 h before transfection, the cells were subcultured so as to reach 50–70% confluency the next day for transfection. Unless indicated otherwise, the cells were transfected in 100-mm tissue culture dishes with 1.3 g of total DNA using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For electron microscopy and BIAcore experiments, 6 × 106 cells were electroporated with 20 μg of total DNA in 0.4-ml cuvettes at 250 volts and 950 microfarads. The cells were collected 48 h post-transfection.Zizimin1 PurificationTransfected cells were collected by trypsinization, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed 10 min on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% protein inhibitors mixture (final concentrations, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 15 μm pepstatin A, 14 μm E-64, 40 μm bestatin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.8 μm aprotinin; Sigma P8340). The lysates were cleared by 10 min of centrifugation at 16,000 × g. A portion of this whole cell extract (WCE) was reserved, and the rest was incubated with M2 anti-FLAG affinity beads (Sigma F2426) for 3 h, on a rocker at 4 °C. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the beads were washed three times in lysis buffer at 4 °C, 10 min/wash and eluted in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol 10% β-mercaptoethanol). In the experiment presented in Fig. 1C, cell lysis and immunoprecipitation were done in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture).When purifying zizimin1 for electron microscopy (EM), the immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer for 30 min each time and once in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm ammonium acetate for 30 min. Zizimin1 was eluted for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm ammonium acetate, and 0.2 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma F4799). When purifying zizimin1 for surface plasmon resonance experiments, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer for 30 min each time and once for 30 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100. Zizimin1 was eluted 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.3 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma #F3290). Some of the material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the rest was supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline.Chemical Cross-linkingCells were collected by trypsinization, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% protease inhibitor mixture. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the lysates were clarified by 16,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min. 5 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodi-imide (EDC) dissolved in water was added for 30 min at room temperature. Control samples received equal volumes of water. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5× SDS loading buffer (0.3125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, and 25% β-mercaptoethanol).Determination of Zizimin1 Molecular WeightSedimentation—COS7 cells, untransfected or transiently transfected with HA-tagged zizimin1, were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed 10 min on ice in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% protein inhibitors mixture. The lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected. 500-μl aliquots of lysates or protein standards were loaded onto 11.2 ml of 5–20% sucrose gradients in lysis buffer. After 16 h of centrifugation at 270,000 × g, fractions of ∼600 μl (this value varied slightly between experiments) were collected starting at the bottom. The fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein standards gels were stained with Coomassie, and the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA or anti-zizimin1. The protein standards used are in Fig. 3B.Fig. 3Zizimin1 is a dimer.A, lysates of COS7 cells were fractionated on a 5–20% sucrose gradient (top panel) or on a Superose-6 gel filtration column (bottom panel). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-zizimin1 antibody. Protein standards were fractionated in parallel, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (not shown). Peak fractions of the protein standards are indicated by arrows. An arrow between fractions indicates that the peak spanned the two fractions. The remaining fractions, not displayed, were negative for zizimin1. B, lysates of COS7 cells expressing HA-tagged zizimin1 were analyzed as in A and probed with anti-HA antibody. Note that for sucrose gradients the fractions size and numbers vary between experiments. Additional fractions that are not displayed were negative for zizimin1.

Lysates were spun 10 min at 16,000 × g, and supernatants were resolved on a Superose 6 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) using lysis buffer as running buffer. Fifty 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The standards were detected by absorption at A280; standards used were thyroglobulin, bovine IgG, ovalbumin, myoglobin, and vitamin B12 with molecular masses of 670, 158, 44, 17, and 1.35 kDa, respectively.Molecular Mass Calculation—The method was adopted from UCSF web sites itsa.ucsf.edu/∼hdeacon/calculate.html and itsa.ucsf.edu/∼hdeacon/Stokesradius.html. To calculate molecular mass from sedimentation and gel filtration data, we used the relationship M = αaS where M is the molecular mass, a is the Stokes radius in cm, S is the sedimentation coefficient, and α = 6πηoN/(1 – νρ), where ηo is the viscosity of the solvent (which is 1.002 × 10–2 for water), ν is the specific density (0.725 for protein), ρ is the density of solvent (0.998 for water), and n is Avogadro's number.Electron MicroscopyFLAG-zizimin1 was purified as described above. Protein at 100 μg/ml was diluted into glycerol so that the final concentration was 12.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 125 mm ammonium acetate, 0.05 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide, and 50% glycerol. 200-μl aliquots were sprayed on to freshly cleaved mica sheets. The sheets were rotary shadowed with platinum at a 9° angle and stabilized with carbon at a 90° angle. The replicas were floated off of the mica in distilled water and collected on 200-mesh copper grids for examination using a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope.Cdc42 Pull-down AssaysThe cell lysates were prepared as for the immunoprecipitation experiments (see above). Glutathione S-transferase-Cdc42 pull-down was done as described (9Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Binding of Purified Zizimin1 Dimers to Cdc42FLAG-tagged zizimin1 constructs were immunoprecipitated as described above followed by 30 min of elution at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide. The eluate was diluted and supplemented to bring the final concentration to 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.06 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide. Each eluate was divided; 4% was saved as total sample, 27% was used for anti-HA IP, and 68% was pulled down with ND-Cdc42.Surface Plasmon ResonanceAnti-mouse IgG1 was covalently immobilized on CM5 chips, then anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma F3165) was allowed to bind to the chips followed by binding of FLAG zizimin1, purified as described above. Bacterially expressed His6-Cdc42 was purified using TALON metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences Clontech; Palo Alto, CA) and used as an analyte. Binding kinetics were measured using a BIAcore 3000 at 25 °C at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Association was followed for 2 min, and dissociation was measured for 10 min. The running buffer was 10 mm HEPES, 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% P20, 3 mm EDTA. To regenerate the chip, Cdc42 was dissociated from zizimin1 using 35 μl of running buffer containing 10 μm GTP, 3 mm MgCl2, and no EDTA. The data were analyzed with the 1:1 model using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software.DNA ConstructsHA-tagged zizimin1 constructs were cloned in the pEF4-Myc-His-C vector (Invitrogen) as described (9Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).FLAG-tagged Zizimin1 Fragments—A linker coding for FLAG followed by glycine (DYKDDDDKG) and a KpnI site was constructed using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGGGTGGTACC-3′ and 5′-GATCGGTACCACCCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCATGGTGGCGTAC-3′. It was cloned into pEF-4-Myc-His-C using the KpnI and BamHI sites to generate pEF-FLAGKPN. Zizimin1 fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned in pEF-FLAG-Kpn using the KpnI and NotI sites.FLAG Full-length Zizimin1—A sequence coding for FLAG followed by two glycines (GCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAG GGTGGT) was added to zizimin1 before its first codon using PCR, and the FLAG-zizimin1 insert was cloned into pEF4-Myc-His-C using the KpnI and NotI sites.Zizimin11865–6 AA—Zizimin1 amino acids 1865–1866 were mutated from YI to AA using the site-directed mutagenesis kit QuikChange XL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the primers 5′-GATCTGGATTCTAAGTATGCCGCGGCCCAGGTGACTCACGTCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGACGTGAGTCACCTGGGCCGCGGCATACTTAGAATCCAGATC-3′. This mutation creates a SacII site. A fragment containing the mutation was subcloned into the pEF-FLAG-zizimin1 and pEF-HA-zizimin1 vectors and sequenced.His6-Cdc42—The cDNA coding for human wild type Cdc42 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TCTGGATCCGGGAGGAGGACAGACAATTAAGTGTGTTGTTGG-3′ and 5′-AAAGAATTCTCATAGCAGCACACACCTGC-3′. The insert was cloned into pRSET-B (Invitrogen) using the BamHI and EcoRI sites. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing.FLAG- and HA-tagged DOCK180 were from Dr. Kodi Ravichandran (The Beirne Carter Center for Immunology Research and the Department of Microbiology and Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA).AntibodiesAnti-zizimin1 antibody was raised in rabbits immunized with a peptide bearing the first 12 amino acids using standard procedures. The resultant sera were affinity purified on columns conjugated to the same peptide. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody was from Covance (Princeton, NJ; MMS-101P).RESULTSZizimin1 Oligomerizes—Sequence analysis of zizimin1 indicated potential coiled coil structures in the last 100 amino acids (9Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These structures are often implicated in oligomerization, which prompted us to test whether zizimin1 exists as higher order complexes. We therefore transfected COS7 cells with HA-tagged zizimin1 alone or together with FLAG-tagged protein. When cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to FLAG, HA-zizimin1 was efficiently precipitated from cells co-expressing FLAG-zizimin1 but not from control cells that expressed only HA-zizimin1. These results demonstrate self-association of zizimin1 (Fig. 1B).As an independent assay for oligomerization, lysates of cells overexpressing HA-zizimin1 were treated with the zero-length cross-linking reagent EDC that links amino and carboxylic acid groups when they are within close proximity (22Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA. Cross-linking induced the appearance of a single major higher molecular mass band (Fig. 1D). No higher oligomers were detected. Fibronectin and zizimin1 have similar monomer molecular weights (fibronectin, 263; zizimin1, 236), and plasma fibronectin is a disulfide-bonded dimer; thus, fibronectin run under reduced or nonreduced conditions was used as a marker for monomers and dimers, respectively (arrows on Fig. 1D). The EDC-induced zizimin1 band had the same mobility as the fibronectin dimer, suggesting that zizimin1 forms oligomers, most likely dimers.Mapping the Oligomerization Domain—To identify sequences in zizimin1 required for oligomerization, the interactions between FLAG-tagged full-length zizimin1 and HA-tagged deletion mutants were tested by co-immunoprecipitation. Deletion of the C-terminal 191 amino acids (Δ1879-end) modestly reduced the association, whereas deletion of 373 amino acids (Δ1696-end) nearly abolished the interaction (Fig. 1B). When lysates containing the HA-tagged C-terminal deletion constructs were treated with EDC, the more slowly migrating species was decreased for zizimin1Δ1879-end and further diminished with zizimin1Δ1696-end (Fig. 1D).To test whether residues 1696–1878 are sufficient for oligomerization, we co-expressed FLAG and HA forms of a similar fragment (1693–1878) and performed the co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking assays. HA-zizimin11693–1878 precipitated with FLAG-zizimin11693–1878 but not with a FLAG-tagged zizimin1 pleckstrin homology domain that was used as a negative control (Fig. 2B). EDC treatment induced a slower migrating band compatible with dimeric zizimin11693–1878 (Fig. 2D). These results show that zizimin1 amino acids 1696–1878 encompass the core sequence required for oligomerization, whereas amino acids 1879–2069 enhance the association. The potential coiled-coil lies at the last hundred amino acids and thus is outside the main oligomerization motif. Efforts to further map the interactions involved in dimer formation were unsuccessful because neither the 1693–1777 nor the 1775–2069 fragments showed significant dimer formation by either chemical cross-linking or co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, B–D).Fig. 2Mapping the oligomerization domain.A, schematic diagram of the zizimin1 C-terminal region and the fragments used in the experiments. The area represented by dashed line is not to scale. B, association of zizimin1 fragments was determined by co-immunoprecipitation. HA-tagged zizimin1 fragments (bait) were co-expressed in COS7 cells with FLAG-tagged fragments (hunter) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The FLAG-tagged zizimin1 pleckstrin homology domain (PH, amino acids 172–282) was used as a negative control. Level of the different fragments in the IPs and the corresponding whole cell extracts (W; representing 9% of the extract used for IP) was determined by Western blotting with anti-HA (top panels) or anti-FLAG antibody (bottom panels). C, the experiment was performed and is displayed as in B. The positions of different fragments are indicated by arrows. The very top bands in the HA or FLAG blots are the heavy chain of the FLAG antibody used for IP. D, HA-tagged zizimin11693–1878 and zizimin11775-end were expressed in COS7 cells. Cell lysates treated with (+) or without (–)5mm EDC were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-HA Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DOCK180 Oligomerization—As mentioned in the introduction, this family of GEFs can be divided into DOCK180-related and zizimin-related proteins. The amino acids from position 1696 to the end are part of the CZH2 domain, which is conserved among all family members. This homology raises the question whether the DOCK180-related proteins also oligomerize. We therefore expressed FLAG-tagged together with HA-tagged DOCK180 and assayed co-immunoprecipitation. HA-DOCK180 was detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates in the presence of FLAG-DOCK180 but not in its absence (Fig. 1C). Thus, DOCK180 also self-associates, suggesting that this property is conserved throughout the CZH family.Zizimin1 Is a Dimer—To determine whether zizimin1 assembles into dimers or higher oligomers, hydrodynamic properties were assayed. Lysates of nontransfected or zizimin1-overexpressing COS7 cells were analyzed by both gel filtration and sedimentation on sucrose gradients. The resultant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting to detect zizimin1. Globular protein standards were separated in parallel. These measurements showed that endogenous zizimin1 had a Stokes radius of 86 Å and a sedimentation coefficient of 12.6 S (Fig. 3). When overexpressed at moderate levels, the main peak of HA-zizimin1 had a Stokes radius of 13.6 S but showed a tail toward a higher molecular weight. Neither endogenous nor HA-zizimin1 had any protein detectable at the position expected for monomers. Calculations of the molecular weight based on these values (see “Materials and Methods”) yielded a molecular weight for zizimin1 of 480 kDa. Based on amino acid composition, the monomer mass of zizimin is 236 kDa; thus hydrodynamic measurements indicate that zizimin1 exists mainly as a dimer. However, when expressed at high levels, HA-zizimin1 ran as much higher aggregates (not shown), suggesting that higher order oligomers are possible under some conditions.Rotary Shadow Electron Microscopy—To view the zizimin1 complex, the protein was overexpressed in COS7 cells at levels where it remains primarily dimeric according to hydrodynamics, purified by FLAG immunoprecipitation, rotary-shadowed, and examined by EM. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining demonstrated that the protein ran as a single major band (not shown). EM images revealed symmetric, V-shaped structures with varying angles between the two arms (Fig. 4). Although the resolution of the technique does not allow a detailed analysis of protein structure, it appears that the arms may be composed of several globular domains. EM images are therefore compatible with zizimin1 being a dimer held together at the C terminus. EM images of control samples from mock-transfected cells lacked the V-shaped structures (not shown).Fig. 4EM images of zizimin1. FLAG-tagged zizimin1 purified from COS7 cells was rotary-shadowed and electron microscopy images taken of the replicas. An image of 50,000 magnification is shown. The inset shows an individual zizimin1 molecule at higher magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Individual Cdc42-binding Sites in Zizimin1 Monomers—The zizimin1 CZH2 domain mediates both the interaction with Cdc42 and dimerization. The relationship between dimerization and Cdc42 binding was therefore explored. Because zizimin1 appears to exist exclusively as a dimer, we tested whether monomers that contain individual Cdc42-binding sites can function independently. To obtain a zizimin1 point mutant deficient in Cdc42 binding, we mutated tyrosine 1865 and isoleucine 1866, which are conserved in all CZH family members, to alanine. A parallel mutation in DOCK180 was found to inhibit the interaction with Rac (14Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The Zizimin1AA mutation almost completely suppressed Cdc42 binding (Fig. 5A). Zizimin1AA showed a modest (∼3-fold) decrease in its ability to dimerize with WT protein compared with WT/WT dimers (Fig"

Glucocorticoids, a major subclass of steroid hormones, modulate a large number of metabolic, cardiovascular, immune, and behavioral functions (1Chrousos G.P. N. Engl. J.

The GR binds to and controls the transcriptional activity of a set of target genes (3Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6310) Google Scholar, 4Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

In the absence of glucocorticoid, the GR is maintained predominantly in the cytoplasm as part of an inactive multiprotein complex that consists of the receptor, two Hsp90 molecules, one molecule each of Hsp70 and Hsp56, and an immunophilin of the FK506- and rapamycin-binding class (5Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). When glucocorticoid binds to GR, the receptor undergoes a change in conformation, dissociates from regulatory heat shock proteins, and is hyperphosphorylated. The activated receptor rapidly translocates to the cell nucleus, where it is able to initiate transcriptional regulation. In the nucleus, hormone-activated GR regulates transcription via two distinct mechanisms, involving direct transcriptional regulation and indirect transcriptional regulation via cross-talk with other TFs. During direct transcriptional regulation, the GR binds as a homodimer directly to short, palindromically arranged DNA sequences located in the promoter regions of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. Binding to these sequences, known as glucocorticoid response elements, leads to transcriptional induction or repression of target genes. During indirect transcriptional cross-talk, the GR regulates gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors. This indirect mechanism has been shown to alter the transcriptional properties of both the GR and the interacting TFs. Transrepression or transactivation via protein-protein interactions with other TFs, such as NF-κB (6Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Stroka D. Soares M. Bach F.H. Winkler H. J. Biol.

Although some cross-talk interactions cause no observable change in DNA binding activity (6Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Stroka D. Soares M. Bach F.H. Winkler H. J. Biol.

Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These latter interactions might result in a mutual transcriptional impairment or synergy of both DNA binding activities. For example, interaction between the GR and STAT5 increases the ability of STAT5 to enhance gene expression. This transcriptional synergy between STAT5 and the GR appears to result from increased DNA binding activity of STAT5 (10Wyszomierski S.L. Yeh J. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interactions that result in altered DNA binding activities of TFs have attracted considerable attention recently, but the lack of effective methods for studying multiple TF interactions has hindered serious research efforts. Conventionally, TF activities have been analyzed in vitro by gel shift assays, also known as electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Unfortunately, EMSAs can detect activation of only one TF/reaction. We have recently developed a novel array technology that allows high throughput functional analysis of TFs (11Lam R. Li X. Am. Biotechnol. Lab. 2002; 20: 22-26Google Scholar, 12Jiang X. Norman M. Li X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1642: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This simple array-based assay can profile the activities of multiple transcription factors in a single experiment. In the present study, we used this system to identify those TFs whose DNA binding activities are regulated by the GR. By comparing array data obtained both in the presence and in the absence of GR expression and activation, we identified cross-talk between the GR and several TFs. These TFs include IRF, whose DNA binding activity was enhanced in the presence of GR, and others like COUP-TF and E47, whose DNA binding activities were repressed. We used EMSAs and luciferase reporter assays to verify our array results. Constructs—The pCMV-GRα expression vector encoding human glucocorticoid receptor was kindly provided by E. Brad Thompson. Reporter constructs were made by replacing the NheI and BglII fragment of pMyc-TA-luc (Clontech) with the enhancer elements of GR, COUP-TF, IRF, or E47. Each reporter contains a minimal TATA box promoter, a luciferase gene, and two or three copies of each corresponding cis-element. Identical cis-element sequences were also used for the gel shift assays and array assays detailed below. A series of luciferase reporter vectors was constructed: pGRE-Luc, pIRF-Luc, pCOUP-TF-Luc, and pE47-Luc. siRNA expression vectors were derived from PAVU6 + 27 (13Paul C.P. Good P.D. Winer I. Engelke D.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Each siRNA expression vector contained two complementary copies of a 19-nucleotide gene-specific sequence separated by a short spacer. Both the sense and antisense portions of siRNA sequences were synthesized and annealed; then the generated SalI and XbaI cohesive ends were used for cloning into PAVU6 + 27 to make E47, COUP-TF, and IRF-1 siRNA expression vectors. The siRNA insert sequences were as follows (the loop regions are in lowercase letters): E47 siRNA, GAAGGTCCGGAAGGTCCCGttcaagagaCGGGACCTTCCGGACCTTCTTTTT; COUP-TF siRNA, GTCGAGCGGCAAGCACTACttcaagagaGTAGTGCTTGCCGCTCGACTTTTT; and IRF1 siRNA, GCATGGCTGGGACATCAACttcaagagaGTTGATGTCCCAGCCATGCTTTTT. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were cultured in 10-cm culture plates in Dulbecco's minimal essential Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential minimal amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Sixteen hours prior to transfection, the cells were seeded without antibiotics for transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). For all transfections, efficiency was monitored and normalized with an in situ β-galactosidase staining kit (Stratagene). The transfection efficiency was estimated to be in the range of 70–90%. To prepare nuclear extracts, COS-1 cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and transfected with 15 μg of GRα expression construct. After 16 h, the cells were treated with or without 10–6m dexamethasone (DEX) for one hour. Untransfected COS-1 cells were used as a control. To perform the reporter assay, the cells were plated in a 6-well plate and transfected with 1.5 μg of a reporter vector mixed with 1 μg of GRα expression vector. The cells transfected with the reporter vector only were used as a negative control. After exposure of transfected cells to 10–6m DEX for 6 h, the cells were subjected to a luciferase reporter assay. For siRNA knockdown, the cells were plated in a 6-well plate and transfected with 1.5 μg of siRNA expression vector. After 72 h, the cells were split; one portion was used for a luciferase reporter assay, and the other was used for Western blot analysis or PCR to examine the effects of siRNA on gene expression. Protein-DNA Array Analysis and Gel Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extraction, protein-DNA array, and gel shift assays were described previously (12Jiang X. Norman M. Li X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1642: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the protein-DNA assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with biotin-labeled DNA probe mix in binding buffer for 30 min at 15 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 2% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA and then excised from the gel. DNA probes were recovered from the protein-DNA complexes and hybridized to the array membrane. For gel shift assays, the nuclear extracts were incubated with individual biotin-labeled probes in binding buffer for 30 min at 15 °C. The probe sequences were as follows: E47 (14Schlissel M. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), CCGGCAGGTGTCCC; CO-UP-TF (15Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A.

Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5393-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), GACCCTAGAGGATCTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGATCCAATTCG. The negative control consisted of free probe (without nuclear extracts). For the competition control, we added excess unlabeled cold probes to the sample containing nuclear extract and biotin-labeled probe. The samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% Tris-borate-EDTA, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and fixed on the membrane by UV cross-linking. The biotin-labeled probe was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Luciferase Reporter Assay—COS-1 cells were first transfected with luciferase reporter constructs and GRα expression vector. After removing the culture medium and rinsing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 200 μl of 1× cell lysis buffer was added to the cells, which were then shaken at room temperature for 15–20 min. The cells were dislodged by scraping or pipetting and then transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube before being centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at room temperature for 1 min to remove cellular debris. 10 μl of the cell extract was mixed with 50 μl of substrate (Pierce), and luminescence was measured using a luminometer. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation was performed using protein G Dynabeads (Dynal Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To stabilize interactions between GRα and other TFs, the immunoprecipitation was carried out in the presence of cis-elements. After treatment of COS-1 and GRα-transfected COS-1 cells with or without 10–6m DEX for 6 h, the nuclear extracts were incubated with E47 probe or IRF probe for 30 min at 15 °C. The protein-DNA complexes were subsequently incubated with monoclonal GRα antibody for 2 h at4 °C and then pulled down with the cross-linked beads. Normal IgG was used as a negative control for immunoprecipitation. The protein-antibody mixture was incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein-bead complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and 50 μl of Laemmli's SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to elute the immunoprecipitated proteins. The eluted proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was then incubated with a polyclonal antibody against E47 or IRF-1 (Santa Cruz). After incubation with a secondary antibody, the membrane was overlaid with luminol enhancer and substrate for 5 min. The image was acquired using a FluorChem imager (Alpha Innotech Corp). To check for siRNA-mediated inhibition of specific gene expression, whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with E47 and IRF-1 antibodies or with nonrelevant YY1 antibody as a loading control. RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from COS-1 and COUP-TF siRNA-transfected cells using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 15 μg of total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl. One cycle of PCR amplification was performed at 94 °C for 60 s, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR reaction contained 1 μl of cDNA and 10 μm COUP-TF forward primer (CTCTATGCCGCTGCACGTGGC) and reverse primer (TAAGGCCAGTTGAAGCTGCTCCC). Primers for β-actin were used as an internal control. The amplified fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. To study cross-talk between the GR and other TFs, we employed a newly developed protein-DNA array technology. This array is a high throughput, DNA-based system that facilitates profiling of the activities of multiple TFs in one assay. There are two arrays: Array I can detect the binding of 54 TFs, and Array II can detect an additional 96 TFs. To identify TFs whose activities might be regulated by GRα, we transfected COS-1 cells, which are known to have a low endogenous level of GR (18Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), with pCMV-GRα or vehicle vector for 16 h. Upon treatment with 10–6m dexamethasone, the cells were collected and nuclear extracts were prepared for analysis with protein-DNA Arrays I and II (Tables I and II list the TFs included on both arrays). As shown in Fig. 1, array analysis detected increased activity of GRα, confirming activation of GRα within the cells. Quantitative analysis of the array results indicated a 2-fold increase in GRα binding. No TF other than GRα exhibited altered DNA binding activity on array I.Table ISchematic diagram of the protein/DNA Array I Open table in a new tab Table IISchematic diagram of the protein/DNA Array IIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Fig. 1Comparison of COS-1 cells and GRα-transfected COS-1 cells with the protein-DNA array I. The array assay was performed using nuclear extracts from COS-1 cells (A) and GRα-transfected COS-1 cells (B). Both cell types were treated with 100 nm dexamethasone. The boxes represent activated GR. These results are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The samples were also compared with protein-DNA Array II. On Array II, the spotting format is different from Array I; there are only two spots of immobilized DNA per cis-element, whereas Array I has four, two of which are diluted 10-fold. We found that the activities of multiple TFs on Array II were affected by GRα (Fig. 2). The most striking changes noted were increased binding of IRF and Pax4 and decreased binding of COUP-TF and E47. Quantitative analysis of the array results indicated that the DNA binding activities of all four of these TFs changed ∼2-fold (although transfection efficiency in these experiments was estimated to be at least 70%, it is possible that the degree of change in DNA binding of TFs has been underestimated by admixture of nuclear extracts from the small number of untransfected cells). Because the protein-DNA array is a high throughput method, the results require verification by a secondary assay. EMSAs were performed with IRF, Pax4, COUP-TF, and E47 probes that were identical in sequence to the probes used in the protein-DNA array assay. After electrophoresis and membrane transfer, both complexes and probes were identified with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, EMSA verified the increased IRF binding as well as the repression of COUP-TF and E47 binding in GRα-transfected cells. As expected, dexamethasone also produced a clear gel shift with a GR probe. Adding cold DNA to the EMSA reaction abolished the band shifts, confirming that the detection was specific. These EMSA results demonstrated that the protein-DNA array is an effective method for identifying TFs whose DNA binding activities have changed. The induction of Pax4, however, could not be verified by EMSA. This discrepancy suggests that the positive result on the array was most likely due to nonspecific binding. Two general mechanisms could explain GRα-mediated changes in DNA binding activities of TFs. First, mechanisms such as direct binding of GRα to specific cis-elements GR responsive element in a promoter or enhancer region of these TF genes could lead to changes in the amount of TF proteins. Second, direct or indirect interaction with the TF proteins could alter their DNA binding activity. These mechanisms are easily distinguished by Western blot analysis of COS-1 using antibodies against E47 and IRF-1. The results showed no difference in IRF-1 or E47 expression in the absence or presence of GRα, with or without DEX treatment, demonstrating that GRα does not significantly alter the expression level of IRF-1 or E47 (Fig. 4). Because no specific antibody against COUP-TF was available, the relevant study could not be carried out with this TF. As an alternative approach, we performed RT-PCR to analyze COUP-TF expression and found there was no difference between COS-1 cells, GRα-expressing COS-1 cells, or DEX-induced GRα-expressing COS-1 cells (Fig. 4). These studies demonstrated that the expression of the three TFs was unchanged by glucocorticoids, showing that GRα regulates DNA binding of IRF-1, E47, and COUP-TF through cross-talk, rather than by changing the amounts of these proteins. To investigate possible protein-protein interactions between GRα, E47, and IRF-1 further, we performed Western blot analysis after immunoprecipitating GRα and associated proteins. COS-1 cells, GRα-expressing COS-1 cells, and DEX-induced GRα-expressing COS-1 cells were first subjected to immunoprecipitation with a GRα-specific antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against E47 and IRF-1. Both E47 and IRF-1 were found to be present in GRα immunoprecipitates from DEX-induced GRα-expressing COS-1 cells (Fig. 5). With extracts of COS-1 cells and GRα-expressing COS-1 cells in the absence of DEX, no interaction was detected, indicating that interactions occur in a ligand-dependent fashion. When the same assay was carried out with nonspecific IgG instead of GR-specific antibody, no interaction was detected, confirming that there is a specific interaction between GRα and the two TFs, E47 and IRF-1. Based on these results, we conclude that GRα interacts directly with E47 and IRF-1 in COS-1 cells and that these interactions affect the DNA binding behavior of these two TFs. Because of the lack of a specific antibody against COUP-TF, we could not verify its direct interaction with GRα. To investigate the functional implications of GRα-induced DNA-binding changes of E47, COUP-TF, and IRF-1, we made use of transcription reporter assays. Reporter constructs for E47, IRF, and COUP-TF were cotransfected with GRα into COS-1 cells, and activation of the corresponding TFs was analyzed by measuring luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 6, GRα repressed the activity of COUP-TF more than 3-fold and that of E47 more than 2-fold. In addition, GRα enhanced the activity of IRF-1 by 45% in a DEX-dependent fashion. These results indicate that transactivation by E47, COUP-TF, and IRF-1 is altered as a result of changes in DNA binding activity initiated by GRα. In many cases, a cis-element may bind several TFs. To confirm the identity of proteins binding to E47, COUP-TF, and IRF-1 cis-elements, we generated siRNAs to knock down each of these TFs. In response to the siRNA, expression of E47 and IRF decreased by 80–90%, as measured by Western blot analysis, and COUP-TF decreased by 90%, as measured by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 7A). Western blot analysis of YY1, an irrelevant protein, and RT-PCR of β-actin, a housekeeping gene, did not show reduced expression of either of these two proteins, confirming that inhibition by each siRNA was specific. When the expression of IRF, E47, and COUP-TF proteins was blocked by siRNAs, luciferase activities of corresponding reporters were significantly decreased (Fig. 7B), confirming that the proteins whose binding to each cis-element was modified by GRα were indeed E47, IRF, and COUP-TF. Elucidating the mechanisms by which protein interactions regulate gene expression remains a major challenge. The glucocorticoid receptor is known to interact with a variety of TFs, thereby modulating their function and, in some cases, altering their interactions with DNA. AP-1 was the first TF shown to interact with GR (8Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 19Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Functionally, the consequence of the interaction between AP-1 and GR is the mutual repression of both AP-1 and GR-dependent transcription. Although initial studies suggested that the GR acted by decreasing AP-1 binding to DNA, later investigations did not support this model. Like AP-1, NF-κB is also repressed by GR (20Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 21Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the mutual repression between GR and NF-κB results from direct interaction between these two proteins, also without altering the DNA binding of NF-κB. Some GR-related interactions cause a noticeable change in DNA binding of specific TFs. For example, GR has been reported to interact with STAT5 to enhance STAT5-controlled gene expression. It is thought that the increased DNA binding activity of STAT5 resulting from this interaction provides a mechanism for the transcriptional synergy exhibited between STAT5 and the GR (10Wyszomierski S.L. Yeh J. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that interactions between IRF, COUP-TF, E47, and the GR all result in altered DNA binding activity. We used the protein-DNA array to profile the activity of 149 transcription factors and identified a number of TFs whose DNA binding activities were either repressed or enhanced in response to GR activation. All of the observed changes in DNA binding were shown to lead to changes in transactivation activities of these TFs. COUP-TF was first identified as a homodimer that binds to a direct repeat regulatory element in the chicken ovalbumin promoter (22Pastorcic M. Wang H. Elbrecht A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, GRα was shown to interact directly with COUP-TFII both in an in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and in an in vitro immunoprecipitation assay. This study examined functional interaction of GRα and COUP-TFII using promoters responsive to each TF (mouse mammary tumour virus and cholesteroid-7-alpha-hydroxylase gene, respectively). The results suggested that COUP-TFII represses GRα-induced transactivation by attracting the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors, whereas the GR enhanced transcriptional activity of COUP-TF (23Massimo U. De Martino N.B. Alesci S. Ichijo T. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, our study with a cis-element derived from the chicken ovalbumin promoter suggested that interaction between GRα and COUP-TF could also repress COUP-TF-induced transactivation by decreasing the protein-DNA binding activity of COUP-TF. Transcription factor E47, a product of the E2A gene, belongs to a TF family characterized by a helix-loop-helix dimerization motif (24Kadesch T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 31-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). E47 plays a pivotal role in activating B cell-specific genes (25Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), is essential to normal B-cell development, and also regulates proliferation of some non-B cells. Here, we demonstrate that GRα interacts with E47, repressing its protein-DNA binding activity. We also showed that the interaction of GRα with IRF enhanced IRF-induced transactivation by increasing IRF protein-DNA binding activity. The interferon-stimulated response element is a DNA binding sequence for the IRFs. The IRF family includes seven cellular and two viral members that exert distinct biological effects (26Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 27Taniguchi T. Harada H. Lamphier M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Among these factors, IRF-1 is the best characterized. IRF-1 acts as a transcriptional activator, is clearly involved in the control of cell growth and apoptosis, and has been proposed as a tumor suppressor. IRF plays a key role in granulocytic differentiation, and its induction by granulocytic colony-stimulating factor represents a limiting step in the early events of myeloid cell differentiation (28Coccia E.M. Stellacci E. Valtieri M. Masella B. Feccia T. Marziali G. Hiscott J. Testa U. Peschle C. Battistini A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 285-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings expand the range of potential target genes that could be regulated by the GR and provide additional evidence for a mechanism by which the GR can regulate gene expression via changes in protein-DNA binding activities of other TFs. Previously, a lack of suitable experimental methods limited discoveries of this type of interaction. The protein-DNA array provides a much needed high throughput tool for discovering novel TF interactions. This technology enabled us to reveal a novel mechanism of GRα regulation. In addition to interacting with NF-κB, AP-1, and the TFs identified in the study, GRα has been shown to interact with other TFs, including hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (29Suh D.S. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) (30Rudiger J.J. Roth M. Bihl M.P. Cornelius B.C. Johnson M. Ziesche R. Block L.H.

However, interactions between GRα and these TFs, as well as interactions with NF-κB and AP-1, were not detected in our study. These omissions could be due to these interactions without changes in protein-DNA binding or the requirement for a specific cellular environment. Nevertheless, our strategy provided an effective method for accelerating the identification of cross-talk between TFs with changes in DNA binding activity. This study identified a number of GR cross-talk partners, providing a glimpse of an additional level of regulation of gene expression, which may help to explain many regulatory actions of glucocorticoids.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this context, we further explored the contact sites between VIP and the hVPAC1 receptor by incorporating a photoactivable benzophenone group on the side chain at position 6 of VIP. This was done by substituting para-benzoyl-l-Phe (Bpa) for phenylalanine 6. This site of incorporation was selected for several reasons: (i) Phe6 is important for the biological activity of VIP (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A.

Krueckl S.L. McRory J.E. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 619-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). (ii) The substitution of Bpa for phenylalanine keeps an aromatic residue, and we expected that, even though Phe6 is important for biological activity, the [Bpa6]-VIP probe should keep reasonable affinity for the receptor. (iii) Position 6 and the previously explored position 22 (8Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) are at the two ends of the central α-helical domain of VIP (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C.

We report here that the amino acid in position 6 of VIP is in the environment of the short sequence 104-108 within the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor when the photoaffinity probe is bound to the receptor. Materials—Restriction enzymes and culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen. Eucaryotic expression vector was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). DNA Sequenase kit and radioactive reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. The site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Promega (Charbonnières, France). Synthetic oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. The human VPAC1 receptor cDNA was cloned in our laboratory (11Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E.

It has the same phenotype as the wild-type receptor with respect to VIP binding and activation of adenylyl cyclase (12Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This construct or derived mutants were stably transfected in CHO cells as described (9Nicole P. Lins L.

The CHO-F7 clone expressing the human VPAC1 construct (Bmax, 5 pmol/mg protein; Kd, 0.6 nm VIP) was used in most experiments. VIP and the photolabile VIP probe, [Ala17, para-benzoyl-l-Phe6]-VIP-28 referred to as [Bpa6]-VIP were obtained by custom synthesis from Neo-system (Strasbourg, France). 125I-VIP, 125I-[Bpa6-VIP], and 125I-cAMP were prepared and purified in our laboratory as previously described (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Development of a new hVPAC1 receptor mutant that incorporated an additional site for CNBr cleavage in a key position was necessary for the current work consisting of substitution of methionine for Phe93. Five other mutants were also constructed in which residues within the 104-108 receptor sequence were individually replaced by alanine. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (4Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Identification of the desired mutations was obtained by direct sequencing of the mutated region (4Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mutants were stably transfected in CHO cells as described (4Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C.

Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation—The CHO-F7 cells expressing the wild-type VPAC1 receptor construct and CHO cells expressing stably transfected receptor mutant were utilized as sources of receptor for this study and were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were grown to confluency. After removing the culture medium, the attached cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with a rubber policeman and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g. The cell pellet was exposed for 30 min at 4 °C to hypoosmotic 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and the membranes were obtained as described (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C until use. The protein content was measured by the procedure of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Ligand Binding and Adenylyl Cyclase Activity Assays—These assays were used for characterization of the newly synthesized photolabile probe [Bpa6]-VIP. The ligand binding assay was as described (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes (100 μg of proteins/ml) derived from transfected CHO cells were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 0.05 nm125I-VIP in the presence of increasing concentrations of VIP or [Bpa6]-VIP, in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped by transferring the incubation medium to an excess of ice-cold buffer. Bound and free peptides were separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), and the membrane pellets were washed two times with 10% (w/v) sucrose in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES. The radioactivity was then assayed in a γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of 125I-VIP bound in the absence (total binding) and the presence (nonspecific binding) of 1 μm unlabeled VIP. The concentration of peptides that elicited half-maximal inhibition of specific 125I-VIP binding (Ki) was determined by computer analysis. Adenylyl cyclase activity in cell membranes was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of VIP or [Bpa6]VIP as described (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Dose-response curves were fitted, and the concentrations of peptides giving half-maximal responses (EC50) were calculated using the Prism software suite (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Receptor Photoaffinity Labeling—Transfected cells were incubated in darkness with 10 nm125I-[Bpa6-VIP] in 10 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% (w/v) ovalbumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of 20 mm HEPES with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 mm tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. 1 ml of labeled cells were then added to each well of a six-well tissue culture plate. This was photolyzed (λ = 365 nm) on ice at a distance of ∼2 cm. After 40 min of UV exposure, the cells were collected into individual 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, washed two times with 10 mm HEPES containing 25 mm glycine, 75 mm NaCl buffer, pH 2.5, and washed one time with 20 mm HEPES. The photolabeled receptors were then analyzed directly by electrophoresis or after chemical or enzymatic cleavage. Chemical Cleavage of Photoaffinity-labeled VPAC1 Receptor Constructs—The photolabeled receptors in cells were incubated overnight in darkness with 10 mg/ml CNBr in 80% formic acid at room temperature. The CNBr present in the reaction mixture was then removed by Waters C18 Sep-Pak purification. After extensive washing of the Sep-Pak cartridge with 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CNBr-generated peptide fragments were eluted with 2 ml of 100% acetonitrile. The fractions were counted for radioactivity and evaporated under vacuum (Speed-Vac). The resulting material was either analyzed directly by electrophoresis or after enzymatic treatments (see below). After migration, labeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. For further enzymatic treatments the bands were cut out, electroeluted (model 422 electroeluter; Bio-Rad), and lyophilized. Enzymatic Treatments—For protein deglycosylation, the material obtained after CNBr treatment was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with PNGase F (3 units/ml) as described (14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Endopeptidase Glu-C digestion of proteins in this material was obtained by incubation for 6 h at 25 °C in 25 mm ammonium carbonate, 0.01% SDS, 5% acetonitrile, pH 7.8, as described (15Sorensen S.B. Sorensen T.L. Breddam K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Trypsin cleavage of proteins was performed for 2 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. Electrophoresis and Autoradiography—Products of cleavage were resolved on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel using MES SDS running buffer system from Invitrogen performed according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 3-10 days with intensifying screens at -80 °C as described (14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular masses of radiolabeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of the protein molecular weight markers colored with Rainbow™ from Amersham Biosciences or protein ladder prestained with Benchmark™ from Invitrogen versus the log values of their masses. In this study, the synthetic [Bpa6]-VIP photoaffinity probe that incorporated the photolabile residue para-benzoyl-l-Phe to replace Phe6 of VIP was first evaluated for its ability to interact specifically with the human VPAC1 receptor stably expressed in CHO-F7 cells. [Bpa6]-VIP has an efficacy similar to that of native VIP in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity but a lower potency with EC50 values of 1.10 and 0.05 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). In the binding assay, [Bpa6]-VIP was also less potent than native VIP in inhibiting 125I-VIP binding with Ki values of 36 and 0.6 nm, respectively. These data indicate that the [Bpa6]-VIP probe is a low potency VPAC1 receptor agonist which is instrumental for photoaffinity labeling of the receptor because its affinity is not too much decreased. The fact that the addition of a para-benzoyl group on Phe6 of VIP results in a decrease of affinity for VIP receptor is in agreement with the important role of Phe6 in VIP activity as previously demonstrated by alanine scanning of the neuropeptide (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As stated under “Materials,” the photoaffinity probe is actually Ala17 in addition to Bpa6. The replacement of Met17 by Ala was employed to simplify subsequent analysis following CNBr cleavage (see below) and was previously shown to keep intact the binding affinity for the hVPAC1 receptor (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After incubation of CHO-F7 cells with the radioiodinated 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] probe, labeled cells were exposed to UV to create a covalent bond between the probe and the receptor. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins revealed the existence of a single labeled band that completely disappeared when an excess of cold VIP was co-incubated with the radioiodinated probe (Fig. 2). This band migrated at a molecular mass of 95 kDa (Fig. 2) in good agreement with the expected mass (92 kDa) considering the previously characterized (14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) mass of the glycosylated VPAC1 receptor (64 kDa), the presence of the green fluorescent protein (25 kDa) at C terminus of the receptor, and the covalently attached [Bpa6]-VIP (3 kDa) in the complex. The 95-kDa labeled band shifted to a 70-kDa band after deglycosylation with PNGase F (Fig. 2) in consonance with the presence of the 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety on each of the three consensus N-glycosylation sites in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the hVPAC1 receptor (14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data indicated that the 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] photoaffinity probe was able to efficiently and specifically label the human VPAC1 receptor. We proceeded with our study with the identification of the VPAC1 receptor domain to which 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] is covalently attached. For that purpose the 95-kDa band corresponding to 125I-[Bpa6-VIP]·hVPAC1R complex was subjected to a series of chemical and enzymatic cleavages. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the 95-kDa band generated a single 30-kDa labeled band (Fig. 3). This band was further shifted to 11 kDa after treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 3), indicating that it is heavily glycosylated, most probably at two consensus N-glycosylation sites. Considering the molecular mass of the attached probe (3 kDa) and the probable presence of the 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety on each of the N-glycosylation sites (14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the best candidate corresponding to the covalent attachment of 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] is represented by the Trp67-Met137 glycosylated receptor fragment (Table I) present in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the VPAC1 receptor. This fragment contains two N-glycosylation sites on Asn69 and Asn100 (Table I). To further validate the Trp67-Met137 receptor fragment as the region of interaction with the 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] probe, we created a new CNBr cleavage site by substituting a methionine for Phe93 by site-directed mutagenesis. This site was chosen because it stands between the two N-glycosylation sites on Asn69 or Asn100. The mutant F93M was constructed and stably expressed in CHO cells. It bound VIP with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4). The Kd for VIP was 1.5 and 0.6 nm for the F93M mutant and wild-type receptor, respectively. After incubation of the F93M mutant with 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] and CNBr treatment of proteins, a 18-kDa labeled band was observed instead of a 30-kDa band for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5). The 12-kDa mass difference observed between the wild-type receptor and mutant cannot be simply accounted for by the shortening of the peptide fragment e.g. 2.6 kDa for the 67-93 sequence or 4.3 kDa for the 94-137 sequence. It is consistent the removal of the 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety known to be linked to Asn69 and Asn100 (Ref. 14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5, the deglycosylation of the 18-kDa labeled band with PNGase F generated a fragment migrating at an approximate molecular mass of 9 kDa, corresponding to the removal of a single carbohydrate moiety. Although these experiments clearly confirmed that the 67-137 receptor fragment was the site of covalent binding of the 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] probe, alone they did not allow to determine which one of the 67-93 or 94-137 fragment was labeled in the F93M receptor mutant. To discriminate between the two fragments, the 18-kDa labeled band (see above) was electroeluted and incubated with trypsin. After trypsin treatment, the labeled material migrated as a narrow 4-kDa band (Fig. 5). Considering that the 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] probe itself is cleaved by trypsin (Table II), generating the 1.4 kDa 1-12 VIP fragment bearing both the para-benzoyl-l-Phe6 and the 125I-Tyr10, the only receptor fragment compatible with the labeling of a 4-kDa band is fragment 104-127 (Table I), whose theoretical mass is 2.6 kDa. Indeed, the mass of this fragment (2.6 kDa) plus the mass of the cleaved probe (1.4 kDa) corresponds to the 4-kDa estimated for the labeled band after trypsin cleavage (Fig. 5). All of the other receptor fragments generated by trypsin cleavage (Table I) are much too small to be compatible with the experimental data.Table I125I-[Bpa6-VIP]-labeled hVPAC1 receptor fragment generated by CNBr cleavageView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Competitive inhibition of 125I-VIP binding by VIP in membranes from CHO cells stably with wild-type receptor or F93M hVPAC1 receptor mutant.

Open table in a new tab To further delineate the site of covalent binding of the affinity probe, the 30-kDa CNBr-generated fragments (Fig. 3) obtained after photoaffinity labeling of the wild-type receptor was digested with endopeptidase Glu-C (Fig. 3), which under our experimental conditions cleaves proteins at the C-terminal side of Glu residues with the notable exception of the Glu-Pro sequence (15Sorensen S.B. Sorensen T.L. Breddam K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Endopeptidase Glu-C treatment of the 30-kDa band generated a 25-kDa band representing the receptor segment 67-108 that contains two N-glycosylation sites on Asn69 and Asn100 (Table I). Accordingly, this band was further shifted to 8 kDa upon treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 3). These data were thus consistent with the covalent binding of the 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] probe to the Trp67-Glu108 glycosylated receptor fragment (Table I). Then trypsin, which cleaves at the C-terminal side of Lys and Arg residues, was used to further narrow the domain of covalent binding of the [Bpa6]-VIP probe. As shown in Fig. 3, trypsin digestion of the 30-kDa band resulted in a nonglycosylated fragment migrating at 4 kDa. The mass of trypsin-generated product strongly supported the possibility that the Ser104-Lys127 fragment is actually the site of attachment of [Bpa6]-VIP (Table I) as demonstrated above with the F93M receptor mutant (Fig. 5). Finally, the CNBr-generated 30-kDa band was sequentially digested with PNGase F, endopeptidase Glu-C, and trypsin. This sequential treatment generated a 2-kDa labeled band. This fragment was compatible with the covalent attachment of the probe to the Ser104-Glu108 sequence of the hVPAC1 receptor. Indeed, its mass of 2 kDa was very similar to the mass of the receptor fragment (0.55 kDa) plus the mass of the trypsin-cleaved probe (1.4 kDa; see above and Table II). Our data show that there is a spatial approximation between Phe6 of VIP and the 104-108 sequence within the N-terminal ectodomain of the human VPAC1 receptor. In a previous complete alanine scanning of VIP (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the residues comprising VIP have been characterized into one of three different categories. Phe6 was placed in category 2, which is defined as residues whose substitution into alanine is associated with a significant decrease of the binding affinity and biological potency of the corresponding analog as well as a change of the predicted structure as compared with native VIP (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Consequently, we speculated that the decreased affinity of the F6A VIP mutant was due to its altered structure, although the possible direct involvement of the category 2 residues, including Phe6, in VIP binding to receptor cannot be ruled out. In this context, we tried to identify the individual residue, or residues, in the short 104-108 receptor fragment that may interact with residue 6 of VIP by individually mutating to alanine the five amino acids of the fragment. As shown in Table III, all of the mutants but C105A bound VIP with the same affinity as the wild-type receptor. In sharp contrast, no binding could be detected with the C105A mutant in consonance with previous data showing that this mutant, although it is normally expressed by transfected cells, neither bind 125I-[VIP] (17Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) nor generate cAMP in response to VIP challenge. 3Y.-V. Tan, A. Couvineau, and M. Laburthe, unpublished data. From this data, we can suggest that Cys105 in the receptor is a candidate for interacting with Phe6 in VIP. However, we should be careful with this conclusion because Cys105 is one of the six cysteine residues that are strictly conserved in the N-terminal ectodomain of all class II G protein-coupled receptors and are involved in the formation of disulfide bridges that are crucial for receptor affinity (3Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In consonance with our data, the C105A mutant failed to be labeled by the photoaffinity 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] probe (not shown).Table IIIBinding parameters of hVPAC1 receptor mutantsReceptor constructsKdaKd and Bmax were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”.BmaxaKd and Bmax were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”.nmpmollmg of proteinsWild type0.41 ± 0.034.41 ± 0.79S104A0.34 ± 0.046.36 ± 0.02C105ANDbND, not detectedNDT106A0.42 ± 0.053.37 ± 0.92D107A0.45 ± 0.094.78 ± 0.80E108A0.32 ± 0.051.60 ± 0.04a Kd and Bmax were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”.b ND, not detected Open table in a new tab The present data identified the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor as the contact region between receptor and the side chain at position 6 of VIP.

It is quite interesting to note that this large segment revealed by mutagenesis studies encompasses the short Ser104-Glu108 sequence of the receptor shown here by photoaffinity labeling to be the contact region of the side chain at position 6 of VIP. We previously developed a structural model of the N-terminal ectodomain of the VPAC1 receptor by sequence homology with a yeast lipase (7Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J.

This model showed that residues that are important for VIP binding, as demonstrated by mutagenesis, are gathered around an electronegative groove with an out-spanning shell of three tryptophan residues at one end (7Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

In this context, the fact that the present study demonstrated that 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] covalently attached to the Ser104-Glu108 segment of the hVPAC1 receptor is most interesting. Indeed, this segment is located on one edge of the putative binding groove (Fig. 6). Another most meaningful aspect of the present study is related to the fact that the contact segment Ser104-Glu108 of the side chain at position 6 of VIP is adjacent to the contact segment 109-120 of the side chain at position 22 of VIP as previously demonstrated by using the 125I-[Bpa22-VIP] probe (8Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig. 6, which highlights the position of the two contact segments and also tentatively positions VIP in the binding groove taking into account the previous modelization (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) studies of the peptide, which supported the idea that VIP has a central α-helix with a kink and less structured C- and N-terminal ends. Our data (present paper and Ref. 8Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) are consistent with a model in which the central part of VIP, at least between Phe6 and Tyr22, lies in the binding groove identified in the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor (Fig. 6). This model is also consistent with the idea that crucial basic residues present in the central part of VIP including Arg14, Lys15, and Lys21 (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C.

Development of new photoaffinity probes with Bpa substitutions at other positions between Phe6 and Tyr22 of VIP should be done to further strengthen this model. The previous evidence for diffuse pharmacophoric domains of VIP that extend along the whole 28-amino acid peptide chain (9Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A.

This is more especially relevant for the VIP N-terminal domain, which, based on indirect evidence, is thought to interact with a still poorly characterized binding site on the core of the receptor (3Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Solano R.M. Langer I. Perret J. Vertongen P. Juarranz M.G. Robberect P. Waelbroeck M. J.

The hypothesis that the VIP-binding cleft could reside between the hVPAC1 receptor N-terminal ectodomain for the central part of VIP (this paper and Ref. 8Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the receptor body for the N-terminal domain of VIP is reminiscent of the situation described for some other class II peptide receptors (22Dong M.

Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results of the photoaffinity labeling study of the hVPAC1 receptor with the 125I-[Bpa6-VIP] probe provide a narrow 104-108 contact region, possibly Cys105, between the receptor N-terminal ectodomain and the side chain at position 6 of VIP. Together with a previous photoaffinity labeling study (8Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Van Rampelbergh J. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36531-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), these data indicate that the central part of VIP lies in a binding groove within the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor. Additional studies with new photoaffinity probes of VIP are needed to further delineate the sites of interaction between the central part of VIP and this binding groove for which a structural model has been already developed (3Laburthe M.

However, the mechanism whereby MPP+ inhibits cell proliferation is still unclear. In this study, we found that MPP+ suppressed the proliferation with accumulation in G1 phase without inducing cell death in p53-deficient MG63 osteosarcoma cells. MPP+ induced hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and rapidly down-regulated the protein but not mRNA levels of cyclin D1 in MG63 cells.

The cyclin D1 down-regulation by MPP+ was also observed in p53-positive PC12, HeLa S3, and HeLa ρ0 cells, which are a subclone of HeLa S3 lacking mitochondrial DNA. Moreover, MPP+ dephosphorylated Akt in PC12 cells, which was rescued by the pretreatment with nerve growth factor. In addition, the pretreatment with nerve growth factor or lithium chloride, a glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor, suppressed the cyclin D1 down-regulation caused by MPP+.

However, the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation by MPP+ have rarely been examined. Progression and transition in the cell cycle of mammalian cells are governed by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) whose activities are regulated by the binding of their regulatory subunits (called cyclins) or Cdk inhibitors (14Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). p21 effectively inhibits Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, and Cdk6, which have a direct role in the G1/S transition, but it is a poor inhibitor of other known Cdks (15Harper J.W.

Cyclin D1 regulates G1 arrest and the phosphorylation status of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Cyclin D1 degradation is mediated by phosphorylation-triggered, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (20Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 proteolysis is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), which is inactivated by a pathway that sequentially involves Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt (22Desbois-Mouthon C.

The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms whereby MPP+ inhibits cell proliferation. We show here that MPP+ initiates an efficient p53-independent G1 arrest by the degradation of cyclin D1. Reagents and Cells—MPP+ and MG132 were purchased from Sigma and Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Anti-cyclin D1 mouse monoclonal, anti-Rb mouse monoclonal, and anti-p21 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego). Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). MG63 and HeLa S3 were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum and 5% FCS antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Establishment of HeLa ρ0 Cells—As described by King and Attardi (23King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), HeLa S3 cells were maintained in αEU medium (αMEM (Invitrogen) + 4 g/liter glucose + 50 ng/ml ethidium bromide (EtBr) + 0.1 g/liter uridine)+ 10% FCS for half a year. More than 100 colonies were isolated in αGU medium (αEU minus ethidium bromide) + 10% FCS, of which the clone 9A (HeLa ρ0) cell strain was selected by reason of its good growing potential and used in this study. Confirmation of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)—The presence or absence of the mitochondrial genome was confirmed in HeLa S3 and HeLa ρ0 cells with PCR using nine primer sets (24Tallini G. Ladanyi M. Rosai J. Jhanwar S.C. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which covered the whole mitochondrial genome. No amplification was shown with HeLa ρ0 DNA as template. Irregularly (once every 2-3 months), the absence of mtDNA in HeLa ρ0 cells was confirmed using two primer sets. The sense primer is located at nucleotides 3108-3127 and the antisense primer at 3318-3301 of the published human mtDNA sequence (25Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7641) Google Scholar). The product length was 211. Fragments of nuclear DNA were amplified with primers at nucleotides 1437-1456 (GGCCATTGCAGAATTATTGC) and at 1530-1511 (AGCCATTCCAGCATATCGTC) in the APC gene (the product length was 94 bp). The PCR mixture contained four primers (0.5 μm each), 150 μm dNTPs, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01% gelatin in a final volume of 10 μl. 10 ng of genomic DNA was submitted to PCR amplification (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles) using 0.25 unit of Taq polymerase (Takara, Tokyo). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and then lysed with a solubilizing solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation. Cell lysates were kept at 95 °C for 5 min and then separated by 12% (for cyclin D1 and p21), 10% (for Akt and GSK-3β), or 8% (for Rb) SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). The membrane was treated with 10% (w/v) skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with primary antibodies followed by peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The epitope was visualized with an ECL Western blot detection kit (American Biosciences). Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—After the fixation with ethanol, the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Calbiochem) and analyzed by flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) using CELLQUEST software. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (26Maruyama T. Kitaoka Y. Sachi Y. Nakanoin K. Hirota K. Shiozawa T. Yoshimura Y. Fujii S. Yodoi J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed, and transferred to maximum strength Nytran nylon (Schleicher & Schüll) with a Turbo-Blotter system (Schleicher & Schüll). The filter was hybridized with human cyclin D1 cDNA probe. MPP+Suppresses the Cell Growth of p53-deficient MG63 Cells—A previous study showed that dopamine neurons from p53 knock-out mice are resistant to MPTP neurotoxicity (27Trimmer P.A. Smith T.S. Jung A.B. Bennett Jr., J.P. Neurodegeneration. 1996; 5: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that MPP+-induced apoptosis is at least partly mediated by p53 (28Duan W. Zhu X. Ladenheim B. Yu Q.S. Guo Z. Oyler J. Cutler R.G. Cadet J.L. Greig N.H. Mattson M.P. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To dissect the p53-independent effect of MPP+, we first examined whether MPP+ suppresses the growth of p53-deficient MG63 osteosarcoma cells. As shown in Fig. 1, MPP+ dose-dependently suppressed the cell proliferation. Under this condition no appreciable cell death occurred by the trypan blue exclusion test, which was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase release assay (data not shown). Thus, MPP+ inhibited the proliferation of MG63 cells without inducing cell death. MPP+Induces G1Arrest in MG63 Cells—To examine the mechanism whereby MPP+ inhibits cell proliferation, the cell cycle was analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The MG63 cells were incubated in DMEM with 0.5% FCS for 48 h to synchronize cells in G0/G1 (Fig. 2A). Then, these cells were incubated in 10% FCS-supplemented medium in the absence or presence of 2 mm MPP+ for 16 h. The cell cycle analysis showed that MPP+ treatment induced accumulation in G1 phase (Fig. 2C), whereas the control treatment markedly increased the population in S phase (Fig. 2B). We next investigated whether the MPP+-induced G1 arrest was accompanied by changes of Rb phosphorylation status (29Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5733-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As expected, hypophosphorylated form of Rb increased after MPP+ treatment (Fig. 3A). However, MPP+ did not increase the p21 protein level in p53-deficient MG63 cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that MPP+ induces p53, p21-independent G1 arrest in MG63 cells. MPP+Down-regulates Cyclin D1 in a Post-transcriptional Mechanism—Cyclins are essential components of cell cycle machinery. During progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, two major types of cyclins are required: D-type cyclins and cyclin E. Progression through G1 depends initially on cyclin D-CDK4/6 protein complexes and later on cyclin E-CDK2. D-type cyclins play a crucial role in the progression through the cell cycle (30Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar), and the down-regulation of cyclin D1 plays an important role in the cell cycle arrest. Therefore, we focused on the change of cyclin D1 expression levels after MPP+ treatment. Although MPP+ suppressed the protein expression of cyclin D1 in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners (Fig. 4, A and B), MPP+ did not decrease the mRNA levels of cyclin D1 (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the decrease of cyclin D1 levels is regulated by the post-transcriptional mechanism. Furthermore, MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, suppressed the MPP+-induced decrease in the cyclin D1 protein level (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that MPP+-induced down-regulation of cyclin D1 is mediated by the proteasome-dependent signal pathway. MPP+Induces Cyclin D1 Down-regulation Even in Cells Lacking mtDNA—Next, we analyzed the effect of MPP+ on the level of cyclin D1 in a p53-positive neuronal cell line, PC12, and HeLa ρ0 cells lacking mtDNA. MPP+ down-regulated cyclin D1 in PC12, HeLa S3, and HeLa ρ0 cells (Fig. 5, A-C). These results indicate that MPP+ down-regulates cyclin D1 level in various cells and that its effect is independent of the p53 status or mitochondrial function in target cells. PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β Pathway Regulates MPP+-mediated Cyclin D1 Proteolysis—Ubiquitin-proteaseome-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 requires phosphorylation of the protein by GSK-3β, which is phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt (20Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β pathway is involved in MPP+-induced degradation of cyclin D1. Using PC12 cells, we demonstrated that MPP+ dephosphorylated Akt and that the pretreatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) rescued the dephosphorylation (Fig. 6A). The phosphorylation of GSK-3β was augmented by the combined treatment with NGF and MPP+ (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, pretreatment with NGF or lithium chloride (LiCl), an inhibitor of GSK-3β in cells (31Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar, 33.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) suppressed the MPP+-induced degradation of cyclin D1. It was also confirmed in MG63 cells that LiCl but not KCl inhibited the cyclin D1 degradation caused by MPP+ (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that MPP+ induces the degradation of cyclin D1 through the PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β pathway. In the present study, we showed that MPP+ inhibits cell proliferation with accumulation in G1 phase and hypophosphorylation of Rb in p53-deficient MG63 cells (Figs. 2C and 3A). In general, G1 cell cycle arrest is induced by p53-dependent or p53-independent accumulation of p21, which inhibits cyclin-E/CDK2 activity and the G1/S transition (34Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar, 35Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that p53 is not associated with MPP+-induced growth inhibition. Although it has been reported that MPP+ inhibits the proliferation of PC12 cells by a p21-dependent pathway (6Soldner F. Weller M. Haid S. Beinroth S. Miller S.W. Wullner U. Davis R.E. Dichgans J. Klockgether T. Schulz J.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), MPP+ did not increase p21 protein levels in MG63 cells (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that MPP+ can inhibit cell proliferation independently of p53 or p21. Cyclin proteolysis is essential for cell cycle progression (36Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cyclin D1 expression either by antisense methodology or antibody microinjection lengthens the duration of the G1 phase and suppresses cell proliferation (37Liu J.J. Chao J.R. Jiang M.C. Ng S.Y. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 38Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633PubMed Google Scholar). Although cyclin D1 protein levels were rapidly down-regulated by MPP+ within 4 h (Fig. 4B), the mRNA level of cyclin D1 did not decrease (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the down-regulation of cyclin D1 is regulated by the post-transcriptional mechanism. We showed that the MPP+-induced decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels was suppressed by proteasome inhibitors, MG132 (Fig. 4D) or N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal (LLnL) (data not shown). These data suggest that MPP+ down-regulates cyclin D1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (20Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). MPP+ inhibits NADH dehydrogenase activity in mitochondrial complex I (8Nicklas W.J. Vyas I. Heikkila R.E. Life Sci. 1985; 36: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 9Ramsay R.R. Salach J.I. Dadgar J. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1986; 134: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated that MPP+ down-regulated cyclin D1 in HeLa and HeLa ρ0 cells (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that the down-regulation of cyclin D1 is not associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by MPP+ and that MPP+ has an extramitochondrial molecular target. GSK-3β was reported to regulate cyclin D1 proteolysis (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). We showed that a GSK-3β-specific inhibitor, LiCl, suppressed the MPP+-induced down-regulation of cyclin D1 protein levels (Fig. 6, B and C), suggesting the involvement of the GSK-3β pathway in the down-regulation of cyclin D1. Akt inactivates GSK-3β through site-specific phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of cyclin D1 turnover (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that MPP+ dephosphorylated Akt in PC12 cells and that the down-regulation of cyclin D1 was suppressed by NGF, a well-known activator of the PI3K-Akt pathway or by an inhibitor of GSK-3β, LiCl (Fig. 6, A and B). The results indicate that MPP+ induces cyclin D1 degradation in various cell lines through decreased Akt activity and concomitant GSK-3β activation. MPTP is a causative agent for the Parkinson's disease model (1Langston J.W. Irwin I. Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1986; 9: 485-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Bloem B.R. Irwin I. Buruma O.J. Haan J. Roos R.A. Tetrud J.W. Langston J.W. J. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 97: 273-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because MPP+ is an active metabolite of MPTP (3Tipton K.F. Singer T.P. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1191-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of MPP+in vitro. Recently GSK-3β signaling has been implicated in neurodegeneration and apoptosis (39Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that MPP+-induced G1 arrest results from the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 through the ubiquitin-proteasomeand PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β-dependent pathway, which indicates a possible new mechanism of MPP+-induced neurotoxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2108064395,"The expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors is regulated by cytokine and growth factor signaling. To examine how signal transduction controls the gene expression program required for progenitor expansion, we screened ATLAS filters with polysome-associated mRNA derived from erythroid progenitors stimulated with erythropoietin and/or stem cell factor. The putative proto-oncogene nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (ndpk-B or nm23-M2) was identified as an erythropoietin and stem cell factor target gene. Factor-induced expression of nm23-M2 was regulated specifically at the level of polysome association by a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Identification of the transcription initiation site revealed that nm23-M2 mRNA starts with a terminal oligopyrimidine sequence, which is known to render mRNA translation dependent on mitogenic factors. Recently, the nm23-M2 locus was identified as a common leukemia retrovirus integration site, suggesting that it plays a role in leukemia development. The expression of Nm23 from a retroviral vector in the absence of its 5′-untranslated region caused constitutive polysome association of nm23-M2. Polysome-association and protein expression of endogenous nm23-M2 declined during differentiation of erythroid progenitors, suggesting a role for Nm23-M2 in progenitor expansion. Taken together, nm23-m2 exemplifies that cytokine-dependent control of translation initiation is an important mechanism of gene expression regulation.

Taken together, nm23-m2 exemplifies that cytokine-dependent control of translation initiation is an important mechanism of gene expression regulation. The expansion, survival, and differentiation of hemopoietic progenitors is largely controlled by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones. Human and murine erythroid progenitors can be expanded in vitro in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo), 1The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; Dex, dexamethasone; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP, eIF-4E-binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin A; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; SCF, stem cell factor; TOP, terminal oligopyrimidine; UTR, untranslated region. stem cell factor (SCF), and dexamethasone (Dex). In the absence of SCF and Dex, the same cells undergo Epo-dependent terminal differentiation into enucleated erythrocytes (1von Lindern M. Deiner E.M. Dolznig H. Parren-Van Amelsvoort M. Hayman M.J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The in vitro expansion of erythroid progenitors most likely reflects stress erythropoiesis induced by hypoxia, because glucocorticoids and SCF are dispensable for adult erythropoiesis, whereas both factors are required for spleen erythropoiesis in anemic mice (3Broudy V.C. Lin N.L. Priestley G.V. Nocka K. Wolf N.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 75-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bauer A. Tronche F. Wessely O. Kellendonk C. Reichardt H.M. Steinlein P. Schutz G. Beug H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2996-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The ability of normal cells to be expanded under stress conditions is exploited by genetic alterations in leukemia. For instance, the v-ErbB oncogene, encoded by the avian erythroleukemia virus, appears to mimic the synergistic effect of the Epo plus SCF-induced signal transduction required for renewal divisions (1von Lindern M. Deiner E.M. Dolznig H. Parren-Van Amelsvoort M. Hayman M.J. Mullner E.W. Beug H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3651-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To examine mechanisms that control the expansion of committed erythroid progenitors, we screened cDNA arrays using cDNA derived from growth factor-stimulated (Epo, SCF, or both) versus growth factor-deprived erythroid progenitors. To identify genes that are differentially regulated either at the transcriptional or the translational level, cDNA prepared from polysome-bound mRNA was used. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the nm23-M2 gene is specifically regulated by the signal-controlled polysome association of its constitutively expressed mRNA. In a recent screen for retroviral integration sites, 9% of the samples in a panel of primary retrovirally induced leukemias harbored integrations in the nm23-M2 gene (5Joosten M. Vankan-Berkhoudt Y.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7247-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that nm23-M2 may be a proto-oncogene. Nm23-M2 or nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B and its human homologue NM23-H2 are members of a gene family that converts G protein-bound GDP to GTP (6Ohtsuki K. Yokoyama M. Uesaka H. Biochim. Biophys.

NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 are described as differentiation inhibitory factors, a function independent of their nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity (9Okabe-Kado J. Kasukabe T. Hozumi M. Honma Y. Kimura N. Baba H. Urano T. Shiku H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enhanced expression of NM23-H1 is associated with hematopoietic malignancies in man (10Niitsu N. Honma Y. Iijima K. Takagi T. Higashihara M. Sawada U. Okabe-Kado J. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Niitsu N. Okamoto M. Honma Y. Nakamine H. Tamaru J.I. Nakamura S. Yoshino T. Higashihara M. Hirano M. Okabe-Kado J.

How NM23 proteins exert their leukemic function is unknown, although numerous functions and interactions have been described (12Salerno M. Ouatas T. Palmieri D. Steeg P.S. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2003; 20: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NM23-H1 has been shown to negatively correlate with tumor metastasis (13Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P.

Beresford P.J. Oh D.Y. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Cell. 2003; 112: 659-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Nm23-M2 possesses a DNA binding domain by means of which it is able to regulate c-Myc expression (17Postel E.H. Mango S.E. Flint S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Here, we report that nm23-M2 mRNA expression is constitutively high in erythroid progenitors but that its translation is strictly dependent on Epo- and SCF-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Cloning of the full 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of nm23-M2 revealed that it contains both a terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) sequence and an inverted repeat. Deletion of this 5′-UTR caused PI3K-independent, constitutive mRNA translation. Cells—I/11 cells were cultured in StemPro medium (Invitrogen) as described (1von Lindern M. Deiner E.M. Dolznig H. Parren-Van Amelsvoort M. Hayman M.J. Mullner E.W. Beug H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3651-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For expansion, the medium was supplemented with 0.5 units/ml Epo (a kind gift of Ortho-Biotech, Tilburg, The Netherlands), 100 ng/ml SCF, and 10–6m Dex (Sigma-Aldrich); for differentiation, the medium was supplemented with 10 units/ml Epo, 10 ng/ml insulin, and 0.5 mg/ml iron-loaded transferrin (Intergene). To analyze cellular signaling mechanisms, cells were washed twice with Hepes-buffered balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and reseeded in Iscove's medium (Invitrogen) without any additives. Factor stimulation was with 5 units/ml Epo and 200 ng/ml SCF. Hemoglobin accumulation was measured as described (18Bakker W.J. Blazquez-Domingo M. Kolbus A. Besooyen J. Steinlein P. Beug H. Coffer P.J. Lowenberg B. Von Lindern M. Van Dijk T.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Isolation of total RNA and Northern blot analyses was performed as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (20Wessely O. Deiner E.M. Beug H. von Lindern M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Isolation of polysomal RNA by sucrose gradient fractionation was performed essentially as described (21Mullner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Lekovits I. Manual of Immunological Methods. 1. Academic Press, London1997: 457-462Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by lysis at 4 °C in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 units/ml RNasin), and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was supplemented with 665 μg/ml heparin and centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) to eliminate mitochondria. The supernatant was layered on a 10-ml (ATLAS hybridization and Northern blots) or 4-ml (TaqMan analysis) linear sucrose gradient (15–40% sucrose (w/v) supplemented with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 0.5 mg/ml heparin) and centrifuged in a SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman) at 38,000 rpm for 120 min at 4 °C or in a SW50 Ti rotor at 42,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C without brake. Fractions (550 μl) were collected and digested with 100 μg of proteinase K in 1% SDS and 10 mm EDTA (30 min at 37 °C). RNAs were recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. RNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gels and subsequent Northern blotting (using Hybond-N+ membranes; Amersham Biosciences). These gels indicated that fractions 1–11 (10-ml gradient) and 1–4 (4-ml gradient) contain nonpolysomal and subpolysomal mRNA, whereas fractions 13–20 (10-ml gradient) and 5–8 (4-ml gradient) consisted of polysome-bound RNA. The latter fractions were pooled for array hybridization and TaqMan analysis, respectively. As probes we used a 612-bp nm23-M2 cDNA fragment or cDNAs containing the entire open reading frame of pim1 or c-jun. After hybridization, filters were scanned on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and signals were quantified by phosphorimaging. Poly(A)+mRNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—RNA was quantified by UV absorbance. Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified from isolated total RNA (25–30 μg) with the Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Equivalent amounts of poly(A)+ RNA (1–2 μg) were reverse transcribed into cDNA using 2-μl cDNA synthesis primers provided by the ATLAS kit. RNA was denatured (for 7 min at 65 °C and 7 min at 4 °C), 10 units of RNasin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm (each) nucleotides, and the buffer supplied with the enzyme plus 100 units of SSII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen.) were added, and the reaction was put at 42 °C for 1.5 h. Subsequently, RNA was degraded in 0.3 m NaOH at 65 °C for 1 h, which was stopped by adding Tris, pH 7.5, to 20 mm and HCl to neutralize the NaOH. cDNA was precipitated in the presence of glycogen (Roche Applied Science) and dissolved in 15 μl of H2O. 1 μl of this dissolved cDNA was used in a random primed labeling reaction (Roche Applied Science) using [α-32P]dATP. After removal of free nucleotides, the 32P incorporation was measured in a Cherenkov counter, and the same amount of counts was used in hybridizations of a single experiment (2Dolznig H. Boulme F.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Microarray Hybridization—Hybridization of Atlas cDNA arrays (588 mouse cDNA probes; Clontech) was performed basically as recommended by the manufacturer with the modifications described below. Filters were prehybridized for 8 h at 68 °C in 10 ml of prewarmed ExpressHyb plus denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, both provided by the kit. Subsequently, 6 × 107 dpm of denatured radioactive cDNA (kept for 5 min at 95 °C without denaturing solution and thereafter chilled on ice) were added and hybridized for 20 h. Filters were washed three times at 68 °C in 200 ml of 2× SSC 1% SDS for 40 min. Thereafter, the filters were washed again three times in 0.2× SSC 0.5% SDS for 20 min and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blotting—I/11 cells were factor-deprived and stimulated as described above. Samples were taken at regular intervals and processed as described previously (18Bakker W.J. Blazquez-Domingo M. Kolbus A. Besooyen J. Steinlein P. Beug H. Coffer P.J. Lowenberg B. Von Lindern M. Van Dijk T.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Following separation of proteins on 10% polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting, filters were incubated with antibodies against Nm23-M2 (Seikagaku, Falmouth, MA), phosphoserine 473-PKB and total PKB (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by an enhanced chemoluminescence reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Isolation and Cloning of the 5′-Untranslated Region of nm23-M2—A nested PCR was performed on an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library of primary erythroblasts (a gift from Walbert Bakker, Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The library was ligated into the lambda ZAP express vector (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The first PCR (45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 25 cycles) was performed using the M13 reverse primer (5′-ACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCTTG-3′) in the vector in combination with pN6 (5′-TCGCCCACCAGGCCGCGC-3′) in nm23-M2 on 50 ng of cDNA. 1 μl of PCR product was transferred to the nested PCR (45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles). The T3 primer (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′) in the vector and pN8 (5′-TGCACGCCATCTGGCTTG-3′) in nm23-M2 were used for this reaction. Subsequently, the final products were cloned directly into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Nucleotide sequencing was carried out using a binding domain sequencing kit according to instructions from the provider (PE Biosystems) Sequencing was carried out on an ABI 310 automatic sequencer (PE Biosystems) using the M13 forward primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′). All primers were obtained from Invitrogen. Nm23-M2 Expression Constructs—The cDNA of nm23-M2 (NCBI accession number X68193) was cloned in the pBluescript KS vector. A triple HA tag was added 5′ of the start codon of the introduced sequence. Artificially introduced NcoI and BspHI restriction sites were used to isolate HA-nm23. Fragments were blunted by adding 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the fragments were gel-purified and inserted into the HpaI site of the eukaryotic retroviral expression vector pBabe. Preparation of Retrovirus and Transduction of I/11 Cells—Retroviral transduction was performed as described (18Bakker W.J. Blazquez-Domingo M. Kolbus A. Besooyen J. Steinlein P. Beug H. Coffer P.J. Lowenberg B. Von Lindern M. Van Dijk T.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In short, ecotropic Phoenix cells were transfected with the use of calcium phosphate. After 24 h, cells were treated with mitomycin C (10 μg/ml) for 1 h, washed three times, and washed three more times 2 h later. I/11 cells were added and co-cultured for 20–24 h in StemPro medium supplemented with Epo, SCF, and Dex as described above. Subsequently, I/11 cells were removed carefully from the Phoenix cells and cultured in supplemented StemPro medium. To select for stable transfectants, puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added 48 h later. Primer Pairs—Gene-specific primers corresponding to nm23-M2 (X68193), rpS4 (M73436), eEF-1β2 (BC023139), Fli-1 (X59421), and αTUB4 (M13444) (NCBI accession numbers in parentheses) were obtained from Invitrogen. The sequences of the primers used for amplification were as follows: nm23-M2, 5′-TGGCCAACCTCGAGCGTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGAGCCCCTCCCAGACCA-3′ (reverse); rpS4, 5′-TAGCGCAGCCATGGCTCGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCATCTCCAGTCAGGGCATAC-3′ (reverse); eEF-1β2, 5′-ATGGGATTCGGAGACCTGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGCAGGTGGTGGACCAGA-3′ (reverse); Fli-1, 5′-TGCAGCCACATCCAACAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAAGGCACGTGGGTGTTAG-3′ (reverse); and αTUB4, 5′-TGCAGCGTGCTGTGTGCATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTCTCGAGCCTCAGAGAA-3′ (reverse). Real Time PCR—The real time PCR assay involved TaqMan technology (PE Applied Biosystems model 7700 sequence detector) using the double-stranded DNA-specific fluorescence dye SYBR green I to detect the PCR product as described previously (23Kolbus A. Blazquez-Domingo M. Carotta S. Bakker W. Luedemann S. von Lindern M. Steinlein P. Beug H. Blood. 2003; 102: 3136-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 50 °C with a 2-min hold (AmpErase UNG incubation) and one cycle of 95 °C with a 10-min hold (AmpliTaq Gold Activation) followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and extension at 62 °C for 30 s. All of the different primer pairs had identical optimal PCR annealing temperatures. Acquisition of the fluorescence signal from the samples was carried out at the end of the elongation step. To confirm amplification specificity, the PCR products from each primer pair were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the dissociation curve was checked at the end of each run. Nm23-M2 Expression Is Regulated by Translational Control—Similarly to primary erythroid progenitors, the erythroid cell line I/11 proliferates in the presence of Epo, SCF, and Dex, although the cells undergo terminal differentiation into enucleated erythrocytes in medium supplemented with Epo and insulin (1von Lindern M.

Mikulits W. Beug H. Mullner E.W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We aimed to identify genes whose expression is controlled by Epo plus SCF to serve as endogenous targets in the elucidation of Epo- and SCF-specific signaling. As signal transduction may control the activation of both transcription and translation, we used polysome-bound mRNA, which was derived from I/11 erythroid cells that were factor-deprived and restimulated with Epo, SCF, or Epo plus SCF, to screen ATLAS filters containing 588 cDNA probes (2Dolznig H. Boulme F. Stangl K. Deiner E.M. Mikulits W. Beug H. Mullner E.W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (see also the supplementary data available in the on-line version of this article). Among other genes, we found nm23-M2 to be up-regulated by Epo, SCF, or Epo plus SCF (Fig. 1A; for complete data see the on-line supplement). The highest expression was observed when cells were stimulated with Epo plus SCF. To validate these results, we tested total RNA derived from I/11 cells that were factor-deprived and restimulated by Epo, SCF, or Epo plus SCF for nm23-M2 expression on a Northern blot. Surprisingly, we did not detect altered expression, although the Epo target gene pim1 was up-regulated by Epo, and the SCF target gene c-jun was up-regulated by SCF (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, we hybridized Northern blots containing fractions of subpolysomal and polysome-bound RNA with the nm23-M2 probe. Quantitative analysis showed that, in the absence of factor, <20% of all nm23-M2 mRNA was present in the polysomal fractions. Upon stimulation with Epo, 53% of nm23-M2 mRNA shifted into the polysomal fractions. In the presence of SCF 64% of the nm23-M2 mRNA was found in the polysomal fractions, and in the presence of Epo plus SCF the percentage was 78% (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that expression of nm23-M2 is regulated at the level of translation initiation rather than by transcriptional control. Cytokine Regulated Polysome Association of nm23-M2 mRNA Is PI3K-dependent—The signaling routes that may be involved in growth factor-stimulated translational control are the MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in activation of p90RSK and MNK-1/2, and the PI3K/PKB pathway, activating mTOR and S6 kinase (24Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To test whether these pathways are involved in growth factor-induced polysome association of nm23-M2 mRNA, I/11 cells were factor-depleted and subsequently SCF-stimulated in the absence or presence of the PI3K-inhibitor LY294002, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 completely abrogated polysome association of nm23-M2 mRNA, whereas the MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not alter the distribution of nm23-M2 transcripts as compared with untreated SCF control samples (Fig. 2A). Rapamycin only weakly reduced polysome association of nm23-M2 mRNA following SCF treatment. However, rapamycin treatment abrogated SCF-induced phosphorylation of the eIF-4E-binding protein (4E-BP), and PD98059 inhibited SCF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in parallel experiments, indicating that the quality and concentration used were effective (Fig. 2B). Decreased nm23-M2 Protein Levels during Erythroid Differentiation Due to the Loss of Polysome Association of nm23-M2 mRNA—Previous studies reported down-regulation of Nm23-M2 protein expression in myeloid and erythroid differentiation (25Willems R. Van Bockstaele D.R. Lardon F. Lenjou M. Nijs G. Snoeck H.W. Berneman Z.N. Slegers H. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1267: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our finding that nm23-M2 mRNA associates with polysomes under erythroid “renewal” conditions is in agreement with these findings. To investigate whether nm23-M2 down-regulation was due to a change in translation, we studied nm23-M2 mRNA polysome binding in I/11 cells during terminal differentiation. I/11 cells were shifted from medium supplemented with Epo, SCF, and Dex to medium supplemented with Epo plus insulin. I/11 cells differentiated synchronously as shown previously (1von Lindern M. Deiner E.M. Dolznig H. Parren-Van Amelsvoort M. Hayman M.J. Mullner E.W. Beug H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3651-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Dolznig H. Habermann B. Stangl K.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1076-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); cell volume is gradually reduced, and hemoglobin accumulation is accelerated between 36 and 48 h after differentiation induction (Fig. 3A). Western blotting showed that the Nm23-M2 protein is down-modulated between 36 and 48 h upon differentiation induction (Fig. 3B). Northern blots containing fractions of subpolysomal and polysomal mRNA derived from cells at different stages of differentiation showed that nm23-M2 mRNA is present in large polysomes 6 and 20 h after the induction of differentiation but that polysome association is largely lost 48 h after differentiation induction (Fig. 3C). To examine whether polysome recruitment is associated with PI3K/PKB activation, we differentiated I/11 cells for 0, 24, and 48 h, factor-depleted the cells for 4 h, and restimulated with 5 units/ml Epo and 10 units/ml insulin for 10 min. Both Epo and insulin induced comparable phosphorylation of PKB in expanding progenitors. Following 24 h differentiation, insulin-induced phosphorylation of PKB was increased, which may explain the increased polysome recruitment of nm23-M2 at this stage of differentiation (Fig. 3, C and D). As observed previously (18Bakker W.J. Blazquez-Domingo M. Kolbus A. Besooyen J. Steinlein P. Beug H. Coffer P.J. Lowenberg B. Von Lindern M. Van Dijk T.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), PKB phosphorylation is down-regulated 48 h following differentiation, as expression is strongly decreased (Fig. 3D). The loss of polysome association 48 h after differentiation induction coincides with major changes in the gene expression program of the cell (2Dolznig H. Boulme F. Stangl K. Deiner E.M. Mikulits W. Beug H. Mullner E.W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Nm23-M2 mRNA Starts with a TOP Tract and Contains an Inverted Repeat—Translational regulation may occur through specific sequences and structures present in the 5′- and/or 3′-UTR of the mRNA. We obtained 5′-fragments of nm23-M2 cDNA from a cDNA library by PCR. Fragments of ∼170 bp, primed from the ATG in nm23-M2 to the 5′-cloning site of the vector, were isolated and cloned. Three independent clones were sequenced, which started at their 5′-site with a pyrimidine stretch of 8, 11, and 13 nucleotides, respectively. These clones were identical to a cDNA submitted by the RIKEN Genomic Sciences Center (AKO12447), 2Y. Hayashizaki, unpublished data, submission date July 10, 2000. which had a 12-nucleotide TOP sequence (Fig. 4). TOP tracts are structures known to be essential in the control of growth factor-dependent translation of several mRNAs, including those for ribosomal proteins (28Meyuhas O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6321-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed a 9-bp inverted repeat in the 5′-UTR of nm23-M2 mRNA (indicated as a stem structure in Fig. 4). Mapping of the novel 5′-cDNA sequence to genomic DNA revealed that the 90 most 5′ nucleotides of the mRNA are located on a separate exon that is separated from the second exon from which the nm23-M2 open reading frame starts by an intron of 241 nucleotides. The TOP tract maps to a genomic sequence of 14 pyrimidines. Translation of nm23-M2 mRNA Expressed from a Retroviral Vector Is Cytokine-independent—To examine whether the TOP sequence and the inverted repeat in the 5′-UTR of nm23-M2 determine the efficiency of polysome association, I/11 cells were transduced with a pBabe HA-Nm23-M2 retroviral expression construct in which the 5′-UTR is replaced by the HA tag sequence. HA-Nm23-M2-expressing clones were factor-deprived and restimulated with Epo and SCF, and RNA was separated into subpolysomal and polysomal fractions that were assayed for endogenous and exogenously expressed nm23-M2. The polysome-associated fraction of HA-nm23-M2 mRNA was refractory to factor deprivation, in contrast to the endogenous mRNA that was consistently only present in the polysome-associated fractions when cells were restimulated with Epo/SCF (Fig. 5). Upon restimulation of the cells with Epo and SCF in the presence of LY294002 or rapamycin, polysome association of endogenous nm23-M2 mRNA was lost, but polysome association of HA-nm23-M2 was not altered. This shows that the 5′-UTR sequences are responsible for PI3K-dependent regulation of the nm23-M2 mRNA translation.

Using the phage display technology, a unique antibody (MW3G3) was selected against AS with a VH3, DP 47, and a CDR3 amino acid sequence of QKKRPRF. Antibody MW3G3 did not react with desulfated, N-deacetylated or N-sulfated AS, indicating that reactivity depends on N-acetyl and 2-O-sulfate groups. Antibody MW3G3 also had a high preference for (modified) heparin oligosaccharides containing N-acetylated glucosamine and 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues. In tissues, antibody MW3G3 identified a HS oligosaccharide epitope containing N-acetylated glucosamine and 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues as enzymatic N-deacetylation of HS in situ prevented staining, and 2-O-sulfotransferase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells were not reactive. An immunohistochemical survey using various rat organs revealed a distinct distribution of the MW3G3 epitope, which was primarily present in the basal laminae of most (but not all) blood vessels and of some epithelia, including human skin.

It largely consists of the repeating disaccacharide structure of →4)-α-d-2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranose(1→4)-α-l-idopyranosyluronic acid-2-sulfate(1→ and is closely related to heparan sulfates. AS is located in large granules present in the outer surface of the snail and is secreted onto the surface as mucus. This mucus consists of 26% proteins, and the GAG moiety is entirely formed by AS. Whether AS is present as a proteoglycan is unclear (2Jeong J. Toida T. Muneta Y. Kosiishi I. Imanari T. Linhardt R.J. Choi H.S. Wu S.J. Kim Y.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol.

Oligosaccharides (10 μg) were incubated with 0.5 ml of periplasmic fraction for 1 h while shaking. Protein A-agarose beads (100 μl) were loaded with 500 μg of anti-VSV tag antibody (P5D4). Next, 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads loaded with P5D4 antibodies were added to the oligosaccharide/anti-AS antibody mixture and incubated for 1 h while shaking. Beads were spun down (10,000 × g), washed three times with PBS, mixed with PAGE loading buffer (Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, with 0.5 m NaCl), and heated for 2 min. Samples were analyzed by PAGE using a 33% gel (21Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), using alcian blue fixation (0.8% (w/v) in 2% (v/v) acetic acid) and silver staining. Control incubations included omission of antibody and heparin oligosaccharides and the use of an irrelevant antibody. Isolation of Metabolically Radiolabeled HS and Disaccharide Analysis—HS chains (3H-labeled) were isolated from wild type (CHOK1) and 2-O-sulfotransferase mutant CHO cells (pgsF17) and digested with a combination of heparinases I, II, and III, and disaccharide compositional analysis was performed as previously described (22Merry C.L. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Evaluation of Specificity by Immunohistochemistry—Tissue specimens were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Tissue sections (5 μm) were incubated with periplasmic fractions of anti-AS antibodies in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected using anti-tag antibodies (anti-VSV, P5D4, and IgG1) followed by Alexa-labeled (488) anti-mouse antibodies. Finally, tissue sections were fixed in ethanol, air-dried, and embedded in mowiol (10% (w/v) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 2.5% (w/v) NaN3). As a control, primary antibodies were omitted. To evaluate the HS specificity of the antibodies, tissue sections were pretreated with heparinase III to remove all HS (0.02 IU/ml in 50 mm NaAc, 50 mm Ca(Ac)2, pH 7.0; overnight incubation at 37 °C). As a control, tissue sections were incubated with reaction buffer without enzyme. After HS removal, tissue sections were washed in PBS and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described above. Digestion of HS was analyzed by incubation with antibody 3G10 (12David G. Bai X.M. Van der S.B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), which recognizes HS stubs generated after HS digestion. Tissue sections were also incubated with a mixture of anti-AS antibodies and AS or AS oligosaccharides (14-mers) and evaluated for inhibition of antibody staining. Mixtures of anti-AS antibodies and oligosaccharides (10 and 50 μg/ml) were preincubated for 2 min before adding to the tissue section. Tissue sections were processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described above. Wild type CHOK1 and mutant pgsF17 CHO (defective in HS 2-O-sulfation) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum on multispot slides for 48 h to reach 80% confluence, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described above. Staining patterns were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferase 1 and 2 Cell Lysates and Deacetylation of Rat Kidney Sections—Stably transfected human kidney 293 cell lines clone 11 (NDST 1) and clone S5 (NDST 2) were grown in Ham's F-12 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and harvested at 80% confluence. Cell lysates were prepared by homogenizing cells on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min, at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected, diluted 1:1 in glycerol, and stored at –20 °C. Protein concentration varied between 10 and 20 mg/ml as determined by the method of Lowry. Cell lysates were stable for at least 1 month. For deacetylation of tissue sections, rat kidney sections were incubated with cell lysates containing 500 μg of protein/ml for 16 h at 37 °C. As a control, tissue sections were incubated with lysis buffer. Tissue sections were washed with PBS and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described above. Acharan Sulfate—AS was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining of the gel (Fig. 1). AS migrates somewhat faster than HS from bovine kidney but slower than dermatan sulfate. Selection of Antibodies against Acharan Sulfate—Four rounds of panning were performed against AS using the semisynthetic scFv library 1, which resulted in a total increase of phage titer from 6 × 102 colony-forming units in the first round to 1 × 108 colony-forming units in the fourth round. Supernatants containing antibodies of the third and fourth selection were tested for reactivity with AS by ELISA. Of the 188 clones screened, four reacted with AS, which were all from the third selection round. DNA sequence analysis revealed that all clones expressed identical antibodies. Clone MW3G3 was selected for further analysis. This antibody belongs to the VH3 family, has a DP 47 germline gene segment, and contains the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 amino acid sequence QKKRPRF. Evaluation of the Specificity of Anti-AS Antibody MW3G3— Antibody MW3G3 was analyzed for reactivity with various GAG species and control samples by ELISA (Fig. 2, Table I). Antibody MW3G3 reacted strongly with AS, moderately with heparin, and very weakly with HS from bovine kidney and porcine intestinal mucosa. No reactivity was seen with chondroitin sulfate-A, chondroitin sulfate-C, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronate nor with DNA. To verify the necessity for N-acetylated glucosamine residues and 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues, as present in AS, various modified AS, heparin, and K5 preparations were analyzed (Table I). Antibody MW3G3 reacted strongly with AS, but not with N-sulfated AS, N-deacetylated AS, and de-O-sulfated AS. These results suggest that both types of modification (N-acetylation and 2-O-sulfation) are important for antibody recognition. Antibody MW3G3 reacted very strongly with N-desulfated, N-acetylated heparin, which is strongly in favor of the above suggested specificity of antibody MW3G3. Reactivity for heparin was dependent on the source used. Heparin from intestinal mucosa reacted quite strongly, whereas heparin from bovine lung, which is more sulfated and less N-acetylated, reacted much more weakly. Desulfated and re-N-sulfated heparin, desulfated and N-acetylated heparin, and 2-O-desulfated heparin showed no reactivity with antibody MW3G3, demonstrating the need for 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues. Antibody MW3G3 showed weak reactivity with a N-desulfated, N-acetylated, and partly 2-O-desulfated (15% (17Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Antibody MW3G3 did not react with K5 but did react with O-sulfated K5 (GlcA2S-GlcNAc6S; 1.2 O-sulfates per disaccharide; Table I) (11van den Born J. Jann K. Assmann K.J. Lindahl U. Berden J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22802-22809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), probably indicating that the antibody recognized 2-O-sulfated glucuronic as well as iduronic acids. Reactivity of antibody MW3G3 for N-desulfated reacetylated heparin is very strong and suggested a strong preference for N-acetylated glucosamine residues. To address this, antibody MW3G3 reactivity for heparin dp6 and dp8 and N-desulfated, N-acetylated heparin dp6 and dp8 oligosaccharides was analyzed. A mixture of all four classes of oligosaccharides was allowed to react with antibody MW3G3 using an immunoprecipitation approach (Fig. 3). The results clearly demonstrated that the antibody strongly precipitates N-acetylated heparin dp8 oligomers, suggesting that antibody MW3G3 gives high preference to N-acetylated glucosamine residues instead of N-sulfated glucosamine residues (which are abundant in heparin). N-Acetylation Is Essential for Binding of Antibody MW3G3 in Situ as Determined by HS Deacetylation of Rat Kidney Tissue Sections—The necessity of N-acetyl groups for antibody recognition was further analyzed by enzymatic removal of N-acetyl groups using cell lysates of human kidney 293 cells stably transfected with NDST 1 and NDST 2 cDNA (23Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindhal U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Pikas D.S. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4552-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), followed by anti-HS antibody staining of the tissue section (25van den Born J. Pikas D.S. Pisa B.J. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Berden J.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, Table I). After incubation, hardly any staining with antibody MW3G3 was observed anymore (Fig. 4, A and C). Staining with anti-HS antibody HS4C3, which recognizes highly sulfated HS structures (9van Kuppevelt T.H. Dennissen M.A. van Venrooij W.J. Hoet R.M. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12960-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), was not affected (Fig. 4, B and D). No differences were observed between NDST 1 or NDST 2 cell lysates. These data indicated that the presence of N-acetyl groups is essential for staining of antibody MW3G3. 2-O-Sulfation Is Essential for Binding of Antibody MW3G3 in Situ as Determined by 2-O-Sulfotransferase Mutant CHO Cells—The necessity of 2-O-sulfates for antibody recognition was determined by the analysis of immunoreactivity of antibody MW3G3 for CHO cells defective in HS 2-O-sulfation (26Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An average of 3.1% of ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc disaccharide units were found in wild type CHO cells (CHOK1) as determined by lyase digestion and disaccharide analysis, whereas no ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc disaccharide units were found in mutant CHO cells (pgsF17). Disaccharide compositional analysis of HS in wild type and mutant CHO cells is given in Table II. Wild type CHO cells showed high expression of MW3G3 epitopes (Fig. 5A), whereas mutant CHO cells were negative (Fig. 5B). We used antibody AO4B08 as a control antibody for the presence of 2-O-sulfation (6Dennissen M.A. Jenniskens G.J. Pieffers M. Versteeg E.M. Petitou M. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2008194340,"Ole e 6 is a pollen protein from the olive tree (Olea europaea) that exhibits allergenic activity with a high prevalence among olive-allergic individuals. The three-dimensional structure of Ole e 6 has been determined in solution by NMR methods. This is the first experimentally determined structure of an olive tree pollen allergen. The structure of this 50-residue protein is based on 486 upper limit distance constraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effects and 24 ϕ torsion angle restraints. The global fold of Ole e 6 consists of two nearly antiparallel α-helices, spanning residues 3-19 and 23-33, that are connected by a short loop and followed by a long, unstructured C-terminal tail. Viewed edge-on, the structured N terminus has a dumbbell-like shape with the two helices on the outside and with the hydrophobic core, mainly composed of 3 aromatic and 6 cysteine residues, on the inside. All the aromatic rings lie on top of and pack against the three disulfide bonds. The lack of thermal unfolding, even at 85 °C, indicates a high conformational stability. Based on the analysis of the molecular surface, we propose five plausible epitopes for IgE recognition. The results presented here provide the structural foundation for future experiments to verify the antigenicity of the proposed epitopes, as well as to design novel hypoallergenic forms of the protein suitable for diagnosis and treatment of type-I allergies.

In addition, three-dimensional structure features of Ole e 6 are discussed to provide a basis for future functional studies. Type-I allergies are one of the most widespread pathologies in developed countries where they affect more than 20% of the population, provoking respiratory, skin, and intestinal disorders. The key factor responsible for the disease is the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine (1Venarske D. deShazo R.D. South. Med. J. 2003; 96: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Miescher S.M. Vogel M. Mol. Aspects Med. 2002; 23: 413-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Budde I.K. Aalberse R.C. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2003; 33: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), after an IgE-mediated immunological response (4Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Beavil A.J. Beavil R.L. McCloskey N. Coker H.A. Fear D. Smurthwaite L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 579-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The diagnosis and treatment of allergies are based on the use of extracts and vaccines, which require large amounts of biological materials obtained from natural sources for their production. These extracts can provoke lateral effects such as anaphylactic shock, are expensive to obtain, and do not assure a constant composition of allergens in extracts. Therefore, the production of the allergens via peptidic synthesis or molecular biology techniques could be a more effective and cheaper alternative source of allergens that could permit the standardization of treatments (5Valenta R. Lidholm J. Niederberger V. Hayek B. Kraft D. Gronlund H. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 896-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The identification of the epitopes, regions of the antigen recognized by the immunoglobulin, is essential in order to design these synthetic vaccines. Until now, epitope-mapping techniques have been based on the search for linear or sequential epitopes (6Suphioglu C. Blaher B. Rolland J.M. McCluskey J. Schappi G. Kenrick J. Singh M.B. Knox R.B. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Jarvinen K.M. Chatchatee P. Bardina L. Beyer K. Sampson H.A. Int. Arch.

Immunol. 2003; 33: 3303-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but they have failed in the identification of discontinuous or conformational epitopes. The shape and accessibility of each region of the allergen are essential for recognition by the IgEs (10Furmonaviciene R. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), so to determine the structure of the allergens is a necessary step in order to define accurately the putative epitopes. This way we can limit the putative residues preferentially recognized by the IgEs, minimize the number of epitopes to be tested for mutating them, and verify their implication in the antigenic response to prepare hypoallergenic forms of the protein to be used as vaccines. Pollinoses, type-I allergies caused by anemophilous pollens, are one of the most widespread allergies (11D'Amato G. Spieksma F.T. Liccardi G. Jager S. Russo M. Kontou-Fili K. Nikkels H. Wuthrich B. Bonini S. Allergy. 1998; 53: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and olive tree (Olea europaea) pollen is one of the main causes of seasonal respiratory allergy in Mediterranean countries (12Bousquet J. Cour P. Guerin B. Michel F.B. Clin. Allergy. 1984; 14: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Important cross-reactions with other Oleaceae pollens, like ash (Fraxinus excelsior), lilac (Syringa vulgaris), or privet (Ligustrum vulgare), have been described previously (13Bousquet J. Guerin B.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 3644-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but their three-dimensional structures have not been determined. Ole e 6 is a 50-amino acid protein composed of a unique polypeptide chain with unknown function. Its allergenic prevalence varies for different geographical areas and reaches 55% in areas where the olive tree is extensively cultivated (21Rodríguez R. Villalba M. Monsalve R.I. Batanero E. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2001; 125: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Batanero E. Ledesma A. Villalba M. Rodríguez R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence contains two sets of the sequential motif Cys-X3-Cys-X3-Cys (25Batanero E. Ledesma A. Villalba M. Rodríguez R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and shows similarity with a polypeptide sequence deduced from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cDNA. This Cys-enriched motif has also been found in a putative protein deduced from the Caenorhabditis elegans genomic structure. Ole e 6 has not been shown to share IgE epitopes with other allergenic pollens, which makes Ole e 6 a good candidate to be included in synthetic vaccines for olive pollinosis because there are not expected significant homologues or similar sequences in other plants. Recently, we have produced in Pichia pastoris and characterized the recombinant form of Ole e 6 (22Barral P. Tejera M.L. Treviño M.A. Villalba M. Bruix M. Rodríguez R. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we have used its 15N-labeled form to determine its high resolution three-dimensional structure in solution. The analysis of this structure is essential to infer information about the accessibility, shape, and mobility of the different regions of the molecule, which can lead to the design of new vaccines specific for olive tree pollen. In addition, the structure determination can also provide a basis to understand or hypothesize on the biological function of this novel plant protein. Protein Sample—The cDNA from Ole e 6 was obtained as described previously (25Batanero E. Ledesma A. Villalba M. Rodríguez R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and it was cloned into the vector pPIC9 to allow its expression in P. pastoris. The plasmid containing the cDNA was integrated in the P. pastoris GS115 his4 strain genome, and the production of the recombinant Ole e 6 (rOle e 6) 1The abbreviations used are: rOle e 6, recombinant Ole e 6; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; W, watt; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. was carried out as described previously (26Huecas S. Villalba M. González E. Martínez-Ruiz A. Rodríguez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, a colony of plasmid-containing P. pastoris was grown in 10 ml of BMG (100 mm K2HPO4, pH 6, 0.34% yeast nitrogen base, 1% (NH4)2SO4, 4 × 10-5% biotin, and 1% glycerol) for 2 days at 30 °C. This culture was used as the preinoculum of a 1-liter culture in the same medium and conditions. After 2 days, the cells were grown in 200 ml of BMM, which was the same as BMG but with 0.5% methanol instead of glycerol, to induce the production of the recombinant protein. After a 4-day culture, the supernatant was collected and dialyzed in the presence of 20 mm NH4HCO3. The dialyzed protein was separated by size through a Sephadex G-50 chromatography column and later by reverse phase HPLC through a nucleosyl-C18 column. Collected peaks from HPLC were resolved in 17% SDS-PAGE, and after Western blotting the peak containing the pure protein was determined. The protein from this peak was selected and used in the subsequent experiments. 15N-rOle e 6 was produced and isolated in the same way but substituting (NH4)2SO4 with (15NH4)2SO4 in the BMG and BMM media. All the samples were analyzed by amino acid analysis, N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation, and mass spectroscopy. Circular Dichroism Analyses—CD spectra of rOle e 6 were obtained on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan), fitted with a 150-W xenon lamp, and connected to a Neslab RTE-111 thermostabilizer bath. Far-UV spectra were registered in the range of 190-250 nm using an optical cell path of 0.1 cm. The spectra were recorded at 50 nm/min scanning speed, and the accumulation of four spectra was achieved. Samples were analyzed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, at 20 and 85 °C, and the protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml. Mean residue mass ellipticities were calculated based on 116 as the average molecular mass/residue, obtained from the amino acid composition of Ole e 6, and expressed in terms of θ (degrees·cm2·dmol-1). Final spectra were corrected by subtracting the corresponding base-line spectrum obtained for the buffer under identical conditions. Temperature-induced denaturation of rOle e 6 was monitored by CD measurements at 220 nm. The temperature was increased from 20 to 85 °C and then cooled to 20 °C at 0.5 °C/min. NMR Spectroscopy—rOle e 6 samples were prepared for NMR experiments at 0.5-1 mm in 95% H2O, 5% D2O or in D2O containing sodium-4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate at pH 6.0. NMR spectra were carried out at 278, 298, or 308 K on a Bruker AV600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe and an active shielded z-gradient coil. Chemical shifts were referenced to the internal sodium-4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate as described previously (27Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). On the unlabeled sample two-dimensional COSY (28Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 416-424Google Scholar) spectra were acquired in H2Oonthe 15N sample. Additionally, 15N HSQC spectrum was recorded without decoupling during acquisition, using an α/β half-filter to detect the low field and high field components of the multiplets (33Crowley P. Ubbink M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2968-2969Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test the association state of the sample, one-dimensional 1H spectra were run at different sample concentrations from 1 to 0.02 mm. No changes in chemical shifts or line widths were observed upon dilution, so we conclude that the sample was monomeric under the conditions described above. The processing of the spectra was carried out by using the program XWIN-NMR (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany) and NMRPipe (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11446) Google Scholar). The spectra analysis, assignment, and cross-peak volume calculations were performed with ANSIG 3.3 (35Helgstrand M. Kraulis P. Allard P. Hard T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—1428 unambiguous NOEs were converted into 900 upper limits by the CALIBA program (36Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The disulfide bond pattern of Ole e 6 was unambiguously determined on the basis of NOE evidences. For the three S-S pairs (8-34, 12-30, and 16-26), at least one intercysteine NOE could be found, and the corresponding restraints were introduced in the calculation. After DYANA filtering, 486 conformationally relevant distances were obtained. These constraints were supplemented with 24 ϕ angle restraints (-200° to -10°) derived from the cross-correlated dipole-dipole relaxation between 1HN-15N and 1HN-1Hα (33Crowley P. Ubbink M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2968-2969Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The negative ϕ angles correspond to the following residues: Ala-3, Gln-4, Phe-5, Lys-19, Asn-21, Thr-24, Cys-26, Cys-30, Thr-32, Cys-34, Ser-35, Val-36, Lys-37, Asp-38, Val-39, Lys-40, Glu-41, Lys-42, Leu-43, Glu-44, Tyr-46, Lys-47, Lys-49, and Asn-50. In the final steps, stereospecific limits were introduced using the program GLOMSA (36Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) for the Hβ of residues Phe-5, Tyr-9, His-13, Cys-16, Asp-18, Phe-25, Cys-26, Lys-29, Cys-30, and Asp-31 and for Hα of Gly-20. The three-dimensional structure of rOle e 6 was determined with the program DYANA 1.5 (37Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). A total of 50 structures were calculated, and the 25 structures with the lowest target function were refined by restrained energy minimization in vacuum (500 steps) using the program AMBER7 (38Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldell J.W. Cheatman III, T.E. Wang J. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J.

Graph. 1996; 14 (29-32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) was used to visualize and globally characterize the structures. The quality of the refined structures was evaluated with the program PROCHECK-NMR (40Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar). Thermal Stability—To test the thermal stability of rOle e 6, CD spectra were obtained at 20 °C, after heating at 85 °C, and again at 20 °C after cooling (Fig. 1A). Temperature-induced changes in the secondary structure of rOle e 6 were registered by measure of CD values at 220 nm between 20 and 85 °C (Fig. 1B). The experiment showed a linear increase in the mean residue mass ellipticity without a transition between two states, making impossible the determination of a Tm value. The CD spectra obtained at 85 °C showed that the protein maintained elements of secondary structure. The recovery of the initial temperature induced almost the complete recuperation of the original spectrum, indicating the restoration of the structure of the allergen. Description of the Ole e 6 Structure—The assignments of the 1H and 15N resonances were obtained following the standard strategy (41Wöthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar) and have been deposited in the BioMagResBank data base (42Seavey B.R. Farr E.A. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) under the accession number BMRB-6139. The 1H and 15N assignments for the backbone and side chains are complete, except for Asp-1. As an example, the assigned 15NHSQC spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. The coordinates of the 25 minimized conformers obtained with DYANA, on the basis of the NMR restraints, have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession number 1SS3. The resulting structures satisfied the experimental constraints with small deviations from the idealized covalent geometry, and most of the backbone torsion angles for nonglycine residues lay within the allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot. The statistics and details of quality and precision for the accepted structures are summarized in Table I, and a superposition of the selected structures is shown in Fig. 3. The root-mean-square deviation value for backbone heavy atoms of the most structured regions (excluding residues 1 and 2 from the N terminus and residues 34-50 from the unstructured C terminus) is 1.14 Å. The maximum violation is 0.29 Å, and the average sum of violations for the whole set of distance constraints is 4.0 Å.Table ISummary of NMR structure calculations and structural statistics of the solution structure of rOle e 6Constraints DistancesIntraresidual164Sequential153Medium range (i-j) < 5114Long range (i-j) ≥ 555Total distances486Anglesϕ24Total510DYANA (50 structures) Target functionAverage0.41Minimal0.34Maximal0.55Maximal violation (Å)Average0.21Minimal0.18Maximal0.29Sum of violations (Å)Average4.0Minimal3.5Maximal5.1AMBER (25 structures)Mean energy (kcal/mol)−284Root-mean-square deviations from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.00853Bond angles (degrees)1.990Ramachandran plotFavorable regions70.0%Additional allowed26.7%Generously allowed2.0%Disallowed1.3%Averaged pairwise root-mean-square deviations (Å)GlobalBackbone5.85 ± 2.64Heavy atoms6.86 ± 2.65Structured region (3−33)Backbone0.25 ± 0.10Heavy atoms1.14 ± 0.15Helix I (3-19)Backbone0.13 ± 0.05Heavy atoms0.98 ± 0.17Helix II (23−33)Backbone0.16 ± 0.06Heavy atoms1.20 ± 0.25 Open table in a new tab The global fold of Ole e 6 consists of two nearly antiparallel α-helices, spanning residues 3-19 and 23-33, that are bound by a short loop and maintained together with the help of the three disulfide bonds. The average angle formed between these two helices is 140° in the 25 final minimized structures. Both α-helices have a very regular internal hydrogen bonding pattern. As expected, stretches of CO(i)-HN(i+4) hydrogen bonds are found in regions 3-20 and 22-33 in the resulting structures. The C-terminal end (residues 34-50) behaves as an unstructured tail. In addition to the mentioned hydrogen bonds participating in the secondary structure, we found an important one appearing in all conformers that involves the side chain of the histidine residue, His-13 Hϵ, and the carbonyl backbone atom of Phe-23. This hydrogen bond could be important for the stability of the protein as it keeps together residues in the two α-helices. Many side chain conformations of residues in rOle e 6 are well defined, with 22 residues (5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33) having χ1 circular variances lower than 0.05. These residues with well defined side chain conformations mainly correspond to residues exhibiting high values of surface inaccessibility and to residues located in the secondary structural elements. One important exception is Phe-23. This hydrophobic residue is at the N-terminal end of the second α-helix, and unexpectedly, its side chain is completely disordered and surface-exposed. During the NMR assignment process only a single chemical shift value could be determined for the aromatic protons, indicating the particular magnetic environment of this side chain. The degeneration of all ring proton chemical shifts in all the experimental conditions studied probably impeded the acquisition of a more precise set of distant restraints. In the future, additional data different from the NOE-based distance constraints, residual dipolar couplings, and others should be very useful to address whether this high disorder is compatible with the right conformation of Phe-23 in solution. Finally, those residues located on the long C-terminal tail are also highly disordered (see Table I and Fig. 3). The hydrophobic core of this small protein has an unusual composition. Residues with accessible surface below 20% are Phe-5, Cys-8, Tyr-9, Cys-12, His-13, Cys-16, Ser-17, Cys-26, Cys-30, and Cys-34. Thus, with the exception of Ser-17, the core of the protein is composed only of aromatic residues and cysteines (Fig. 4). Their relative disposition is also very specific; all of the aromatic rings are in one face of the interhelix surface, whereas the three S-S bonds are just opposite in the other face. Additionally, each disulfide bond is located on the top of the inner face of one ring: disulfide 16-26 on the top of His-13, disulfide 12-30 on Tyr-9, and disulfide 8-34 on Phe-5 (Fig. 4). Ole e 6 has a great number of exposed residues, most of them bearing charged groups (11 negative and 9 positive charges). The surface of the protein shows a well defined charge distribution. The unstructured tail is mainly positive, whereas the structured part has a positive and a negative face as can be seen in Fig. 3B. The main cluster of positive charges is composed of residues Lys-19 and Lys-29, and the negative clusters are composed of Glu-15, Asp-18, and Asp-33 in one side and Glu-27 and Asp-31 in the other side. Ole e 6 is the first olive pollen allergen whose three-dimensional structure has been determined. No homologue protein was found for Ole e 6 in the data base banks, and only polypeptide sequences derived of two genomic structures were detected to have a degree of similarity. The alignment of the amino acid sequence of Ole e 6 with those deduced from genes of N. tabacum and C. elegans rendered an identity degree of 52 and 28%, respectively, and the Cys-X3-Cys-X3-Cys motifs were conserved. Unfortunately, no data about these putative proteins or about their function or structure are available so far. The solution structure of the Ole e 6 allergen determined here consists of a well defined globular N-terminal body composed of two antiparallel α-helices and a long and unstructured C-terminal tail. The most characteristic feature of this structure is the internal core made up by the disulfide bridges 8-34, 12-30, and 16-26 and the aromatic rings of Phe-5, Tyr-9, and His-13. The presence of this histidine, a positively charged residue, in the hydrophobic core deserves some attention. The global accessible surface area of His-13 is very low (less than 9%), and specifically the accessibility of some ring atoms is less than 1%. It is well known that the presence of a charged residue in the protein interior is energetically unfavorable (43Dao-pin S. Anderson D.E. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11521-11529Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and sometimes additional interactions are necessary to stabilize the local structure (44Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar, 45Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). In Ole e 6, the NHϵ of the imidazole ring participates in a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Phe-23. This fact, together with the high burial, could contribute to decreasing the pKa value of this group, making this histidine neutral at the natural physiological pH, diminishing the penalty of the electrostatic energy term, and increasing the stability of the protein. On the other hand, the presence of a large amount of covalent, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions between the two helices suggests a high stability for this part of the protein. In fact, the absence of a two-state denaturation curve in the thermal transition from 20 to 85 °C and the extent of secondary elements that remained at high temperature indicate a great stability for the allergen, to which the disulphide bridges should also contribute. The presence of two grooves in the protein surface coincident with the two interhelix region faces is notable. Interestingly, the base of one of these grooves is composed of the outer faces of the aromatic rings of Phe-5, Tyr-9, His-13, and Phe-23. Their nearly planar disposition with respect to the surface suggests that they could interact with other groups as, for example, aromatic-aromatic or aromatic-π cation interactions. Additionally, the electrostatic surface shows at the N terminus well defined regions with positive and negative clusters. Most of the amino acids involved in such regions (Glu-15, Asp-18, Glu-27, Lys-29, Asp-31, and Asp-33) are conserved in the putative counterpart from tobacco, which suggests a possible biological role for these clusters in the activity of these pollen proteins. In summary, it seems that this protein has been designed to have a stable and structured core to specifically interact with other molecules, and its structure points to the participation of electrostatic interactions as the driving forces for recognition. Moreover, the unstructured tail can also play a biological and/or immunological role. The conformational chemical shifts of the residues in the C-terminal tail suggest that there is a tendency to form an α-helix in this region. Furthermore, estimation of secondary structure of Ole e 6 performed by theoretical methods and based on the amino acid sequence (46Garnier J. Gibrat J.F. Robson B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gave an α-helix conformation for the segment at p"

In the γ origin of plasmid R6K, the Rep protein, π, is distinctive in that it can bind the seven 22-bp iterons in two forms; π monomers activate replication, whereas π dimers act as inhibitors. In this work, we used wild type and variants of the π protein with altered monomer/dimer ratios to study iteron/π interactions. High resolution contact mapping was conducted using multiple techniques (missing base contact probing, methylation protection, base modification, and hydroxyl radical footprinting), and the electrophoretic separation of nucleoprotein complexes allowed us to discriminate between contact patterns produced by π monomers and dimers. We also isolated iteron mutants that affected the binding of π monomers (only) or both monomers and dimers. The mutational studies and footprinting analyses revealed that, when binding DNA, π monomers interact with nucleotides spanning the entire length of the iteron. In contrast, π dimers interact with only the left half of the iteron; however, the retained interactions are strikingly similar to those seen with monomers. These results support a model in which Rep protein dimerization disturbs one of two DNA binding domains important for monomer/iteron interaction; the dimer/iteron interaction utilizes only one DNA binding domain.

These results support a model in which Rep protein dimerization disturbs one of two DNA binding domains important for monomer/iteron interaction; the dimer/iteron interaction utilizes only one DNA binding domain. Initiation of DNA replication occurs at a specific site called the origin of replication (ori). In one class of replicons, plasmid-encoded replication initiator protein (Rep) binds to tandemly repeated DNA sequences in the ori called iterons. Most iteron-containing plasmids display remarkable similarities among the iteron sequences (1Papp P.P. Chattoraj D.K. Schneider T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Chattoraj D.K. Schneider T.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schneider T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One sequence, 5′-TGAGnG-3′, is conserved in several plasmids and shown to be important for Rep binding in vitro as well as for ori function in vivo (Fig. 1 and Refs. 4McEachern M.J. Filutowicz M. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 5Miao D.M. Sakai H. Okamoto S. Tanaka K. Okuda M. Honda Y. Komano T. Bagdasarian M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3295-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, another sequence cluster that occurs one integral DNA helical turn (10 bp) from the start of the 5′-TGAGnG-3′ motif remains highly conserved within iterons of the same replicon (2Chattoraj D.K. Schneider T.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the interactions between Rep proteins and their cognate iterons, and how these nucleoprotein complexes associate with the other components of the initiation apparatus, remain significant objectives in molecular biology. In γ ori, one of the three origins derived from the antibiotic resistance plasmid R6K, a minimum of five 22-bp iterons (out of seven, total) were shown to be required for ori activation (6Kolter R. Helinski D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 161: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, base substitution in the iteron sequence (G/C7 to A/T) prevented Rep protein binding to the iteron in vitro and plasmid replication in vivo (4McEachern M.J. Filutowicz M. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For plasmid R6K, the cognate Rep protein, called π (7Inuzuka M. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

To identify the components of these complexes, a technique was employed where full-length π and shorter variants were reconstituted into heterodimers prior to DNA binding. Comparative analyses of the resultant banding patterns (in EMSA) suggested that, for WT π, the faster migrating complex contains bound monomers of the protein, and the slower migrating complex contains bound dimers (12Wu J.

Biol. 1998; 283: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding proficiency of heterodimers in which one π variant lacked the C-terminal DNA binding domain suggested that only one subunit of a π dimer makes specific contact with the iteron DNA (15Urh M. Wu J. Forest K. Inman R.B. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An additional line of evidence for the identification of π monomer-bound and π dimer-bound direct repeat complexes came from treating Rep proteins with subdenaturing levels of agents that can disrupt protein-protein interactions. In EMSA, increasing guanidine HCl concentrations led to a loss of the slower migrating “dimer” band and an increase in the faster migrating, “monomer” band (12Wu J. Sektas M. Chen D. Filutowicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13967-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Urh M. Wu J. Forest K. Inman R.B. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Treatment with guanidine HCl or urea has also been shown to activate a Rep protein (RepA), as has treatment with chaperones (e.g. see Refs. 16Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and 17Wickner S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Complementing this, hyperreplicative (i.e. copy-up) π variants tend to be more susceptible than WT to guanidine HCl treatment (suggesting dimer instability) and tend to show more monomer complex in EMSA, whereas inactive initiator variants produce predominantly dimer complex (9Abhyankar M.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) combined Sephadex G-75 column filtration (for molecular weight determination), guanidine HCl challenge, mutant analysis, and EMSA in a single set of experiments. Again, monomer- and dimer-bound nucleoprotein complexes are identified, the former being more prevalent with copy-up variants and the latter more prevalent with WT π protein. A complete understanding of the pattern of π binding has been complicated by the multiple ways that monomers and dimers of the protein appear to interact with the iteron sequence. There are several possible combinations of nucleoprotein complexes that can occur, and even a probe as simple as two direct repeats results in up to five shifted bands in the presence of WT π protein (21Krüger R. Rakowski S.A. Filutowicz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, footprints in solution studies were expected to be composites of various families of nucleoprotein complexes, and the resulting data would likely be too complex to meaningfully address structure/function models of π protein activities (in replication and transcription). By paring the DNA probe(s) down to a single iteron, we hoped to simplify the array of assemblies of π monomers and dimers on γ ori DNA. Resolving the binding characteristics of the monomeric and dimeric forms of π protein is of great significance since the binding (to iterons) of monomers, but not dimers, appears to be required for open complex formation (13Krüger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we used His-tagged wild type π (His-π·WT) and previously characterized variants of the protein with altered monomer/dimer ratios (His-π·P106L/F107S (14, Urh, M. (1996) Studies of the Mechanisms Controlling Replication of Plasmid R6K. Ph.D. thesis, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar, 15Urh M. Wu J. Forest K. Inman R.B. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and His-π·M36A/M38A (13Krüger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) to study iteron/π interactions. Each variant differs from the other in several replication-related functional properties such as iteron binding and the ability to facilitate “open complex” formation. His-π·P106L/F107S is a copy-up variant; it stimulates increased replication compared with WT π, apparently by elevating the fraction of π monomers relative to the low monomer level observed in the WT protein (14, Urh, M. (1996) Studies of the Mechanisms Controlling Replication of Plasmid R6K. Ph.D. thesis, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar, 15Urh M. Wu J. Forest K. Inman R.B. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The variant His-π·M36A/M38A fails to support replication, and the highly purified protein does not possess strand-opening activity in vitro (13Krüger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fast migrating (monomer) nucleoprotein complex is absent in EMSA assays when a one-direct repeat probe is mixed with His-π·M36A/M38A, but the slower migrating, dimer-bound complex is readily observed (13Krüger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Understanding the process of origin recognition and the architecture of complexes that activate or inhibit replication requires detailed information about iteron/π interaction(s). Here we used several chemical footprinting analyses to characterize the interactions of π monomers and dimers with DNA containing a single iteron. Electrophoretic separation of nucleoprotein complexes allowed us to discriminate between contact patterns produced by each form of the protein. We also isolated base pair substitution mutations that affect the binding of π monomers (only) in addition to mutations that affect both monomers and dimers. Our results indicate that π monomers make much more extensive iteron contacts in comparison with dimers. Monomers interact with the entire iteron, spanning the adjacent major grooves, but dimers interact with only the left half of the iteron. The interactions of π dimers in the left half of the iteron (Fig. 1) are the same as those of π monomers. These results support a model in which Rep protein dimerization disturbs one of two DNA binding domains important for monomer/iteron interaction; the dimer/iteron interaction utilizes only one DNA binding domain. Strains and Plasmids—Escherichia coli strain ECF001 contains a chromosomal copy of the pir gene under an arabinose-inducible promoter, ParaBAD (22Pluciennik A. Iyer R.R. Napierala M. Larson J.E.

J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4965-4974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pRK1 (20Krüger R. Filutowicz M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2461-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was previously described. pFL731 is a derivative of pUC9 in which a single iteron is cloned into the HincII site. Protein Purification—His-π·WT, His-π·P106L/F107S, and His-π·M36A/M38A were purified as described (24Wu J. Filutowicz M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DNA Preparation—Plasmid pRK1 containing a single iteron was digested with EcoRI/PstI (generating a 91-bp fragment) or SalI/SmaI (generating an 83-bp fragment), and the fragments were purified from a 6% acrylamide gel using a Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The fragments were then 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP at the EcoRI site or [α-32P]dTTP at the SalI site using Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Unincorporated free nucleotides were removed by passage through a G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). Missing Base Interference Footprinting—DNA containing, on average, one missing guanine or adenine (using formic acid; Sigma) or one missing cytosine or thymine (using hydrazine; Sigma) was prepared using published procedures (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). DNA containing, on average, one missing guanine was also prepared using dimethyl sulfate (DMS; Sigma) as described (26Brunelle A. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To carry out missing base interference footprinting, 10 ng of DNA was incubated with π protein (His-π·WT (1.5 μg), His-π·P106L/F107S (1.5 μg), or His-π·M36A/M38A (2.5 μg)) in a 25-μl final volume for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture also contained 225 ng of poly(dI-dC) and 2.5 μl of 10× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA and 100 mm potassium glutamate). Proteins were diluted in TGE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.3 m KCl). After the binding reaction, iteron-π complexes were separated from unbound DNA by electrophoresis on a 6% acrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. π-Bound iteron DNA from monomer or dimer complexes and free DNA were eluted according to the crush and soak method (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.51-5.54Google Scholar), and then strand cleavage was carried out at the abasic sites by incubation in 100 μl of 1 m piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Fragments were ethanol-precipitated, separated by electrophoresis on denaturing (7 m urea) 9% acrylamide gels, and dried. Gels were scanned by phosphorimaging using a Storm system (Amersham Biosciences). Data points in each lane were normalized to a region of sequence flanking the iteron, which is not affected by π binding, to correct for differences in loading. Normalized profiles were graphed using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). Missing bases that interfered with π binding were underrepresented in the strand cleavage profiles of bound DNA relative to the free DNA or the DNA population that was not incubated with π. Positions where removal of a base completely prevented π binding are identified as strong (or severe) effects, whereas those that partially prevented binding are classified as moderate or weak effects. Methylation Interference Footprinting—DNA was premethylated with DMS using a published protocol (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complexes were formed (with the modified DNA), and the complexes were separated and analyzed as described above for missing base interference footprinting. Methylation Protection Footprinting—DNA fragments (10 ng) were preincubated with His-π·WT (1.2 μg) or variants of π (His-π·P106L/F107S (0.9 μg) or His-π·M36A/M38A (1.5 μg)) in the binding buffer described above (25-μl final volume) for 15 min at room temperature. Then the DNA was methylated by the addition of 1 μl of DMS followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 min. The complexes were separated on gels and analyzed as described above. Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting—End-labeled DNA fragment (2 ng) was incubated with 300 ng of protein in a 25-μl final volume. Reactions also contained 65 ng of poly(dI-dC) and binding buffer described above. Cleavage was carried out as previously described (28Levchenko I. Filutowicz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1936-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After cleavage, the complexes were separated (6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel), and fragments were eluted and analyzed on a denaturing (7 m urea) 9% acrylamide gel. Incompatibility and EMSA—Plasmid pFL731 was subjected to PCR mutagenesis following a published protocol (29Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar) to create random iteron base pair mutations. The primers used for PCR were 5′-CTAGTCTAGAATTCCCGGGGATCC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACAAGCTTGGCTGCAG-3′. Plasmid pUC9 and the PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI/PstI, and PCR fragments were cloned into pUC9 and tested for incompatibility as follows. Iteron-bearing, penicillin-resistant (PenR) derivatives of pUC9 were transformed into E. coli (strain ECF001) harboring the chloramphenicol-resistant (CamR) γ ori plasmid, pFW25. Transformation mixtures were plated on LB agar supplemented with penicillin (250 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml). Plasmids with a mutant iteron (pFLitn) causing compatibility were isolated and sequenced (ABI Prism 3100), and the iteron DNA was labeled by PCR using the described primers and [α-32P]dATP. These mutated iteron fragments were used for EMSA (20Krüger R. Filutowicz M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2461-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Missing Bases in the Iteron Interfere with π Monomer and π Dimer Binding—Although the importance of some iteron base pairs (bp) for π binding was previously demonstrated both genetically and biochemically (4McEachern M.J. Filutowicz M. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Filutowicz M. Uhlenhopp E. Helinski D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 32: 131-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the relative importance of each bp was not known with regard to binding by π monomers versus dimers, and strand-specific information was similarly lacking. To identify iteron bases that are crucial for π binding, we carried out missing purine and missing pyrimidine interference experiments (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively) with fragments containing a single 22-bp, R6K γ ori iteron (Fig. 1). Nucleoprotein complexes were formed with His-π·P106L/F107S and DNA fragments containing, on average, one missing base. Complexes identified as containing bound monomers or dimers of the protein (see Introduction) were then separated by EMSA for independent analyses. The results for π monomer-bound nucleoprotein complex show that, in the top strand of the DNA, removal of numerous bases throughout the iteron (A3-G7, G9, and T13-G20) severely affected π binding. Additionally, the removal of most other bases showed weak affects. There were only three bases (A1, G11, and A22) whose absence produced no observable effect on the binding of π monomers. In the bottom strand, removal of bases (T8-T10, T15, and A17-A21) severely affected the binding of π monomers. All other bases except T22 (no effect) showed moderate or weak effects when removed. In contrast, for complexes containing π dimer, the removal of only a few bases in the left half of the iteron in either the top strand (A3-G7) or the bottom strand (T8-T10) severely affected π binding. Moderate effects on dimer binding were observed upon the removal of several other bases in top (A1, A2, and A8-A10) and bottom (G4 and A6-C7) strands, localized to the left half of the iteron. Additionally, 4 bottom strand bases showed weak but noticeable effects on π dimer binding (T1-T3 and T5). Missing bases in the right half of the iteron did not reduce binding. No substantial differences were seen between interference footprints of dimer complexes formed with any of the π proteins used (His-π·WT, His-π·P106L/F107S, and His-π·M36A/M38A; see Supplemental Data). Moreover, depurination with DMS (Supplemental Data) yielded similar results to those shown in Fig. 2A (depurination with formic acid). Analysis of the missing base interference data indicates that the interaction of the π monomer with the iteron is more extensive than the dimer's interaction. The positions that interfered with π dimer binding represent a subset of the positions that affected monomer binding and occurred only in the left half of the iteron. (Note that data from these and subsequent experiments are also summarized in Fig. 7) Another interesting observation obtained from close inspection of the footprinting gels (Fig. 2) is that, for the dimer-bound complex, an increase in band intensity, relative to the free DNA signal, sometimes occurs in fragments with missing bases in the right half of the iteron (see “Discussion”). Last, we note as a caveat that distortion of the normal structure of the iteron DNA could significantly contribute to the effect of some of the missing bases, since structural changes can occur up to 4 bp from an abasic site (31Koudelka G.B. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Nature. 1987; 326: 886-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, at least a portion of the interference to π binding caused by missing bases could be attributable to effects on a structure important for recognition by π rather than to the loss of direct base contacts. π/Iteron Major and Minor Groove Contacts Detected by Methylation Interference and Protection Footprinting—The missing base interference experiments suggested that a surprisingly large number of bases in the iteron are important for π monomer binding, whereas fewer bases are important for the binding of π dimers. However, these results did not distinguish which base surfaces (major groove, minor groove, or both) are contacted or, alternatively, whether the interference signals might derive, in some degree, from indirect effects of missing bases on DNA backbone structure (also see “Discussion”). To determine whether π makes specific base contacts with the N-3 position of adenine in the minor groove and the N-7 position of guanine in the major groove, we conducted methylation interference and protection footprinting experiments using DMS. Methylation interference footprinting with modified DNA and His-π·P106L/F107S (Fig. 3A) shows that the modified bases A2, A3, G7, and G16 in the top strand and G19 in the bottom strand strongly interfered with π monomer binding. G12 in the bottom strand showed partial interference. Adenine residues are less reactive to DMS than guanine residues, and, therefore, the intensities of bands at A residues are lower than those for G; this is true even in the absence of bound protein, which tends to de-emphasize protection signals. For dimers, in the top strand, modified bases A2, A3, and G7 strongly interfered with π binding; however, notably, G16 did not. Similar results were also obtained in methylation protection experiments, and the results when His-π·WT was used are shown in Fig. 3B. As seen in the missing base experiments above, methylation interference and protection signals for π monomers were located throughout the iteron, whereas signals for dimers constituted a subset of the monomer signals and were located only in the left half of the iteron. Probing of Iteron Backbone/π Interactions Using Hydroxyl Radicals—Hydroxyl radicals break the backbone of DNA with little sequence dependence; thus, hydroxyl radical footprinting allows all backbone positions to be monitored for contact with protein (32Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Complexes formed with π (His-π·P106L/F107S) were treated with hydroxyl radicals (Fig. 4). Iteron/π monomer binding revealed two clusters of protection, 5-7 bp long, on the top strand (A2-A8 and T14-C19). In the bottom strand, two clusters of protection, offset by 4 or 5 nucleotides in the 5′ direction from those in the top strand (T8-G12 and T18-T22) were observed. Similar results were obtained with monomers of His-π·WT (see Supplemental Data). A helical presentation of this data indicates that π monomer binds, predominantly, to one face of the double-stranded helix protecting positions along two helical turns (see Fig. 7). Iteron/π dimer binding revealed, on each strand, one cluster of protection 5-9 bp long (centered at position A5 on the top strand and T10 on the bottom strand) offset by 4 or 5 nucleotides in the 5′ direction on the two strands. The pattern shows that positions protected by the dimer are a subset of positions protected by the monomer and are located only in left half of the iteron. Similar results were obtained with dimer complexes formed with His-π·WT or with the variant, His-π·M36A/M38A (see Supplemental Data). Enhanced cleavage of the bases in the bottom strand of the iteron (right half) in the presence of dimer suggests possible structural distortion of the DNA upon binding of protein dimers. Isolation of Iteron Mutants with Reduced Ability to Bind π Protein—When cloned into an otherwise compatible plasmid, iterons inhibit the replication of their plasmid of origin; such DNA sequences are said to cause incompatibility (Inc). We took advantage of iteron-mediated incompatibility (33Novick R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 381-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to select for iteron mutants (itn) that are π-binding-deficient. The genetic set-up is shown schematically in Fig. 5. To conduct our experiments, we used an E. coli strain (ECF001) that carried an arabinose-inducible pir gene on its chromosome (22Pluciennik A.

In this report, we have identified an NAD+-binding site within human UGDH by photoaffinity labeling with a specific probe, [32P]nicotinamide 2-azidoadenosine dinucleotide (2N3 NAD+), and cassette mutagenesis. For this work, we have chemically synthesized a 1509-base pair gene encoding human UGDH and expressed it in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein.

Photolabeling of these peptides was effectively prevented by the presence of NAD+ during photolysis, demonstrating a selectivity of the photoprobe for the NAD+-binding site. Amino acid sequencing and compositional analysis identified the NAD+-binding site of UGDH as the region containing the sequence ICCIGAXYVGGPT, corresponding to Ile-7 through Thr-19 of the amino acid sequence of human UGDH. The unidentified residue, X, can be designated as a photolabeled Gly-13 because the sequences including the glycine residue in question have a complete identity with those of other UGDH species known. The importance of Gly-13 residue in the binding of NAD+ was further examined with a G13E mutant by cassette mutagenesis.

Because glucuronate is a component of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the mutation inactivation of UGDH (sugarless) abolishes GAG assembly and, consequently, abolishes GAG-dependent growth factor signaling (9Binari R.C.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). GAG chains of proteoglycans and hyaluronan are ubiquitous components of extracellular matrix and pericellular spaces. There is a growing body of information on the implication of GAGs in cell behavior, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, spreading, migration, and cancer growth and metastasis (15Spicer A.P.

Transforming growth factor-β is the most potent stimulator of proteoglycan and GAG synthesis, including that of hyaluronan. Its action, however, depends on the cell type (18Bassols A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of GAGs is also modulated by oxygen cell status. Hypoxic endothelial cells and lung fibroblasts enhanced the heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate ratio, which led to an increase of basic fibroblast growth factor reactivity on the cell surface (19Karlinsky J.B.

Interestingly, the human UGDH was shown to be an early response gene after interleukin-1 treatment of ocular fibroblasts (21Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), as well as an early androgen response gene in breast cancer (22Lapointe J. Labrie C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4486-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although a clone of human UGDH has been reported (13Marcu O. Stathakis D.G. Marsh J.L. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 86: 244-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol.

Therefore, further characterization of the active sites of human UGDH is needed to elucidate the physiological nature of the UGDH. In the present study, we have identified an NAD+-binding site using photoaffinity labeling and cassette mutagenesis to gain a deeper insight into the structural basis of human UGDH. For this study, a 1509-base pair gene that encodes human UGDH has been chemically synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein. Identification of the nucleotide-binding sites of a variety of proteins has been advanced by the use of nucleotide photoaffinity analogues that selectively insert into a site upon photoactivation with ultraviolet light. For instance, [32P]2N3NAD+ was shown to be a valid active site probe for several proteins (23Campbell S. Kim H. Doukas M. Haley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ATP-binding site of adenylate kinase and creatine kinase and the protein unique to cerebrospinal fluids of Alzheimer's patients successfully also has been identified using 2N3ATP and 8N3ATP (31Gunnersen D.J.

To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying a reactive residue critically involved in the coenzyme binding of the human UGDH. Materials—UDP-glucose, NAD+, ampicillin, isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were purchased from Sigma. 2N3NAD+ and [32P]2N3NAD+ were synthesized using NMN adenyltransferase according to the same method as described previously (26Yoon H.-Y. Cho E.H. Kwon H.Y. Choi S.Y. Cho S.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41448-41454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against human UGDH was kindly provided by Dr. S. Choi (Hallym University, Chunchon, Korea). Precast gels for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from NOVEX. All other chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade or better. Bacterial Strains—E. coli DH5α (33Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8214) Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for plasmid-mediated transformations during the assembly of the synthetic human UGDH gene (pHUGDH) and for cassette mutagenesis. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (34Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4841) Google Scholar) was used for high level expression of the recombinant hUGDH. Design and Assembly of the Synthetic hUGDH Gene—The design of the synthetic hUGDH gene was based on the amino acid sequence of hUGDH (15Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and used the following strategy. First, a DNA sequence containing 37 restriction sites located approximately every 42 bp throughout the entire length of the coding region was selected from the large number of possibilities. Only those sites recognized by commercially available restriction enzymes and that are not located in pUC18 (except in the polylinker region) were included in the final sequence of the gene. The hUGDH gene is flanked by unique EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites that render the gene portable to various E. coli expression vectors. Second, the codon usage of the resulting hUGDH gene was modified to include those triplets that are utilized in highly expressed E. coli genes (35An G. Bendiak D.S. Mamelak L.A. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4163-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 36Gouy M. Gautier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7055-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) while retaining the largest possible number of unique restriction sites. In some cases, suboptimal codons were used either to allow the inclusion of unique restriction sites or to preclude redundant sites. Third, a ribosome-binding site AGGAGG (37Stormo G.D. Reznikoff W. Gold L. Maximizing Gene Expression. Butterworth, Stoneham, MA1986: 195-224Crossref Google Scholar) was added 10 bases upstream of the coding region to direct the initiation of translation in E. coli. The sequence adjacent to the ribosome-binding site included an A at position –3 relative to the ATG, and the spacer region (–1 to –9) was made A + T-rich to reduce potential mRNA secondary structure in the vicinity of the translation start site (37Stormo G.D. Reznikoff W. Gold L. Maximizing Gene Expression. Butterworth, Stoneham, MA1986: 195-224Crossref Google Scholar). Addition of a ribosome-binding site made the synthetic hUGDH gene portable to any of a number of commonly available plasmid vectors that carry inducible E. coli promoters. The hUGDH gene was assembled from seven gene segments that were initially cloned into pUC18. Each of the gene segments was constructed with 2–4 oligonucleotides. 6–7 isolates of each segment were examined by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. The final synthetic hUGDH gene, designated as pHUGDH, was used for gene expression and mutagenesis studies. Protein Purification and Characterization—Fresh overnight cultures of DE3/pHUGDH were used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria-Bertani (LB) containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. DE3/pHUGDH was grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 1.0, and then isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside induction, DE3/pHUGDH was grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C and then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 100 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol and lysed with a sonicator. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the crude extract was loaded onto a blue Sepharose CL-6B column that was equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The column was washed with buffer A until the breakthrough peak of protein had been eluted. The enzyme was then eluted by a gradient up to 500 mm NaCl. The fractions containing hUGDH were pooled and concentrated, and the buffer was changed to buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using Amicon concentrator, after which the fractions were applied to a fast protein liquid chromatography Resource-Q column equilibrated with buffer B. The enzyme was then eluted using a linear gradient made with buffer B in increasing concentrations of NaCl (from 0 to 300 mm) at 3 ml/min. The fractions containing hUGDH were pooled and concentrated. The purified enzymes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and recognized by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies against the hUGDH. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217399) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme Assay and Kinetic Studies—hUGDH activity was measured with NAD+ in 100 mm sodium glycine, pH 8.7, and 1 mm UDP-glucose at 25 °C. The reaction started by the addition of NAD+ to 1 mm final concentration. One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 2 μmol of NAD+/min at 25 °C. For determination of Km and Vmax values, the assays were carried out by varying the substrate under investigation while keeping the other substrate and reagents at the optimal concentration indicated above. The Km and Vmax values were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation and assuming a single binding site each for the substrate and cofactor. Catalytic efficiency was estimated by use of the equation v/[E0] = (kcat/Km)[S] (39Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman, New York1985: 98-120Google Scholar). Photolabeling of hUGDH with [32P]2N3NAD+—Photolabeling of the wild-type hUGDH with [32P]2N3NAD+ was performed by the method of Yoon et al. (26Yoon H.-Y. Cho E.H. Kwon H.Y. Choi S.Y. Cho S.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41448-41454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. For saturation studies, the wild-type hUGDH (100 μg) in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, was incubated with various concentrations of [32P]2N3NAD+ in Eppendorf tubes for 5 min. For competition studies, 100 μg of enzyme was incubated with various concentrations of NAD+ for 10 min in the same buffer prior to the addition of 50 μm [32P]2N3NAD+ and then allowed to incubate with the photoprobe for 5 min as described above. The samples were irradiated with a handheld 254-nm UV lamp for 90 s twice at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final 7%). The reaction mixtures were kept on the ice bath for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed and resuspended with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0. The remaining free photoprobe, if any, was further removed from the protein by exhaustive washing using Centrifree (Amicon), and 32P incorporation into protein was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Tryptic Digestion and Isolation of Photolabeled Peptide—To determine the site modified by [32P]2N3NAD+, 1.0 mg of the wild-type hUGDH in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, was incubated with 200 μm [32P]2N3NAD+ for 5 min at 4 °C. The mixtures were irradiated for 90 s twice. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final 7%) and kept at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 75 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, containing 2 m urea. The enzymes were proteolyzed by the addition of 15 μg of trypsin and kept at room temperature for 3 h, after which time 15 μg of trypsin was added again. After an additional 3 h at room temperature, 20 μgof trypsin was added, and the digestion mixture was kept at 25 °C overnight. To validate that the isolated peptide was specific for the NAD+-binding site and could be protected from photomodification, the hUGDH proteins were also photolyzed in the presence of 300 μm NAD+ and proteolyzed as described above. The trypsin-digested peptides were separated by the phosphopeptide isolation kit from Pierce following the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced by the Edman degradation method as described before (26Yoon H.-Y. Cho E.H. Kwon H.Y. Choi S.Y. Cho S.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41448-41454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Construction and Purification of the G13E Mutant—Single amino acid substitution of Gly-13 was constructed by cassette mutagenesis of plasmid pHUGDH. Plasmid DNA (5 μg) was digested with BstBI and SalI to remove the 98-bp fragment that encodes amino acids 3–35, and vector DNA was purified by electrophoresis using 1% low melting point agarose. The 98-bp BstBI/SalI fragment was replaced with a 98-bp synthetic DNA duplex containing a substitution on both DNA strands at positions encoding Gly-13 to make the G13E mutant protein. The mutagenic oligonucleotide was annealed, ligated, and transformed into DH5α as described above, and G13E mutant was identified by DNA sequencing using plasmid DNA as a template. G13E mutant was expressed in E. coli strain DE3 and purified to homogeneity as described above. Construction of the Synthetic hUGDH Gene and Expression—The gene was initially constructed as three segments using the plasmid pUC18 as a cloning vector (Fig. 1). A total of 20 synthetic oligonucleotides that varied from 56 to 92 nucleotides in length were used to assemble the three segments. The ends of the segments were chosen from restriction sites present in the polylinker of pUC18 to allow stepwise assembly in that vector. The three segments were, respectively, a 486-bp EcoRI/PstI fragment composed of 6 oligonucleotides, a 580-bp PstI/AgeI fragment composed of 7 oligonucleotides, and a 443-bp AgeI/HindIII fragment composed of 7 oligonucleotides (Fig. 1). Several isolates of each of the gene segments were characterized by DNA sequencing. Based on the sequencing of several isolates of each gene segment, an overall mutation frequency of ∼3/1000 bp synthesized was observed and corrected to the designed sequence using a standard cassette mutagenesis procedure. The designed sequence and position of 37 restriction sites in the hUGDH coding region of pHUGDH are shown in Fig. 2. High level expression of the synthetic hUGDH gene was achieved by transformation of pHUGDH into E. coli strain DE3. Upon induction with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside at 37 °C for 3 h, expression of hUGDH in soluble extracts was about 0.163 units/mg. SDS-PAGE analysis of crude cell extracts and measurement of specific activities indicated that pHUGDH directed hUGDH expression to a level of ∼16% of total cellular protein upon induction with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (Fig. 3).Fig. 2DNA sequence of the synthetic hUGDH gene carried in pHUGDH. Numbers on the left refer to amino acids (upper) and DNA (lower). Only the unique restriction sites are shown. Position 1 of the amino acid sequence corresponds to the first amino acid (Met) of the human UGDH (15Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol.

Because the recombinant hUGDH was readily solubilized, no detergents were required throughout the entirety of the purification steps. The purified hUGDH was estimated to be >98% pure by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). No additional amino acids such as N-terminal histidine tags or protease recognition sites were introduced in the synthetic hUGDH gene product (Fig. 2). N-terminal sequence analysis of the first 7 amino acids (MFEIKKI) is in agreement with the published sequence of human UGDH (15Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The subunit size (57 kDa) and the native size (340 kDa) of the hexameric recombinant hUGDH were determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) and HPLC-gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), respectively. The 57-kDa protein was absent in extracts from DE3 transformed with pUC18 (Fig. 3). The highly purified enzyme was a mixture of hexamer, tetramer, and dimer as determined by HPLC gel filtration. The hUGDH was predominantly observed as a hexamer together with significant tetrameric and dimeric species, indicating some subunit dissociation. Although relative species ratios were conserved over several different preparations of the enzyme, the ratio of the oligomeric state was changed by storage conditions and periods. UGDH catalyzes conversion of a UDP-glucose substrate to a UDP-glucuronic acid product, concomitantly reducing 2 molecules of NAD+ to NADH. The enzymatic activity of hUGDH was characterized by steady state kinetic analysis. Measurements to determine dependence of the reaction on cofactor concentration were done using purified hUGDH incubated with increasing concentrations of NAD+ in the presence of saturating UDP-glucose substrate. Similarly, dependence of reaction kinetics on substrate was measured by increasing UDP-glucose concentration in the presence of saturating NAD+. Saturation kinetic data were observed for both conditions. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Km and Vmax for the reaction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme. Both sets of conditions yielded a similar Vmax of 157 ± 5 nmol of NAD+/min/mg of enzyme (Fig. 4, A and B). The Km for UDP-glucose was 17 ± 3 μm (Fig. 4A), and the Km for NAD+ was 133 ± 4 μm (Fig. 4B). For more detailed catalytic properties of hUGDH, the enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) for the individual substrates was determined (Table I). The kcat value of hUGDH was 105 ± 4s–1, and the kcat/Km values for NAD+ and UDP-Glc were 7.9 ± 1.0 s–1·μm–1 and 6.2 ± 1.3 s–1·μm–1, respectively (Table I).Table IKinetic properties of hUGDH and G13E mutantkcatKmkcat/KmNAD+UDP-GlcNAD+UDP-Glcs-1μms-1·μm-1hUGDH105±4133±417±37.0 ± 1.06.2 ± 1.3G13E mutantNegligibleaNot detectable under standard reaction conditions and found less than 0.05% activity relative to wild-type enzyme after measuring activity for 3 h.NegligibleNegligibleNegligibleNegligiblea Not detectable under standard reaction conditions and found less than 0.05% activity relative to wild-type enzyme after measuring activity for 3 h. Open table in a new tab Specific Binding of 2N3NAD+to hUGDH—The reactive amino acid in the direct binding of NAD+ to hUGDH was identified by photoaffinity labeling with [32P]nicotinamide 2-azidoadenosine dinucleotide (2N3NAD+). To show specificity of the photoprobe-protein interaction, saturation of photoinsertion should be observed. For demonstrating saturation effects with the photoprobe, the purified enzymes were photolabeled with increasing concentrations of [32P]2N3NAD+. Under the experimental conditions described, saturation of photoinsertion with [32P]2N3NAD+ occurred at around 120 μm photoprobe (Fig. 5). In all photolabeling experiments, the ionic strength was kept low to enhance binding affinity, as we have observed in general that the lower the ionic strength is, the tighter the binding of nucleotide photoaffinity probes and the more efficient the photoinsertion are (26Yoon H.-Y. Cho E.H. Kwon H.Y. Choi S.Y. Cho S.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41448-41454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 5 demonstrate the apparent Kd value of ∼48 μm, which is in reasonably good agreement with the recently reported Kd value (118 μm) of NAD+ with hUGDH (40Sommer B.J. Barycki J.J. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23590-23596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of [32P]2N3NAD+ incorporation was estimated to be 3 mol of the label/hexameric enzyme. The results in Fig. 5 indicate the saturability of the NAD+-specific site of hUGDH with this photoprobe and therefore decrease the possibility of nonspecific photoinsertion. To further demonstrate specific labeling of hUGDH, the wild-type hUGDH was photolabeled with [32P]2N3NAD+ in the presence of increasing NAD+ concentrations. As shown in the results of the competition experiments (Fig. 6), NAD+ at concentrations in the range of Km values was able to protect photolabeling from [32P]2N3NAD+. Approximately 95% protection was observed with 160 μm NAD+ for the wild-type hUGDH (Fig. 6). These results show the specificity and utility of [32P]2N3NAD+ as a good probe for determining the NAD+-binding site.Fig. 6Effect of NAD+ on photoinsertion of [32P]2N3 NAD+ into hUGDH. The wild-type hUGDH and the G13E mutant in the reaction buffer were photolyzed with 50 μm [32P]2N3NAD+ in the presence of the indicated concentrations of NAD+. 32P incorporations into proteins were determined by"
