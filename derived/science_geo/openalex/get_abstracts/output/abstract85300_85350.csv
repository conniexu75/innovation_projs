https://openalex.org/W1496654715,"Adenylate cyclase of rat adipocyte membranes exhibited dual responses in a strictly GTP-dependent manner; an activation took place in the presence of certain receptor agonists such as isoproterenol or secretin, whereas an inhibitory phase was observed with other agonists such as prostaglandin E1 or purine-modified adenosine as well as with the stimulatory agonists at higher GTP concentrations. Treatment of membrane donor cells with islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, abolished the inhibitory phase while preserving the activatory phase. This unique action of IAP was associated with ADP-ribosylation of a membrane Mr = 41,000 protein. In contrast, the inhibitory phase was preserved in membranes from cholera toxin-treated cells. Monophasic and persistent activation of the cyclase was provoked by guanyl-5'-yl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate. The time lag normally observed for the guanyl-5'-yl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate activation was decreased by isoproterenol or cholera toxin but was not altered by IAP treatment. Our conclusion is that the sole site of IAP action is the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni) that is required for transmission of inhibitory signals from receptors to the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase; the function of Ni is lost upon IAP-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of the Mr = 41,000 protein which appears to be an active subunit of Ni. A possibility is discussed that rather diverse effects of IAP so far reported with various cell types are accounted for in terms of such interference with the function of Ni."

The segment necessary for stabilization has been located within a 3.0 kb segment outside of the region essential for autonomous replication of the F plasmid. This segment contains three functionally distinct regions: two of them (designated sopA and sopB) specify gene products that act in trans, whereas the third region (sopC) acts in cis. All three functions seem to be essential for normal partition of the plasmid into daughter cells during cell division. The cis-acting region also specifies plasmid incompatibility."
https://openalex.org/W2066027429,"Recently we described a saturable, high-affinity binding site for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) on the surface of Vero cells that appears to mediate viral infectivity. To isolate this binding site, we have extracted Vero cells with the detergent, octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The dialyzed detergent extract specifically inhibits the saturable, high-affinity binding of 35S-methionine-labeled VSV to Vero cells. The inhibitory activity is resistant to protease, neuraminidase and heating to 100 degrees C. It is soluble in chloroform-methanol and inactivated by phospholipase C, suggesting that it is a phospholipid. Of various purified lipids tested, only phosphatidylserine was capable of totally inhibiting the high-affinity binding of VSV. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration for phosphatidylserine was 1 microM. Phosphatidylserine also inhibited VSV plaque formation by 80%-90%; Herpes simplex virus plaque formation was unaffected. Centrifugation and electron microscopy studies have shown that phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes bind to VSV. The finding that phosphatidylserine directly binds to VSV and inhibits VSV attachment and infectivity suggests that plasma membrane phosphatidylserine could function as a binding site or portion of a binding site for VSV."
https://openalex.org/W2089219831,"Activation of gene expression by the SV40 72 bp repeat was studied at the transcriptional level by quantitative S1 nuclease mapping of total RNA isolated from Hela cells transfected with chimeric con-albumin promoter-SV40 early gene recombinants. Our results demonstrate that, irrespective of its orientation, the 72 bp repeat is a potentiator of initiation of transcription from “TATA”-box-dependent and -independent “natural” or “substitute” promoter elements. In addition, we show that potential proximal promoter sequences are activated in preference to more distal ones. These results are consistent with the bidirectional entry site model for transcription activation by the 72 bp repeat."
https://openalex.org/W2038538652,"Abstract The yeast endonuclease and ligase activities that carry out the splicing of tRNA precursors in vitro have been physically separated. The properties of a partially purified ligase fraction were examined. The ligase requires a divalent cation and a nucleoside triphosphate as cofactor. The product of ligation is a 2′-phosphomonoester, 3′,5′-phosphodiester linkage. The phosphate in the newly formed phosphodiester bond comes from the γ position of ATP, while the 2′ phosphate is derived from the RNA substrate. An adenylylated enzyme intermediate was identified by incorporation of label from α- 32 P-ATP. Adenylylation was reversed by pyrophosphate, releasing ATP, whereas ligation was accompanied by release of AMP. Polynucleotide kinase and cyclic phosphodiesterase activities copurify with the adenylylated protein and may be required for the tRNA splicing reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1517513338,"Previous work has shown that the permanent adhesive of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis is a protein containing large amounts of hydroxyproline (13%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa, 11%). The protein also known as the polyphenolic protein is produced and stored in the exocrine phenol gland of the mussel and deposited onto marine surfaces by the animal's foot during the formation of new adhesive plaques. The adhesive protein has been purified by a combination of ion exchange on sulfonylpropyl-Sephadex and gel filtration on low surface energy chromatographic media. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein at acidic pH shows it to consist of two components having a molecular weight of about 130,000. Treatment of the protein with clostridial collagenase reduced the molecular weight by less than 10%. The collagenase-resistant fragment contains most or all of the Hyp and Dopa. Trypsin treatment of the polyphenolic protein results in extensive degradation. The major tryptic peptide (80%) contains 10 amino acids including Hyp and Dopa and was shown by sequence analysis to be H2N-Ala-Lys-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Hyp-Hyp-Thr-Dopa-Lys-COOH. Calculations suggest that this and related sequences may be repeated as often as 75 times in the polyphenolic protein."
https://openalex.org/W1561511774,"We have performed a detailed analysis of all the anionic oligosaccharides released by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H from the whole cell glycoproteins of P388D1 mouse macrophage-like cells labeled for 14 h with [2-3H]mannose. The major anionic species consisted of phosphorylated high mannose-type oligosaccharides containing one or two phosphomonoesters or phosphodiesters in several different positions. In addition we identified hybrid-type molecules containing one, two, or three sialic acid residues. A subset of the latter molecules also contained phosphodiesters or phosphomonoesters on another branch of the same oligosaccharide. Unlike previously reported hybrid-type molecules, these do not have a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue on the beta-linked mannose. Some of these oligosaccharides contained an unidentified acid-labile group on the core N-acetylglucosamine or the beta-linked mannose. The glycoproteins secreted by these cells were greatly enriched in hybrid oligosaccharides containing one sialic acid and one phosphomonoester. The interaction of the isolated oligosaccharides with bovine liver phosphomannosyl receptor immobilized on Affigel was analyzed. Oligosaccharides with phosphomonoesters were the only species that interacted with high affinity with the receptor, and molecules with two phosphomonoesters showed the best binding. The location of the phosphomonoester on the oligosaccharide influenced the degree of interaction with the receptor. Removal of accessible nonphosphorylated mannose residues improved the binding in some cases. These findings indicate that the generation of the physiological phosphomannosyl ligand on lysosomal enzymes involves removal of the blocking N-acetylglucosamine residues, trimming of certain mannose residues, and correct positioning of the phosphate esters."
https://openalex.org/W1495765353,"A type IV collagen-degrading enzyme activity secreted by a highly metastatic mouse tumor was purified by concanavalin A- and type IV collagen-agarose affinity chromatographies followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-0.5 m. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was 160,000 but about 70,000 when Triton X-100 was added to the column buffer. The purified enzyme protein was resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into two polypeptide chains of about 68,000 and 62,000 daltons. The enzyme activity could be increased by preincubation with trypsin and it is possible that the two chains represent latent and active enzyme forms. The enzyme activity was not reduced in the presence of dithiothreitol, it had a pH optimum of 7.6 and was inhibited by EDTA but not N-ethylmaleimide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, or Trasylol. The inhibition with EDTA was reversible. The pro-alpha 1(IV) and pro-alpha 2(IV) chains of the type IV procollagen substrate were both degraded at a similar rate to form two pairs of degradation fragments corresponding in molecular weights to about 70 and 30% of the original size chains. The presence of Triton X-100 increased slightly the activity of the enzyme and diminished the reduction of its activity upon freezing, indicating that the enzyme is a hydrophobic protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497925081,"Rat liver fatty acid binding protein mRNA is present in both liver and intestinal epithelium. It is the most abundant mRNA in the small intestinal mucosa. We have determined the sequence of this mRNA from cloned cDNA. It consists of a 5'-nontranslated domain at least 39 nucleotides long, a coding region which specifies a 127-amino acid, 14,184-dalton polypeptide, and a 3'-nontranslated region 68 nucleotides long. An AAUAAA sequence begins 21 nucleotides before the 3'-terminal poly(A) tail. The derived protein sequence was verified by automated sequential Edman degradation of (i) the primary translation product of the mRNA and (ii) a cyanogen bromide peptide generated from the mature liver protein. Evidence is presented which suggests that this protein is targeted to the cytoplasm. The NH2 terminus of the primary translation product is acetylated in vitro. No cleavable signal peptide sequence or internal signal sequence equivalent was detectable in a co-translational cleavage assay. Cloned cDNA was used to establish that this mRNA was 12 times more abundant in intestinal epithelial than in liver RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1984240546,"Clonal BALB/c mouse epidermal keratinocyte (BALB/MK) cell lines were established in tissue culture. Despite their aneuploid nature, the lines were nontumorigenic, and retained in vitro properties similar to those of primary diploid keratinocytes. These included the constitutive expression of keratin and terminal differentiation in response to a calcium concentration greater than 1.0 mM in the medium. The cells also demonstrated an absolute requirement for nanomolar concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) for their proliferation. BALB or Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses are acute transforming retroviruses, which have been shown to transform fibroblastic and hematopoietic cells. Infection of BALB/MK or its clonal sublines with either virus leads to the rapid acquisition of EGF-independent growth. The cells concomitantly lose their sensitivity to calcium-induced terminal differentiation. Thus these retroviruses can rapidly confer upon epithelial keratinocytes in culture growth properties that resemble those of malignant epidermoid carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030628776,"The DNA sequences of two optional introns in the gene for subunit I of cytochome c oxidase in yeast mitochondrial DNA have been determined. Both contain long unassigned reading frames (URFs). These display regions of amino acid homology with six other URFs, two of which encode proteins involved in mitochondrial RNA splicing. Such conserved regions may thus define functionally important domains of proteins involved in RNA processing. This homology also implies that these URFs had a common ancestral sequence, which has been duplicated and dispersed around the genome. Comparison of the flanking exons in the long strain KL14-4A with their unsplit counterpart in D273-10B reveals clustered sequence differences, which lead in D273-10B to codons rarely used in exons. These differences may be linked to the loss or absence of one of the optional introns."
https://openalex.org/W2039793235,"The N protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, prepared in a soluble form, was found to self-assemble, and to assemble with RNAs into RNAase-resistant structures with the buoyant density of viral nucleocapsids. It selectively assembled leader RNAs over other viral transcripts. The basis for this selective encapsidation was not the relative size of the viral transcripts or the presence or absence of a 5' cap group, but was sequence-dependent. Partial-assembly experiments demonstrated that leader RNA assembly started within the first 14 nucleotides at the 5' end. Examination of known leader RNA sequences suggests that the sequence responsible for selective assembly by N protein is a five-times-repeated A residue at every third position from the 5' end of the leader chain."
https://openalex.org/W1584920009,"Limited proteolysis can be used to remove either 42 or 62 amino acids at the COOH terminus of the 18,873-dalton Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). Since poly(dT), but not d(pT)16, increases the rate of this reaction, it appears that cooperative SSB binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is associated with a conformational change that increases the exposure of the COOH terminus to proteolysis. As a result of this DNA-induced conformational change, we presume that the COOH-terminal region of SSB will become more accessible for interacting with other proteins that utilize the SSB:ssDNA complex as a substrate and that are involved in E. coli DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Removal of this COOH-terminal domain from SSB results in a stronger helix-destabilizing protein which suggests this region may be important for controlling the ability of SSB to denature double-stranded DNA. Since similar results have previously been reported for the bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein (Williams, K.R., and Konigsberg, W. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 2463-2470; Hosoda, J., and Moise, H. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7547-7555), the acidic, COOH-terminal domains of these two single-stranded DNA binding proteins may be functionally homologous. Preliminary evidence is cited that suggests other prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA binding proteins may contain similar functional domains essential for controlling their ability to invade double helical DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2125992715,"Control of the initiation of meiosis was examined in diploids of yeast homozygous for two temperature-sensitive mutations, cyr1 and CYR3, which are defective in adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. The cyr1 and CYR3 mutations permitted the initiation of meiosis, but resulted in the frequent production of two-spored asci at the restrictive temperature. Unlike the wild-type diploid cells, the cyr1 and CYR3 homozygous diploid cells were capable of initiating meiosis even in nutrient growth media. This unique feature of the cyr1 and CYR3 mutants suggests that these mutations relate to the choice between mitotic and meiotic processes. In diploids homozygous for the bcy1 mutation that results in deficiency of the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and production of a high level of the catalytic subunit of this enzyme, no premeiotic DNA replication and commitment to intragenic recombination occurred, and no spores were formed. We conclude that the initiation of meiosis may be dependent upon the repression of cAMP production and the inactivation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1551647770,"The binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid were studied in primary monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes. Ligand entered the cell bound to the asialoglycoprotein receptor and subsequently dissociated from the receptor intracellularly. Rate coefficients for each of the transitions that constitute the endocytic pathway were computed. Subcellular fractionation on Percoll gradients revealed that prior to localization in lysosomes, 125I-asialo-orosomucoid resided in a fraction of slightly lower buoyant density than plasma membranes. Neither ammonium chloride (20 mM) nor leupeptin (0.1 mg/ml) affected ligand binding or internalization of prebound ligand. However, both reagents inhibited degradation of ligand by greater than 95%. Of the two, only ammonium chloride inhibited receptor-ligand dissociation. Ammonium chloride treatment resulted in the accumulation of ligand in the prelysosomal fraction. In contrast, exposure of cells to leupeptin led to accumulation of ligand within lysosomes. The results are interpreted in terms of pH-mediated dissociation of ligand-receptor complex within a nonlysosomal endocytic vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W2007784773,"Avian erythroblastosis virus causes erythroid leukemia and sarcomas in chickens. The viral oncogene responsible for these diseases, erb, is divided into two regions known as erbA and erbB, and recent evidence suggests that it is the erbB gene that is responsible for the transforming activity. From rats bearing avian erythroblastosis virus-induced sarcomas, we have obtained antisera which are specific for the erb gene products. Using such antisera, we have been able to characterize the erbB gene product as a 68,000 molecular weight protein. Pulse-chase and cell-free in vitro translation experiments show that the initial product is a 62,500 dalton protein which is initially modified to a 66,000 dalton protein, and then further modified to a 68,000 dalton form. These modifications could be shown to be associated with glycosylation and phosphorylation. Cell fractionation experiments revealed that the 66,000 and 68,000 dalton proteins were located in cell membrane fractions, and immunofluorescence results showed the erbB gene product to be expressed on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2075228155,"A readily sedimentable nuclear fraction from Chinese hamster embryo fibroblast (CHEF/18) cells catalyzes incorporation of 14C-rCDP into DNA. Data indicated that this incorporation is made possible by the conversion of rCDP into a small and functionally compartmentalized, rather than a large and freely diffusible, pool of dCTP. This catalytically active sedimentable fraction from S phase CHEF/18 cells or actively replicating calf thymus cells contains nascent and template DNA, and numerous enzymes required for DNA biosynthesis including ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, thymidylate synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase, DNA methylase, topoisomerase and DNA polymerase. We have named this catalytically active macromolecule the replitase. The replitase fraction contained spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 24 to 30 nm and had an estimated molecular weight on the order of 5 X 10(6)."

https://openalex.org/W207827982,"A cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase has been isolated from Drosophila melanogaster by chromatography on phosphocellulose and hydroxylapatite followed by gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation. As determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme is greater than 95% homogeneous and is composed of two distinct subunits, alpha and beta, having Mr = 36,700 and 28,200, respectively. The native form of the enzyme is an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer having a Stokes radius of 48 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 6.4 S, and Mr approximately 130,000. The purified kinase undergoes an autocatalytic reaction resulting in the specific phosphorylation of the beta subunit, exhibits a low apparent Km for both ATP and GTP as nucleoside triphosphate donor (17 and 66 microM, respectively), phosphorylates both casein and phosvitin but neither histones nor protamine, modifies both serine and threonine residues in casein, and is strongly inhibited by heparin (I50 = 21 ng/ml). These properties are remarkably similar to those of casein kinase II, an enzyme previously described in several mammalian and avian species. The strong similarities among the insect, avian, and mammalian enzymes suggest that casein kinase II has been highly conserved during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1499297475,"Hepatocyte phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4,5-P2), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (4-P), and phosphatidylinositol were labeled with 3H when rats were injected intraperitoneally with 200 microCi of [2-3H] myo-inositol 18 h previously. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-P accounted for 0.84 +/- 0.06 and 7.48 +/- 0.36%, respectively, of the total [3H] myo-inositol containing phospholipids. The breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 was stimulated transiently (maximum effect seen at 15 s) and in a Ca2+-dependent manner by 10(-8) M vasopressin. Phosphatidylinositol 4-P breakdown was enhanced to a smaller, but longer, extent by vasopressin, whereas no changes in phosphatidylinositol were detected up to 120 s. Subcellular fractionation studies also showed no preferential breakdown of phosphatidylinositol in plasma membranes at 5-20 min. Only doses of vasopressin (10(-8) and 10(-7) M) in excess of those producing maximum effects on phosphorylase activation and Ca2+ efflux (10(-9) M) were effective at stimulating phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 breakdown. It is concluded that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 breakdown induced by vasopressin in rat hepatocytes is not responsible for the mobilization of Ca2+ which leads to the activation of phosphorylase. On the contrary, it is Ca2+-dependent and appears to require the occupation of more receptors than are required for Ca2+ mobilization and phosphorylase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1608829034,"The receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) has been purified to near homogeneity from octylglucoside extracts of A875 melanoma cell membranes by the use of repetitive affinity chromatography on NGF-Sepharose. Elution of purified receptor (NGF receptor) was accomplished with 0.15 M NaCl, pH 11.0, containing phosphatidylcholine and octylglucoside. Chromatography on two columns of NGF-Sepharose yielded a 1500-fold purification of the receptor, as assessed by 125I-NGF binding, and permitted recovery of 9% of the total binding activity in the soluble extract. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding of 125I-NGF provided similar Kd values for NGF receptors in soluble extracts of A875 membranes (2.2 nM) and with purified NGF receptor (3.1 nM). Examination of NGF receptor after electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed the presence of two major peptides, of Mr = 85,000 and Mr = 200,000. Affinity labeling experiments, done with 125I-NGF and A875 cells, soluble extracts of A875 cell membranes, and purified receptor, show that both of these components of the NGF receptor can be specifically cross-linked to 125I-NGF."

https://openalex.org/W1587253456,Adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ATP beta S) and guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (GTP beta S) were used to demonstrate initiation of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA in preparations of whole nuclei from control and glucocorticoid-treated MMTV-infected rat hepatoma tissue culture cells. RNA chains initiated in the cell-free reaction retain a thiol group at the 5' end and can be separated from thiol-free RNA chains by chromatography on mercury-Sepharose. The abundance of MMTV sequences was determined by nucleic acid hybridization with filter-bound DNA representing four different regions of the MMTV genome. About six times more MMTV RNA is initiated with GTP beta S than with ATP beta S. Most of the cell-free initiation of MMTV RNA occurs within or very near a 380-nucleotide section of the proviral long terminal repeat that is the presumptive site of transcription initiation in vivo. The sensitivity of MMTV RNA initiation and synthesis to alpha-amanitin and actinomycin D are characteristic of DNA-directed transcription by RNA polymerase II. Nuclei from glucocorticoid-treated cells initiate approximately 10 times more MMTV RNA than nuclei from control cells.
https://openalex.org/W1980223495,"We have isolated phage clones containing the D. melanogaster sequence homologous to the v-abl oncogene, and two types of phage clones containing sequences homologous to the v-src probe. The D. melanogaster abl clone (lambda Dabl1) and one of the src clones (lambda Dsrc1) hybridize with both v-abl and v-src probes, and both map in situ to the same chromosomal position, 73B, on chromosome arm 3L. The second D. melanogaster src clone (lambda Dsrc2) does not react with the v-abl probe and hybridizes in situ to chromosomal position 64B. The hybridization pattern suggests that the src and abl cellular oncogenes have evolved from a common prototype sequence. The homologous sequences in D. melanogaster exhibit hybridization to regions in the vertebrate v-abl and v-src that are important for kinase activity and transforming potential of the viral gene products."

The F0-subunit b was predominantly labeled. A very low amount of label was detected on the other F0-subunits a and c. The label in subunit b could be traced back by proteolytic digestion to the NH2-terminal fragment 1 to 53 which contains the stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues 1 to 32. By sequencing the intact protein, the distribution of label among the amino acids in this segment was determined. Cysteine 21 was predominantly labeled. Other labeled amino acids occurred at the NH2-terminal (Asn-2) and at position 26 (tryptophan). Due to the restricted mobility of the label in the lipid bilayer, these residues are suggested to be located in or close to the polar head of the lipid bilayer. These results will be compared with predictions for the arrangement of the polypeptide b derived from the hydrophobicity profile."

https://openalex.org/W1679190390,"Selective transcription of hybrid plasmids containing yeast rDNA was achieved with a template-dependent S100 fraction from whole cell extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A small region of the yeast rDNA which directs selective initiation in vitro was identified by subcloning. An initiation site was mapped within this region on the basis of the molecular weights of transcripts synthesized in vitro from templates which were cleaved with restriction endonucleases at a series of sites downstream from the site of initiation. The initiation site maps to a position 3.0 kilobase pairs upstream from the sequences which encode the 5' terminus of 18 S rRNA. In vitro initiation from this site is not inhibited by 50 micrograms/ml of alpha-amanitin and is completely abolished when the reactions contain 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4. Based on these data, selective transcription of yeast rDNA in vitro is RNA polymerase I-dependent. Several S1 nuclease-resistant hybrids are formed between DNA probes labeled at restriction endonuclease sites downstream from the in vitro initiation site and high molecular weight cellular RNA. The 5' terminus of the most abundant rRNA precursor maps approximately 0.7 kilobase pair upstream from sequences which encode the 5' terminus of 18 S rRNA. This corresponds to the 5' terminus of the 35 S rRNA precursor reported by others. The 5' terminus of the largest detectable precursor synthesized in vivo corresponds closely with the initiation site identified in vitro. Based on the data presented here, RNA polymerase I traverses the interspersed 5 S rRNA gene. Since these two ribosomal genes are transcribed in opposite directions, this arrangement of the RNA polymerase I and III promoters may ensure that equivalent amounts of the two gene products are synthesized in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1564000058,The specific binding of various concentrations of 125I-labeled nerve growth factor (NGF) to PC12 cells at 37 degrees C reached maxima after 90 min and then declined to 25% of maximal binding after 10 h. Decreased binding was accompanied by degradation of 125I-NGF and the appearance of acid-soluble biologically inactive 125I (mainly 125I-monoiodotyrosine) in the medium as well as a decrease in the number of surface NGF receptors. The time-dependent decrease in binding and the degradation of 125I-NGF were inhibited by low temperature and the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine while degradation was inhibited by metabolic energy inhibitors in the absence of glucose. Chloroquine also produced an increase in the accumulation of 125I-NGF which was not readily removed from the cells. These data suggest that 125I-NGF bound to PC12 cells is efficiently internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degraded by the lysosomes. It appears from other data that this process does not produce the intracellular signals regulating neurite outgrowth.

Double-stranded DNA synthesized from the purified mRNA preparation was inserted into the PstI site of pBR322, using the oligo(dG-dC) tailing procedure. Clones containing DNA complementary to vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein mRNA were selected by differential colony hybridization with [32P] cDNA synthesized from enriched or low vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein mRNA preparations. Plasmid DNAs from the selected clones were each verified by both a solution hybrid-arrest assay and a filter hybrid-selection assay.

https://openalex.org/W1539696604,"Effects of the S-S cross-linking reagent, Cu2+-o-phenanthroline (CuP), on salt conductances of gastric vesicle membranes in which the (H+ + K+)-ATPase is present were studied. CuP caused a dose-dependent increase in the KCl conductance of the vesicle membrane. The increase of the KCl conductance caused by 10 microM CuP was completely prevented by 0.3 mM ATP or 0.3 mM adenyl 5'-yl imidodiphosphate and partially prevented by ADP. The NaCl conductance was also increased by the CuP reaction. However, CuP has no effect on the K2SO4 conductance. Pretreatments of vesicles with 0.1 mM 4-acetoamide-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, an anion channel inhibitor, completely blocked the effect of CuP. Thus, these effects of CuP are ascribable to the increase in the anion conductance of the vesicle membrane produced by S-S cross-linking. Furthermore, tyrosine-tyrosine cross-linking with tetranitromethane also increases the anion conductance. Probable roles of the opening of the closed anion channel of the ATPase were discussed in regard to the acid secretory mechanism of gastric mucosa."

https://openalex.org/W1503335744,"We have isolated a cloned segment of the chick alpha 1 type III collagen gene from a genomic DNA library. This DNA clone was obtained by cross-hybridization with a cDNA clone containing sequences coding for a segment of the carboxy propeptide of chick alpha 1 type I collagen. This genomic clone was identified as coding for alpha 1 type III collagen by DNA sequence analysis of two segments of the gene and by its ability to hybridize to crop mRNA but not to calvaria mRNA in agreement with the presence of alpha 1 type III collagen in crop but not in calvaria. The deduced amino acid sequences reveal characteristic features for alpha 1 type III collagen and are in good agreement with the known protein sequences of calf and human alpha 1 type III collagen. The size of alpha 1 type III mRNA is about 6 kilobases, slightly larger than the mRNA for alpha 1 type I. R-loop electron microscopic analysis indicates that at least 16 exons are interspersed in a 9-kilobase DNA segment that contains the third distal part of the alpha 1 type III collagen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1590111583,"The binding isotherm of 2-(10-carboxydecyl)-2-hexyl-4,4-dimethyl-3-oxyloxazolidine to the 12,000 molecular weight cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding protein purified from pig's heart and as analyzed by electron spin resonance is shown to be sigmoidal and dependent on protein concentration. Its maximum binding capacity, Vmax, is 9.81 microM X g-1 when the protein concentration is 1.98 g . liter-1 and 14.33 microM . g-1 when the concentration is 0.198 g . liter-1. The molar ellipticity, theta, measured by circular dichroism at 225 nm in the protein range of 0.2-3 g . liter-1 is also shown to depend on concentration, with two maxima at 1.7 and 1.2 g . liter-1. The rotational correlation time, tau eff, of a spin-labeled N-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-carbonyl-pyrroline-1-oxyl)imidazole specifically bound to tyrosine residues of the protein surface, as analyzed by electron spin resonance, is decreasing as a function of protein concentration. To account for these three concentration-dependent variations, we suggest that the protein self-aggregates since these variations will not be found if the protein is monomeric. A very significant influence of this aggregation property of the protein on the activity of fatty acid-dependent membrane-bound enzymes is predicted by a model analysis and, thus, should be considered as a new parameter in the control of energy production in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1977057045,"In the rho- mutants of yeast, the mitochondrial genome is made up of a small segment excised from the wild-type mitochondrial DNA. The segment is repeated either in tandem or in palindrome to form a series of multimeric DNAs. We have asked how the palindromic organization arises. From several palindromic rho- mitochondrial DNAs, we have isolated the restriction fragments that contained the head-to-head or tail-to-tail junction of the repeating units, and have determined their nucleotide sequences. We found that the palindromes were not symmetrical right up to the junction points: at the junction, there was always an asymmetrical sequence of variable length. At both ends of this junction sequence, we found inverted oligonucleotide sequences that were variable in each mutant and that were present in the wild-type DNA. At the moment of excision, a single-strand cut seems to occur at each of these short inverted repeats, in such a way that the two complementary strands of the genome are cut unequally and the single-stranded overhangs become the junction sequences between the palindromic repeating units. This scheme may account for the complex structures of many rho- mitochondrial DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1680794155,"The high Km cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified by an improved procedure. Its amino acid composition is reported. Its pI is 5.85 +/- 0.1. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the native enzyme gave Mr = 88,000 +/- 6,000, whilst gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate gave a molecular weight of 43,000, indicating that the enzyme is a dimer. Preparations of 94 +/- 4% purity contained about 2.4 atoms of zinc/43,000 daltons. Inactivation of the enzyme by 8-hydroxyquinoline was accompanied by removal of about 2 zinc atoms per monomer. Partially inactivated enzyme regained activity during dialysis against zinc, or, with less effect, cobalt salts. 8-Hydroxyquinoline (Ki = 1.1 mM) and 1,10-phenanthroline (Ki = 0.6 mM) were competitive inhibitors. The enzyme was also inhibited by the nonchelating 1,7-and 4,7-phenanthrolines and by thiols and KCN, but not by NaN3. These inhibitors probably act by binding to, but not chelating, enzyme-bound zinc."

https://openalex.org/W1527384300,"A rapid procedure for the simultaneous purification of yeast RNA polymerases I, II, and III is described. The procedure involves direct fractionation of a yeast cell extract by heparin agarose affinity chromatography, followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The purification can be completed in 3-4 days using 20-200 g of yeast cells. Two forms each of RNA polymerases I, II, and III are resolved after DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. In the cases of RNA polymerases I and II, these forms differ in subunit structure. The transcriptional properties of the isolated enzymes were determined using hybrid plasmid DNA templates containing yeast ribosomal and glycolytic structural genes. Both forms of RNA polymerases I and II transcribe plasmid DNA templates with low efficiency and no evidence for selective initiation of transcription was found for these enzymes using a wide variety of templates. Both forms of RNA polymerase III transcribe plasmid DNA templates with high efficiency and direct the synthesis of discrete transcripts. Sites for initiation and termination of transcription by RNA polymerase III within defined plasmid DNA templates were determined. The data show that RNA polymerase III-dependent synthesis of discrete transcripts from restriction endonuclease-digested plasmid DNA templates is initiated from selected ends of the templates and terminates at discrete sites downstream from the site of initiation. RNA polymerase III initiates synthesis at many sites within supercoiled plasmid DNA templates."
https://openalex.org/W2129180895,"Abstract The integration patterns of viral DNA sequences in three hamster embryo cell lines independently derived by transformation with equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) have been investigated by DNA blot hybridization analyses for the restriction enzymes Eco RI, Bgl II, Xba I and Bam HI with 32 P-labeled selected DNAs from a collection of cloned EHV-1 restriction enzyme fragments as probes. These EHV-1-transformed cell lines contained subgenomic portions of the viral genome in an integrated state at multiple sites in the host genome. At least one copy of a viral DNA sequence mapping colinearly from 0.32 to 0.38 map units within the EHV-1 genome was common among these three EHV-1 transformed cell lines. The 0.32–0.38 viral DNA sequence was maintained stably even after 125 cell passages, whereas sequences from other positions in the EHV-1 genome were lost progressively during continued cell passage. The significance of the findings that these oncogenically transformed cell lines harbor a specific region of the EHV-1 genome is discussed with regard to stable maintenance of the oncogenically transformed state."
https://openalex.org/W1582225523,"Reactions catalyzed by purified Bungarus fasciatus venom NAD glycohydrolase were demonstrated to include ADP-ribose transfer from NAD to alcohols and to imidazole derivatives to produce a variety of ADP-ribosides. The formation of products was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography. In the enzyme-catalyzed alcoholysis of NAD, the ratio of n-alkyl-ADP-riboside formed to the hydrolytic product, ADP-ribose, increased linearly with alcohol concentration. The effectiveness of alcohols as acceptors of the ADP-ribose moiety in these reactions increased with increasing chainlength of the alcohol used. Linear positive chainlength effects extended from methanol to pentanol suggesting facilitation of these reactions by nonpolar interactions. In the methanolysis reaction, NADP, thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide-1, N6-ethenoadenine dinucleotide, and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide were shown to be as effective as NAD as donor substrates. The NAD glycohydrolase-catalyzed ADP-ribose transfer to pyridine bases to form NAD analogs was studied at pyridine base concentrations above those determined to be saturating for the base exchange reaction. Under these conditions, the ratio of base exchange to hydrolysis of NAD was directly related to the pKa of the ring nitrogen of the pyridine base employed. In addition to alcoholysis and pyridine-base exchange reactions, the snake venom enzyme was demonstrated to catalyze an ADP-ribose transfer reaction to imidazole derivatives. Arginine methyl ester was ineffective as an ADP-ribose acceptor molecule in these reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1593347888,"A lactate dehydrogenase isozyme designated has recently been described in cells transformed by the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus. Several unusual properties were felt to distinguish this LDH isozyme from previously described LDH isozymes. These properties include cathodic electrophoretic migration in acrylamide gels using an imidazole/borate buffer system, inhibition of activity by oxygen and GTP, and stimulation of activity by cyanide. However, this report demonstrates that the muscle-type mammalian LDH isozyme, LDH 5, also exhibits these unusual properties when it is isolated and detected by the same methods previously used to demonstrate LDHk. The unusual properties attributed to LDHk are not intrinsic properties of the enzyme itself but rather result from the methods employed to demonstrate LDHk activity. Numerous similarities exist between LDH 5 and LDHk including electrophoretic mobility, substrate requirements, similar Michaelis constants for lactate, pyruvate, NAD, and NADH, and identical tissue distribution, indicating that LDHk represents mammalian LDH 5."
