https://openalex.org/W2137279272,"Cerebellar granule cells are the most abundant type of neuron in the brain, but the molecular mechanisms that control their generation are incompletely understood. We show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is made by Purkinje cells, regulates the division of granule cell precursors (GCPs). Treatment of GCPs with Shh prevents differentiation and induces a potent, long-lasting proliferative response. This response can be inhibited by basic fibroblast growth factor or by activation of protein kinase A. Blocking Shh function in vivo dramatically reduces GCP proliferation. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of normal growth and tumorigenesis in the cerebellum."

https://openalex.org/W2102839588,"Although broken chromosomes can induce apoptosis, natural chromosome ends (telomeres) do not trigger this response. It is shown that this suppression of apoptosis involves the telomeric-repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2). Inhibition of TRF2 resulted in apoptosis in a subset of mammalian cell types. The response was mediated by p53 and the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase, consistent with activation of a DNA damage checkpoint. Apoptosis was not due to rupture of dicentric chromosomes formed by end-to-end fusion, indicating that telomeres lacking TRF2 directly signal apoptosis, possibly because they resemble damaged DNA. Thus, in some cells, telomere shortening may signal cell death rather than senescence."

https://openalex.org/W2050779639,"Protein-interacting modules help determine the specificity of signal transduction events, and protein phosphorylation can modulate the assembly of such modules into specific signaling complexes. Although phosphotyrosine-binding modules have been well-characterized, phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-binding modules have not been described. WW domains are small protein modules found in various proteins that participate in cell signaling or regulation. WW domains of the essential mitotic prolyl isomerase Pin1 and the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 bound to phosphoproteins, including physiological substrates of enzymes, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The Pin1 WW domain functioned as a phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-binding module, with properties similar to those of SRC homology 2 domains. Phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-binding activity was required for Pin1 to interact with its substrates in vitro and to perform its essential function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2165582963,"The differential effect of stimulus inversion on face and object recognition suggests that inverted faces are processed by mechanisms for the perception of other objects rather than by face perception mechanisms. We investigated the face inversion using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The principal effect of face inversion on was an increased response in ventral extrastriate regions that respond preferentially to another class of objects (houses). In contrast, house inversion did not produce a similar change in face-selective regions. Moreover, stimulus inversion had equivalent, minimal effects for faces in in face-selective regions and for houses in house-selective regions. The results suggest that the failure of face perception systems with inverted faces leads to the recruitment of processing resources in object perception systems, but this failure is not reflected by altered activity in face perception systems."
https://openalex.org/W2051945956,"MAG is a potent inhibitor of axonal regeneration. Here, inhibition by MAG, and myelin in general, is blocked if neurons are exposed to neurotrophins before encountering the inhibitor; priming cerebellar neurons with BDNF or GDNF, but not NGF, or priming DRG neurons with any of these neurotrophins blocks inhibition by MAG/myelin. Dibutyryl cAMP also overcomes inhibition by MAG/myelin, and cAMP is elevated by neurotrophins. A PKA inhibitor present during priming abrogates the block of inhibition. Finally, if neurons are exposed to MAG/myelin and neurotrophins simultaneously, but with the Gi protein inhibitor, inhibition is blocked. We suggest that priming neurons with particular neurotrophins elevates cAMP and activates PKA, which blocks subsequent inhibition of regeneration and that priming is required because MAG/myelin activates a Gi protein, which blocks increases in cAMP. This is important for encouraging axons to regrow in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2006108102,"Synaptic clustering of neurotransmitter receptors is crucial for efficient signal transduction and integration in neurons. PDZ domain–containing proteins such as PSD-95/SAP90 interact with the intracellular C termini of a variety of receptors and are thought to be important in the targeting and anchoring of receptors to specific synapses. Here, we show that PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase), a PDZ domain–containing protein, interacts with the C termini of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro and in vivo. In neurons, PICK1 specifically colocalizes with AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses. Furthermore, PICK1 induces clustering of AMPA receptors in heterologous expression systems. These results suggest that PICK1 may play an important role in the modulation of synaptic transmission by regulating the synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1985434939,"Cell proliferation and differentiation are regulated by growth regulatory factors such as transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) and the liphophilic hormone vitamin D. TGF-β causes activation of SMAD proteins acting as coactivators or transcription factors in the nucleus. Vitamin D controls transcription of target genes through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Smad3, one of the SMAD proteins downstream in the TGF-β signaling pathway, was found in mammalian cells to act as a coactivator specific for ligand-induced transactivation of VDR by forming a complex with a member of the steroid receptor coactivator–1 protein family in the nucleus. Thus, Smad3 may mediate cross-talk between vitamin D and TGF-β signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1975504364,"We have used confocal microscopy to monitor synaptically evoked Ca2+ transients in the dendritic spines of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Individual spines respond to single afferent stimuli (<0.1 Hz) with Ca2+ transients or failures, reflecting the probability of transmitter release at the activated synapse. Both AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists block the synaptically evoked Ca2+ transients; the block by AMPA antagonists is relieved by low Mg2+. The Ca2+ transients are mainly due to the release of calcium from internal stores, since they are abolished by antagonists of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR); CICR antagonists, however, do not depress spine Ca2+ transients generated by backpropagating action potentials. These results have implications for synaptic plasticity, since they show that synaptic stimulation can activate NMDA receptors, evoking substantial Ca2+ release from the internal stores in spines without inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD)."

https://openalex.org/W2027934726,P -to- S converted teleseismic waves recorded by temporary broadband networks across Tibet show a north-dipping interface that begins 50 kilometers north of the Zangbo suture at the depth of the Moho (80 kilometers) and extends to a depth of 200 kilometers beneath the Bangong suture. Under northern Tibet a segmented south-dipping structure was imaged. These observations suggest a different form of detachment of the Indian and Asian lithospheric mantles caused by differences in their composition and buoyancy.
https://openalex.org/W2025809975,"Tropospheric aerosols affect the radiative forcing of Earth's climate, but their variable concentrations complicate an understanding of their global influence. Model-based estimates of aerosol distributions helped reveal spatial patterns indicative of the presence of tropospheric aerosols in the satellite-observed clear-sky solar radiation budget over the world's oceans. The results show that, although geographical signatures due to both natural and anthropogenic aerosols are manifest in the satellite observations, the naturally occurring sea-salt is the leading aerosol contributor to the global-mean clear-sky radiation balance over oceans."

https://openalex.org/W2007112380,"Density measurements on several hydrous (≤19 mole percent of H 2 O) silicate melts demonstrate that dissolved water has a partial molar volume ( V̄ H 2 O ) that is independent of the silicate melt composition, the total water concentration, and the speciation of water. The derived value for V̄ H 2 O is 22.9 ± 0.6 cubic centimeters per mole at 1000°C and 1 bar of pressure, whereas the partial molar thermal expansivity (∂ V̄ H 2 O /∂ T ) and compressibility (∂ V̄ H 2 O /∂ P ) are 9.5 ± 0.8 × 10 −3 cubic centimeters per mole per kelvin and −3.2 ± 0.6 × 10 −4 cubic centimeters per mole per bar, respectively. The effect of 1 weight percent dissolved H 2 O on the density of a basaltic melt is equivalent to increasing the temperature of the melt by ∼400°C or decreasing the pressure of the melt by ∼500 megapascals. These measurements are used to illustrate the viability of plagioclase sinking in iron-rich basaltic liquids and the dominance of compositional convection in hydrous magma chambers."
https://openalex.org/W2051714097,"Some molecular clock estimates of divergence times of taxonomic groups undergoing evolutionary radiation are much older than the groups' first observed fossil record. Mathematical models of branching evolution are used to estimate the maximal rate of fossil preservation consistent with a postulated missing history, given the sum of species durations implied by early origins under a range of species origination and extinction rates. The plausibility of postulated divergence times depends on origination, extinction, and preservation rates estimated from the fossil record. For eutherian mammals, this approach suggests that it is unlikely that many modern orders arose much earlier than their oldest fossil records."
https://openalex.org/W2036529420,"We investigated mechanisms of cell death during hypoxia/reoxygenation of cultured kidney cells. During glucose-free hypoxia, cell ATP levels declined steeply resulting in the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Concurrently, there was cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Cells that leaked cytochrome c underwent apoptosis after reoxygenation. ATP depletion induced by a mitochondrial uncoupler resulted in similar alterations even in the presence of oxygen. Moreover, inclusion of glucose during hypoxia prevented protein translocations and reoxygenation injury by maintaining intracellular ATP. Thus, ATP depletion, rather than hypoxia per se, was the cause of protein translocations. Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevented cytochrome c release and reoxygenation injury without ameliorating ATP depletion or Bax translocation. On the other hand, caspase inhibitors did not prevent protein translocations, but inhibited apoptosis during reoxygenation. Nevertheless, they could not confer long-term viability, since mitochondria had been damaged. Omission of glucose during reoxygenation resulted in continued failure of ATP production, and cell death with necrotic morphology. In contrast, cells expressing Bcl-2 had functional mitochondria and remained viable during reoxygenation even without glucose. Therefore, Bax translocation during hypoxia is a molecular trigger for cell death during reoxygenation. If ATP is available during reoxygenation, apoptosis develops; otherwise, death occurs by necrosis. By preserving mitochondrial integrity, BCL-2 prevents both forms of cell death and ensures cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W1982830349,"New neurons are incorporated into the high vocal center (HVC), a nucleus of the adult canary (Serinus canaria) brain that plays a critical role in the acquisition and production of learned song. Recruitment of new neurons in the HVC is seasonally regulated and depends upon testosterone levels. We show here that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is present in the HVC of adult males but is not detectable in that of females, though the HVC of both sexes has BDNF receptors (TrkB). Testosterone treatment increases the levels of BDNF protein in the female HVC, and BDNF infused into the HVC of adult females triples the number of new neurons. Infusion of a neutralizing antibody to BDNF blocks the testosterone-induced increase in new neurons. Our results demonstrate that BDNF is involved in the regulation of neuronal replacement in the adult canary brain and suggest that the effects of testosterone are mediated through BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2094677101,"Using site-directed fluorescent labeling, we examined conformational changes in the S4 segment of each domain of the human skeletal muscle sodium channel (hSkM1). The fluorescence signals from S4 segments in domains I and II follow activation and are unaffected as fast inactivation settles. In contrast, the fluorescence signals from S4 segments in domains III and IV show kinetic components during activation and deactivation that correlate with fast inactivation and charge immobilization. These results indicate that in hSkM1, the S4 segments in domains III and IV are responsible for voltage-sensitive conformational changes linked to fast inactivation and are immobilized by fast inactivation, while the S4 segments in domains I and II are unaffected by fast inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W2013319332,"We have studied the synaptic responses in hippocampal slices to stimulus patterns derived from in vivo recordings of place cell firing in a behaving rodent. We find that synaptic strength is strongly modulated during the presentation of these natural stimulus trains, varying 2-fold or more because of short-term plasticity. This modulation of synaptic strength is precise and deterministic, because the pattern of synaptic response amplitudes is nearly identical from one presentation of the train to the next. The mechanism of synaptic modulation is primarily a change in release probability rather than a change in the size of the elementary postsynaptic response. In addition, natural stimulus trains are effective in inducing long-term potentiation (LTP). We conclude that short-term synaptic plasticity—facilitation, augmentation, and depression—plays a prominent role in normal synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W2021608362,"The formation of a persistently active cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is critical for establishing long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) in Aplysia. The injection of bovine catalytic (C) subunits into sensory neurons is sufficient to produce protein synthesis–dependent LTF. Early in the LTF induced by serotonin (5-HT), an autonomous PKA is generated through the ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated proteolysis of regulatory (R) subunits. The degradation of R occurs during an early time window and appears to be a key function of proteasomes in LTF. Lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, blocks the facilitation induced by 5-HT, and this block is rescued by injecting C subunits. R is degraded through an allosteric mechanism requiring an elevation of cAMP coincident with the induction of a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase."

Maps of the water vapor distribution associated with a precipitating cloud, a partly precipitating cold front, and horizontal convective rolls reveal quantitative measures that are not observed with conventional methods, and suggest that such radar observations can be used for forecasting and to study atmospheric dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2047961525,"Neuronal activity-dependent processes are believed to mediate the formation of synaptic connections during neocortical development, but the underlying intracellular mechanisms are not known. In the visual system, altering the pattern of visually driven neuronal activity by monocular deprivation induces cortical synaptic rearrangement during a postnatal developmental window, the critical period. Here, using transgenic mice carrying a CRE-lacZ reporter, we demonstrate that a calcium- and cAMP-regulated signaling pathway is activated following monocular deprivation. We find that monocular deprivation leads to an induction of CRE-mediated lacZ expression in the visual cortex preceding the onset of physiologic plasticity, and this induction is dramatically downregulated following the end of the critical period. These results suggest that CRE-dependent coordinate regulation of a network of genes may control physiologic plasticity during postnatal neocortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2036242775,"A processing approach has been identified and reduced to practice in which a residual stress profile can be designed such that cracks in a brittle material are arrested or grow in a stable manner. In the approach, cracks in the body encounter an increase in the magnitude of residual compression as the crack propagates. If correctly designed, the process increases strength and significantly decreases strength variability. This approach was demonstrated for a silicate glass, and multiple cracking was observed as a forewarning of the final failure. Normally, such glasses would fail catastrophically with the propagation of a dominant crack."
https://openalex.org/W2126148882,"The wiring patterns among various types of neurons via specific synaptic connections are the basis of functional logic employed by the brain for information processing. This study introduces a powerful method of analyzing the neuronal connectivity patterns by delivering a tracer selectively to specific types of neurons while simultaneously transsynaptically labeling their target neurons. We developed a novel genetic approach introducing cDNA for a plant lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), as a transgene under the control of specific promoter elements. Using this method, we demonstrate three examples of visualization of specific transsynaptic neural pathways: the mouse cerebellar efferent pathways, the mouse olfactory pathways, and the Drosophila visual pathways. This strategy should greatly facilitate studies on the anatomical and functional organization of the developing and mature nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2010170987,"Elementary Ca2+ release signals in nerve growth factor- (NGF-) differentiated PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons, functionally analogous to the ""Ca2+ sparks"" and ""Ca2+ puffs"" identified in other cell types, were characterized by confocal microscopy. They either occurred spontaneously or could be activated by caffeine and metabotropic agonists. The release events were dissimilar to the sparks and puffs described so far, as many arose from clusters of both ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Increasing either the stimulus strength or loading of the intracellular stores enhanced the frequency of and coupling between elementary release sites and evoked global Ca2+ signals. In the PC12 cells, the elementary Ca2+ release preferentially occurred around the branch points. Spatio-temporal recruitment of such elementary release events may regulate neuronal activities."
https://openalex.org/W2074924691,"Six garnet pyroxenites from Beni Bousera, Morocco, yield a mean lutetium-hafnium age of 25 ± 1 million years ago and show a wide range in hafnium isotope compositions (ɛ Hf = –9 to +42 25 million years ago), which exceeds that of known basalts (0 to +25). Therefore, primary melts of garnet pyroxenites cannot be the source of basalts. The upper mantle may be an aggregate of pyroxenites that were left by the melting of oceanic crust at subduction zones and peridotites that were contaminated by the percolation of melts from these pyroxenites. As a consequence, the concept of geochemical heterogeneities as passive tracers is inadequate. Measured lutetium-hafnium partitioning of natural minerals requires a reassessment of some experimental work relevant to mantle melting in the presence of garnet."

Carbon dust condenses from initially gaseous carbon and oxygen atoms because energetic electrons produced by radioactivity in the supernova cause dissociation of the carbon monoxide molecules, which would otherwise form and limit the supply of carbon atoms. The resulting free carbon atoms enable carbon dust to grow faster by carbon association than the rate at which the dust can be destroyed by oxidation. The origin of presolar micrometer-sized carbon solids that are found in meteorites is thereby altered."
https://openalex.org/W2038432598,"Dopamine-deficient mice (DA−/−), lacking tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in dopaminergic neurons, become hypoactive and aphagic and die by 4 weeks of age. They are rescued by daily treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA); each dose restores dopamine (DA) and feeding for less than 24 hr. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses expressing human TH or GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1) were injected into the striatum of DA−/− mice. Bilateral coinjection of both viruses restored feeding behavior for several months. However, locomotor activity and coordination were partially improved. A virus expressing only TH was less effective, and one expressing GTPCH1 alone was ineffective. TH immunoreactivity and DA were detected in the ventral striatum and adjacent posterior regions of rescued mice, suggesting that these regions mediate a critical DA-dependent aspect of feeding behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2149872494,"Axon pathfinding and target choice are governed by cell type–specific responses to external cues. Here, we show that in the Drosophila embryo, motorneurons with targets in the dorsal muscle field express the homeobox gene even-skipped and that this expression is necessary and sufficient to direct motor axons into the dorsal muscle field. Previously, it was shown that motorneurons projecting to ventral targets express the LIM homeobox gene islet, which is sufficient to direct axons to the ventral muscle field. Thus, even-skipped complements the function of islet, and together these two genes constitute a bimodal switch regulating axonal growth and directing motor axons to ventral or to dorsal regions of the muscle field."
https://openalex.org/W2007683534,"To understand the role of redox-sensitive mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth, we have studied the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a thiol antioxidant, and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a potent NADH/NADPH oxidase inhibitor, on serum-, platelet-derived growth factor BB-, and thrombin-induced ERK2, JNK1, and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation; c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB expression; and DNA synthesis. Both NAC and DPI completely inhibited agonist-induced AP-1 activity and DNA synthesis in VSMC. On the contrary, these compounds had differential effects on agonist-induced ERK2, JNK1, and p38 MAP kinase activation and c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB expression. NAC inhibited agonist-induced ERK2, JNK1, and p38 MAP kinase activation and c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB expression except for platelet-derived growth factor BB-induced ERK2 activation. In contrast, DPI only inhibited agonist-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and c-Fos and JunB expression. Antibody supershift assays indicated the presence of c-Fos and JunB in the AP-1 complex formed in response to all three agonists. In addition, cotransfection of VSMC with expression plasmids for c-Fos and members of the Jun family along with the AP-1-dependent reporter gene revealed that AP-1 with c-Fos and JunB composition exhibited a higher transactivating activity than AP-1 with other compositions tested. All three agonists significantly stimulated reactive oxygen species production, and this effect was inhibited by both NAC and DPI. Together, these results strongly suggest a role for redox-sensitive mechanisms in agonist-induced ERK2, JNK1, and p38 MAP kinase activation; c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB expression; AP-1 activity; and DNA synthesis in VSMC.

NADH/NADPH oxidase is a flavin-containing plasma membrane-bound enzyme that generates superoxide anion upon activation (32Bellavite P. Corso F. Dusi S. Grzeskowiak M. Della-Bianca V. Rossi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8210-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide anion can be dismutated enzymatically or nonenzymatically to H2O2, which is then scavenged by catalase or peroxidase (33Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify the sources of oxidant generation, several investigators have reported that growth factors that induce either hyperplasia or hypertrophy stimulate NADH/NADPH oxidase activity in various cell types (34Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar, 35Brightman A.O. Wang J. Miu R.K. Sun I.L. Barr R. Crane F.L. Morre D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It was also reported that NADH/NADPH oxidase activity can be regulated in a growth-dependent manner (35Brightman A.O. Wang J. Miu R.K. Sun I.L. Barr R. Crane F.L. Morre D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A role for NADH/NADPH oxidase activity in tumor necrosis factor-α- and fibroblast growth factor-induced c-Fos expression and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced Jun-NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) activation in chondrocytes has been reported (36Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 37Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In another study, inhibition of NADH/NADPH oxidase activity by antisense targeted depletion of its p22phox component blunted the hypertrophic effect of angiotensin II in VSMC (38Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Because of these findings, a role for this enzyme in growth factor-induced signaling events has been suggested. However, the molecular events underlying the growth-regulating effects of NADH/NADPH oxidase are not clear. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the role of redox-sensitive mechanisms in the modulation of agonist-induced early response events in VSMC. Here we report the following observations. 1) NAC, a thiol antioxidant, blocks agonist-induced ERK2, JNK1, and p38 MAPK activation, c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB expression, AP-1 activity, and DNA synthesis in VSMC. 2) NADH/NADPH oxidase activity plays a role in some subset of agonist-induced early response events such as induction of p38 MAPK activation, c-Fos and JunB expression, AP-1 activity, and DNA synthesis. 3) JunB appeared to be the predominant member of the AP-1 complex formed in response to both receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptor agonists. 4) AP-1 with c-Fos and JunB composition exhibited a higher transcriptional activity than AP-1 with other compositions tested. Together, these results strongly suggest that redox-sensitive mechanisms play an important role in the modulation of AP-1 activity and growth in VSMC. Aprotinin, ATP, bis-N-methylacridinium nitrate (lucigenin), bovine myelin basic protein, EGTA, β-glycerophosphate, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , sodium deoxycholate, sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, sodium pyrophosphate, and thrombin were obtained from Sigma. PDGF-BB was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Diphenyleneiodonium was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Downsview, Ontario). Anti-ERK1 (SC-93), ERK2 (SC-154), c-Fos (SC-052), JunB (SC-46), JunD (SC-74), JNK1 (SC-474), and p38 MAPK (SC-728 and SC-535) rabbit polyclonal antibodies and GST-c-Jun (1–79) (SC-4113) recombinant protein were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-c-Jun rabbit polyclonal antibody (PC-06) was purchased from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). AP-1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotide and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from Promega (Madison, WI). Phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). [14C]Chloramphenicol (52 mCi/mmol), [methyl-3H]thymidine (70 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (8,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Sciences, Inc. VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aortas of 200–300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion as described earlier (13Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% C02 atmosphere. VSMC were plated onto 60-mm dishes, allowed to grow to 70–80% confluence, and then growth arrested by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% (v/v) calf serum for 72 h. Growth-arrested VSMC were exposed to various agonists in the presence and absence of the indicated inhibitors for 24 h. Cells were pulse labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 2 h just before the end of the incubation period and harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse the cells. The mixture was allowed to remain on ice for 20 min and was then passed through a GF/F glass microfiber filter. The filter was washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% ethanol, dried, and placed in a liquid scintillation vial containing the mixture. The radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801). Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without the agonists in the presence and absence of appropriate inhibitors for the indicated time periods at 37 °C. Medium was aspirated, and cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. 250 μl of lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4)) was added to the frozen monolayers, thawed on ice for 15 min, and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatants was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on a 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The protein was transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After appropriate treatments, cells were washed with cold PBS and solubilized on ice for 15 min in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 400 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates normalized for protein were immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-ERK2 and anti-JNK1 rabbit IgG for ERK2 and JNK1 assays, respectively, for 2 h followed by the addition of 40 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional hour. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm lithium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and three times with kinase buffer (12.5 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4). The ERK2 activity present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by resuspending in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of myelin basic protein, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction and incubating at 30 °C for 20 min. For the JNK1 assay, incubation with the kinase buffer was the same as that for the ERK2 assay except that 1 μg of GST-c-Jun was used instead of myelin basic protein. The reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels. The dried gel was exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film and developed. Activation of p38 MAPK was measured by Western blotting using phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without agonists for the indicated time periods, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described earlier (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 20 min at 30 °C. For supershift analysis, antibodies (4 μg) were added to the reaction mix after the initial 20-min incubation, and incubation continued for an additional 2 h. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 0.25 × TBE buffer (1 × TBE = 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using a T4 polynucleotide kinase kit per the supplier's protocol (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by chromatography in a G-25 spin column (Bio-Rad). VSMC culture was split evenly into 100-mm dishes the day before transfection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum to 80–90% confluence. Cells were transfected with collagenase (coll)-CAT plasmid DNA (20 μg/100-mm dish) using a calcium phosphate precipitation method as described by Angel et al. (40Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS 16 h after transfection, incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% calf serum for 36 h at 37 °C, and then stimulated with and without agonists in the presence and absence of appropriate inhibitors for 6 h. In the other set of experiments, VSMC were cotransfected with expression plasmids (8 μg each) for c-Fos or Jun family members alone or in various combinations along with AP-1 reporter plasmid, coll-CAT, and 48 h after transfection cells were processed for CAT activity. Vector DNA was used to normalize the amount of DNA transfected with the cells. Cells were washed with PBS, scraped in 1 ml of TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) into an Eppendorf tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 1 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in 100 μl of cold 250 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and the cells were lysed by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined as described above. CAT activity was measured by the method of Gorman et al. (41Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of protein from each condition was incubated with 20 μl of 4 mm acetyl-CoA, 32.5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 4 μl of 50 μCi/ml [14C]chloramphenicol in a total volume of 150 μl at 37 °C for 2–4 h. Controls without cell extract and/or with nontransfected cell extracts were incubated simultaneously. Acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol was extracted with ethyl acetate and separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 1B plates using a chloroform:methanol mixture (19:1) as solvent, and the air-dried silica plates were subjected to autoradiography. Superoxide anion production in growth-arrested VSMC in response to agonists was measured according to the method described by Griendling et al. (34Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS and pelleted by centifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in assay buffer consisting of 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 35 mm phosphoric acid, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Superoxide anion production in VSMC in response to agonists was measured in the darkroom with a AutoLumat LB 953 luminometer. To start the assay, lucigenin was added to a final concentration of 250 μm to 1 × 106 cells followed by agonist in a total volume of 1 ml of assay buffer. Wherever appropriate, 20 mm NAC was added to cells 2 h before the assay, and DPI (12 μm) was added 30 min before the assay. Photoemission in terms of relative light units was measured every minute for 5 min. All of the experiments were repeated at least three to four times with similar results. All samples were normalized for protein content before Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and CAT assay. Statistical analysis on [3H]thymidine uptake data was performed using Student'st test. To study the role of redox-sensitive mechanisms in agonist-induced cell growth, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without 10% serum, 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB, or 0.1 unit/ml thrombin in the presence and absence of 20 mm NAC or 12 μm DPI for 24 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine uptake. As shown in Fig. 1, Aand B, all three agonists caused a significant increase in DNA synthesis in VSMC, and this effect was blocked by NAC and DPI. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of NAC- and DPI-inhibited VSMC growth, we first determined the time course of agonist-induced expression of AP-1 components, c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, serum, PDGF-BB, and thrombin induced c-Fos (12–20-fold), c-Jun (3–4-fold), and JunB (5–7-fold) expression in a time-dependent manner. Induction of c-Fos expression in response to serum, PDGF-BB, and thrombin was observed at 1 h, reached a near maximal level at 2 h, and declined thereafter. The maximal expression of c-Jun in response to these agonists was observed at 2 h, whereas JunB levels peaked 3 h poststimulation. Significant levels of JunD were present in growth-arrested VSMC which were increased by 2-fold upon treatment with serum. PDGF-BB and thrombin had no significant effect on JunD levels. To test whether agonist-induced increases in the levels of c-Fos and members of the Jun family proteins are mediated via the generation of oxidants, we treated growth-arrested VSMC with serum, PDGF-BB, or thrombin in the presence and absence of NAC, a thiol antioxidant, and the protooncogene levels were determined. NAC significantly decreased c-Fos (70%), c-Jun (50%), and JunB (70%) expression in response to serum, PDGF-BB, and thrombin (Fig. 3). In contrast, NAC had no significant effect on JunD levels in either control or agonist-treated VSMC. NADH/NADPH oxidase has been implicated in cytokine- and growth factor-induced c-Fos expression and cytokine-induced JNK1 activation and c-Jun expression in chondrocytes (36Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J.

To test the role of NADH/NADPH oxidase activity in agonist-induced expression of c-Fos and members of the Jun family proteins, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without serum, PDGF-BB, or thrombin in the presence and absence of DPI, and the protooncogene levels were determined. Expression of c-Fos in response to these agonists was almost completely (85%) blocked by DPI (Fig.4). DPI also significantly (70%) inhibited JunB expression induced by these agonists. DPI alone induced c-Jun expression by 3-fold, and it exhibited an additive effect with agonist-induced expression of this protooncogene (Fig. 4). DPI had no significant effect on JunD levels in either control or agonist-treated cells.Figure 4Effect of DPI on serum-, PDGF-BB-, and thrombin-induced expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD in VSMC. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without 10% serum (CS), 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB, or 0.1 unit/ml thrombin in the presence and absence of 12 μm DPI for 2 h, and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD levels as described in the legend of Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Fos and Jun family proteins constitute the transcription factor AP-1 (42Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between the induction of expression of c-Fos and members of the Jun family proteins and AP-1-dependent transcription, we studied the expression of AP-1-responsive reporter gene in growth-arrested VSMC stimulated with serum, PDGF-BB, or thrombin in the presence and absence of NAC or DPI. VSMC were transiently transfected with a collagenase-CAT (coll-CAT) reporter plasmid in which CAT expression was driven by collagenase gene promoter containing a single AP-1 site, growth arrested, and then treated with and without the agonists in the presence and absence of NAC or DPI. All three agonists caused induction of the AP-1-dependent reporter gene expression, and this response was significantly blocked by both NAC and DPI (Fig.5, A and B). Because NAC and DPI inhibited the AP-1 activity despite the differential effects of these compounds on serum-, PDGF-BB-, and thrombin-induced c-Jun expression, we next determined the composition of AP-1 formed in response to these agonists. Gel supershift analysis showed the presence of c-Fos and JunB in the AP-1 complex formed in response to serum and thrombin (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained with PDGF-BB (data not shown). To determine the functional activity of AP-1 with c-Fos and JunB composition, VSMC were cotransfected with expression plasmids for c-Fos and members of the Jun family in various combinations along with the AP-1 reporter plasmid coll-CAT, and CAT activity was measured 48 h after transfection. Consistent with the gel supershift analysis, AP-1 with c-Fos and JunB composition exhibited a higher transcriptional activity than AP-1 with other combinations tested (Fig.7).Figure 6JunB is the predominant component of AP-1 in serum-, PDGF-BB-, and thrombin-treated VSMC. 5 μg of nuclear protein from control cells and cells treated with 10% serum, 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB, or 0.1 unit/ml thrombin for 2 h was incubated with32P-labeled canonical AP-1 oligonucleotide for 20 min, and the protein-DNA complex was separated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.

https://openalex.org/W2071387048,"Short-term synaptic enhancement is caused by an increase in the probability with which synaptic terminals release transmitter in response to presynaptic action potentials. Since exocytosed vesicles are drawn from a readily releasable pool of packaged transmitter, enhancement must result either from an increase in the size of the pool or an elevation in the fraction of releasable vesicles that undergoes exocytosis with each action potential. We show here that at least one major component of enhancement, augmentation, is not caused by an increase in the size of the readily releasable pool but is instead associated with an increase in the efficiency with which action potentials induce the exocytosis of readily releasable vesicles."

The incident photons were converted to electron-hole pairs that were locally stored in a quantum well that was laterally modulated by a field-effect tunable electrostatic superlattice. At large superlattice potential amplitudes, these pairs were stored for a time that was at least five orders of magnitude longer than their natural lifetime. At an arbitrarily chosen time, they were released in a short and intense flash of incoherent light, which was triggered by flattening the superlattice amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W2017364006,"The α subunit (G sα ) of the stimulatory heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate binding protein (G protein) G s activates all isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase (Type V) and its subdomains, which interact with G sα , promoted inactivation of the G protein by increasing its guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity. Adenylyl cyclase and its subdomains also augmented the receptor-mediated activation of heterotrimeric G s and thereby facilitated the rapid onset of signaling. These findings demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the monomeric G sα and enhances the GTP/GDP exchange factor (GEF) activity of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2061469038,"The Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 is a negative regulator of the cell cycle, although its expression is induced by a number of mitogens that promote cell proliferation. We have found that E2F1 and E2F3, transcription factors that activate genes required for cell cycle progression, are strong activators of the p21 promoter. In contrast, HBP1 (HMG-box protein-1), a novel retinoblastoma protein-binding protein, can repress the p21 promoter and inhibit induction of p21 expression by E2F. Both E2Fs and HBP1 regulate p21 transcription through cis-acting elements located between nucleotides −119 to +16 of the p21 promoter and the DNA binding domains of each of these proteins are required for activity. Sequences between −119 and −60 basepairs containing four Sp1 consensus elements and two noncanonical E2F binding sites are of major importance for E2F activation, although E2F1 and E2F3 differ in the extent of their ability to activate expression when this segment is deleted. The opposing effects of E2Fs and HBP1 on p21 promoter activity suggest that interplay between these factors may determine the level of p21 transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2029636046,"We have previously reported that a set of oral squamous cell carcinoma lines express specifically elevated cdk6 activity. One of the cell lines, SCC4, contains a cdk6 amplification and expresses functional p16ink4a, the other cell lines express undetectable levels of p16ink4a, despite a lack of coding-region mutations. Two of the cell lines, SCC15 and SCC40 have a hypermethylated p16ink4A promoter and a third cell line, SCC9, has a mutation in the p16ink4a promoter. Using the demethylation agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, we showed that the p16ink4a protein was re-expressed after a 5-day treatment with this chemical. One cell line, SCC15 expressed high levels of p16ink4a. In this line, cdk6 activity was decreased after 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine treatment, and the hypophosphorylated, growth suppressive form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRB was detected. Expression of p16ink4a persisted, even after the drug was removed and the cells expressed senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Ectopic expression of p16ink4a with a recombinant retrovirus in this cell line also induced a similar senescence-like phenotype. Hence, it was possible to restore a functional pRB pathway in an oral squamous cell carcinoma line by inducing re-expression of endogenous p16ink4a in response to treatment with a demethylating agent."
https://openalex.org/W2321828406,"Small polydisperse circular DNA (spcDNA) is a heterogeneous population of extrachromosomal circular molecules present in a large variety of eukaryotic cells. Elevated amounts of total spcDNA are related to endogenous and induced genomic instability in rodent and human cells. We suggested spcDNA as a novel marker for genomic instability, and speculated that spcDNA might serve as a mutator. In this study, we examine the presence of telomeric sequences on spcDNA. We report for the first time the appearance of telomeric repeats in spcDNA molecules (tel-spcDNA) in rodent and human cells. Restriction enzyme analysis indicates that tel-spcDNA molecules harbor mostly, if not exclusively, telomeric repeats. In rodent cells, tel-spcDNA levels are higher in transformed than in normal cells and are enhanced by treatment with carcinogen. Tel-spcDNA is also detected in some human tumors and cell lines, but not in others. We suggest, that its levels in human cells may be primarily related to the amount of the chromosomal telomeric sequences. Tel-spcDNA may serve as a unique mutator, through specific mechanisms related to the telomeric repeats, which distinguish it from the total heterogeneous spcDNA population. It may affect telomere dynamics and genomic instability by clastogenic events, alterations of telomere size and sequestration of telomeric proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2110005660,"Lung cancer is now the number one cause of cancer death for both men and women. An age-adjusted analysis over the past 25 years shows that in women specifically, lung cancer incidence is on the rise. It is estimated that 10-20 genetic events including the alteration of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes will have occurred by the time a lung tumor becomes clinically evident. In an effort to identify regions containing novel cancer genes, chromosome 18p11, a band not previously implicated in disease, was examined for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In this study, 50 matched normal and NSCLC tumor samples were examined using six 18p11 and one 18q12.3 PCR-based polymorphic markers. In addition, LOH was examined in 29 glioblastoma pairs and 14 paired breast carcinomas. This analysis has revealed potentially two regions of LOH in 18p11 in up to 38% of the tumor samples examined. The regions of LOH identified included a 2 cm area between markers D18S59 and D18S476, and a more proximal, 25 cm region of intermediate frequency between D18S452 and D18S453. These results provide evidence for the presence of one or more potential tumor suppressor genes on the short arm of chromosome 18 which may be involved in NSCLC, brain tumors and possibly breast carcinomas as well."

A 0.8-kilobase fragment derived from the large intron of Fgf8was found to enhance human growth hormone expressed from theFgf8 promoter 3–4-fold in an orientation dependent manner. The intronic fragment contains DNA-binding sites for the AP2, Pbx1, and Engrailed transcription factors. Gel shift and Western blot experiments documented the presence of these transcription factors in nuclear extracts from ES cell embryoid bodies. In vitro mutagenesis of the Engrailed or Pbx1 site demonstrated that these sites modulate the activity of the intronic fragment. In addition, in vitro mutagenesis of both Engrailed and Pbx1 sites indicated that other unidentified sites are responsible for the transcriptional enhancement observed with the intronic fragment. Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8) plays a critical role in vertebrate development and is expressed normally in temporally and spatially restricted regions of the vertebrate embryo. We now report on the identification of regions of Fgf8important for its transcriptional regulation in murine ES cell-derived embryoid bodies.

Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Despite the discrete FGF expression patterns, the molecular mechanisms controlling the regulation of these genes are poorly understood. Human FGF1 spans over 120 kb, contains three protein coding exons, and at least four upstream untranslated exons (2Myers R.L. Payson R.A. Chotani M.A. Deaven L.L. Chiu I.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple FGF1 transcripts are generated by alternate promoter usage and tissue-specific splicing (3Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R.

MurineFgf3 contains three distinct promoters and two separate polyadenylation sites that generate different mRNA, but all of them encode the same protein (5Mansour S.L. Martin G.R.

Fgf8 is primarily an embryonic growth factor that is expressed in several regions of vertebrate embryos: i.e.epiblast, primitive streak, surface ectoderm of branchial arches, apical ectodermal ridge of the limb bud, isthmus of midbrain-hindbrain junction, and forebrain/nasal placode (13Heikinheimo M.

Biol. 1995; 5: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Fgf8 is also weakly expressed in adult gonads, primarily in germ cells (18MacArthur C.A. Shankar D.B. Shackleford G.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2501-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Valve E. Penttila T.L. Paranko J. Harkonen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This discrete temporal and spatial expression pattern ofFgf8 is important for induction and patterning of the embryo during gastrulation, limb development, and midbrain-hindbrain formation (20Crossley P.H. Minowada G. MacArthur C.A. Martin G.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Crossley P.H. Martinez S. Martin G.R.

Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). FGF8 is pathologically expressed in some human breast cancer cell lines (24Payson R.A. Wu J. Liu Y. Chiu I.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar). Examining how Fgf8 expression is regulated could provide an understanding of both physiological and pathological actions of this growth factor. Currently, little is known about the Fgf8 promoter. Its 5′-flanking region is very GC-rich and it is located 5 kb from the 3′ end of Npm3, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed member of the nucleoplasmin/nucleophosmin family (25MacArthur C.A. Shackleford G.M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site(s) for Fgf8 are unknown, but are inferred to be within 300 bp upstream of the start codon. In the 5′-region ofFgf8, there is no TATA box. Prior work demonstrated that the 2-kb 5′-region of Fgf8 did not direct expression of a reporter transgene in a Fgf8-like expression pattern. 2G. Martin, personal communication. We therefore postulated that DNA elements cis to Fgf8, but not included in this 2 kb of upstream DNA sequence, might be important forFgf8 expression. Because of the presence of theNpm3 gene 5 kb upstream of Fgf8 (25MacArthur C.A. Shackleford G.M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we searched for DNA sequences downstream of the beginning of Fgf8 that were conserved between mice and humans. Small regions in the proximal portion of the large intron are conserved between murineFgf8 and human FGF8 (26Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), despite the lack of coding function for this region. This large intron lies between the last exon of the cluster of first exons (exon 1D) and exon 2 (18MacArthur C.A. Shankar D.B. Shackleford G.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2501-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is no conservation between murine Fgf8 and humanFGF8 in the remainder of the large intron, and in other introns (26Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Characterization of cis-regulatory elements in Fgf8 through the usual transient transfection methods is complicated sinceFgf8 is not normally expressed in established cell lines, and hence these cell lines may lack appropriate transcription factors that regulate Fgf8 expression. Because transgenic approaches are expensive, we sought a relevant in vitro system to analyze potential Fgf8 regulatory regions. Prior work demonstrated Fgf8 expression in murine ES cells differentiated into embryoid bodies (27Soudais C. Bielinska M. Heikinheimo M. MacArthur C.A. Narita N. Saffitz J.E. Celeste Simon M. Leiden J.M. Wilson D.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we use a stable transfection human growth hormone (hGH) reporter assay in ES cell embryoid bodies to analyze Fgf8 DNA sequences for promoter and enhancer activity. We find that the 2-kb 5′-region ofFgf8 contains promoter activity, and that a 0.8-kb fragment of the large intron enhances transcription of the reporter gene. We show co-localization of expression of the endogenous Fgf8gene and the reporter hGH gene in embryoid bodies derived from ES cells transfected with the Fgf8-hGH reporter construct. DNA sequence analysis, in conjunction with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), identify multiple transcription factors that bind to theFgf8 promoter and enhancer. In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that although the Engrailed and Pbx1-binding sites modulate the enhancer activity of the intronic fragment, other sites are responsible for most of the transcriptional enhancement seen with the intronic fragment. The 1.8-kbXhoI-XbaI fragment containing neomycin gene was isolated from pPNT vector (28Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), made blunt with Klenow fragment, and after addition of EcoRI linkers, inserted into theEcoRI site of the promoter-less plasmid, p℘GH (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). The 1.8- or 2-kbEcoRV-SmaI fragment containing the 5′-region of murine Fgf8 gene (Fig. 1), after addition ofBamHI linkers, was inserted in the forward orientation into the BamHI site of p℘GH with neomycin gene subcloned previously. The 0.8-kb PstI-XhoI intronic fragment from the Fgf8 gene (Fig. 1) was made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase, and subcloned in forward and reverse orientation into the SphI site of p℘GH vector downstream from the hGH gene, after adding SphI linkers. Promoter sequences and the neomycin gene were then added to the constructs as described above. Mutations in the binding sites for transcription factors AP2, Pbx1 or Engrailed were introduced into the plasmid, pGEM-7Zf(+), containing the 0.8-kb Fgf8 intronic fragment subcloned into the SphI site, using the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were as follows (lowercase letters denote mutant substitutions): forward primer for AP2-binding site, 5′-GAAAGAGGATATGTCGaaAGGGCCCACAAAAGG-3′; reverse primer for AP2 binding site, 5′-CCTTTTGTGGGCCCTttCGACATATCCTCTTTC-3′; forward primer for Pbx1-binding site, 5′-GGGGCTGAGAACTGAccGATTTCTACAACATTC-3′; reverse primer for Pbx1-binding site, 5′-GAATGTTGTAGAAATCggTCAGTTCTCAGCCCC-3′; forward primer for Engrailed-binding site 5′-GGAGAAGGAAAACTCTAggAAAATGTAATAAAATGTAATAAAAAGG3′; reverse primer for Engrailed-binding site 5′-CCTTTTTATTACATTTTccTAGAGTTTTCCTTCTCC-3′. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Following introduction of the AP2, Pbx1, or Engrailed mutation into the intronic fragment of Fgf8 subcloned into the SphI site of the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector, the mutated enhancer was subcloned into p℘GH, at the SphI site as described above. The plasmids above were sequenced by the thermocycle technique, using the fmol kit (Promega), and a combination of plasmid and Fgf8 sequence-specific primers (26Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sequences were read with the IBI-Kodak gel reader and MacVector v5.0 software (IBI-Kodak). CCE ES cells (29Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar) were routinely cultured on mitomycin C-treated STO feeder cells in culture medium consisting of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% newborn calf serum, 0.1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin with addition of leukemia inhibitory factor at a concentration of 1,000 units/ml (30Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kelmer R. J. Embryol. Exp. Exp. Morph. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in humidified incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. ES cells (1 × 10 7) were electroporated with 25 μg of SalI-linearized targeting plasmid (240 V, 500 microfarads, electrode distance 0.4 cm) as described by Hogan et al. (55Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) and the cells were then seeded into 100-mm plates. After 24 h, 250 μg/ml active G418 was added and the cells cultured for 7–9 days. Antibiotic-resistant ES clones were pooled and expanded at 125 μg/ml G418. The cells were passaged once through leukemia inhibitory factor-containing media to remove feeder cells. Then ES cells were differentiated in suspension culture using the method of Doetschman et al. (30Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kelmer R. J. Embryol. Exp. Exp. Morph. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioned cell culture medium was changed every other day, and was harvested at day 9 and assayed for hGH using a commercially available radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute Diagnostics}. Embryoid bodies were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Then they were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Total protein was quantitated in supernatant fraction to normalize hGH levels to number of embryoid bodies. For gel shift assays, nuclear extracts from day 9 embryoid bodies were prepared as described by Andrews and Faller (32Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides, 21–44 bases in length containing binding sites for transcription factors in the middle of sequence, were designed based on known murine Fgf8 gene sequence and they were made by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared (33Wilson D.B. Dorfman D.M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP, using polynucleotide kinase. The sense (plus) strand sequences for the oligonucleotides in the 5′-region ofFgf8 were as follows: Msx2, 5′-TTTGCCCCTGCTAATTGCTCAGAAGCA-3′; CREB/ATF, 5′-GCCCAAGGGGACGTCAGCACCGGGGC-3′; Egr1, 5′-CCACACCAGCCGCCCCCGCCCCTCCCGCGG-3′; and Egr1/AP2/Sp1, 5′-GCCCCGCCCCCGCCCCGGGCGGCGACCCGGC-3′. The sense (plus) strand sequences for the oligonucleotides in the intron were as follows: AP2, 5′-GAAAGAGGATATGTCGCCAGGGCCCACAAAAGG-3′; Sp1/Pbx1, 5′-GGGGCTGAGAACTGATTGATTTCTACAACATTC-3′; Engrailed, 5′-GGAGAAGGAAAACTCTATTAAAATGTAATAAAATGTAATAAAAAGG-3′. Binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50,000 cpm of DNA probe, 10 μg of nuclear extract in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer with 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) to inhibit nonspecific binding of the labeled probe to nuclear extract proteins (34Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For competition assays, a 5–100-fold molar excess of specific or nonspecific oligonucleotides were included in each binding reaction. Mutant oligonucleotides were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. if available or custom made by Biosynthesis (Engrailed mutant, corresponding to mutant primer above). All mutants contain 2-bp substitutions in the middle of the binding motif for the transcription factor. Following 20-min incubation at room temperature, the binding reactions were fractionated on 4% polyacrylamide gels run in 45 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmEDTA for 2 h at 200 V. The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Protein in nuclear extracts and in the conditioned media after lysis of embryoid bodies was quantitated with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Western blots on nuclear extracts were performed as described previously (35MacArthur C.A. Lawshe A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development. 1995; 121: 3603-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a primary antibody to En1 and En2 (36Davis C.A. Holmyard D.P. Millen K.J. Joyner A.L. Development. 1991; 111: 287-298PubMed Google Scholar), or a primary antibody to Pbx1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Day 9 embryoid bodies were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% sucrose, and frozen in OCT cryopreservation solution (Tissue-Tek). 10-μm sections were subjected to in situhybridization with sense or antisense Fgf8 or hGH riboprobes. Fgf8 probes (765 nucleotides, derived from the FGF8b cDNA) were prepared as described previously (13Heikinheimo M. Lawshé A. Shackleford G.M. Wilson D.B. MacArthur C.A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). hGH sense or antisense probes were prepared by in vitro transcription of EcoRI-linearized pGEM vector (Promega) containing a 240-bp fragment of hGH exon V, kindly provided by D. Ornitz. Riboprobes were labeled with [α-33P]UTP (ICN or Amersham) and SP6, T3, or T7 RNA polymerases (Promega) in in vitrotranscription reactions as described (13Heikinheimo M. Lawshé A. Shackleford G.M. Wilson D.B. MacArthur C.A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Hybridization, washing, exposure to emulsion, counterstaining, and photography were as described (13Heikinheimo M. Lawshé A. Shackleford G.M. Wilson D.B. MacArthur C.A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We were interested in understanding the regulation of Fgf8, a developmentally regulated FGF with expression in discrete regions of the vertebrate embryo, but only minimal expression in the gonads of the adult organism (13Heikinheimo M.

We cloned the murine Fgf8 gene in prior work (Fig.1 A) (18MacArthur C.A. Shankar D.B. Shackleford G.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2501-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and now report the sequence of the 1462 bp upstream of the translation start codon (GenBank accession number AF065607). Analysis of the sequence revealed DNA-binding sites for the transcription factors Msx2 (562–568 bp), CREB/ATF (814–819 bp), Egr1/Krox24 (971–979 bp and 1060–1069 bp), AP2 (1068–1075 bp), and Sp1 (1072–1077) (Fig. 1 B). As we prepared to test two different 5′-regions for promoter activity, we learned of the inability of this region to direct reporter transgene expression in a Fgf8-like pattern in mouse embryos.2 We therefore sought to identify additionalFgf8 sequence elements that might be important for regulating Fgf8 expression. We previously cloned the humanFGF8 gene (26Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The homology between the mouse and human genes is very high in coding regions (85–90% at nucleic acid level), but not in noncoding regions. The mouse and human noncoding sequences were analyzed for short stretches (30–60 bp) of complete identity, as we hypothesized that noncoding sequences conserved in mice and humans might be important in gene regulation. We identified a 767-bp region of the proximal portion of the large intron of Fgf8 that had several well conserved stretches of DNA sequence when compared with the corresponding region of human FGF8 (Fig. 1 B). This sequence is now reported in GenBank (accession number AF065608). Analysis of this sequence revealed DNA-binding sites for transcription factors AP2 (69–77 bp), Sp1 (293–300 bp), Pbx1 (305–312 bp), and Engrailed (494–503 bp) (Fig. 1 B). To analyze possible Fgf8 promoter/enhancer elements in vitro, we sought to identify a cell line that expressesFgf8. Mouse ES cells made to differentiate into embryoid bodies express Fgf8 by the eighth day of this process (27Soudais C. Bielinska M. Heikinheimo M. MacArthur C.A. Narita N. Saffitz J.E. Celeste Simon M. Leiden J.M. Wilson D.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar). 3J. Gemel, C. Jacobsen, and C. A. MacArthur, unpublished results. We therefore constructed reporter plasmids containing the hGH gene with variousFgf8 5′-regions ± intron region (Fig. 1 C). The larger 5′-region runs from EcoRV to the secondSmaI site, which is 6 bp upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 1, A and B). The shorter 5′-region runs from the EcoRV site to the first SmaI site, and lacks the binding sites for AP2 and Sp1. Following stable transfection into ES cells, the clones from each transfection were pooled and allowed to differentiate into embryoid bodies. The conditioned media from these embryoid bodies at day 9 were analyzed for hGH protein by radioimmunoassay, and the results were normalized to total protein present in the embryoid bodies. The shorter 5′-region had promoter activity in this assay (Fig.2). However, the larger 5′-region had significantly more promoter activity than the shorter 5′-region (Fig.2), implicating Fgf8 DNA sequences between the twoSmaI sites in the 5′-region in the regulation ofFgf8 expression. When the intronic fragment was placed downstream of the hGH reporter gene in the forward orientation (Fig.1 C, constructs 5 and 7), very high level expression was obtained (3–4-fold increase) (Fig. 2). In contrast, placing the intronic fragment in the reverse orientation (Fig.1 C, constructs 6 and 8) did not increase reporter gene expression above that observed without the intronic fragment (Fig. 2). This intronic fragment by itself did not have promoter activity, as hGH reporter gene expression in construct 4 was no higher than hGH reporter gene expression in the construct lacking any Fgf8 sequence (Fig. 2). With the identification of potential DNA elements in Fgf8 that stimulate reporter gene expression, we sought to determine if these same elements directed expression of the reporter gene in a fashion similar to the endogenous Fgf8 gene. Previously, it was shown that steady state levels of the endogenous Fgf8 RNA could be detected by ribonuclease protection assays at days 10 and 18, but not days 0, 4, or 6 (27Soudais C. Bielinska M. Heikinheimo M. MacArthur C.A. Narita N. Saffitz J.E. Celeste Simon M. Leiden J.M. Wilson D.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar). We have subsequently demonstrated expression of Fgf8 at day 8 of development of embryoid bodies {data not shown}. We therefore did a temporal analysis of the hGH reporter gene expression from our highest expressing construct in Fig. 2, construct 5. As for the endogenous Fgf8 gene, we did not detect reporter gene expression at day 0 and day 1 of development of embryoid bodies (Fig.3 A). We detected low level reporter hGH expression at day 3, that increased to full expression at day 8 (Fig. 2). This reporter hGH expression pattern is similar to the endogenous Fgf8 expression pattern seen in embryoid bodies (27Soudais C. Bielinska M. Heikinheimo M. MacArthur C.A. Narita N. Saffitz J.E. Celeste Simon M. Leiden J.M. Wilson D.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar), although expression levels of the reporter gene seem higher compared with the endogenous Fgf8 gene (see below). We compared the spatial pattern of the hGH reporter gene expression with the endogenous Fgf8 gene by in situhybridization at day 9 of development of embryoid bodies, using constructs 3 and 5 (Fig. 1 C). There was co-localization of endogenous Fgf8 expression with reporter hGH gene expression in the less eosinophilic cells of the embryoid bodies, compared with expression in the more eosinophilic cells in construct 5 (Fig.3 B). In contrast, the reporter hGH gene was expressed in both the less eosinophilic and the more eosinophilic cells in construct 3 (Fig. 3 C). Although there was co-localization of the reporter hGH gene with the endogenous Fgf8 gene in construct 5, the reporter gene was expressed at higher levels (note thatFgf8 probe is 3 times the length of hGH probe), possibly due to higher reporter gene copy number in the transfected cells. Despite the differences in expression levels, the time course and co-localization experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrate that the reporter gene containing the intronic fragment has expression similar to the endogenous Fgf8 gene. To determine if the identified DNA sequences in Fgf8 actually were occupied by transcription factors present in nuclei of day 9 embryoid bodies, we prepared nuclear extracts and performed EMSA. Specific gel shifts were obtained when nuclear extracts from day 9 embryoid bodies were assayed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the Msx2-, CREB/ATF-, and Egr1/Sp1/AP2-binding sites in the 5′-region ofFgf8 (Fig. 4). The gel shifts were competed with non-radiolabeled authentic oligonucleotide, but not mutant oligonucleotide (when available). Similarly, specific gel shifts were obtained when the nuclear extracts of day 9 embryoid bodies were assayed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP2, Sp1/Pbx1, and Engrailed DNA-binding sites in Fgf8 (Fig.5). The AP2 and Sp1/Pbx1 sites were competed with non-radiolabeled authentic, but not mutant, oligonucleotide (Fig. 5). The Engrailed site was fully competed by authentic non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide, and partially competed by an Engrailed mutant oligonucleotide, suggesting the possibility of additional factors binding at adjacent sites in the oligonucleotide, or some ability of a transcription factor in day 9 embryoid bodies to bind to the mutated Engrailed site. We were unsuccessful in our attempts to supershift complexes seen in EMSA assays using antisera, and thereby confirm the identity of the proteins binding to these sites in Fgf8. We therefore performed Western blots to demonstrate that En1, En2, and Pbx1 were present in day 9 embryoid extracts (Fig.6). To determine whether the AP2, Pbx1, and/or Engrailed DNA-binding sites in the intron of Fgf8were responsible for the enhancement of reporter hGH gene expression seen in construct 5 compared with construct 3 (Fig. 1 C), we created two base mutations in these binding sites by polymerase chain reaction methods. The mutated constructs were compared with the wild type construct 5 in the ES cell stable transfection assay. Although proteins bound to the AP2 site in the intron (Fig. 1 B) in a specific fashion (Fig. 5), mutation in this AP2-binding site did not significantly affect expression of the reporter gene (Fig.7). In contrast, a mutation in the Engrailed-binding site of the intron (Fig. 1 B) reduced hGH expression to 45% of the wild type construct (Fig. 7). A mutation in the Pbx1 DNA-binding site in the Fgf8 intron (Fig.1 B) reduced expression to 75% of the wild type construct (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, a double Engrailed/Pbx1 mutant gave wild type expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 7). As the intron increases expression of the reporter transgene from 26 ng of hGH/mg of protein to 89 ng of hGH/mg of protein (Fig. 2, constructs 3 and 5), the mutation in the Engrailed-binding site removes 75% of the enhancing activity of the intron. The mutation in the Pbx1-binding site removes 35% of the enhancing activity of the intron. Mutations in both Engrailed- and Pbx1-binding sites do not alter the ability of the intronic fragment to increase reporter gene expression, and indicate that additional site(s) are responsible for the transcriptional enhancement seen with the intronic fragment. In this paper, we identified promoter activity in the 2-kb 5′-region of Fgf8, spanning the region between theEcoRV and SmaI sites (Figs. 1 and 2). We also demonstrated that deletion of the 0.2-kbSmaI-SmaI fragment in this 5′-region ofFgf8 results in 44% reduction of hGH production (Figs.1 C and 2), reflecting a significant decrease inFgf8 promoter activity. Sequence analysis of this region ofFgf8 identified binding sites for AP2 and Sp1 at theSmaI site, which are destroyed when the 0.2-kbSmaI-SmaI fragment is removed from longer construct. Specific gel shifts were observed in EMSA with this region of Fgf8 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the AP2/Sp1 DNA-binding site in the Fgf8 5′-region is important for transcriptional activity of Fgf8 in mouse ES cells. Our data further indicate that a Fgf8 intronic fragment in the proximal portion of the large intron regulates Fgf8expression in mouse ES cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Specific gel shifts were observed for the AP2-, Pbx1-, and Engrailed-binding sites of this intronic fragment, when analyzed with nuclear extracts of day 9 embryoid bodies (Fig. 5). Pbx1, En1, and En2 are present in day 9 embryoid bodies as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 6). Although, mutation of the AP2-binding site in the intronic fragment abolished competition in the gel shift assay (Fig. 5), the mutation had no effect on the Fgf8 intronic enhancing activity (Fig. 7). In contrast, mutation of the Engrailed-binding site in the intronic fragment markedly affected the ability of this region to compete with the authentic binding site, but did not abolish competition (Fig. 5). The same Engrailed mutation decreased the enhancing activity of theFgf8 intron by 75% in mouse ES cells (Fig. 7). A mutation in the Pbx1-binding site that completely abolished competition in a gel shift assay (Fig. 5) decreased the enhancing activity of theFgf8 intron by 35% in mouse ES cells (Fig. 7). In contrast to the decrease in expression of the reporter gene seen with either the Pbx- or Engrailed-binding sites, the Pbx1/Engrailed double mutant showed a wild type level of expression (Fig. 7). To explain our data, we propose the following model. First, we hypothesize that there are activating sequences, presently unidentified, in the 0.8-kb intronic fragment that increaseFgf8 expression. Second, the Pbx and En proteins modulate the activity of the intronic activator sequence(s). If only Pbx proteins, or only Engrailed proteins, are present, they inhibit the activity of the intronic fragment and decrease Fgf8expression. If both Engrailed and Pbx proteins are present, then they interact with their binding sites and relieve the inhibition of each other. The mechanism of this interaction, based on prior studies (see below), may well involve heterodimerization of Pbx and Engrailed proteins versus homodimerization. The Engrailed proteins are members of a homeodomain-containing protein family (37Joyner A.L. Kornberg T. Coleman K.G. Cox D.R. Martin G.R. Cell. 1985; 43: 29-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), encoded by two mammalian genes, En1 andEn2 (38Joyner A.L. Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Both genes are expressed in posterior portions of the midbrain-hindbrain junction and spinal cord in the mouse embryo (38Joyner A.L. Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Mice lacking En1 die at birth with severe midbrain-hindbrain deletion, and rib and limb defects (39Wurst W. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2065-2075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while mice lacking En2 survive with subtler cerebellar defects (40Joyner A.L. Herrup K. Auerbach B.A. Davis C.A. Rossant J. Science. 1991; 251: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).En2 can substitute for En1 in midbrain-hindbrain function (41Hanks M. Wurst W. Anson-Cartwright L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Science. 1995; 269: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). En1 is essential for ventral limb patterning, as loss of Engrailed function results in a dorsal-ventral patterning defect of the limb (42Loomis C.A. Harris E. Michaud J. Wurst W. Hanks M. Joyner A.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). En1 was shown responsible for limiting the ventral aspect of the apical ectodermal ridge expression of Fgf8 (42Loomis C.A. Harris E. Michaud J. Wurst W. Hanks M. Joyner A.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Additionally, En1 is expressed prior to Fgf8 in the midbrain-hindbrain junction (isthmus) (15Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development. 1995; 121: 439-451PubMed Google Scholar, 43Davis C.A. Joyner A.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 44McMahon A.P. Joyner A.L. Bradley A. McMahon J.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 581-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and may be responsible for localizing the expression ofFgf8 to the cells of the isthmus (45Lee S.M.K. Danielian P.S. Fritzsch B. McMahon A.P. Development. 1997; 124: 959-969PubMed Google Scholar). The studies in the limb suggest that Engrailed repressesFgf8 expression in this location (42Loomis C.A. Harris E. Michaud J. Wurst W. Hanks M. Joyner A.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our results in ES cells suggest that Engrailed inhibits Fgf8 expression in the absence of Pbx1. Engrailed proteins can heterodimerize with members of the Pbx family of homeodomain proteins (46Peltenburg L.T. Murre C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47Peltenburg L.T.C. Murre C. Development. 1997; 124: 1089-1098PubMed Google Scholar). Extradenticle, aDrosophila homolog of the vertebrate Pbx proteins, has been shown to heterodimerize with homeodomain proteins and convert a transcriptional repressor homeodomain protein (as a monomer or homodimer) to a transcriptional activator (48Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin H. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2032-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We identified single Engrailed- and Pbx-binding sites in the Fgf8 intron that inhibit expression of Fgf8 in mouse ES cells, but that together can allow full Fgf8 expression. We also demonstrate binding of these elements by nuclear proteins present in mouse ES cell embryoid bodies, and identify both Pbx and Engrailed proteins in day 9 mouse ES cell embryoid bodies by Western blotting. Our data support the model that Engrailed heterodimerized with Pbx might activate transcription, while Engrailed or Pbx proteins alone might repress transcription (48Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin H. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2032-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An interesting finding in our work is the weak competition of the Engrailed mutant site observed in EMSA, but not seen for any of the other sites (Figs. 4 and 5). This weak competition may occur for two reasons. First, the mutated site may still be bound by the transcription factor, albeit in a much weaker fashion. Second, other unidentified binding site(s) in this region may exist that is/are not affected by the mutation. Evidence for the second possibility exists, since one of the gel shifts observed is competed equally well by the Engrailed mutant and wild type probes (open arrow, Fig.5). This report is the first example of transcriptional regulation by intron sequences in the FGF family of genes, but numerous examples of intronic regulation of transcription exist for other genes (49McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5349-5357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 50Rohrer J. Conley M.E.

Carcinogenesis. 1991; 4: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Traditionally, enhancer sequences are thought to be position and orientation independent. The Fgf8 intron's ability to enhance transcription shows orientation dependence, activating only in the forward orientation (Figs. 1 C and 2). Hprtintronic sequences that regulate transcription in ES cells also show similar orientation and position dependence (53Magin T.M. McEwan C. Milne M. Pow A.M. Selfridge J. Melton D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our use of stable transfection of ES cells, and the analysis of reporter genes in embryoid bodies derived from these transfected ES cells, allows one to analyze transcriptional control elements of developmentally regulated genes in an appropriate physiological contextin vitro. Similar analyses can be performed in P19 cells following differentiation in vitro (54Pari G. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4796-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified important DNA-binding sites in theFgf8 gene that regulate in vitro expression of a reporter gene in embryoid bodies following transfection into ES cells. Future work will seek to identify the proteins that bind to these elements, and to generate transgenic and/or chimeric mice to test whether the identified Fgf8 regulatory elements are necessary and sufficient for Fgf8 expression in vivo.

Muglia for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1970355926,"Reactivation of telomerase and stabilization of telomeres occur simultaneously during human cell immortalization in vitro and the vast majority of human cancers possess high levels of telomerase activity. Telomerase repression in human somatic cells may therefore have evolved as a powerful resistance mechanism against immortalization, clonal evolution and malignant progression. The comparative ease with which rodent cells immortalize in vitro suggests that they have less stringent controls over replicative senescence than human cells. Here, we report that Syrian hamster dermal fibroblasts possess substantial levels of telomerase activity throughout their culture life-span, even after growth arrest in senescence. In our studies, telomerase was also detected in uncultured newborn hamster skin, in several adult tissues, and in cultured fibroblasts induced to enter the post-mitotic state irreversibly by serum withdrawal. Transfection of near-senescent dermal fibroblasts with a selectable plasmid vector expressing the SV40 T-antigen gene resulted in high-frequency single-step immortalization without the crisis typically observed during the immortalization of human cells. Collectively, these data provide an explanation for the increased susceptibility of rodent cells to immortalization (and malignant transformation) compared with their human equivalents, and provide evidence for a novel, growth factor-sensitive, mammalian senescence mechanism unrelated to telomere maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2324952193,"Wild-type (wt) p53 frequently induces apoptosis when expressed in tumor cells whereas mutant p53 acts as an oncoprotein and consequently, stimulates cell proliferation. We report here exceptions to that rule. p53 conformational mutant 175H and DNA contact mutant 273H provoke apoptosis in human p53-deficient Hep3B hepatoma cells with delayed kinetics relative to wt p53. Similarly, c-Myc strongly stimulates apoptosis in these cells. In contrast, viral oncoproteins E1A and E7, and the cellular oncoprotein MDM-2, fail to elicit cytocidal responses. Efficient apoptotic cell death by mutant p53 requires oligomerization as 175H and 273H with deletions between amino acid residues 326 and 347 of the oligomerization domain are nontoxic. Apoptosis by mutant or wt p53 was significantly inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF but not by the inactive analog AEBSA. Together, these results suggest that a wt p53-independent control mechanism is operational in Hep3B cells that eliminates cells upon sensing illegitimate proliferation signals originating from certain oncoproteins, including mutant p53 and Myc. We suggest that some tumor cell types lack p53 altogether because they tolerate neither wild-type nor mutant forms of the protein."

Thecaudal-related protein Cdx-2/3 (the protein designated Cdx-2 in the mouse and Cdx-3 in the hamster) is expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium and in islet and enteroendocrine cells, where it activates proglucagon gene transcription. We show here that Cdx-3 sequences amino-terminal to the homeodomain (amino acids 1–180) function as a heterologous transcriptional activation domain when fused to the LexA DNA binding domain. A Cdx-3-Pit-1 fusion protein containing only the first 83 amino acids of Cdx-3 linked to the POU domain of Pit-1 markedly stimulated the transcriptional activity of a Pit-1-responsive promoter. Analysis of the transcriptional properties of Cdx-3 mutants in fibroblasts and islet cells revealed distinct amino-terminal subdomains that function in a cell-specific manner. Point mutations within the amino-terminal A domain were associated with reduced transcriptional activity. Furthermore, internal deletions and selected point mutations within domain A, but not the B or C domains, resulted in accumulation of mutant Cdx-3 in the cytoplasm. Unexpectedly, mutation of an Asp-Lys-Asp motif within domain A identified a putative cytoplasmic membrane-associated export signal that mediates Cdx-3 compartmentalization.

Fjose A. Gehring W.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are expressed early during development in a concentration gradient across the anteroposterior axis of the embryo. Perturbation of caudal function as a result of inactivating mutations (2Macdonald P.M. Struhl G. Nature. 1986; 324: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) or ectopic expression (3Mlodzik M. Gibson G. Gehring W.J. Development. 1990; 109: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar) leads to disruption of normal segmentation and an abnormal body pattern. Caudal genes were subsequently identified and characterized in mammalian species, including mice and humans (4James R. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3246-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hu Y. Kazenwadel J. James R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27214-27225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bonner C.A. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mammalian caudalhomologues cdx-1 and cdx-2/3 are expressed early during embryonic development in the gut, tailbud, neural tube, and mesoderm, following which, expression during adult life is predominantly restricted to the epithelium of the gastointestinal tract (4James R. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3246-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Duprey P. Chowdhury K. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Simon D. Guenet J. Gruss P. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cdx-4 gene, which maps to the X-inactivation center of mouse and human X chromosomes (8Horn J.M. Ashworth A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), is expressed only transiently during embryonic development, from day 7 to day 10 post coitum (9Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that members of the caudalgene family have important roles in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation in cells of endodermal origin. The chicken Caudal protein CHox-cad is expressed in embryonic but not adult liver, and expression is reactivated in regenerating liver cells following partial hepatectomy, consistent with a role for CHox-Cad in hepatocyte differentiation (10Doll U. Niessing J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 260-268PubMed Google Scholar). Conditional expression of murine cdx-2 in undifferentiated intestinal IEC-6 cells leads to cessation of cellular proliferation followed by resumption of growth and development of cellular characteristics reflective of more differentiated intestinal cell types (11Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Overexpression of cdx-2 in human colon cancer cells up-regulates molecules involved in cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions, and cdx-2 expression in turn is modulated by basement membrane components (12Lorentz O. Duluc I. De Arcangelis A. Simon-Assmann P. Kedinger M. Freund J.-N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experiments provide substantial evidence linking cdx-2 with changes in cell growth and differentiation.Complementary evidence for the biological importance ofcaudal genes in pattern formation and intestinal differentiation derives from analysis of loss of function mutations in mice. Disruption of the murine cdx-1 gene by homologous recombination results in anterior homeotic transformation of vertebrae, potentially due to the importance of cdx-1 for transcriptional control of members of the Hox gene cluster (13Subramanian V. Meyer B.I. Gruss P. Cell. 1995; 83: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although homozygous cdx-2−/− mice are embryonic lethal, cdx-2+/− heterozygote mice exhibit a complex phenotype, with tail and skeletal abnormalities including a homeotic shift of vertebrae and rib malformations (14Chawengsaksophak K. James R. Hammond V.E. Kontgen F. Beck F. Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Cdx-2+/− mice also exhibit stunted growth and develop multiple adenomatous intestinal polyps that do not express the remaining cdx-2 allele. These observations demonstrate that even cdx-2 haploinsufficiency leads to striking abnormalities in cellular differentiation pathwaysin vivo.Despite the emerging biological importance of Caudal proteins, the structural determinants of caudal function remain poorly understood. Alignment of caudal family members demonstrates significant amino acid homology within subdomains, designated A–C (9Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,15Joly J.S. Maury M. Joly C. Duprey P. Boulekbache H. Condamine H. Differentiation. 1992; 50: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) of the amino-terminal region; however, the functional significance of these subdomains has not yet been ascertained. We recently demonstrated that the hamster cdx-2 homologue, designatedcdx-3, is an important regulator of proglucagon gene transcription not only in pancreatic islets but also in enteroendocrine cells of the intestine (16Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Jin T. Trinh D.K.Y. Wang F. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To elucidate the specific regions of the Cdx-2/3 protein (the protein designated Cdx-2 in the mouse and Cdx-3 in the hamster) that are important for transcriptional activation and biological function, we have now carried out studies of the structural determinants of Cdx-3-dependent activation of the proglucagon promoter in vitro.RESULTSThe results of recent experiments suggest that amino acids 1–180, which make up the amino-terminal region of cdx-2, function as a heterologous activation domain (26Taylor J.K. Levy T. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To identify functionally important regions of the Cdx-3 protein independent of the Cdx-3 homeobox, we generated a series of LexA-Cdx-3 fusion proteins. The transcriptional properties of these molecules were studied using a cotransfected reporter plasmid containing LexA DNA binding sites adjacent to a minimal promoter upstream of the luciferase cDNA coding sequences. As a control, we first analyzed the transcriptional properties of a LexA:Pit-1 cDNA containing the LexA DNA binding domain fused to amino acids 8–80 of the transcription factor Pit-1 (19Lew A.M. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7156-7160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Pit-1 amino-terminal sequences conferred approximately a 3-fold induction of reporter activity in transfected BHK cells, similar to the magnitude of induction reported with the identical LexA:Pit-1 plasmid in transfected COS-7 cells (19Lew A.M. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7156-7160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fusion of the entire cdx-3 open reading frame adjacent to the LexA DNA binding domain resulted in a 6-fold activation of reporter activity (Fig. 1 a).Although deletion of the sequences carboxyl-terminal to thecdx-3 homeodomain (LexA:cdx 1–250) was associated with a reduction in relative transcriptional activation, thecdx-3 carboxyl-terminal sequences alone, from amino acids 245–313, did not confer transcriptional activation to the LexA DNA binding domain. The greatest activation of luciferase activity was observed with the plasmid containing the cdx-3amino-terminal sequences, LexA:Cdx(1–180), resulting in a 25–40-fold activation of reporter activity (Fig. 1, a andb). Plasmids containing the homeodomain alone, or the homeodomain plus the carboxyl-terminal sequences, displayed no transcriptional activation (Fig. 1 a).The results of these experiments using chimeric proteins in transfected fibroblasts demonstrated that Cdx-3 amino acids 1–180 encode a transcriptional activation domain, in agreement with experiments carried out analyzing the transcriptional properties of thecdx-2 amino-terminal region (26Taylor J.K. Levy T. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether protein subdomains within the 180 amino acid Cdx-3 amino-terminal region might be identified that are sufficient for conferring transcriptional activation, we analyzed the activity of a series of LexA:cdx fusions containing smaller regions of Cdx-3 amino-terminal sequences. In contrast to the potent transcriptional activation observed with LexA plasmids containing the intact 180 amino acid amino-terminal region of Cdx-3, LexA:cdx fusion genes containing smaller regions of cdx-3 amino-terminal sequences were transcriptionally inactive (Fig. 1 b).These experiments demonstrated that Cdx-3 amino-terminal sequences display functional activity when fused to the DNA binding domain of a bacterial transcription factor. To determine whether Cdx-3 amino-terminal sequences also mediate transcriptional activation in the context of a heterologous mammalian transcription factor, the first 120 amino acids of Pit-1 were replaced with amino acids 1–83 of Cdx-3. Transfection of BHK fibroblasts with the Cdx-3(1–83)/Pit-1 chimeric protein produced a 350-fold activation of luciferase activity (Fig.2), significantly greater than the 100-fold activation of reporter activity observed following transfection of full-length wild-type Pit-1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, minimal activation was seen with the control plasmid Pit-1(121–191). These observations define a subregion of the Cdx-3 amino terminus (amino acids 1–83, containing subdomains A and B (Fig. 1 c)) as being capable of functionally substituting for an endogenous activation domain in a mammalian transcription factor.Figure 2Transactivation by a chimeric Cdx-3/Pit-1 protein.

A proglucagon promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid was cotransfected with a series of cdx-3 plasmids containing in-frame deletions in the cdx-3 amino-terminal coding sequence. Full-length cdx-3 produced an ∼8–17-fold activation of the proglucagon promoter (Fig.3, a and b). Remarkably, internal deletion of Cdx-3 amino acids 84–180, containing sequences comprising subdomain C (Fig. 1 c), had no effect on the relative transcriptional induction of the proglucagon promoter (Figs. 3 a and 4). In contrast, deletions within the first 75 amino acids containing domains A and B, alone or in combination with more extensive carboxyl-terminal deletions, were consistently associated with attenuation of thecdx-3-induction of the proglucagon promoter (Fig. 3,a and b). One of the smallest Cdx-3 amino-terminal mutants containing a deletion within domain A, Δ(8–41), displayed a clearly reduced ability to activate the proglucagon promoter. Progressive deletion of additionalcdx-3 sequences, as represented by Δ(8–106) and Δ(8–139), produced a further decline incdx-3-dependent transcriptional activation, whereas deletion of the entire cdx-3 amino-terminal domain (Δ(8–180)) resulted in complete loss of proglucagon promoter activation (Fig. 3 b). These observations, taken together with the data demonstrating the functional activity of the first 83 amino acids in the context of a Cdx-3/Pit-1 fusion protein, clearly illustrate the importance of the Cdx-3 amino-terminal region for transcriptional activation.Figure 3Transcriptional properties ofcdx-3 mutant plasmids. A series of amino-terminal deletions (a and b) or carboxyl-terminal deletions (c) was generated by PCR. The cdx-3 plasmids (5 μg) were cotransfected into BHK cells with 5 μg of the −82 proglucagon-luciferase plasmid, and the luciferase activity obtained was normalized to the background luciferase activity measured following cotransfection with the pBAT8 expression vector alone in the same experiment. The relative cdx-3-dependent activation of the proglucagon promoter varied from 5- to 17-fold in different transfections as described previously (16Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

Johnson A.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with the data shown in Fig.1 a, the Δ(250–313) Cdx-3 molecule lacking the carboxyl-terminal 63 amino acids was associated with reduced levels of transcriptional activation (Fig. 3 c). In contrast, further deletion of all carboxyl-terminal sequences and the homeodomain resulted in complete loss of cdx-3-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig. 3 c), demonstrating that the Cdx-3 amino-terminal region alone, in the absence of a DNA binding domain, is functionally inactive.As the proglucagon and cdx-2/3 genes are not normally expressed in fibroblasts, we studied the transcriptional properties ofcdx-3 mutants in islet A cells previously shown to express both the endogenous proglucagon and cdx-3 genes (16Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Jin T. Trinh D.K.Y. Wang F. Drucker D.J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28984-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with the data obtained in BHK fibroblasts, the Δ(84–180) mutant did not exhibit a diminution of transcriptional activation in InR1-G9 islet cells (Fig. 4). Similarly, the Δ(8–41) mutant exhibited significantly reduced activity in both BHK and InR1-G9 cells (Figs. 3 and 4), consistent with the functional importance of the proximal amino-terminal region for Cdx-3 activity. In contrast, the Δ(8–74) mutant, encompassing deletions within Cdx-3 domains A and B, exhibited transcriptional activity comparable to wild-type Cdx-3 in islet cells but not in fibroblasts (Fig. 3 versus Fig. 4). These observations delineate amino-terminal subdomains exhibiting cell-specific transactivation properties and are consistent with the cell-specific transactivation properties demonstrated for the entire Cdx-2(1–180) amino terminus in fibroblast and intestinal epithelial cell lines (26Taylor J.K. Levy T. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The loss of transcriptional activation following selective deletion of Cdx-3 amino-terminal sequences may be attributable to reduced levels of Cdx-3 expression, incomplete Cdx-3 cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation, diminished binding of Cdx-3 to the proglucagon promoter, and/or impaired activity of one or more transcriptional activation domains. To distinguish between these various mechanisms, we prepared nuclear extracts from BHK and InR1-G9 cells transfected with thecdx-3 mutant plasmids. The expression and DNA binding properties of the various Cdx-3 mutant proteins was examined using a combination of Western blotting with Cdx-3 antisera and EMSA analyses (Fig. 5, a and b) with a proglucagon promoter G1 binding site probe (16Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Jin T. Trinh D.K.Y. Wang F. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All of the Cdx-3 mutant proteins were expressed and detected in BHK and InR1-G9 nuclear extracts by EMSA and Western blotting (Fig. 5, a andb, and data not shown). Competition with excess unlabeled Gc probe diminished specific complex formation; however, competition with a heterologous oligonucleotide had no effect (Fig. 5 c). None of the of the amino-terminal mutants exhibited consistent relative reductions (compared with wild-type Cdx-3 in the levels of protein expression as assessed by Western blotting (data not shown). The lack of available antisera that cross-react with Cdx-3 amino-terminal sequences precluded similar Western blot analyses of the carboxyl-terminal deletions.Figure 5Analysis of cdx-3 expression by EMSA and Western blotting. a and b, Cdx-3 plasmids were transfected into BHK cells, and then nuclear extracts were prepared and nuclear protein was utilized for EMSA experiments with a G1 proglucagon promoter probe (16Jin T.

Despite the conservation of caudalamino acid sequences within domain B, mutation of amino acid 28, 69, or 74 had no significant effect on cdx-3-dependent proglucagon transcription (Fig. 6). A significant reduction in Cdx-3 transcriptional activity was observed, in both BHK and InR1-G9 cells, with the point mutation closest to the amino terminus of the protein in domain A, a tyrosine-serine substitution at position 14. The reduction in transcriptional activity was not attributable to decreased expression of this mutant protein, as assessed by Western blot analyses (Fig. 6 c).Figure 6Transcriptional properties of Cdx-3 amino-terminal point mutations in BHK and InR1-G9 cells.a and b, the transcriptional activity of the individual cdx-3 plasmids harboring single point mutations, cotransfected with the −82 proglucagon-luciferase plasmid, was normalized relative to the values obtained following transfection of the wild-type cdx-3 plasmid into BHK fibroblasts (a) and InR1-G9 islet cells (b). *,p < 0.05 (point mutations versus cdx-3 wild-type). c, Western blot analysis of wild-type Cdx-3, Cdx-3 point mutations, and endogenous c-Jun in transfected BHK cells. Due to the expression of endogenouscdx-3 in InR1-G9 cells, Western blot analysis of the identical transfected plasmids in InR1-G9 cells could not distinguish between endogenous wild-type Cdx-3 and transfected Cdx-3 point mutations (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Further mutagenesis of sequences within domain A, single point mutations D8A, K9M, and D10A, resulted in Cdx-3 mutants exhibiting significant reductions in proglucagon promoter transcriptional activation in both BHK fibroblasts and InR1-G9 islet cells (Fig.7 a). EMSA experiments demonstrated no major impairment of G1 element binding activity (Fig.7 c) with the D8A and K9M mutations, although a slight reduction in relative levels of expression of these two mutants (compared with wild-type Cdx-3, was detected by Western blotting (Fig.7 b). Similarly, the Cdx-3(D10A) point mutation exhibited a significant reduction in transcriptional activity in both fibroblast and islet cells, without impairment of protein expression or G1 element binding (Fig. 7).Figure 7a, relative transcriptional activity of clustered Cdx-3 amino-terminal point mutations in BHK fibroblasts and InR1-G9 islet cells. The transcriptional activity of thecdx-3 plasmids harboring single, double, or triple point mutations, cotransfected with the −82 proglucagon-luciferase plasmid, was normalized relative to the values obtained following transfection of the wild-type cdx-3 plasmid into BHK fibro blasts or InR1-G9 islet cells.

Furthermore, Western blotting demonstrated marked reduction in protein expression of the three mutants, reflected in a corresponding decrease in G1 element binding activity (Fig. 7,b and c). Analysis of the mutationally sensitive Cdx-3 amino-terminal sequences within domain A demonstrated that amino acids 8–10 resembled a diacidic Asp-X-Asp motif (Fig.1 c) that is remarkably similar to a recently described consensus sequence required for protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum (29Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar).These observations suggested that the reduction in nuclear expression of Cdx-3 mutant proteins harboring double or triple point mutations in a putative membrane export signal might be attributable to defective Cdx-3 trafficking from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Analysis of the cellular localization of wild-type cdx-3 following transfection of BHK cells demonstrated that the majority of immunoreactive wild-type protein was localized to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 8). In contrast, a marked reduction in the levels of nuclear cdx-3(K9M/D10A) was observed in the same experiment, whereas the levels ofcdx-3 and cdx-3(K9M/D10A) in the nuclear membrane fraction were comparable. Initial analysis of nonfractionated cell extracts demonstrated markedly reduced levels of cytoplasmiccdx-3(K9M/D10A) (data not shown). To localize the cellular distribution of cdx-3(K9M/D10A) expression, more detailed cell and nuclear fractionation was performed. Analysis of the cytoplasmic membrane fraction demonstrated low levels of wild-type Cdx-3 but clearly increased levels of the mutant Cdx-3(K9M/D10A) protein (Fig. 8). These findings are consistent with defective cytoplasmic export and arrest of the mutant protein in a cytoplasmic membrane fraction.Figure 8Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions following transfection of BHK cells with pBAT7 alone or with wild-type cdx-3 orcdx-3(K9M/D10A).

We examined ryk expression in adult mouse epithelial tissues and during embryonic development at the histological level. Ryk RNA is present at greatly increased levels in cells at particular stages of epithelial differentiation: the basal layer of skin and tongue epithelia, the intervillous layer and some crypt bases of the intestine and the lower matrix region of the hair follicle. Although ryk RNA is expressed at similar levels in a variety of tissues from embryonic day 10.5 to 18.5, specific induction of ryk RNA can be seen by in situ hybridization in the basal layer of skin and hair follicle at day 15.5–16.5, and protein staining localizes to the hair follicle by immunohistochemistry. At day 4.5 and 6.5, little if any ryk is present in the blastocyst, but it is transiently induced at a high level in mature decidual cells of the uterine stroma. We review a number of independent isolations of ryk, including fruit fly and nematode members of the ryk family. Because ryk is induced in epithelial cells seeking a final place in a differentiated tissue, or during remodeling of the endometrium, and a homologous gene, derailed, is known to regulate muscle and nerve target seeking in Drosophila, ryk may also be involved in cellular recognition of appropriate context."
