https://openalex.org/W2102101495,"Although numerous studies have suggested ways in which the assembly of cytoskeletal proteins can be regulated physiologically, less information has been generated on the regulation of the synthesis of these proteins. Ben-Ze'ev et al. recently suggested that the synthesis of tubulin in mouse 3T6 cells is affected by the state of assembly of microtubules. We have investigated the level at which this apparent modulation of tubulin synthesis takes place, using cloned cDNA probes for alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNAs to measure the amounts of tubulin mRNAs combined with immunoprecipitation of tubulin to monitor the rate of protein synthesis. We have found that in many, but not all, cell types tubulin synthesis decreases very rapidly in response to microtubule inhibitors that increase the monomer pool. This decline in synthesis is associated with decline in the amounts of both alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNAs. Kinetic studies of tubulin protein synthesis and RNA levels suggest that the tubulin monomer may regulate the rate of tubulin mRNA transcription. It is likely that tubulin synthesis can be shut off quickly in the cell as the result of short half-lives of the tubulin mRNAs, which may be as short as 1--2 hr. These data suggest that the cell exploits the instability of the tubulin mRNAs as a means to regulate precise levels of the monomer-tubulin pool."

https://openalex.org/W2030650670,"An operon fusion of the lac genes to those required for synthesis of type 1 fimbriae (pili) has been achieved in a K12 strain of Escherichia coli lysogenized by the bacteriophage mu d (Ap4, lac). Synthesis of beta-galactosidase, therefore, reflected pil gene transcription and was used as a probe of fimbrial regulation. Expression of the operon fusion was found to oscillate, demonstrating that phase variation between fimbriate and nonfimbriate states is under transcriptional control. The transition rates from fimbriate to nonfimbriate were 1.05 X 10(-3) per bacterium per generation and from nonfimbriate to fimbriate, 3.12 X 10(-3) per bacterium per generation."
https://openalex.org/W2047432006,"Individual neurons can be recognized and identified anatomically, physiologically, and biochemically in the insect central nervous system. Biochemical analyses of extracts prepared from one such identified neuron show it to be associated with a bioactive pentapeptide called proctolin. This peptide may be a neurotransmitter, and a preparation is established in which its physiological action can be studied at the cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W32245353,"A carboxypeptidase purified from brain catalyzes the release of COOH-terminal tyrosine without further digesting tubulin. It is distinct from previously described carboxypeptidases, and appears to have specificity for tubulin as it is not inhibited by peptides and proteins with COOH-terminal tyrosine, and because, unlike carboxypeptidase A (which by removing tyrosine from aldolase causes its inactivation), this enzyme does not decrease aldolase activity. The enzyme detyrosinolates both self-assembly-competent (cycle-purified) and -incompetent (phosphocellulose-purified) tubulin. However, under assembly conditions the rate was 2-3-fold higher for competent tubulin. Preincubation of assembly-competent tubulin with podophyllotoxin or colchicine resulted in a parallel concentration-dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerization and detyrosinolation. Similarly, when incompetent tubulin was induced to polymerize by preincubation with purified microtubule-associated protein 2 (an assembly-promoting protein) or taxol, the initial rate of its detyrosinolation increased 3-5-fold, and this increase was blocked if podophyllotoxin was also added along with microtubule-associated protein 2 or taxol during the preincubation. Oligomers induced by adding vinblastine to incompetent tubulin were also detyrosinolated more rapidly, and the stimulation was abolished by maytansine, which has been shown to disperse the vinblastine-induced oligomers. When polymerized and subunit fractions were separated after a steady state mixture had been partially digested with the carboxypeptidase, the former was found to have lost 2-3 times more COOH-terminal tyrosine. Although both polymer and monomer can be detyrosinolated by the enzyme, polymeric and oligomeric forms are the preferred substrates. Carboxypeptidase appeared to release tyrosine at the same rate from populations of short and long microtubules."

https://openalex.org/W2031815941,"IL-3 is a recently described lymphokine that induces the expression of the enzyme 20-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 alpha SDH) in an early T-cell precursor. We demonstrate that purified IL-3 an be used to establish continuous cultures of a discrete subpopulation of T cells with virtually 100% efficiency from normal, unstimulated splenic lymphocyte populations. Once established over a period of approximately 4-6 weeks, the cultures can be readily cloned either in soft agar or by limiting dilution. All of the established lines are Lyt1+, 2- la-, lg-, Tdt-, 20 alpha SDH+, a phenotype characteristic of helper T cells; they are therefore distinct from continuous cultures of T cells established with IL-2. although initiation of these cell lines was absolutely dependent on IL-3, once established all of the cell lines were independent of exogenously added lymphokines for their growth in vitro. However, all of the cells lines were found to constitutively produce IL-3 at high levels. None of the cell lines constitutively produced lL-2, but could be readily induced to produce this lymphokine by treatment with phorbol-myristic acetate. The ability to produce lL-3 and lL-2 is a further indication that all the cell lines are helper T cells. The possible mechanisms by which lL-3 allows the specific differentiation and/or amplification of T cells of helper phenotype in tissue culture are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1546934733,"Using L-cysteate and tcysteinesulfinate as model substrates, we characterize here a transport system, both in cultured rat hepatocytes and human skin fibroblasts, serving for the anions glutamate and aspartate, but not for the dipolar species glutamic and aspartic acids. This system appears to be accompanied by a second, lower affinity system for the anionic forms, which is also Naâ€™-dependent; this lower affinity system applies at least to glutamate. These systems show the usual degree of preference for L- over D-glutamate and, in the fibroblast, for L- over DL-a-aminoadipate. D-ASpartate proved nearly as inhibitory to the uptake of Lcysteate or t-aspartate, however, as did L-aspartate itself, a comparison recalling a similar stereoselective anomaly discovered by Pall in Neurospora (Pall, M. (1976) Biochim Biophys. Acta 211, 513-520). We conclude that this anomaly arises from the ability of the two substrate carboxylate groups to bond in the spatial order either a# for the L-isomer or &a for the D-isomer and also to bond in the order a,y for L-glutamate, but scarcely in the order y,a for D-glutamate. A major lack of inhibition by D-cysteate, which might be expected to bind like aspartate in the inverted order, shows, however, that the two anionic groups are not recognized in identical manners by the two corresponding subsites, Precedent for a chemical difference in these two subsites is available from transport systems for neutral aand p-amino acids. A strong transport inhibition of the hepatocyte system by 3-aminoglutarate shows that an a,a relation between the amino group and either of the carboxylate groups of the anionic amino acid is not required. The above anomaly in stereoselectivity is compared with a corresponding one, applying to the reactions of aspartic acid and asparagine, versus glutamic acid and glutamine, with System L for neutral amino acid transport in the Ehrlich cell. A weak pHdependent inhibition of the uptake of anionic amino acids by cysteine can be associated with its unique mode of conversion to an anionic species."
https://openalex.org/W1601846113,"The effect of extracellular pH on the transport interaction of cystine and glutamate in cultured human diploid cells was examined over the pH range of 5.8-8.0. The initial rates of uptake of cystine increased with an increase in pH and glutamate potently inhibited the cystine uptake independently of pH. The uptake of glutamate was almost invariable within the pH range, but it was inhibited by cystine in a pH-dependent manner; the inhibition increased with an increase in pH. Regardless of pH, the uptake of cystine and glutamate was strongly inhibited by alpha-aminoadipate, alpha-aminopimelate, and homocysteate. From the pK values of cystine and other amino acids, it is suggested that cystine is transported in the same ionic form as is glutamate."

Prior inactivation of the enzyme by the modification of an essential tyrosine residue with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan, a reaction that can be reversed by thiols, does not affect the irreversible inactivation of the ATPase by dicyclohexyl[14C]carbodiimide. During the large scale modification of the F1-ATPase by dicyclohexyl[14C]carbodiimide which led to 70% inactivation, 1.9 g atoms of 14C were incorporated/mol of enzyme. Isolation of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits from this large scale inactivation revealed that the gram atoms of 14C bound per mol of each of the subunits was: alpha, 0.04; beta, 0.56; and gamma, 0.04. The majority of the radioactivity in a cyanogen bromide digest of the 14C-labeled beta subunit was isolated in a fragment that has the following amino acid sequence: Glu-Leu-Ile-Asn-Asn-Val-Ala-Lys-Ala-His-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Ser-Val-Phe-Ala-Gly-Val-Gly -Glu-Arg-Thr-Arg-Glu-Gly-Asn-Asp-Leu-Tyr-Glu*-His-Met; where Glu* represents the N gamma-glutamyl derivative of dicyclohexyl[14C]urea."

https://openalex.org/W8239487,"Chemical modifications of sea anemone toxin II from Anemonia sulcata have been used to study the residues involved in its toxic action on crabs and mice and in its binding properties to the Na+ channel of rat brain synaptosomes. Guanidination of th epsilon-amino groups of lysines 35, 36, and 46 with O-methylisourea hydrogen sulfate did not change the net charge of the toxin molecule and had no effect upon its toxic and binding properties. Either acetylation or fluorescamine treatment of the toxin that destroyed the positive charges of the three epsilon-amino groups and of the alpha-amino function of Gly produced an almost complete loss of toxicity and a considerable decrease in the binding activity. Iodination of the toxin on His induced practically no loss of toxic or binding properties. Carbethoxylation of both histidines 32 and 37 with diethyl pyrocarbonate provoked an important decrease of both the toxicity and the binding activity. Modifications of the guanidine side chain of Arg with 1,2-cyclohexanedione fully destroyed both toxicity and binding of the toxin to the Na+ channel. Modification of the carboxylate functions of Asp, Asp, and of the COOH-terminal Gln with glycine ethyl ester in the presence of a soluble carbodiimide completely abolished the toxicity but left the affinity for the sea anemone toxin receptor unchanged. The antagonist character of this carboxylate-modified derivative was further confirmed by electrophysiological and Na+ flux experiments. The theoretical and practical significance of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1530243106,"Myosin from Limulus, the horseshoe crab, is shown to be regulated by a calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of its regulatory light chains. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a Limulus myosin preparation reveals three light chain bands. Two of these light chains have been termed regulatory light chains based on their ability to bind to light chain-denuded scallop myofibrils (Sellers, J. R., Chantler, P. D., and Szent-Gyorgyi, A. G. (1980) J. Mol. Biol. 144, 223-245). Ths other light chain does not bind to these myofibrils and is thus termed the essential light chain. Both Limulus regulatory light chains can be phosphorylated with a highly purified turkey gizzard myosin light chain kinase or with a partially purified myosin light chain kinase which can be isolated from Limulus muscle by affinity chromatography on a calmodulin-Sepharose column. Phosphorylation with both of these enzymes requires calcium and calmodulin. Limulus myosin is isolated in an unphosphorylated form. The MgATPase of this unphosphorylated myosin is only slightly activated by rabbit skeletal muscle actin plus tropomyosin. The calcium-dependent phosphorylation of the myosin results in an increase in the actin-activated MgATPase rate. Once phosphorylated, the actin-activated MgATPase rate is only slightly modified by calcium. This suggests that calcium operates mainly at the level of the myosin kinase-calmodulin system."

https://openalex.org/W1588010906,"The effects of a number of antimitotic drugs on the GTPase activity of tubulin were examined. The previously reported stimulation with colchicine and inhibition with podophyllotoxin and vinblastine wee confirmed. Maytansine, which competes with vinblastine in binding to tubulin, was comparable to the latter in inhibiting GTP hydrolysis. Nocodazole, which competes with colchicine in binding to tubulin, was significantly superior to colchicine in enhancing GTP hydrolysis. This superiority arose from the more rapid bindng of nocodazole to tubulin, as the two drugs had comparable activity when drug and tubulin were preincubated prior to the addition of GTP. Both colchicine and podophyllotoxin contain a trimethoxybenzene ring, while the closest structural analogy of nocodazole to colchicine includes the trimethoxybenzene ring. To explore this apparent paradox, we examined a number of simpler colchicine analogs for their effects on tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis. While tropolone was without effect, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzaldehyde stimulated the reaction. We therefore conclude that the trimethoxybenzene ring of colchicine is primarily responsible for the drug's stimulation of the GTPase activity of tubulin and that the inhibitory effect of podophyllotoxin must derive from the latter's tetrahydronaphthol moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1569735279,"HeLa BU cells infected with either the type 1 or the type 2 forms of herpes simplex virus show an increase in the activities of uracil-DNA glycosylase and dUTP nucleotidohydrolase. Under optimal conditions, uracil-DNA glycosylase activity increases approximately 40-fold in HSV type 2-infected cells. In herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1-infected cells, uracil-DNA glycosylase activity increases only 6-fold. At a KCl concentration of 100 mM, uracil-DNA glycosylase derived from HSV type 2-infected cells is activated 2-fold, while the glycosylase extracted from mock infected HeLa BU cells is inhibited almost 90% at 100 mM KCl. dUTP nucleotidohydrolase activity increases 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively, in HSV type 1- and HSV type 2-infected HeLa BU cells. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of extracts derived from the type 1- and type 2-infected cells indicates distinct electrophoretic mobilities from the host cell enzyme. dUTP nucleotidohydrolase RF values for the mock infected cells, HSV type 1, and HSV type 2 are 0.5, 0.25, and 0.33, respectively. Serum from rabbits immunized against cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2 specifically neutralizes the dUTPase and uracil-DNA glycosylase activities extracted from herpes simplex virus-infected cells. This serum does not neutralize dUTPase or uracil-DNA glycosylase activity derived from mock infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W30329286,"This laboratory recently observed a cDNA reverse transcript to a specific mRNA from the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctata) pancreas which predicted the presence of a somatostatin gene product different from the previously reported catfish somatostatin (Oyama, H., Bradshaw, R. A., Bates, O. J., and Permutt, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2251-2254). The gene product was purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide was shown to be structurally identical with somatostatin-14 from other species by tryptic mapping, amino acid composition, and sequence. The level of somatostatin-14 in the catfish endocrine pancreas was determined to be 104 micrograms of immunoreactive somatostatin/g of tissue. These observations suggest that the catfish pancreas has at least two structurally distinct somatostatins."
https://openalex.org/W1593985324,"Discrimination against the binding of noncognate aminoacyl (aa)-tRNAs by mRNA-programmed ribosomes is the outcome of two selection steps, one involving an aa-tRNA.EFTu.GTP complex, which occurs prior to and includes GTP hydrolysis, the other involving the aa-tRNA alone, which follows GTP hydrolysis. Conditions which lead to errors in protein synthesis have been found to influence the accuracy of one or both selection steps in a system measuring poly(U)-directed binding of Leu-tRNA2Leu. Streptomycin has a large effect only on the discrimination process following GTP hydrolysis, but the other pertubations of recognition studied, high [Mg2+], polyamines, the strA1 and ram1 mutations, affect both discrimination processes. The general result is consistent with the view that proofreading of aa-tRNA by ribosomes for the most part uses the same specificity determinants used in the initial selection of a ternary complex."

https://openalex.org/W1525534263,"[5,6,8,9,11,12-3H6]Leukotriene C3 was converted to polar metabolites which ere excreted in feces and urine for 4-5 days after subcutaneous administration to guinea pigs. Lung homogenates converted leukotriene C3 to leukotriene D3. Liver and kidney homogenates did not catabolize leukotriene C3 appreciably due to inhibition of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in these tissues by endogenous glutathione. Liver and kidney homogenates metabolized [3H6]leukotriene D3 to the cysteine analog, leukotriene E3 (Bernstrom, K., and Hammarstrom, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9579-9582). In addition leukotriene C3 and products of greater polarity were formed. The conversion of leukotriene D3 to leukotriene C3 was catalyzed by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase which performed a reverse reaction due to the high tissue concentrations of glutathione. The results suggest that the degradation of leukotriene C3 to leukotriene D3 is important for the further metabolism of this leukotriene in liver and kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1571694865,"The action of L-triiodothyronine, L-thyroxine, and their analogues on the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase of erythrocytes from rats fed with two different fat-supplemented diets has been studied. It was found that only L-triiodothyronine and L-thyroxine have effects on the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase of both groups, producing inhibition in rats fed with corn oil and activation in rats fed with lard-supplemented diets. The half-maximal effect for L-triiodothyronine and L-thyroxine are, respectively, on the order of 10(-10) and 10(-8) M. These changes were not obtained with analogues of the hormones. It is suggested that the response of this enzymatic system to the hormonal action is conditioned by the fatty acid composition of membrane-bound lipids. This observation is novel in the hormonal research area."
https://openalex.org/W2096154005,"Rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase can be rapidly isolated by a new procedure which uses avidin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The isolated enzyme has Mr = 260,000; none or very little of the proteolytic products of the carboxylase which are formed in conventional purification procedures are found in our preparations. It is apparent that the previously reported subunit of the carboxylase, with Mr = 230,000, is itself the product of proteolysis. The properties of the enzyme produced by our new method are quite different from those of the conventionally prepared enzyme. Our enzyme contains 6 mol of alkali-labile phosphate/mol of subunit, rather than 2 mol; the Km for acetyl-CoA is about 8-fold higher and the specific activity is only about one-fifth of that previously reported. The large amount of phosphate does not appear to cause the low specific activity of the new enzyme preparation, because alkaline phosphatase treatment reduces the number of phosphates/subunit from 6 to 3 mol but does not change the specific activity."
https://openalex.org/W1549418418,"Thiolase I (long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA-specific) from porcine heart has been characterized kinetically. In the direction of acetoacetyl-CoA cleavage, a variety of thiols including CoASH show the same Vmax at saturating concentrations of acetoacetyl-CoA. At a constant overall velocity of acetoacetyl-CoA disappearance, one of the two acetyl groups from acetoacetyl-CoA will partition between CoASH and 2-mercaptoethanol at increasing 2-mercaptoethanol concentrations. These observations suggest rate-determining formation of an acetyl enzyme intermediate in the direction of acetoacetyl-CoA cleavage. In the direction of acetoacetyl-CoA formation from two molecules of acetyl-CoA, the Vmax of acetoacetyl-CoA formation is identical with the Vmax for an acetyl-CoA in equilibrium CoA isotope exchange reaction and the Vmax for an enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer reaction between acetyl-CoA and 2-mercaptoethanol. This suggests that in the direction of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis, the acetyl transfer half-reaction is rate-limiting. The acetyl intermediate has been isolated and characterized. The equilibrium constant for acetyl enzyme formation from acetyl-CoA and free enzyme is 1 +/- 0.5 X 10(-2). The rate constant for spontaneous hydrolysis of the acetyl enzyme (2.6 X 10(-4) s-1) is a factor of 400 faster than the rate constant for acetyl-CoA hydrolysis under comparable conditions. The acetyl enzyme is thermodynamically and kinetically destabilized compared to acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W2045327032,"Species of somatostatin of higher molecular weight were present in the nerve terminals (synaptosomes) of ovine stalk median eminences and were released by depolarizing stimuli. One of these species was identified as the biologically active molecule octacosa somatostatin.

https://openalex.org/W1481344525,"Sugar nucleotide degradation by Zn2+-requiring nucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphatase was effectively inhibited by the addition of the chelator 2,3-dimercaptopropan-1-ol, along with low concentrations of nucleotides or their analogues. The addition of dimercaptopropanol alone completely inhibited alkaline phosphatase. This chelator has a much higher association constant for Zn2+ than for the Mn2+ needed for glycosyltransferase reactions, enabling selective chelation of Zn2+. Neither the chelator alone nor in combination with low concentrations of nucleotides was inhibitory to glycosyltransferase activities, as shown by xylosyltransferase in chick embryo epiphyseal microsomes and galactosyltransferase in rat serum."
https://openalex.org/W1535540228,"The calmodulin (CaM)-binding proteins present in the human red blood cell membrane were examined through photoaffinity labeling. Two different membrane preparations were used: white ghosts and inside-out vesicles. These were incubated with azido-125I-CaM, a photoactivatable derivative of calmodulin, and photolyzed. Cross-linked products were identified by autoradiography of dried sodium dodecyl sulfate slab gels and quantitated by counting gel slices for 125I. The major product formed with each membrane type had an apparent Mr of 168,000. No other product was common to both membrane types; however, a few other products unique to each vesicle type were detected. The formation of the 168,000-dalton product correlated with an increased basal (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in white ghosts and with an increased basal Ca2+ transport in inside-out vesicles. This suggests that the 168,000-dalton product represents a cross-link between azido-125I-CaM and the Ca2+ pump ATPase. The ATPase appears to be a single protein of about 150,000 daltons, which can bind a single calmodulin. No evidence was found to indicate anything other than a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between calmodulin and the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1484198994,"The (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) of sarcoplasmic reticulum contains a cysteine residue at position 12 of its sequence. This sulfhydryl group was 1 out of a total of 10-11 that were labeled by treatment of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with N-[3H]ethylmaleimide under saturating conditions. This was shown by isolating a 31-residue NH2-terminal peptide from a tryptic digest of the succinylated ATPase, prepared from N-[3H]ethylmaleimide-labeled vesicles. Reaction of the vesicles with glutathione maleimide, parachloromercuribenzoic acid, or parachloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid, membrane-impermeant reagents, prevented further reaction of sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide. This result indicates that all sulfhydryl groups that are reactive with N-ethylmaleimide are on the outside of the vesicles. Since Cys12 is located in a hydrophilic NH2-terminal portion of the ATPase, the labeling results suggest that the NH2 terminus of the ATPase is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. These results are consistent with earlier observations (Reithmeier, R. A. F., de Leon, S., and MacLennan, D. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11839-11846) that the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase is synthesized without an NH2-terminal signal sequence."

At 0.7 Ã— 10-7 to 1.5 Ã— 10-7M and at 4 Ã— 10-7Mamanitin equivalents, the conjugate inhibited protein synthesis in S49.1 cells by 50 percent and 80 to 96 percent, respectively. At these concentrations, mutant Thy 1-deficient S49 cells and other murine lymphomas lacking Thy 1 altogether or carrying Thy 1.1 antigens were unaffected. This result demonstrates the potential for targeting amanitin to specific cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1525210984,"In frog erythrocytes, desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors is characterized by a decrease in the beta-receptor recognition sites in the plasma membrane and a concomitant increase in the number of this receptor's binding sites in the cytosol. We have documented that this redistribution of the receptor recognition sites reflects the internalization of the surface-bound beta-adrenergic receptors. The present study was addressed to examine whether transglutaminase plays a role in the agonist-mediated internalization of beta-adrenergic receptor recognition sites. Pretreatment of cells with methylamine was found to decrease the internalization and the loss of membrane-bound beta-adrenergic receptors induced by isoproterenol. Methylamine appears to be equally potent in inhibiting transglutaminase activity and in preventing internalization and the receptor loss. The effect of methylamine on soluble and on membrane-bound beta-adrenergic receptors is due to a change in Bmax rather than Kd of these binding sites. Among eight inhibitors of transglutaminase tested, the rank order potency for blocking the enzyme can be correlated with that for preventing the receptor loss and receptor internalization. Moreover, these drug effects on beta-adrenergic receptors are unrelated to the inhibition of isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase or the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to beta-receptors. These result may lend credence to the view that transglutaminase participates in the internalization and the decrease of membrane-bound receptors during desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1526454669,"Abstract The stereochemical course of the ribosome-dependent GTPase reaction of elongation factor G from Escherichia coli has been determined. Guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate stereospecifically labeled with 17O and 18O in the gamma-position was hydrolyzed in the presence of the elongation factor and ribosomes. The configuration of the product, inorganic [16O, 17O, 18O]thiophosphate ws analyzed by 31P NMR after its stereospecific incorporation into adenosine 5'-(beta-thio)triphosphate. The analysis showed that the hydrolysis proceeds with inversion of configuration at the transferred phosphorus atom. It is therefore likely that the hydrolysis occurs in a single step by direct, in-line transfer of the phosphorus from GDP to a water oxygen, without a phosphoenzyme intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1596954494,"The native and one of the modified forms of tyrosine aminotransferase were purified from rat liver and characterized. Several hydrodynamic properties of the native enzyme are: Stokes radius, 46 A; subunit isoelectric point, 5.6; sedimentation coefficient, 5.6 S, frictional ratio, 1.44; diffusion coefficient, 4.65 X 10(-7) cm2 s-1; extinction coefficient of a 1% solution (w:v) at 280 nm, 10.5 cm-1. The molecular weight of the dimeric protein is 110,500 as calculated from the Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient. The subunit of the modified form is of lower molecular weight than the subunit of the native enzyme and has a pI of about 5.9. During isoelectric focusing, both forms of the enzyme separate into two components. The more acidic component that is resolved from the native enzyme is phosphorylated, but the other component is not. The amino acid composition of native tyrosine aminotransferase differs from values reported for mixtures of the three forms of this enzyme. Neither the native nor the modified forms of the enzyme possess a free alpha-amino group as judged by dansylation, nor can they be digested with leucine aminopeptidase, implying that the NH2-terminus is blocked. The possibility that tyrosine aminotransferase is acetylated was examined by translating poly(A)+RNA from hepatoma cells in a cell-free translational system in the presence and absence of inhibitors of protein acetylation. [35S]Tyrosine aminotransferase synthesized in the presence of the inhibitors has a more basic isoelectric point than the native enzyme as determined by isoelectric focusing, suggesting that the enzyme is acetylated either at the NH2-terminal or the epsilon-amino group of an internal lysine. When digested by either of two lysosomal proteases, tyrosine aminotransferase is cleaved to a smaller size. These data show that tyrosine aminotransferase is susceptible to several post-translational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1420107,"gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase purified from hog kidney cortex was implanted in the human erythrocyte membrane by incubation of erythrocytes at 37 degrees c with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-incorporated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Membranes prepared from these implanted cells exhibited 4- to 5-fold increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. The association/insertion of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase into erythrocyte membrane was further demonstrated by antibody to gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Implantation of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase into erythrocyte membrane led to stimulation of uptake of glutamate and alanine, which are normally transported at a slow rate in human erythrocytes. The uptake of these amino acids in the implanted system was inhibited by inhibitors (serine-borate and azaserine) of transpeptidase activity as well as by antibody to gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. These results in the implanted human erythrocytes demonstrate that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase enzyme can mediate the translocation of amino acids and provide further evidence in support of its postulated role in the transport of amino acids in natural membranes."
https://openalex.org/W124976036,"Nucleotide pyrophosphatase, a Zn2+-dependent enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of sugar nucleotides, generally interferes with glycosyltransferase assays. Certain tissues such as intestinal mucosa are particularly rich sources of nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity. The inhibition of nucleotide pyrophosphatase without affecting glycosyltransferase activities by the removal of Zn2+ allows for the assay of galactosyltransferases in rat intestinal particulate fractions. Inactivation of nucleotide pyrophosphatase was achieved by preincubation of particulate enzyme preparations in the presence of EDTA. Addition of Mn2+, required for the galactosyltransferase assays, did not reactivate the nucleotide pyrophosphatase. The presence of 0.05% (w/v) soybean trypsin inhibitor was required during the preparation of intestinal mucosa homogenates and enzyme assays to protect the UDP-galactose: N-acetylglucosaminyl galactosyltransferase from inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W81049697,"The nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (NTP) substrate specificities for Ca-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activities have been examined in cardiac sarcolemma (SL) and sarcoplasmic (SR) membrane vesicles. The results indicate that SL membrane vesicles exhibit a much narrower range of NTP substrate specificities than SR membranes. In SR membrane vesicles, the Ca-stimulated Mg-dependent hydrolysis of ATP and dATP occurred at nearly equivalent rates, whereas the rates of hydrolysis of GTP, ITP, CTP, and UTP ranged from 16-33% of that for ATP. All of the above nucleotides also supported Ca2+ transport into SR vesicles; dATP was somewhat more effective than ATP while GTP, ITP, CTP, and UTP ranged from 28-30% of the activity for ATP. In the presence of oxalate, the initial rate of Ca accumulation with dATP was 4-fold higher than for ATP, whereas the activity for GTP, ITP, CTP, and UTP ranged from 35-45% of that for ATP. For the SL membranes, Ca-activated dATP hydrolysis occurred at 60% of the rate for ATP; GTP, ITP, CTP, and UTP were hydrolyzed by the SL preparations at only 7-9% of the rate for ATP. NTP-dependent Ca2+ uptake in SL membranes was supported only by ATP and dATP, with dATP 60% as effective as ATP. GTP, ITP, CTP, and UTP did not support the transport of Ca2+ by SL vesicles. The results indicate that the SL and SR membranes contain distinctly different ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport systems."
https://openalex.org/W1553669773,"Rat kidney 5-oxo-L-prolinase catalyzes the endergonic hydrolysis of 5-oxo-L-proline (L-pyroglutamate, L-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate) to form L-glutamate; the reaction is driven by and dependent on the stoichiometric concomitant hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. The present studies are concerned with the mechanism by which the free energy of ATP hydrolysis is conserved and made available for 5-oxoproline hydrolysis. Studies with 18O-labeled substrates showed that (a) all three oxygen atoms of 5-oxoproline are recovered in the product glutamate, and (b) the two water molecules consumed in the reaction contribute one oxygen atom to inorganic phosphate and one oxygen atom to the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamate. It was shown that the enzyme also catalyzes the intrinsically exergonic hydrolysis of alpha-hydroxyglutarate lactone, a reaction that is ATP-dependent. Intermediates in the 5-oxoprolinase reaction were not detected by exchange experiments with radioactive ADP and phosphate, nor were they trapped by adding hydroxylamine. In the presence of very high glutamate concentrations, a slow reversal of the 5-oxoprolinase reaction was demonstrated by measuring ATP formation. The findings are consistent with a mechanism in which 5-oxo-L-proline is phosphorylated by ATP on the amide carbonyl oxygen and the resulting intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed to yield gamma-glutamyl phosphate; the latter is hydrolyzed to glutamate and inorganic phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W176440414,"The activity of asparagine synthetase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is increased in response to asparagine deprivation or decreased aminoacylation of several tRNAs (Andrulis, I. L., Hatfield, G. W., and Arfin, S. M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10629-10633). CHO cells resistant to beta-aspartylhydroxamate have up to 5-fold higher levels of asparagine synthetase than the parental line (Gantt, J. S., Chiang, C. S., Hatfield, G. W., and Arfin, S. M. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4808-4813). We have investigated the basis for these differences in enzyme activity by combined radiochemical and immunological techniques. The asparagine synthetase of beef pancreas was purified to apparent homogeneity. Antibodies raised against the purified protein cross-react with the asparagine synthetase of CHO cells. Immunotitrations show that the amount of enzyme protein in physiologically or genetically derepressed CHO strains is proportional to the level of enzyme activity. Measurement of the relative rates of asparagine synthetase synthesis by pulse-labeling experiments demonstrate that the difference in the number of asparagine synthetase molecules is closely correlated with the rate of enzyme synthesis. In contrast, the half-life of asparagine synthetase in wild type cells and in physiologically or genetically derepressed cells is very similar. It appears that the increased levels of asparagine synthetase can be attributed solely to an increased rate of enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1575314636,"The characteristics of 22Na efflux from 22NaCl-preloaded synaptic plasma membrane vesicles and the stimulation of such efflux by gramicidin D and L-glutamate were determined. The rate and magnitude of passive Na+ efflux were dependent on the initial intravesicular NaCl concentration. A Na+:cation exchange process was also observed. Gramicidin D markedly enhanced Na+ efflux in a concentration-dependent manner and at 10 microM it caused total loss of intravesicular 22Na. The neuroexcitatory amino acids L-glutamate and D-glutamate, and the amino acid analog kainic acid, also stimulated Na+ efflux in a dose-dependent fashion, but their effects were weaker than those of gramicidin D. The mechanism of glutamate stimulation of Na+ flux is presumed to be through the activation of the glutamate receptor . Na+ channel complex in these membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1481698917,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a major rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, is subject to acute regulation by both allosteric modulation and covalent enzyme phosphorylation. Because citrate activation of the enzyme in vitro requires citrate concentrations far in excess of intracellular levels, we have attempted to identify other ligands which might mediate carboxylase activity. Heated liver extracts contain a potent endogenous activator of carboxylase assayed in dialyzed high speed liver supernatant; the activator elutes behind the salt volume of a Bio-Gel P-6 gel filtration column, is destroyed by alkaline phosphatase, and is adsorbed by charcoal. This activator activity is shared by several guanine nucleotides (5'-GTP, 5'-GDP, 5'-GMP, and 3':5'-cyclic GMP). Further separation of the endogenous activator by high pressure liquid chromatography reveals a carboxylase-activating compound which co-elutes with 5'-GMP. The guanine nucleotides are potent activators of carboxylase activity at intracellular nucleotide concentrations and permit expression of maximal enzyme velocity at cytosolic citrate concentrations. However, we have been unable to document any effects of guanine nucleotides on isolated rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase. While the mechanisms of these effects remain to be elucidated, they suggest that the guanine nucleotides may be important intracellular regulators of carboxylase activity and of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1530722799,"Glutamine synthetase in Escherichia coli is regulated by adenylation and deadenylation reactions. The adenylation reaction converts the divalent cation requirement of the enzyme from Mg2+ to Mn2+. Previously, the catalytic action of unadenylated glutamine synthetase was elucidated by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change accompanying substrate binding. However, due to the lack of changes in the tryptophan fluorescence, a similar study could not be done with the adenylated enzyme. In this study, therefore, an extrinsic fluor is introduced into the adenylated glutamine synthetase by adenylating the enzyme with 2-aza-1,N6-ethenoadenosine triphosphate, a fluorescent analog of ATP. The modified enzyme (aza-epsilon-glutamine synthetase) exhibits catalytic and kinetic properties similar to those of the naturally adenylated enzyme. The results of fluorometric studies on this aza-epsilon-glutamine synthetase indicated that L-glutamate and ATP bind to both Mn2+ and Mg2+ forms of the enzyme in a random order, but only the Mn2+ form is capable of forming a highly reactive enzyme-bound intermediate which is a prerequisite for the reaction with NH4+ to form products. The extrinsic fluorescence changes are also used to determine the binding constants of various substrates and inhibitors of both the biosynthetic and gamma-glutamyl transfer reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1601700652,"The kinetic binding mechanism of rat kidney gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase has been evaluated by isotope exchange at equilibrium studies. The results are consistent with a Random BC mechanism as suggested previously (Yip, B. P., and Rudolph, F. B. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 3563-3568). The purification procedure for the enzyme was modified to remove contaminating adenylate kinase prior to isotope exchange studies."
https://openalex.org/W1536123921,"Glutamate dehydrogenase binds alpha-ketoglutarate and NADPH to form a ternary complex whose ultraviolet difference spectrum exhibits a blue-shifted coenzyme absorption band and a distinctive aromatic amino acid perturbation. When ammonia is added to this complex at -42 degrees C in 50% methanol, initiating the enzymatic reaction, these two spectral features disappear at different rates. The kinetic independence of these two features is especially evident in the presence of excess L-glutamate. We propose that, under cryogenic conditions at least, there are two forms of the enzyme. The blue shift of the coenzyme absorption band reflects only the physical presence of an alpha-ketoglutarate molecule at the active site, while the distinctive aromatic amino acid perturbation reflects a change in enzyme structure caused by alpha-ketoglutarate binding which may persist in the absence of any bound alpha-ketoglutarate molecule. Simple red and blue shifts of model tyrosine and tryptophan compounds cannot be used to simulate the observed aromatic amino acid perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2416101005,"Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a reagent commonly employed for the inhibition of serine proteases, has been found to cause significant inhibition of the incorporation of labeled acetate, but not mevalonate, into nonsaponifiable lipid and digitonin-precipitable sterols in the 10,000 X g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate preparations. In two experiments, the extent of inhibition of the synthesis of digitonin-precipitable sterols from acetate by PMSF at 1 mM was 81 and 65%. PMSF inhibited the synthesis of nonsaponifiable lipid from acetate at concentrations as low as 0.1 microM. Preincubation of the 10,000 X g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenates with PMSF (1 mM) resulted in a significant reduction of the activities of acetate thiokinase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG)-CoA synthase, but did not affect the activities of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. Preincubation of rat liver microsomes with PMSF (1 mM) caused a 50% reduction in the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The combined results indicate that major sites of action of PMSF in the inhibition of sterol biosynthesis from labeled acetate appear to be on the activities of acetate thiokinase, HMG-CoA synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase. Another reagent used to inhibit serine proteases, diisopropylfluorophosphate, had (at a concentration of 1 mM) no effect on the activities of cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, HMG-CoA synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase."
