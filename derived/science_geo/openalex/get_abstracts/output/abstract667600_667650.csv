https://openalex.org/W3123744360,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD)1,2, but how these loci confer AD risk is unclear. Here, we aimed to identify loci that confer AD risk through their effects on brain protein abundance to provide new insights into AD pathogenesis. To that end, we integrated AD GWAS results with human brain proteomes to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of AD, followed by Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis. We identified 11 genes that are consistent with being causal in AD, acting via their cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Nine replicated in a confirmation PWAS and eight represent new AD risk genes not identified before by AD GWAS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our results were independent of APOE e4. Together, our findings provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and promising targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies."

Applying genome-wide multiple testing correction, we identified three significant loci in European case-control analyses and 15 loci in quantitative symptom analyses. Genomic structural equation modeling indicated tight coherence of a PTSD symptom factor that shares genetic variance with a distinct internalizing (mood-anxiety-neuroticism) factor. Partitioned heritability indicated enrichment in several cortical and subcortical regions, and imputed genetically regulated gene expression in these regions was used to identify potential drug repositioning candidates. These results validate the biological coherence of the PTSD syndrome, inform its relationship to comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders and provide new considerations for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3122023875,"Why have the effects of COVID-19 been so unevenly geographically distributed in the United States? This paper investigates the role of social capital as a mediating factor for the spread of the virus. Because social capital is associated with greater trust and relationships within a community, it could endow individuals with a greater concern for others, thereby leading to more hygienic practices and social distancing. Using data for over 2,700 US counties, we investigate how social capital explains the level and growth rate of infections. We find that moving a county from the 25 th to the 75 th percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths, as well as suggestive evidence of a lower spread of the virus. Our results are robust to many demographic characteristics, controls, and alternative measures of social capital."
https://openalex.org/W3126098507,"Autophagy is an essential cellular process that removes harmful protein species, and autophagy upregulation may be able to protect against neurodegeneration and various pathogens. Here, we have identified the essential protein VCP/p97 (VCP, valosin-containing protein) as a novel regulator of autophagosome biogenesis, where VCP regulates autophagy induction in two ways, both dependent on Beclin-1. Utilizing small-molecule inhibitors of VCP ATPase activity, we show that VCP stabilizes Beclin-1 levels by promoting the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin-3 towards Beclin-1. VCP also regulates the assembly and activity of the Beclin-1-containing phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) complex I, thus regulating the production of PI(3)P, a key signaling lipid responsible for the recruitment of downstream autophagy factors. A decreased level of VCP, or inhibition of its ATPase activity, impairs starvation-induced production of PI(3)P and limits downstream recruitment of WIPI2, ATG16L and LC3, thereby decreasing autophagosome formation, illustrating an important role for VCP in early autophagy initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3125658236,"This paper provides a thorough overview and further clarification surrounding the volatility behavior of the major six cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Dash and Dogecoin) with respect to world currencies (Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen), the relative performance of diverse GARCH-type specifications namely the SGARCH, IGARCH (1,1), EGARCH (1,1), GJR-GARCH (1,1), APARCH (1,1), TGARCH (1,1) and CGARCH (1,1), and the forecasting performance of the Value at Risk measure. The sampled period extends from October 13 th 2015 till November 18 th 2019. The findings evidenced the superiority of the IGARCH model, in both the in-sample and the out-of-sample contexts, when it deals with forecasting the volatility of world currencies, namely the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen. The CGARCH alternative modeled the Euro almost perfectly during both periods. Advanced GARCH models better depicted asymmetries in cryptocurrencies’ volatility and revealed persistence and “intensifying” levels in their volatility. The IGARCH was the best performing model for Monero. As for the remaining cryptocurrencies, the GJR-GARCH model proved to be superior during the in-sample period while the CGARCH and TGARCH specifications were the optimal ones in the out-of-sample interval. The VaR forecasting performance is enhanced with the use of the asymmetric GARCH models. The VaR results provided a very accurate measure in determining the level of downside risk exposing the selected exchange currencies at all confidence levels. However, the outcomes were far from being uniform for the selected cryptocurrencies: convincing for Dash and Dogcoin, acceptable for Litecoin and Monero and unconvincing for Bitcoin and Ripple, where the (optimal) model was not rejected only at the 99% confidence level."
https://openalex.org/W3124103630,"Neural-derived signals are crucial regulators of CNS vascularization. However, whether the vasculature responds to these signals by means of elongating and branching or in addition by building a feedback response to modulate neurodevelopmental processes remains unknown. In this study, we identified bidirectional crosstalk between the neural and the vascular compartment of the developing CNS required for oligodendrocyte precursor cell specification. Mechanistically, we show that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) express angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and that this expression is regulated by Sonic hedgehog. We demonstrate that NPC-derived Ang1 signals to its receptor, Tie2, on endothelial cells to induce the production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1). Endothelial-derived TGFβ1, in turn, acts as an angiocrine molecule and signals back to NPCs to induce their commitment toward oligodendrocyte precursor cells. This work demonstrates a true bidirectional collaboration between NPCs and the vasculature as a critical regulator of oligodendrogenesis. Paredes et al. identify bidirectional crosstalk between the neural and the vascular compartment in the developing CNS required for oligodendrocyte precursor cell specification and mediated by an angiopoietin1–Tie2–TGFß1 signaling axis."

The aim of antenatal care is to assure that every pregnancy culminates in the delivery of a healthy baby without negative effects on the health of pregnant women through health promotion and disease prevention, early detection, and treatment of complications and existing diseases. Hence, this study assessed the late initiation of antenatal care and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at public health centers of Ilu Ababor Zone, southwest Ethiopia. An Institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 389 pregnant women who were attending antenatal care service at twelve randomly selected health centers. A systematic sampling technique was employed to recruit pregnant women. Pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect data. Data were entered into Epidata and exported to SPSS for analysis. Those women who started antenatal care follow up after 12 weeks of gestational age were categorized as booked lately. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify an association between the independent predictors and the outcome variable. In this study, 277 (71.2%) of the participants were booked their first antenatal care visit lately. Having family size of ≥ 4 (AOR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.07–4.74), maternal age ≥ 25 years (AOR: 2.30; 95%CI: 1.02–5.18) and perceived the right time of booking &gt; 12 weeks of gestation (AOR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.13–5.04) had higher odds of late antenatal care initiation. Similarly, not being a member of women’s health developmental army (AOR: 2.35; 95%CI: 1.09–5.07) and ANC not attended previously (AOR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.17–9.42) had also a more likelihood of booking antenatal care lately. In this study, the majority of women started antenatal care lately. Thus, the provision of health education on the importance of attending first antenatal care early is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3125286483,"Flooding risk in cities has been recently exacerbated by increased urbanization and climate change, often with catastrophic consequences in terms of casualties and economic losses. Rainwater harvesting systems and green roofs are recognized as being among the most effective blue-green mitigation measures. However, performances of these systems have currently been investigated only at laboratory or very-small local scales. In this work, we assess the potential benefit of the extensive installation of these solutions on all the rooftops of 9 cities, with different climatological and geographical characteristics. Both surface discharge reduction and delay between rainfall and runoff peak generation have been investigated. Green roofs ensure a larger average lag time between rainfall and runoff peaks than rainwater harvesting systems, without significant differences between intensive and extensive structures. On the other hand, the cost-efficiency analysis, considering the entire urban area, shows a higher retention capacity with a lower financial investment for rainwater harvesting rather than for green roofs in most cases. For extreme rainfall events, large-scale installation of rainwater harvesting systems coupled with intensive green roofs over the entire city have shown to be the most efficient solution, with a total discharge reduction that can vary from 5% to 15%, depending on the city characteristics and local climate."
https://openalex.org/W3121190469,"Background SLFN11 has recently been reported to execute cancer cells harboring replicative stress induced by DNA damaging agents. However, the roles of SLFN11 under physiological conditions remain poorly understood. Germinal center B-cells (GCBs) undergo somatic hypermutations and class-switch recombination, which can cause physiological genotoxic stress. Hence, we tested whether SLFN11 expression needs to be suppressed in GCBs during B-cell development. Objective To clarify the expression profile of SLFN11 in different developmental stages of B-cells and B-cell-derived cancers. Methods We analyzed the expression of SLFN11 by mining cell line databases for different stages of normal B-cells and various types of B-cell-derived cancer cell lines. We performed dual immunohistochemical staining for SLFN11 and B-cell specific markers in normal human lymphatic tissues. We tested the effects of two epigenetic modifiers, an EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat (EPZ6438) and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat (LBH589) on SLFN11 expression in GCB-derived lymphoma cell lines. We also examined the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs in combination with cytosine arabinoside and the effects of SLFN11 on the efficacy of cytosine arabinoside in SLFN11-overexpressing cells. Results SLFN11 mRNA level was found low in both normal GCBs and GCB-DLBCL (GCB like-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Immunohistochemical staining showed low SLFN11 expression in GCBs and high SLFN11 expression in plasmablasts and plasmacytes. The EZH2 and HDAC epigenetic modifiers upregulated SLFN11 expression in GCB-derived lymphoma cells and made them more susceptible to cytosine arabinoside. SLFN11 overexpression further sensitized GCB-derived lymphoma cells to cytosine arabinoside. Conclusions The expression of SLFN11 is epigenetically suppressed in normal GCBs and GCB-derived lymphomas. GCB-derived lymphomas with low SLFN11 expression can be treated by the combination of epigenetic modifiers and cytosine arabinoside."
https://openalex.org/W3122276608,"Transportation infrastructure, such as railways, roads and power lines, contribute to national and regional economic, social and cultural growth and integration. Kenya, with support from the Chinese government, is currently constructing a standard gauge railway (SGR) to support the country’s Vision 2030 development agenda. Although the actual land area affected by the SGR covers only a small proportion along the SGR corridor, a significant proportion of the area supports a wide range of ecologically fragile and important ecosystems in the country, with potential wider impacts. This study used a qualitative content analysis approach to gain an understanding and perceptions of stakeholders on the potential ecological impacts of the interactions between the SGR and the traversed ecological systems in Kenya. Three dominant themes emerged: 1) ecosystem degradation; 2) ecosystem fragmentation; and 3) ecosystem destruction. Ecosystem degradation was the most commonly cited impact at while ecosystem destruction was of the least concern and largely restricted to the physical SGR construction whereas the degradation and fragmentation have a much wider footprint. The construction and operation of the SGR degraded, fragmented and destroyed key ecosystems in the country including water towers, protected areas, community conservancies and wildlife dispersal areas. Therefore, we recommend that project proponents develop sustainable and ecologically sensitive measures to mitigate the key ecosystem impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3124295781,"Objective One of the greatest challenges in clinical trial design is dealing with the subjectivity and variability introduced by human raters when measuring clinical end-points. We hypothesized that robotic measures that capture the kinematics of human movements collected longitudinally in patients after stroke would bear a significant relationship to the ordinal clinical scales and potentially lead to the development of more sensitive motor biomarkers that could improve the efficiency and cost of clinical trials. Materials and methods We used clinical scales and a robotic assay to measure arm movement in 208 patients 7, 14, 21, 30 and 90 days after acute ischemic stroke at two separate clinical sites. The robots are low impedance and low friction interactive devices that precisely measure speed, position and force, so that even a hemiparetic patient can generate a complete measurement profile. These profiles were used to develop predictive models of the clinical assessments employing a combination of artificial ant colonies and neural network ensembles. Results The resulting models replicated commonly used clinical scales to a cross-validated R 2 of 0.73, 0.75, 0.63 and 0.60 for the Fugl-Meyer, Motor Power, NIH stroke and modified Rankin scales, respectively. Moreover, when suitably scaled and combined, the robotic measures demonstrated a significant increase in effect size from day 7 to 90 over historical data (1.47 versus 0.67). Discussion and conclusion These results suggest that it is possible to derive surrogate biomarkers that can significantly reduce the sample size required to power future stroke clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3123084694,"Deploying under-utilized landraces in wheat breeding has been advocated to accelerate genetic gains in current era of genomics assisted breeding. Mexican bread wheat landraces (Creole wheats) represent an important resource for the discovery of novel alleles including disease resistance. A core set of 1,098 Mexican landraces was subjected to multi-location testing for rust diseases in India, Mexico and Kenya. The landrace core set showed a continuous variation for yellow (YR) and stem rust (SR) disease severity. Principal component analysis differentiated Mexican landraces into three groups based on their respective collection sites. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay varied from 10 to 32 Mb across chromosomes with an averge of 23Mb across whole genome. Genome-wide association analysis revealed marker-trait associations for YR resistance in India and Mexico as well as for SR resistance in Kenya. In addition, significant additive-additive interaction effects were observed for both YR and SR resistance including genomic regions on chromosomes 1BL and 3BS, which co-locate with pleiotropic genes Yr29/Lr46/Sr58/Pm39/Ltn2 and Sr2/Yr30/Lr27 , respectively. Study reports novel genomic associations for YR (chromosomes 1AL, 2BS, and 3BL) and SR (chromosomes 2AL, 4DS, and 5DS). The novel findings in Creole wheat landraces can be efficiently utilized for the wheat genetic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3123141357,"Soil phosphorus (P) adsorption and desorption occur in an important endogenous cycle linked with soil fertility problems and relevant to the environmental risk assessment of P. In our study, the effect of long-term inorganic and organic fertilization on P adsorption and desorption characteristics in relation to changes in soil properties was evaluated by selecting three long-term experimental sites in southern China. The selected treatments at each site were CK (unfertilized), NPK (synthetic nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and NPKM (synthetic NPK plus manure). The adsorption and desorption characteristics of P were evaluated using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The results showed that long-term application of NPK plus manure significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC), total P and available P at all three sites compared with the NPK and CK treatments. All three treatments fit these equations well. The maximum adsorption capacity (Q m ) of P increased with NPKM treatment, and the binding energy of P (K) and the maximum buffering capacity (MBC) showed increasing trends. NPKM showed the highest Q m (2346.13 mg kg -1 ) at the Jinxian site, followed by Nanchang (221.16 mg kg -1 ) and Ningxiang (2219.36 mg kg -1 ). Compared to CK and NPK, the NPKM treatment showed a higher MBC as 66.64, 46.93 and 44.39 L kg -1 at all three sites. The maximum desorption capacity (D m ) of P in soil was highest with the NPKM treatment (157.58, 166.76, 143.13 mg kg -1 ), showing a better ability to release P in soil. The correlation matrix showed a significant positive correlation of SOC, total and available P with Q m , D m and MBC. In conclusion, it is suggested that manure addition is crucial to improve P utilization in red paddy soils within the recommended range to avoid the risk of environmental pollution."
https://openalex.org/W3125315405,"This study provides a review of methods used in the determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in ginseng and compares the effectiveness of three extraction methods (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS), a modified QuEChERS and a Fast Pesticide Extraction (FaPEx)) in the analyses of 20 OCPs in ginseng root samples. For each method, sample mass, solvent volume and sorbent mass were varied to identify the optimum combination to effectively isolate analytes of interest from the complex sample matrix. Extracts were analyzed using the gas chromatography-μ-electron capture detector (GC-μ-ECD), and confirmatory analyses performed by gas chromatography-tandem-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Eighteen out of 20 OCPs spiked onto in-house prepared ginseng samples produced acceptable recoveries (51–156%) when extracted using QuEChERS and FaPEx. All 20 analytes, including dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p, p’- DDD) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o, p’-DDT), produced acceptable recoveries (51–129%) with the use of a modified QuEChERS method. The applicability of the modified QuEChERS method was demonstrated through the analysis of ginseng samples grown in endosulfan-treated soil. The samples were analyzed by both GC-μ-ECD and GC-MS/MS with no significant difference identified in the results of each analytical method. This study highlights the applicability of the modified QuEChERS method, in combination with GC- μ-ECD, to determine organochlorine pesticides in ginseng. This may be especially useful for laboratories in developing countries and less advanced institutions without access to MS/MS instrumentation."
https://openalex.org/W3122855399,"Studies that screen for metabolites produced in ruminants are actively underway. We aimed to evaluate the metabolic profiles of five biofluids (ruminal fluid, serum, milk, urine, and feces) in dairy cow by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) and provide a list of metabolites in each biofluid for the benefit of future research. We analyzed the metabolites in five biofluids from lactating cows using proton nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; 96, 73, 88, 118, and 128 metabolites were identified in the five biofluids, respectively. In addition, 8, 6, 9, and 17 metabolites were unique to ruminal fluid, serum, milk, and urine, respectively. The metabolites present at high concentrations were: acetate, propionate, and butyrate in ruminal fluid; lactate, glucose, and acetate in serum; and lactose, guanidoacetate, and glucitol in milk. In addition, the following metabolites were present at high concentrations: hippurate, urea, and trimethylamine N-oxide in urine and acetate, propionate, and butyrate in feces. The score plots of the principal component analysis did not show clear distinctions among the five biofluid samples. The purpose of this study was to verify the ability of our metabolomics approaches to identify metabolites in the biofluids of dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W3121557243,"Amphimoschus is an extinct Eurasian ruminant genus, mostly recorded in Europe, without a close living relative and, hence, an unknown systematic position. This genus is known from around 50 localities from the late early to the middle Miocene. Two species were described during 180 years, but since their first description during the late 19 th century and early 20 th century, hardly any detailed taxonomic work has been done on the genus. Over the years, extensive collecting and excavating activities have enriched collections with more and more complete material of this still rare and enigmatic animal. Most interestingly, a number of skull remains have been unearthed and are promising in terms of providing phylogenetic information. In the present paper, we describe cranial material, the bony labyrinth, the dentition through 780 teeth and five skulls from different ontogenetic stages. We cannot find a clear morphometric distinction between the supposedly smaller and older species Amphimoschus artenensis and the supposedly younger and larger species A . ponteleviensis . Accordingly, we have no reason to retain the two species and propose, following the principle of priority (ICZN chapter 6 article 23), that only A . ponteleviensis Bourgeois, 1873 is valid. Our studies on the ontogenetic variation of Amphimoschus does reveal that the sagittal crest may increase in size and a supraorbital ridge may appear with age. Despite the abundant material, the family affiliation is still uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W3123046398,"Most of the commercial papaya genotypes show susceptibility to water deficit stress and require high volumes of irrigation water to yield properly. To tackle this problem, we have collected wild native genotypes of Carica papaya that have proved to show better physiological performance under water deficit stress than the commercial cultivar grown in Mexico. In the present study, plants from a wild Carica papaya genotype and a commercial genotype were subjected to water deficit stress (WDS), and their response was characterized in physiological and molecular terms. The physiological parameters measured (water potential, photosynthesis, Fv/Fm and electrolyte leakage) confirmed that the papaya wild genotype showed better physiological responses than the commercial one when exposed to WDS. Subsequently, RNA-Seq was performed for 4 cDNA libraries in both genotypes (susceptible and tolerant) under well-watered conditions, and when they were subjected to WDS for 14 days. Consistently, differential expression analysis revealed that after 14 days of WDS, the wild tolerant genotype had a higher number of up-regulated genes, and a higher number of transcription factors (TF) that were differentially expressed in response to WDS, than the commercial genotype. Thus, six TF genes (CpHSF, CpMYB, CpNAC, CpNFY-A, CpERF and CpWRKY) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis as they were highly expressed in response to WDS in the wild papaya genotype. qRT-PCR results confirmed that the wild genotype had higher expression levels (REL) in all 6 TF genes than the commercial genotype. Our transcriptomic analysis should help to unravel candidate genes that may be useful in the development of new drought-tolerant cultivars of this important tropical crop."
https://openalex.org/W3125332886,"The invasive wasp-mimicking Tiger Longicorn Beetle, Xylotrechus chinensis , a potentially lethal pest of mulberry trees (Moraceae: Morus sp.), was first reported in Europe in 2018, although its colonization and establishment were estimated to have occurred during the year 2012 or earlier. In Catalonia the infestation spread from four towns and 44.1 km 2 in 2018 to 12 towns and 378.1 km 2 in 2020; in the studied town of Barberà del Vallès, infested trees rose from 16.21% in February 2016 to 59.29% in December 2018. Human safety in public parks and avenues is a concern, as beetle infestation increases the risk of falling branches. The main objective of this study was to evaluate how the infestation progresses over time, with and without abamectin treatment, and provide insights into female egg-laying preferences. Such knowledge helps contribute to management efforts to reduce expansion of the range of beetle infestation. Our statistical analysis shows that females prefer laying eggs on larger trees, on the highest part of trunks and on the crown base (this being more preferred than the trunk), and they do so on warmer, SW orientations rather than those facing N, NW and E. Emergence holes and gallery slits predict the spreading of infestations to new trees. An abamectin treatment (trunk injection) carried out at the end of April significantly reduced the number of new infestation. However, for maximum insecticide efficiency, the best time for treating with abamectin would be from mid-July to mid-August, when newly hatched larvae begin feeding on the phloem."
https://openalex.org/W3125724250,"We examine gender bias in media by tallying the number of men and women quoted in news text, using the Gender Gap Tracker, a software system we developed specifically for this purpose. The Gender Gap Tracker downloads and analyzes the online daily publication of seven English-language Canadian news outlets and enhances the data with multiple layers of linguistic information. We describe the Natural Language Processing technology behind this system, the curation of off-the-shelf tools and resources that we used to build it, and the parts that we developed. We evaluate the system in each language processing task and report errors using real-world examples. Finally, by applying the Tracker to the data, we provide valuable insights about the proportion of people mentioned and quoted, by gender, news organization, and author gender. Data collected between October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2020 shows that, in general, men are quoted about three times as frequently as women. While this proportion varies across news outlets and time intervals, the general pattern is consistent. We believe that, in a world with about 50% women, this should not be the case. Although journalists naturally need to quote newsmakers who are men, they also have a certain amount of control over who they approach as sources. The Gender Gap Tracker relies on the same principles as fitness or goal-setting trackers: By quantifying and measuring regular progress, we hope to motivate news organizations to provide a more diverse set of voices in their reporting."
https://openalex.org/W3123479989,"Background Bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are a frequent complication of influenza and contribute to the widespread use of antibiotics. Influenza vaccination may help reduce both appropriate and inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics. Electronic health records provide a rich source of information for assessing secondary effects of influenza vaccination. Methods We conducted a retrospective study to estimate effects of influenza vaccine on antibiotic (amoxicillin) prescription in the elderly based on data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The introduction of UK policy to recommend the influenza vaccine to older adults in 2000 led to a substantial increase in uptake, creating a natural experiment. Of 259,753 eligible patients that were unvaccinated in 1999 and aged≥65y by January 2000, 88,519 patients received influenza vaccination in 2000. These were propensity score matched 1:1 to unvaccinated patients. Time-to-amoxicillin was analysed using the Prior Event Rate Ratio (PERR) Pairwise method to address bias from time-invariant measured and unmeasured confounders. A simulation study and negative control outcome were used to help strengthen the validity of results. Results Compared to unvaccinated patients, those from the vaccinated group were more likely to be prescribed amoxicillin in the year prior to vaccination: hazard ratio (HR) 1.90 (95% confidence interval 1.83, 1.98). Following vaccination, the vaccinated group were again more likely to be prescribed amoxicillin, HR 1.64 (1.58,1.71). After adjusting for prior differences between the two groups using PERR Pairwise, overall vaccine effectiveness was 0.86 (0.81, 0.92). Additional analyses suggested that provided data meet the PERR assumptions, these estimates were robust. Conclusions Once differences between groups were taken into account, influenza vaccine had a beneficial effect, lowering the frequency of amoxicillin prescribing in the vaccinated group. Ensuring successful implementation of national programmes of vaccinating older adults against influenza may help contribute to reducing antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3122614252,"Quantitative measurement of nanoscale surface roughness of articular cartilage tissue is significant to assess the surface topography for early treatment of osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease worldwide. Since it was not established by clinical diagnostic tools, the current studies have been suggesting the use of alternative diagnostic tools using pre-clinical methods. This study aims to measure the nanoscale surface roughness of articular cartilage tissue utilizing biospeckle which is used as a non-destructive and non-contact optical imaging technique. An experimental setup was implemented to capture biospeckle images from twelve cross-section areas of articular cartilage tissue gathered from bovine knee joints at 632 nm wavelength laser radiation. Then, to analyze the biospeckle image, a second-order statistical-based method was proposed through the combination of 308 highly correlated statistical features extracted from implemented gray-level co-occurrence matrices by employing principal component analysis. The result indicated that the measurement of the nanoscale surface roughness based on the first principal component only is able to provide accurate and precise quantitative measurement of early signs of articular cartilage degeneration up to 2500 nm."
https://openalex.org/W3122794588,"Background Transanal irrigation (TAI) has emerged as a key option when more conservative bowel management does not help spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD). Aim To investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of an electronic TAI system (Navina Smart) in subjects with NBD. Design We present an open, prospective efficacy study on Navina Smart, in individuals with NBD secondary to SCI, studied at three months. Population Eighty-nine consecutive consenting established SCI individuals (61 male; mean age 48, range 18–77) naïve to TAI treatment were recruited from ten centres in seven countries. Subjects had confirmed NBD of at least moderate severity (NBD score ≥10). Methods Subjects were taught how to use the device at baseline assisted by the Navina Smart app, and treatment was tailored during phone calls until optimal TAI regime was achieved. The NBD score was measured at baseline and at three months follow up (mean 98 days). Safety analysis was performed on the complete population while per protocol (PP) analysis was performed on 52 subjects. Results PP analysis showed a significant decrease in mean NBD score (17.8 to 10, p&lt;0.00001). In subjects with severe symptoms (defined as NBD score ≥14), mean NBD scores decreased (19.4 to 10.9, p&lt;0.0001). The number of subjects with severe symptoms decreased from 41 (79%) subjects at baseline to 16 (31%) at three months follow-up. Device failure accounted for the commonest cause for loss of data. Side effects possibly related to the device developed in 11 subjects (12%). Discontinuation due to failure of therapy to relieve symptoms was reported by 5 subjects (6%). Conclusion Navina Smart is effective for individuals with NBD, even those with severe symptoms; long-term data will follow. Whilst there were some device problems (addressed by the later stages of subject recruitment) the treatment was generally safe. Clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02979808 )"
https://openalex.org/W3122966720,"There is evidence that adoption of non-pharmaceutical containment measures (NPMs) may have had a major impact on Covid-19 epidemic dynamics, and mitigated its effect on healthcare system. Optimal timing of implementation of these measures however is not known. In Italy, a national lockdown was decided on March 11 th 2020 and ended 4 th of May. At that time, cumulative incidence (CI) was different in Italian regions which ranged from &lt;5 cases/100,000 to &gt;11 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In this paper, we aim to evaluate how level of incidence in different regions at the time of implementation of NPMs affected CI and had an impact on the healthcare system in terms of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rates. We used regional daily new COVID-19 diagnosed cases as well number of people hospitalized in ICU and number of deaths for period February 24-May 11 from all the 19 Italian regions and two autonomous provinces. For each region we calculated: temporal daily trend of cumulative cases of Covid-19/100,000 inhabitants, daily trend of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rate at the end of period. We found that the epidemic curves show similar trends for all regions and all tend to flatten between 11–32 days. However, after 2 months, regions with lower CI at lockdown remained at substantially lower CI (&lt;265 cases/100,000), had a peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU which did not exceed 79.4% and a mortality&lt;0.27/1,000. On the other hand, in regions with higher incidence at lockdown, CI reached 382–921 cases/100,000, the peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU and mortality rate reached 270%, and 1.5/1,000, respectively. Our data suggests that level of CI at the moment of lockdown is important to control the subsequent spread of infection so NPMs should be adopted very early during the course of Covid-19 epidemic, in order to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system and to reduce related mortality."

The molecular weight of pure MRYP and the ratio of mannose to glucose in components of MRYP were determined. Antioxidant and antibacterial abilities of MRYP were investigated in vitro and in vivo . The optimal fermentation parameters were as follows: Medium 4, pH = 6.72, temperature = 30.18°C, blades speed = 461.36 r/min; the optimized yield reached 4323.90 mg/L, which was 1.31 times the original yield. The sequence of factors that affected the MRYP yield was the blades speed&gt;pH&gt;temperature. The main components of MRYP were MYH-1 and MYH-2. The molecular weights of MYH-1 and MYH-2 were 246.92 kDa and 21.88 kDa, respectively; they accounted for 53.60% and 28.75% of total polysaccharide. In MYH-1 and MYH-2, the proportion of glucose and mannose accounted for 46.94%, 38.46%, and 67.10%, 7.17%, respectively.

Our analysis of employer responses to more than 3,200 fictitious job applications across 15 occupations revealed that overall positive employer response rates were higher for women than men by almost 5 percentage points. We found that this gap was driven by employer responses in female-dominated occupations. Male applicants were about half as likely as female applicants to receive a positive employer response in female-dominated occupations. For male-dominated and mixed occupations we found no significant differences in positive employer responses between male and female applicants."
https://openalex.org/W3124832149,"Background Maternal stressful life events during pregnancy have been associated with immune dysregulation and increased risk for asthma and atopy in offspring. Few studies have investigated whether prenatal stress is associated with increased overall or specific infectious diseases in childhood, nor explored sex differences. We sought to examine the relationship between the nature and timing of maternal stress in pregnancy and hospitalisation with infection in offspring. Methods Between 1989 and 1992, exposure data on stressful life events were collected from pregnant women (Gen1) in the Raine Study at 18 and 34 weeks’ gestation and linked to statutory state-wide hospital morbidity data. We examined associations between the number, category and timing of maternal prenatal stress events and overall and clinical groups of offspring (Gen2) infection-related hospitalisation until age 16 years, adjusting for maternal age, education, and smoking in pregnancy in addition to the presence of siblings at birth. Results Of 2,141 offspring with complete stress in pregnancy data available, 1,089 had at least one infection-related hospitalisation, with upper respiratory tract infections the most common (n = 556). Each additional stressful life event during pregnancy was associated with increased risk in male offspring for hospitalisation with all infection types. There was little evidence of these associations in girls. Conclusions Increased exposure to stressful life events in utero is associated with sex-specific infection-related hospitalisations in childhood. Prenatal stress may adversely affect early immune development for boys and increase the risk of more severe infections. Mechanistic understanding would inform preventative interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3121206605,"Background Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) frequently causes outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). It is believed that MRSA predominantly enters the NICU with MRSA colonized parents. In Denmark, 27 MRSA NICU outbreaks have been registered between 2008 and 2019. Aim The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MRSA nasal carriage in pregnant women in Copenhagen and to clarify if MRSA screening during pregnancy could add to the prevention of NICU outbreaks. Methods All pregnant women 18 years or older were offered MRSA nasal screening at their first midwife visit between 13 and 20 weeks of gestation. Results 1778 pregnant women were included, two (0.11%) carried MRSA in the nose. Conclusion Infants of the two MRSA positive women were not admitted to a NICU and therefore the screening had no impact on NICU outbreaks. The low prevalence of MRSA found in this study does not justify MRSA screening of all pregnant women in Denmark."

The subjects of this study were part of the Fujiwara-kyo Eye Study, a cross sectional epidemiological study of elderly individuals conducted by Nara Medical University. Participants were ≥70-years who lived in the Nara Prefecture. All underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, and a VI was defined as a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/40 in the better eye. The associations between the BCVA and walking speed and one-leg standing time were determined. The medical history and health conditions were evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire. A total of the 2,809 subjects whose mean age was 76.3 ± 4.8 years (± standard deviation) were studied. The individuals with a VI (2.1%) had significantly slower walking speeds and shorter one-leg standing times than that of the non-VI individuals (1.5±0.4 vs 1.7±0.4 m/sec, P &lt;0.01; 17.1±19.6 vs 27.6±21.3 sec, P &lt;0.01, respectively). Univariate logistic regression found that the odds ratio (OR) for the slower walking speed (&lt;1 m/sec) in the VI individuals was significantly higher at 7.40 (3.36–16.30;95% CI, P &lt;0.001) than in non-VI individuals. It was still significantly higher at 4.50 (1.87–10.85;95% CI, P = 0.001) in the multivariate logistic regression model after adjusting for the BCVA, age, sex, current smoking habit, and health conditions. Our results indicate that the walking speed and one-leg standing times were significantly associated with VI."
https://openalex.org/W3124675951,"Introduction The World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund jointly recommend colostrum feeding immediately following delivery of the newborn. Colostrum avoidance is the practice of discarding colostrum at least once within the first three days after delivery of the newborn. Colostrum contains antibodies that protect the newborn against disease. Despite this fact, many Ethiopian mothers see colostrum feeding as a cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and they believe colostrum should be discarded to alleviate its effects. However, the cause of this misconception about colostrum is not well researched in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Objective To assess the prevalence of colostrum avoidance and associated factors among mothers of children aged less than six months in Bure district, Amhara Region, North West, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1 st to 30 th , 2019 in Bure district. Structured questionnaires and face to face interviews were used to collect data from 621 study participants. Multistage sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were entered into Epi Data version 4.2.0 and then exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of colostrum avoidance practice. Results Six hundred twenty-one (621) mothers of children aged less than six months participated. The prevalence of colostrum avoidance was 14.5% (95%CI; 11.5–17.4). The multivariate analysis indicated that home delivery [AOR = 3.350, (95%CI; 2.517–14.847)], giving birth through cesarean section [AOR = 3.368, (95%CI; 1.339–8.471)], no participation in an antenatal care group [AOR = 1.889, (95%CI; 1.144–3.533)], poor knowledge of mothers about colostrum [AOR = 3.44, (95%CI; 2.45–4.977)], and poor attitude of mothers towards colostrum [AOR = 3.053, (95%CI; 1.157–8.054)] were important predictors of colostrum avoidance practice. Conclusion and recommendations Home delivery, giving birth through cesarean section, no participation in an antenatal care group, poor knowledge of mothers about colostrum, and poor attitude of mothers towards colostrum were significantly associated with colostrum avoidance practice. Therefore, health care workers in the district should promote institutional delivery, reduce the magnitude of cesarean section, encourage pregnant mothers to participate in an antenatal care group, and enhance maternal awareness about the merits of colostrum feeding. Moreover, health educations for mothers to have a positive attitude towards colostrum are important recommendations to be taken to prevent the further practice of colostrum avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W3123087613,"Facilitating clinical translation of quantitative imaging techniques has been suggested as means of improving interobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate. One such technique, magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), has significant competitive advantages over conventional mapping techniques in terms of its multi-site reproducibility, short scanning time and inherent robustness to motion. It has also been shown to improve the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer when added to standard mpMRI sequences, however, the existing studies have all been conducted on 3.0 T MRI systems, limiting the technique’s use on 1.5 T MRI scanners that are still more widely used for prostate imaging across the globe. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was, therefore, to evaluate the cross-system reproducibility of prostate MRF T 1 in healthy volunteers (HVs) using 1.5 and 3.0 T MRI systems. The initial validation of MRF T 1 against gold standard inversion recovery fast spin echo (IR-FSE) T 1 in the ISMRM/NIST MRI system revealed a strong linear correlation between phantom-derived MRF and IR-FSE T 1 values was observed at both field strengths (R 2 = 0.998 at 1.5T and R 2 = 0.993 at 3T; p = &lt; 0.0001 for both). In young HVs, inter-scanner CVs demonstrated marginal differences across all tissues with the highest difference of 3% observed in fat (2% at 1.5T vs 5% at 3T). At both field strengths, MRF T 1 could confidently differentiate prostate peripheral zone from transition zone, which highlights the high quantitative potential of the technique given the known difficulty of tissue differentiation in this age group. The high cross-system reproducibility of MRF T 1 relaxometry of the healthy prostate observed in this preliminary study, therefore, supports the technique’s prospective clinical validation as part of larger trials employing 1.5 T MRI systems, which are still widely used clinically for routine mpMRI of the prostate."
https://openalex.org/W3124756862,"Background Some patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a severe clinical course with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal outcome. Clinical manifestations and biomarkers in early stages of disease with relevant predictive impact for outcomes remain largely unexplored. We aimed to identify parameters which are significantly different between subgroups. Design 125 patients with COVID-19 were analysed. Patients with ARDS (N = 59) or non-ARDS (N = 66) were compared, as well as fatal outcome versus survival in the two groups. Key results ARDS and non-ARDS patients did not differ with respect to comorbidities or medication on developing a fatal outcome versus survival. Body mass index was higher in patients with ARDS versus non-ARDS (p = 0.01), but not different within the groups in survivors versus non-survivors. Interleukin-6 levels on admission were higher in patients with ARDS compared to non-ARDS as well as in patients with fatal outcome versus survivors, whereas lymphocyte levels were lower in the different subgroups (all p&lt;0.05). There was a highly significant 3.5-fold difference in fever load in non-survivors compared to survivors (p&lt;0.0001). Extrapulmonary viral spread was detected more often in patients with fatal outcome compared to survivors (P = 0.01). Further the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in serum showed a significantly more severe course and an increased risk of death (both p&lt;0.05). Conclusions We have identified early risk markers for a severe clinical course, like ARDS or fatal outcome. This data might help develop a strategy to address new therapeutic options early in patients with COVID-19 and at high risk for fatal outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3124635543,"Studies have shown that some electrolytes, including Na + and K + , play important roles in embryonic development. However, these studies evaluated these electrolytes by using inhibitors or knockout mice, with no mention on the changes in the intracellular electrolyte concentrations during embryogenesis. In this study, we used the electrolyte indicators CoroNa Green AM and ION Potassium Green-2 AM to directly visualise intracellular concentrations of Na + and K + , respectively, at each embryonic developmental stage in mouse embryos. We directly observed intracellular electrolyte concentrations at the morula, blastocyst, and hatching stages. Our results revealed dynamic changes in intracellular electrolyte concentrations; we found that the intracellular Na + concentration decreased, while K + concentration increased during blastocoel formation. The degree of change in intensity in response to ouabain, an inhibitor of Na + /K + ATPase, was considered to correspond to the degree of Na + /K + ATPase activity at each developmental stage. Additionally, after the blastocyst stage, trophectoderm cells in direct contact with the blastocoel showed higher K + concentrations than in direct contact with inner cell mass, indicating that Na + /K + ATPase activity differs depending on the location in the trophectoderm. This is the first study to use CoroNa Green AM and ION Potassium Green-2 AM in mouse embryos and visualise electrolytes during embryonic development. The changes in electrolyte concentration observed in this study were consistent with the activity of Na + /K + ATPase reported previously, and it was possible to image more detailed electrolyte behaviour in embryo cells. This method can be used to improve the understanding of cell physiology and is useful for future embryonic development studies."

In the framework of such attempts, in a number of in vitro , as well as in vivo , models it was shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has an effect against SARS-CoV-2. While there were not enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have included HCQ in treatment protocols for infected patients and for prophylaxis. In the current non-randomized, observational study we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharynx swabs from infected patients 7–10 days post symptoms with clinically mild disease and compared the viral RNA load dynamics between patients receiving HCQ (200 mg twice per day according to the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation treatment instructions, n = 33) and a control group without antiviral pharmacological therapy ( n = 12). We found a statistically significant relationship between maximal RNA quantity and deterioration of patients’ medical conditions, and as well we confirmed arterial hypertension to be a risk factor for people with COVID-19. However, we showed that at the dose used in the study HCQ therapy neither shortened the viral shedding period nor reduced the virus RNA load."

According to available literature, the experiences of healthcare workers who care for the genitally mutilated females in Nigeria have not been described, hindering efforts towards ending this procedure through evidence-based, community-led interventions. This qualitative study described the experiences of healthcare workers caring for the genitally mutilated females in South-Eastern Nigeria. In-depth interviews conducted with 17 participants resulted in two themes and five sub-themes. The participants faced major challenges in caring for these females as the complications of FGM/C resulted in situations requiring advanced skills for which they were ill-prepared. Irrespective of this complex situation, the participants believed FGM/C was an age-old cultural practice; some even supported its continuation. The solution to this problem is not simple. However, educational programmes involving all cadres of healthcare workers could assist with eradicating this practice. Also, enforcing the anti-FGMC law could enhance the eradication of this procedure."

Towards this end, this research experimentally manipulated perceptions of group-level competition between Black and White individuals in the U.S. and tested for effects on negative psychological outcomes. In Study 1 ( N = 899), participants assigned to the high interracial competition condition (HRC) reported perceiving more discrimination, behavioral avoidance, intergroup anxiety, and interracial mistrust relative to low interracial competition (LRC) participants. Study 2 –a preregistered replication and extension—specifically recruited similar numbers of only Black and White participants ( N = 1,823). Consistent with Study 1, Black and White participants in the HRC condition reported more discrimination, avoidance, anxiety, and mistrust. Main effects for race also emerged: Black participants perceived more interracial competition and negative outcomes. Racial income inequality moderated effects; competition effects were stronger in areas with higher levels of inequality. Implications for theory development are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3125664393,"Purpose Mitochondrial (mt) DNA damage is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other human aging diseases. This study was designed to quantify and characterize mtDNA low-frequency heteroplasmy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of three different tissues isolated from AMD subjects using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Methods DNA was extracted from neural retina, [RPE+choroid] and blood from three deceased age-related macular degeneration (AMD) subjects. Entire mitochondrial genomes were analyzed for low-frequency heteroplasmy SNPs using NGS technology that independently sequenced both mtDNA strands. This deep sequencing method (average sequencing depth of 30,000; range 1,000–100,000) can accurately differentiate low-frequency heteroplasmy SNPs from DNA modification artifacts. Twenty-three ‘hot-spot’ heteroplasmy mtDNA SNPs were analyzed in 222 additional blood samples. Results Germline homoplasmy SNPs that defined mtDNA haplogroups were consistent in the three tissues of each subject. Analyses of SNPs with &lt;40% heteroplasmy revealed the blood had significantly greater numbers of heteroplasmy SNPs than retina alone (p≤0.05) or retina+choroid combined (p = 0.008). Twenty-three ‘hot-spot’ mtDNA heteroplasmy SNPs were present, with three being non-synonymous (amino acid change). Four ‘hot-spot’ heteroplasmy SNPs (m.1120C&gt;T, m.1284T&gt;C, m.1556C&gt;T, m.7256C&gt;T) were found in additional samples (n = 222). Five heteroplasmy SNPs (m.4104A&gt;G, m.5320C&gt;T, m.5471G&gt;A, m.5474A&gt;G, m.5498A&gt;G) declined with age. Two heteroplasmy SNPs (m.13095T&gt;C, m.13105A&gt;G) increased in AMD compared to Normal samples. In the heteroplasmy SNPs, very few transversion mutations (purine to pyrimidine or vice versa, associated with oxidative damage) were found and the majority were transition changes (purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine, associated with replication errors). Conclusion Within an individual, the blood, retina and [RPE+choroid] contained identical homoplasmy SNPs representing inherited germline mtDNA haplogroup. NGS methodology showed significantly more mtDNA heteroplasmy SNPs in blood compared to retina and [RPE+choroid], suggesting the latter tissues have substantial protection. Significantly higher heteroplasmy levels of m.13095T&gt;C and m.13105A&gt;G may represent potential AMD biomarkers. Finally, high levels of transition mutations suggest that accumulation of heteroplasmic SNPs may occur through replication errors rather than oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W3125864535,"To investigate the effectiveness of intraprocedural dual-phase cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and its effect on improving treatment outcomes. Between November 2018 and November 2019, data from 111 patients with unresectable HCCs (N = 263 lesions) were reviewed retrospectively. All patients had undergone baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans within one month prior to the procedure. Both arterial-phase (AP) and delayed-phase CBCT images were acquired during all conventional TACEs. Each HCC detection rate when read by AP-CBCT and when read by dual-phase (DP) CBCT including both AP and delayed phase was compared with that of MRI, and the diagnosis of HCC was based on MRI. Additionally, the follow-up results concerning lipiodol uptake status and tumor response of the lesions detected only by AP-/DP-CBCT were analyzed and compared with MRI-only detected lesions. The overall sensitivity of DP-CBCT (94.7%) was significantly higher than that of AP-CBCT (89.0%) ( p = 0.003). In particular, the rate of subcentimeter HCC detection by DP-CBCT was pronounced (91.5% vs. 80.3%) ( p = 0.01). Lesions found only by DP-CBCT exhibited positive lipiodol uptake (n = 31/31; 100%) and showed complete or partial responses (n = 24/31; 77.4%) on follow-up CT imaging, while MRI-only detected lesions had less lipiodol uptake (n = 6/14, 42.9%) and complete or partial responses (n = 4/14; 28.6%) ( p ≤ 0.001). DP-CBCT imaging during TACE enabled better detection of HCCs than when using AP-CBCT alone, and AP- and DP-CBCT is superior to MRI in detecting chemoembolization-sensitive lesions. This resulted in increased detectability of HCCs and the achievement of better treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3174355021,"The use of non-motorized vehicles in urban city has improved the convenience of short-distance travel and reduced traffic pollution. However, the overtaking behaviour of non-motorized vehicles impacts traffic safety and efficiency significantly. The objective of this study is to model the durations of overtaking behaviour in the non-motorized vehicle exclusive lane. A total of 3010 overtaking events of non-motorized vehicles were extracted from two locations in Chengdu, China. The nonparametric survival analysis was conducted to model the overtaking duration of non-motorized vehicles. The categorical variables that significantly influence the overtaking duration were examined by the Log-rank test. The results show that the overtaking durations of female riders is longer than that of male riders. It takes longer for electrical bikes to complete overtaking than conventional bikes. When the non-motorized vehicle is under the load state (i.e. passengers or goods on the non-motorized vehicle), the overtaking behaviour takes more time than the un-load state. Moreover, it takes less time to overtake the non-motorized vehicle with load than to overtake the one without load. When there is a wrong-way driving phenomenon or under higher traffic volume, the duration is longer compared to the normal traffic and lower traffic volume conditions. The findings of this study attempt to provide a more profound understanding of non-motorized vehicles overtaking behaviour under different traffic conditions and give insights to the safety research of non-motorized vehicles."

In Senegal, available data suggest that VAS should be maintained, but geographic and age-related specificities need to be addressed to better implement and target VAS programming. The objective of this comparative cross-sectional study, conducted in urban settings of Dakar, was to compare the vitamin A liver stores (VALS) assessed using the modified-relative dose response (MRDR) test between supplemented and non-supplemented 9–23 month-old children and to study their relationship with VAS. The supplemented group (n = 119) received VAS (either 100 000 UI or 200 000 UI) 2 to 6 months before evaluation while the non-supplemented group (n = 110) had not received VAS during the past 6 months. In addition to MRDR, serum retinol concentrations (SR), and biomarkers of subclinical inflammation were measured. Children’s health-related data and feeding patterns were collected. Mean MRDR values (VAS: 0.030 ± 0.017, non-VAS: 0.028 ± 0.016, P = 0.389) and inflammation-adjusted SR (VAS: 1.34 ± 0.37, non-VAS: 1.3 ± 0.35, P = 0.515) of children were adequate. Low prevalence of VALS (VAS: 5.2%, non-VAS: 5.4%) and inflammation-adjusted VAD (VAS: 2.6%, non-VAS: 0.9%) were detected despite high presence of infections and inflammation. Children were mostly still being breastfed (VAS: 85.7%, non-VAS: 77.3%) and complementary feeding indicators were similar in both groups. Only breastfeeding was associated with VALS and was found to reduce by 76% at least, the odds of VAD (adjusted OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07–0.8, P = 0.020). Based on MRDR values, VAS was not related to improved VALS and SR as well as VAD reduction among these children with adequate VALS. Reinforcing breastfeeding advocacy and morbidity prevention/control are essential in this setting. Scaling-back VAS in this subpopulation should be examined regarding the risk of hypervitaminosis A after an evaluation of dietary vitamin A intake sufficiency and a more quantitative assessment of VALS."
https://openalex.org/W3122453000,"The physiological response to stressors has great importance, and its variance has an adaptive role in the survival of individuals. This study describes the effects of stress-axis activation on maternal behavior during the birthing process (parturition) in captive rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ). In this species, chances of survival are strongly influenced by nest quality. Thus, maternal care is initiated with nest preparation in late pregnancy, which itself is subject to strict and complex hormonal regulation. Among these hormones, progesterone is one of the most dominant in the process of nest construction. We have demonstrated that its level is altered by the level of cortisol elevation in the animal in question, potentially having an influence on the preparation of the nest for the newborn kittens. We found that does that had a constant and un-elevated level of cortisol metabolite while delivering their litters performed better than those individuals that showed an increased corticoid response around parturition. The latter group exhibited a perceptible delay in the building of their nests, and in addition, further losses were also experienced in their already smaller litters. As the quality of the nest itself proved to be was in no way inferior to those of the other group, this higher kitten-mortality rate may be attributed to impaired maternal behavior. Individual variances in cortisol levels may also result in subtle changes in hormonal regulation, potentially affecting the expression of maternal behavior. We have concluded that the higher level of cortisol detected in more-sensitive does effectively disrupts the natural hormonal regulation involved in their nest-building processes."
https://openalex.org/W3123102544,"The peninsular effect is a geographical phenomenon that explains patterns of species richness. Given that spatial variation in species richness along a peninsular may be driven by multiple processes, we aimed to identify the sources of latitudinal patterns in passerine species richness and test hypotheses regarding (1) recent deterministic processes (climate, primary productivity, forest area, and habitat diversity), (2) anthropogenic processes (habitat fragmentation), and (3) stochastic processes (migration influence) in the Korean peninsula. We used the distribution data of 147 passerine species from 2006 to 2012. Single regression between passerine species richness and latitude supported the existence of the peninsular effect. Mean temperature increased with decreasing latitude, as did habitat diversity but leaf area index and forest area decline. However, mean temperature and forest area only influenced passerine species richness. Although habitat diversity influenced passerine species richness, it was counter to the expectations associated with peninsular effect. The number of habitat patches decreased as latitude increased but it had no effect on passerine species richness. Ratio of migrant species richness showed no significant relationship with leaf area index, forest area, and habitat diversity. However, the ratio of migrant species richness increased with decreasing mean temperature and that contributed to the increase in passerine species. Overall, our finding indicate that the observed species richness pattern in peninsulas with the tip pointing south (in the northern hemisphere) counter to the global latitudinal gradient. These results were caused by the peninsular effect associated with complex mechanism that interact with climate, habitat area, and migrant species inflow."

By measures of RV end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVi), 16 patients (26%) revealed RV dilatation. Nine patients (15%) revealed both. RV dysfunction was associated with increased right and left ventricular volumes as well as reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (all p&lt;0.05). During follow-up, 15 patients (25%) died and additional 14 patients (23%) were admitted to hospital due to heart failure symptoms. RV dysfunction predicted all-cause mortality even after adjustment for LV function. Similarly, RVEDVi was a predictor of all-cause mortality even after adjustment for LVEDVi. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis unraveled that, among patients presenting with CMR indicative of both, RV dysfunction and dilatation, the majority (78%) experienced an adverse event during follow-up (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion In patients undergoing TMVR, pre-existing RV dysfunction and RV dilatation are associated with reduced survival, in progressive additive fashion. The assessment of RV volumes and function by CMR may aid in risk stratification prior TMVR in these high-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W3122625746,"Background and aims Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping is a pivotal tool for epidemiological investigation, guiding management and antiviral treatment. Challenge existed in identifying subtypes of genotype-1 (G-1) and genotype (GT) of indeterminate. Recently, the Abbott HCV RealTime Genotype Plus RUO assay (HCV GT Plus) has been developed aiming to overcome the limitations. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the assay compared with 5’ UTR sequencing in clinical samples. Materials and methods Eligible individuals were treatment chronic hepatitis C patients that were enrolled consecutively in a medical center and two core regional hospitals in southern Taiwan from Oct 2017 through Aug 2018. The patient with genotype 1 without subtype and indeterminate previously genotyped by Abbott RealTime HCV GT II will further determinate by Abbott HCV RealTime HCV GT Plus. All of the genotype results were validated by 5' UTR sequencing as a reference standard. Results A total of 100 viremic CHC patients were recruited, including 63 G-1 patients (male: 28), and 37 patients (male: 15) of indeterminate genotyped by Abbott RealTime HCV GT II assay (HCV GT II), respectively. The detection rate of 63 GT1 samples without subtype were 93.7% (59/63), 37 indeterminate samples without genotype were 62.2 (23/37) by HCV GT Plus. 5' UTR sequencing confirmed HCV GT Plus characterized results for 84.7% (50/59) of type1, with 100% (4/4), 82.8 (24/29) and 84.6% (22/26) for 1a, 1b and type6; 65.2% (15/23) of indeterminate with 100% (3/3) and 60% (12/20) for 1b and type 6 samples, respectively. Conclusions The Abbott RealTime HCV GT Plus RUO assay provides additional performance in GT detection."
https://openalex.org/W3123439361,"One major obstacle in development of biomolecular electronics is the loss of function of biomolecules upon their surface-integration and storage. Although a number of reports on solid-state electron transport capacity of proteins have been made, no study on whether their functional integrity is preserved upon surface-confinement and storage over a long period of time (few months) has been reported. We have investigated two specific cases—collagen and ferritin proteins, since these proteins exhibit considerable potential as bioelectronic materials as we reported earlier. Since one of the major factors for protein degradation is the proteolytic action of protease, such studies were made under the action of protease, which was either added deliberately or perceived to have entered in the reaction vial from ambient environment. Since no significant change in the structural characteristics of these proteins took place, as observed in the circular dichroism and UV-visible spectrophotometry experiments, and the electron transport capacity was largely retained even upon direct protease exposure as revealed from the current sensing atomic force spectroscopy experiments, we propose that stable films can be formed using the collagen and ferritin proteins. The observed protease-resistance and robust nature of these two proteins support their potential application in bioelectronics."
https://openalex.org/W3123957372,"Currently, safety of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) in patients with liver cirrhosis is unknown. The aim of this study was to explore postoperative morbidity and mortality and long-term outcomes of cirrhotic patients after LPD. The study was a one-center retrospective study comprising 353 patients who underwent LPD between October 2010 and December 2019. A total of 28 patients had liver cirrhosis and were paired with 56 non-cirrhotic counterparts through propensity score matching (PSM). Baseline data, intra-operative data, postoperative data, and survival data were collected. Postoperative morbidity was considered as primary outcome whereas postoperative mortality, surgical parameters (operative durations, intraoperative blood loss), and long-term overall survival were secondary outcomes. Cirrhotic patients showed postoperative complication rates of 82% compared with rates of patients in the control group (48%) (P = 0.003). Further, Clavien-Dindo ≥III complication rates of 14% and 11% (P = 0.634), Clavien-Dindo I-II complication rates of 68% and 38% (P = 0.009), hospital mortality of 4% and 2% (P = 0.613) were observed for cirrhotic patients and non-cirrhotic patients, respectively. In addition, an overall survival rate of 32 months and 34.5 months (P = 0.991), intraoperative blood loss of 300 (200–400) ml and 150 (100–250) ml (P&lt;0.0001), drain amount of 2572.5 (1023.8–5275) ml and 1617.5 (907.5–2700) ml (P = 0.048) were observed in the cirrhotic group and control group, respectively. In conclusion, LPD is associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, the incidence of Clavien-Dindo ≥III complications and post-operative mortality showed no significant increase. In addition, liver cirrhosis showed no correlation with poor overall survival in patients who underwent LPD. These findings imply that liver cirrhosis patients can routinely be considered for LPD at high volume centers with rigorous selection and management."
https://openalex.org/W3124108915,"This registered report protocol elaborates on the theory, methods, and material of a study to identify latent profiles of competence development in reading and mathematics among German students in upper secondary education. It is expected that generalized (reading and mathematical competence develop similarly) and specialized (one of the domains develops faster) competence profiles will be identified. Moreover, it is hypothesized that students’ domain-specific interest and educational history will predict membership of these latent profiles as these factors influence the students’ learning environments. For this study, we will use data from the German National Educational Panel Study , including students from ninth grade in secondary schools (expected N = 14,500). These students were tracked across six years and provided competence assessments on three occasions. The latent profiles based on the students’ reading and mathematical competences will be identified using latent growth mixture modeling. If different types of profiles can be identified, multinomial regression will be utilized to analyze whether the likelihood of belonging to a certain competence development profile is influenced by students’ domain-specific interest or educational history. As this protocol is submitted before any analyses were conducted, it will provide neither results nor conclusions."

While tightness-looseness has been quantified for a large and growing number of countries around the world, there are many countries where a tightness-looseness score has yet to be determined, thus impeding the inclusion of those countries in cross-cultural research with a tightness-looseness focus. There is a dearth of research on cultural tightness-looseness in South America in particular. We report results from a national survey of 1,265 Ecuadorian residents which provided quantification of the relatively tight culture of Ecuador."
https://openalex.org/W3122805507,"Ilomastat, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), has drawn attentions for its function in alleviating radiation damage. However, the detailed mechanisms of Ilomastat’s protection from animal model remain not fully clear. In this study, the C57BL/6 mice were pre-administrated with Ilomastat or vihicle for 2 h, and then total body of mice were exposed to 6 Gy of γ-rays. The protective effect of Ilomastat on the hematopoietic system in the irradiated mice were investigated. We found that pretreatment with Ilomastat significantly reduced the level of TGF-β1 and TNF-α, and elevated the number of bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells in the irradiated mice. Ilomastat pretreatment also increased the fraction of BM hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at day 30 after irradiation, and protected the spleen of mouse from irradiation. These results suggest that Ilomastat promotes the recovery of hematopoietic injury in the irradiated mice, and thus contributes to the survival of mouse after irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W3123611746,"Objective To gather consensus on professional competencies and basic public health content for the degree program in Human Nutrition and Dietetics (HND). Design In 2018, the Fifth Meeting of University Public Health Professors took place in Zaragoza (Spain). Fourteen lecturers in the HND degree program participated from 11 Spanish universities. They identified competencies and basic content for training for the HND degree using group dynamics and consensus strategies. Results The professors identified 51 basic competencies, distributed in the areas of “evaluation of population health needs” (n = 20), “development of health policies” (n = 23), and “guaranteeing provision of health care services” (n = 8). In order to reach these competencies, 35 topics were proposed organized into six thematic blocks: foundations of public health, nutritional epidemiology, health problems and diet and nutrition strategies, food security, health in all policies and health promotion and education. Conclusion The consensus reached serves as a reference to orient and update public health education as a part of the HND degree."
