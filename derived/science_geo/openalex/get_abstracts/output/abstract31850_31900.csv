https://openalex.org/W2112811492,"Mutations at the W locus in the mouse have pleiotropic effects on embryonic development and hematopoiesis. The characteristic phenotype of mutants at this locus, which includes white coat color, sterility, and anemia, can be attributed to the failure of stem cell populations to migrate and/or proliferate effectively during development. Mapping experiments suggest that the c-kit proto-oncogene, which encodes a putative tyrosine kinase receptor, is a candidate for the W locus. We show here that the c-kit gene is disrupted in two spontaneous mutant W alleles, W44 and Wx. Genomic DNA that encodes amino acids 240 to 342 of the c-kit polypeptide is disrupted in W44; the region encoding amino acids 342 to 791 is disrupted in Wx. W44 homozygotes exhibit a marked reduction in levels of c-kit mRNA. These results strongly support the identification of c-kit as the gene product of the W locus."

https://openalex.org/W2073645604,"Two groups of mediators, the neuropeptides substance P and K and the monocyte-derived cytokines, interact in the neural regulation of immunological and inflammatory responses. Substance P, substance K, and the carboxyl-terminal peptide SP(4-11) induce the release of interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 from human blood monocytes. The neuropeptide effects occur at low doses, are specific as shown by inhibition studies with a substance P antagonist, and require de novo protein synthesis. Since monocyte-derived cytokines regulate multiple cellular functions in inflammation and immunity and since neuropeptides can be released from peripheral nerve endings into surrounding tissues, these findings identify a potent mechanism for nervous system regulation of host defense responses."

https://openalex.org/W2012093804,"Complementary DNAs were isolated and used to deduce the primary structures of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits of the dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent calcium channel from rabbit skeletal muscle. The alpha 1 subunit, which contains putative binding sites for calcium antagonists, is a hydrophobic protein with a sequence that is consistent with multiple transmembrane domains and shows structural and sequence homology with other voltage-dependent ion channels. In contrast, the alpha 2 subunit is a hydrophilic protein without homology to other known protein sequences. Nucleic acid hybridization studies suggest that the alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunit mRNAs are expressed differentially in a tissue-specific manner and that there is a family of genes encoding additional calcium channel subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W1604526865,"The cell surface receptor for fibronectin is a heterodimeric membrane protein that recognizes an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence in fibronectin and that requires cations such as Mg2+ or Ca2+ for binding to fibronectin. The divalent cation requirements of this receptor were analyzed by measuring attachment of receptor liposomes to ligand-coated surfaces in the presence of different cations. The most striking effect observed was produced by Mn2+, which increased the binding of the receptor liposomes to fibronectin 2-3-fold over their binding in buffers containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. The binding activities of two related adhesion receptors, the vitronectin receptor and platelet GP IIb-IIIa, were supported but not enhanced by Mn2+. Two observations suggest that Mn2+ can compete with Ca2+ for the same cation-binding sites of the receptor. First, Mn2+ could still enhance fibronectin receptor binding activity even in the presence of 10-fold higher concentrations of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Second, Mn2+ inhibited the binding of radioactive Ca2+ to the alpha subunit of the receptor. The increased fibronectin receptor activity in the presence of Mn2+ appeared to be due to an increase in the affinity of the receptor for the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence because a 110-kDa cell attachment fragment and a synthetic hexapeptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence inhibited liposome binding more effectively in the presence of Mn2+ than in the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+. The affinity for the peptide was affected more than the affinity for the fragment, indicating that Mn2+ also induces a change in receptor specificity. Increased receptor binding in the presence of Mn2+ was also apparent in affinity chromatography of the fibronectin receptor on the 110-kDa fibronectin fragment; Mn2+ improved the yield of the receptor 4-fold. Mn2+ similarly increased the number of receptor-fibronectin complexes in preparations analyzed by electron microscopy. These results show that exogenous influences can modulate the affinity and specificity with which the fibronectin receptor binds to its ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1966093407,"Antibodies directed against a conserved intracellular segment of the sodium channel alpha subunit slow the inactivation of sodium channels in rat muscle cells. Of four site-directed antibodies tested, only antibodies against the short intracellular segment between homologous transmembrane domains III and IV slowed inactivation, and their effects were blocked by the corresponding peptide antigen. No effects on the voltage dependence of sodium channel activation or of steady-state inactivation were observed, but the rate of onset of the antibody effect and the extent of slowing of inactivation were voltage-dependent. Antibody binding was more rapid at negative potentials, at which sodium channels are not inactivated; antibody-induced slowing of inactivation was greater during depolarizations to more positive membrane potentials. The peptide segment recognized by this antibody appears to participate directly in rapid sodium channel inactivation during large depolarizations and to undergo a conformational change that reduces its accessibility to antibodies as the channel inactivates."

https://openalex.org/W1747551678,"Interleukin 1 (IL 1) production is stimulated by infection, cellular injury, and inflammation. This cytokine directs a wide spectrum of host responses. Human interleukin 1 alpha (IL 1 alpha) was used to examine the time course of effects on zinc metabolism as part of the acute phase response. IL 1 produced a transient depression in the serum zinc concentration and increased serum ceruloplasmin. Metallothionein levels were increased in liver 14-fold after IL 1. Increased expression of metallothionein-1 and -2 genes following IL 1 were observed in liver, bone marrow, and thymus. Pulse-labeling experiments with i.v.-administered 65Zn showed that IL 1 drastically altered zinc distribution kinetics among tissues. More 65Zn was taken up (and/or retained) by the liver, bone marrow, and thymus 6 h after IL 1, whereas correspondingly less 65Zn was found in bone, skin, and intestine. Uptake by other tissues was not affected by IL 1. Chromatography of cytosol from tissues with increased 65Zn uptake suggests the IL 1-induced redistribution may be driven by enhanced metallothionein synthesis. Collectively, the results show that IL 1 regulates zinc metabolism and may direct its preferential, tissue-specific distribution via elevated metallothionein-1 and -2 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1974491777,"Angiogenesis is an important component of organogenesis and wound repair and occurs during the pathology of oncogenesis, atherogenesis, and other disease processes. Thus, it is important to understand the physiological mechanisms that control neovascularization, especially with methods that permit the molecular dissection of the phenomenon in vivo. Heparin-binding growth factor-1 was shown to bind to collagen type I and type IV. When complexed with gelatin, heparin-binding growth factor-1 can induce neovascularization at polypeptide concentrations that are consistent with the biological activity of the mitogen in vitro. The adsorption strategy induces rapid blood vessel formation at and between organ- and tissue-specific sites and permits recovery of the site-specific implant for examination and manipulation by molecular methods."
https://openalex.org/W1557509594,"Binding of ligands that contain Arg-Gly-Asp to adhesion receptors induces cell spreading and aggregation and alters gene expression, possibly due to conformational changes within occupied adhesion receptors. PMI-1 is a monoclonal antibody which reacts with the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, and reports such a conformational change. ADP stimulation of platelets results in a fibrinogen-dependent increase in binding of the PMI-1 antibody. Peptides containing Arg-Gly-Asp also reversibly increase the binding of this antibody to cells and to purified glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. The PMI-1 antibody inhibits platelet adhesion and spreading on certain substrata (Shadle, P. J., Ginsberg, M. H., Plow, E. F., and Barondes, S. H. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 2056-2060); thus this occupancy-modulated site may participate in adhesive function."

https://openalex.org/W1999051466,"Transcription by RNA polymerase preceding the initiation of replication from the E. coli chromosomal origin (oriC) in vitro enables dnaA protein to open the DNA duplex under conditions when its action alone is insufficient. The RNA polymerases of phages T7 and T3 are as effective as the E. coli enzyme in activating initiation. The persistent RNA transcript hybridized to the template creates an R-loop that is responsible for activation. The activating RNA need not cross oriC, but must be less then 500 bp away. Transcripts lacking a 3' OH group are effective, proving that priming of DNA synthesis is not involved in the activation. Thus, transcription activates the origin of an otherwise inert plasmid by altering the local DNA structure, facilitating its opening by dnaA protein during the assembly of replication forks."
https://openalex.org/W2067354942,"Retroviruses contain two copies of the plus stranded viral RNA genome. As a means of determining whether both of these RNA's are used in the reverse transcription reaction, cells were infected with heterozygous virus particles that varied in nucleotide sequence at two separate locations at the RNA termini. The DNA proviruses formed from a single cycle of reverse transcription were then examined. Of the 12 proviruses that were characterized, all exhibited long terminal repeats (LTR's) that would be expected to arise only if both RNA templates were used for the generation of minus strand DNA. In contrast, only a single minus strand DNA appeared to be used as template for the plus strand DNA in the generation of fully double-stranded viral DNA. These results indicate that the first strand transfer step in reverse transcription is an intermolecular event while that of the second transfer is intramolecular. Thus, retroviruses contain two functionally active RNA's, and both may be required for the generation of a single linear DNA molecule. Formation of heterozygotes during retrovirus infection would be expected to result in the efficient generation of LTR recombinants."
https://openalex.org/W1580269759,"The phenomenon of acute phase (AP) response can be reproduced in vitro using cultured cells of hepatic origin by stimulation with the crude supernatant of activated monocytes (MoCM). Several monocyte-derived factors have been identified which might be responsible, alone or in combination, for the induction of AP response, but recently the attention has been focused on interleukin 6 (IL-6). We have previously shown that part of the AP response consists of the increase in the rate of transcription of the AP genes. Here we have treated the human hepatoma cell line Hep 3B with either crude MoCM or recombinant IL-6 and compared the effect of the two stimulants on the expression of both endogenous AP genes and recombinant plasmids introduced into the cells by transfection. The transfected plasmids contained the 5'-flanking region of AP genes fused to the coding region of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. We observe that the induction of mRNA accumulation of the endogenous genes corresponds to the transcriptional activation of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusions. This is good evidence that the effect of IL-6 is totally or partially exerted at the level of transcription and that short segments of the 5'-flanking sequences of the inducible genes contain IL-6-responsive elements. Our results show that IL-6 is fully effective only on some of all the genes induced or repressed by MoCM, whereas others are only partially affected or totally nonresponsive."

https://openalex.org/W1979791988,"T-lymphocyte immunity is likely to be an important component of the immune defence against the AIDS virus, because helper T cells are necessary for the antibody response as well as the cytotoxic response. We have previously predicted two antigenic sites of the viral envelope protein gp120 likely to be recognized by T lymphocytes, based on their ability to fold as amphipathic helices, and have demonstrated that these are recognized by T cells of mice immunized with gp120 (ref. 1). A peptide corresponding to one of these sites can also be induce immunity in mice to the whole gp120 protein. Because many clinically healthy seropositive blood donors have already lost their T-cell proliferative response to specific antigen, we tested the response to these synthetic peptides of lymphocytes from 14 healthy human volunteers who had been immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the AIDS viral envelope gene and boosted with a recombinant fragment. Eight of the 14 responded to one peptide, and four to the other peptide, not included in the boost. These antigenic sites recognized by human T cells may be useful components of a vaccine against AIDS. We also found a correlation between boosting with antigen-antibody complexes (compared to free antigen) and higher stimulation indices, suggesting a more effective method of immunization."
https://openalex.org/W1494933156,"The role of extracellular Ca2+ in pituitary hormone release was studied in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. The basal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyrotropin (TSH), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion were independent of extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e). In contrast, the basal levels of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) release showed dose-dependent increases with elevation of [Ca2+]e, and were abolished by Ca2+-channel antagonists. Under Ca2+-deficient conditions, BaCl2 mimicked the effects of calcium on PRL and GH release but with a marked increase in potency, and also increased basal LH and FSH release in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of normal [Ca2+]e, depolarization with K+ maximally increased cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) from 100 to 185 nM and elevated LH, FSH, TSH, ACTH, PRL, and GH release by 7-, 5-, 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1.5-fold, respectively. These effects of KCl were abolished in Ca2+-deficient medium or in the presence of the Ca2+-channel antagonist, Co2+, and were diminished by the dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel antagonist, nifedipine. The Ca2+-channel agonist BK 8644 (100 nM) enhanced the hormone-releasing actions of 25 mM KCl upon PRL, LH, FSH, GH, TSH, and ACTH by 2.3-, 2.0-, 1.8-, 1.7-, 1.6-, and 1.4-fold, respectively. The dose- and voltage-dependent actions of BK 8644 were specific for individual cell types; BK 8644 enhanced GH, PRL, TSH, LH, and ACTH secretion in the absence of any depolarizing stimulus, with ED50 values of 8, 10, 150, 200, and 400 nM, respectively. However, in the presence of 50 mM KCl, the ED50 values for BK 8644 were 1.5, 2, 3, 5, and 7 nM for GH, PRL, ACTH, TSH, and LH, respectively. [3H]BK 8644 bound specifically to pituitary membranes with Kd values of 0.8 nM and concentrations of about 900 channels per cell. These observations provide evidence for the presence and participation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the secretion of all five populations of anterior pituitary cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056839774,"Calcium channels are inactivated by voltage and intracellular calcium. To study the kinetics and the mechanism of calcium-induced inactivation of calcium channels, a ""caged"" calcium compound, dimethoxy-nitrophen was used to photo-release about 50 μM calcium ion within 0.2 millisecond in dorsal root ganglion neurons. When divalent cations were the charge carriers, intracellular photo-release of calcium inactivated the calcium channel with an invariant rate [time constant (τ) ≈ 7 milliseconds]. When the monovalent cation sodium was the charge carrier, photorelease of calcium inside or outside of the cell blocked the channel rapidly (τ ≈ 0.4 millisecond), but the block was greater from the external side. Thus the kinetics of calcium-induced calcium channel inactivation depends on the valency of the permeant cation. The data imply that calcium channels exist in either of two conformational states, the calcium- and sodium-permeant forms, or, alternatively, calcium-induced inactivation occurs at a site closely associated with the internal permeating site."
https://openalex.org/W1510451713,"Effects of deltamethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, and lindane, the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane, on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated ion channels were studied using cultured neurons isolated from the newborn rat dorsal root ganglia. The neuron was voltage clamped using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Two components of inward chloride currents were generated in response to bath application of GABA. One of the components was selectively blocked by 1 x 10(-5)M lindane in a stereospecific manner, but neither component was affected by 1 x 10(-5)M deltamethrin, which drastically prolonged the voltage-activated sodium channel current. Thus, the action of lindane to stimulate the nervous system is partly because of an interaction with the GABA receptor-channel complex. The target site of deltamethrin is not the GABA receptor-channel complex but the sodium channel. The results suggest a multiplicity of the GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W1596519007,"The rat monoclonal antibody GoH3 identifies a complex of glycoproteins Ic and IIa on human and mouse platelets. The GoH3 epitope is located on glycoprotein Ic. A novel glycoprotein complex is identified by GoH3 on the surface membranes of mouse mammary epithelial tumor cells. This antigen complex is composed of glycoprotein Ic noncovalently associated with a monomor or a disulfide-linked multimer of a high molecular weight glycoprotein (Ic-binding protein (IcBP]. Glycoprotein Ic is synthesized as a large precursor with asparagine N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides. Processing of this precursor involves a proteolytic cleavage of the large polypeptides into two smaller disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, Ic alpha (heavy) and Ic beta (light), and conversion of the majority of the high mannose oligosaccharides into complex-type glycans. Likewise, glycoprotein IcBP is initially glycosylated with high mannose asparagine N-linked oligosaccharides which are processed to complex units in the mature form. Association of glycoprotein Ic with IcBP occurs within the cell soon after their synthesis. The kinetics of labeling show non-coordinate processing consistent with the idea that the concentration of glycoprotein Ic limits complex formation and the subsequent processing of glycoprotein IcBP."
https://openalex.org/W1964490862,"The activated heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein Gk, at subpicomolar concentrations, mimics muscarinic stimulation of a specific atrial potassium current. Reconstitution studies have implicated the alpha and beta gamma subunits as mediators, but subunit coupling by the endogenous G protein has not been analyzed. To study this process, a monoclonal antibody (4A) that binds to alpha k but not to beta gamma was applied to the solution bathing an inside-out patch of atrial membrane; the antibody blocked carbachol-activated currents irreversibly. The state of the endogenous Gk determined its susceptibility to block by the antibody. When agonist was absent or when activation by muscarinic stimulation was interrupted by withdrawal of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in the presence or absence of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), the effects of the antibody did not persist. Thus, monoclonal antibody 4A blocked muscarinic activation of potassium channels by binding to the activated G protein in its holomeric form or by binding to the dissociated alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1590956479,"Ion fluxes associated with translocation of diphtheria toxin across the surface membrane of Vero cells were studied. When cells with surface-bound toxin were exposed to low pH to induce toxin entry, the cells became permeable to Na+, K+, H+, choline+, and glucosamine+. There was no increased permeability to Cl-, SO4(-2), glucose, or sucrose, whereas the uptake of 45Ca2+ was slightly increased. The influx of Ca2+, which appears to be different from that of monovalent cations, was reduced by several inhibitors of anion transport and by verapamil, Mn2+, Co2+, and Ca2+, but not by Mg2+. The toxin-induced fluxes of N+, K+, and protons were inhibited by Cd2+. Cd2+ also protected the cells against intoxication by diphtheria toxin, suggesting that the open cation-selective channel is required for toxin translocation. The involvement of the toxin receptor is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1594973010,"Two cDNA libraries have been constructed with RNA prepared from the estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and ZR 75. They were screened by differential hybridization for estrogen-regulated sequences. A total of 11 different RNAs were isolated from the MCF7 cell cDNA library and four from the ZR 75 cell cDNA library. Only two sequences were isolated from both libraries. The levels of the 13 different RNAs are induced between 2.5- and 100-fold by estrogen in MCF7 cells. The expression and regulation by estrogen of the RNAs was examined in eight different human tumor cell lines. The relative abundance of each RNA varied in the different cell lines. The expression of three RNAs (pNR-1, pNR-2, and pNR-25) was detected only in estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells. The sequences that were expressed in all eight cell lines were regulated by estrogen only in the three estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines. The response of the RNAs to other classes of steroids and to different concentrations of estrogen was characterized in more detail. The extent to which different concentrations of estradiol induced each RNA varied, but half-maximal induction of most of the RNAs occurred between 2 and 5 X 10(-11) M. The time at which increased RNA levels were first detected following exposure to estradiol also varied. Estrogen increased the levels of some RNAs within 15 min, while for others there was a lag of 4 h."

https://openalex.org/W1537634427,"Ovine trophoblast protein-1 (oTP-1), an interferon of embryonic origin, is produced during the peri-implantation period of early pregnancy. Secretion of oTP-1 is detectable between days 13 and 21, but not beyond. In this study, the levels of oTP-1 mRNA in embryos were analyzed to determine if they reflected the transient nature of oTP-1 production. Total cellular RNA (tcRNA) was isolated from embryos representing day 12 (n = 5), 14 (n = 7), 16 (n = 5), 18 (n = 6), 20 (n = 4), and 22 (n = 5) of pregnancy and spotted on nylon membranes. Complementary RNA was transcribed from a specific oTP-1 cDNA (550 base pairs) template and applied (16-1000 pg) to nylon membranes to develop a standard curve. The fixed RNA samples were then allowed to hybridize with the 32P-labeled oTP-1 cDNA. oTP-1 mRNA was not detectable on day 12, increased to high levels (3.6 +/- 1.6 ng/ug of embryo DNA) on day 14, decreased about 5-fold by day 16, 15-fold by day 18, 170-fold by day 20, and 200-fold by day 22 of pregnancy. At day 14 oTP-1 mRNA comprised 0.060 +/- 0.019% of the tcRNA and was more abundant than actin mRNA. Northern analyses of pooled tcRNA representing each day of pregnancy showed that the oTP-1 probe hybridized to a single class of mRNA (approximately 1.1 kilobases) and confirmed the results obtained with dot blots."
https://openalex.org/W1557398645,"The major sites of phosphorylation have been determined on the human keratin intermediate filament keratin 1 (type II) chain expressed in terminally differentiating epidermis. A total of nine phosphate sites were found, involving 1 threonine and 8 serine residues, and were localized to end domain sequences. The sites identified corresponded to major sites of phosphorylation as determined by direct quantitation of O-phosphoserine. Since the tissue was cultured with [32 P] orthophosphate only briefly, labeling occurred primarily by turnover, so that information on the dynamics of phosphorylation was also obtained. The degrees and specific activities (that is, turnover rates) of phosphorylation of these sites varied widely between different isoelectric variants (phosphate isomers) of keratin 1 chains and correlated with their locations on the chain: those sites on the more exposed E1 and E2 subdomains were fully phosphorylated and turning over at high rates, while a site near the end of the rod domain in a presumably more confined location was only slightly phosphorylated and turning over at low rate. The nature of the sequences around the phosphorylated residues indicates that cAMP-dependent and probably other protein kinase activities operate simultaneously in intact normal epidermal tissue. The correlation between the degrees and rates of turnover of phosphorylation with the locations on the chain may have an important bearing on the functional role of phosphorylation of the keratin intermediate filaments in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1558046708,"Arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) stimulation of sodium transport in high electrical resistance epithelia is accompanied by adenylate cyclase stimulation and cAMP accumulation. The hypothesis of direct phosphorylation of the purified amiloride-blockable epithelial Na+ channel protein by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A after ADH treatment of cultured cells was investigated in this study. Phosphate-depleted A6 cells (a cell line derived from toad kidney) were exposed to 32PO4(3-) in the absence or presence of basolateral ADH (100 milliunits/ml). After 20 min (the time needed for ADH to increase maximally Na+ transport), the Na+ channels were extracted from the cells and purified. At every stage of purification, only one subunit of the Na+ channel, namely, the 315-kDa subunit, was specifically phosphorylated as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or scintillation counting. In addition, a polyclonal antibody raised against purified epithelial Na+ channel protein was able to immunoprecipitate the phosphorylated channel protein from a detergent-solubilized fraction of vasopressin-treated A6 cells. This same subunit was also specifically phosphorylated in vitro when the purified Na+ channel protein was incubated with gamma-[32P]ATP and the purified catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Thus, only a single component, the 315-kDa subunit, of the Na+ channel protein complex (which is composed of six subunits) can be phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro. This subunit is selectively phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to a level of 2-3 mol of 32P/mol of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1522034871,"Abstract Recent studies have shown that pyrroline 5-carboxylate, the intermediate in the interconversions of proline, ornithine, and glutamate, can regulate the metabolism of erythrocytes. We now report that the formation of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P) was markedly stimulated by pyrroline 5-carboxylate in intact red cells. The production of PP-Rib-P is an important point of regulation in nucleotide metabolism. We found that pyrroline 5-carboxylate increased glucose metabolism through the oxidative arm of the pentose shunt, ribose 5-phosphate formation, and PP-Rib-P production and subsequently augmented purine nucleotide production through the salvage pathway in erythrocytes. We now report that pyrroline 5-carboxylate markedly stimulated the net synthesis of inosine monophosphate from hypoxanthine in intact human red cells so that the of inosine monophosphate became 20-30% of the total of purine nucleotides. Inosine monophosphate has been considered to be a mobile pool of purines, i.e. a reservoir from which peripheral tissues can be supplied; the effect of pyrroline 5-carboxylate on the inosine monophosphate may be a mechanism for regulating the function of erythrocytes in purine delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1598306055,"To understand the structure of apolipoprotein A-I, we have used an immunochemical approach and identified specific regions of apoA-I that may be exposed on the apoprotein as it exists on high density lipoprotein (HDL). Twelve mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human apoA-I were generated from six fusions. Thirteen synthetic peptides of between 5 and 16 amino acid residues in length, which span the amino-terminal two-thirds of apoA-I, were tested for their ability to react with each of the 12 antibodies. In a competitive solid-phase radioimmunoassay, a synthetic peptide, which represented residues 1-15 of mature apoA-I, inhibited the binding of antibody AI-16 to immobilized HDL. Similarly, a synthetic peptide, which represented residues 90-105 of apoA-I, inhibited the binding of antibody AI-18 to immobilized HDL. Using systematic changes in the size and sequence of the oligopeptides, the limits and essential amino acid residues of these epitopes were defined. Comparisons of the slopes of the competition curves obtained with immunoreactive peptides, isolated apoA-I, and HDL verified that these two regions of apoA-I are exposed on the surface of apoA-I as it exists on native HDL."

https://openalex.org/W2120771160,"Treatment of bovine chromaffin cells with 40 mM KCl stimulates a 3-fold increase in total methionine enkephalin immunoreactivity (medium plus cells) and a 4-fold increase in proenkephalin mRNA (mRNAenk). These effects of KCl, which are dependent on extracellular calcium, can be blocked by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), although release of methionine enkephalin appears less affected. Using fura-2-loaded chromaffin cells and a dual-excitation wavelength spectrofluorometer, we have examined whether the actions of KCl and TPA on methionine enkephalin synthesis and release can be explained by changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). KCl produced a rapid 600 nM increase in [Ca2+]i from resting levels of approximately 170 nM. Subsequently, [Ca2+]i declined to a new steady-state plateau which was approximately 275 nM higher than the original resting levels. The postdepolarization plateau of [Ca2+]i was reduced by TPA, (-)-(R)-202,791 (a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist), and LaCl3 (a nonselective calcium channel blocker). TPA also inhibited potentiation of the KCl-stimulated plateau of [Ca2+]i due to (+)-(S)-202,791, a calcium channel agonist. In contrast, TPA had no effect on resting [Ca2+]i and only slightly inhibited the initial rapid KCl-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i. The inhibitory effects were maintained for 24 h in the continuous presence of TPA. We conclude 1) that TPA inhibits enkephalin synthesis by inactivating dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent calcium channels, 2) that these channels alone maintain elevated [Ca2+]i following KCl depolarization, and 3) that sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i is necessary in order to increase enkephalin synthesis in KCl-treated chromaffin cells."

Isolated oLH beta was rapidly nicked and converted from an Mr 18,000 band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels to an Mr 13,000 band. Partial nicking of only the beta subunit in intact oLH was also observed as indicated by the appearance of small amounts of the Mr 13,000 band detected in Arg-C-treated oLH samples. The alpha subunit was protected by association with the beta subunit, but free alpha subunit was rapidly degraded. Sequence analysis of nicked oLH beta indicated that one of the peptide bonds on either side of Arg43 was cleaved by the protease, with a slight preference for the amino side of this residue. Nicked oLH beta was reassociated with oLH alpha, and the resulting dimer was separated from unrecombined subunits.

Since diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), this enzyme may be involved in mediating the physiological response to TRH. Activation of protein kinase C leads to phosphorylation of receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and decreased EGF affinity. The present study examined the effect of TRH on EGF binding to intact GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor cells to test whether TRH activates protein kinase C. Cells were incubated with TRH at 37 degrees C and specific 125I-EGF binding was then measured at 4 degrees C. 125I-EGF binding was decreased by a 10-min treatment with 0.1-100 nM TRH to 30-40% of control in a dose-dependent manner. 125I-EGF binding was not altered if cells were incubated at 4 degrees C, although TRH receptors were saturated or in a variant pituitary cell line without TRH receptors. TRH (10 min at 37 degrees C) decreased EGF receptor affinity but caused little change in receptor density, 125I-EGF internalization, or degradation. When cells were incubated continuously with TRH, there was a recovery of 125I-EGF binding after 24 h. Incubation with the protein kinase C activating phorbol ester TPA caused an immediate (less than 10 min) profound (greater than 85%) decrease in 125I-EGF binding followed by partial recovery at 24 h. Maximally effective doses of TRH and TPA decreased EGF receptor affinity with half-times of 3 min. EGF treatment (5 min) caused an increase in the tyrosine phosphate content of several proteins; prior incubation with TRH resulted in a small decline in the EGF response. GH4C1 cells were incubated with 500 nM TPA for 24 h in order to down-regulate protein kinase C. Protein kinase C depletion was confirmed by immunoblots and the effects of TRH and TPA on 125I-EGF binding were tested. TRH and TPA were both much less effective in cells pretreated with phorbol esters. TRH increased cytoplasmic pH measured with an intracellularly trapped pH sensitive dye after mild acidification with nigericin. This TRH response is presumed to be the result of protein kinase C-mediated activation of the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger and was blunted in protein kinase C-depleted cells. All of these results are consistent with the view that TRH acts rapidly in the intact cell to activate protein kinase C and that a consequence of this activation is EGF receptor phosphorylation and Na+/H+ exchanger activation."
https://openalex.org/W1576075989,"Heparin-binding growth factors (HBGF) are essential and key mitogens for human adult large vessel endothelial cells. At 170 pg/ml, the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) caused a 50% inhibition of heparin-binding growth factor type one (HBGF-1)-stimulated DNA synthesis in human adult large vessel endothelial cells. TPA at 1 ng/ml completely inhibited HBGF-1-stimulated proliferation. TPA at 5 ng/ml reduced specific HBGF-1 receptor sites from 6600 per cell to 3200 per cell without affecting receptor affinity. Since phorbol esters are potent activators of protein kinase C, desensitizes both animal capillary and human adult large vessel endothelial cells to the mitogenic effects of HBGF by down-regulation of specific HBGF receptors.--HOSHI, H; KAN, M.; MIOH, H.; CHEN J.-K.; McKEEHAN, W.

https://openalex.org/W1488196244,"The lone cysteine residue (Cys-202) of transcription termination factor rho has been modified with the sulfhydryl-specific dyes 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and 5-(2-[iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. Labeling with both dyes is specific for the Cys-202 residue and is at least 90% complete. Rho protein is an RNA-dependent ATPase and exists as a hexamer of identical subunits in its activated (RNA-liganded) form. We find that chemical modification of rho at Cys-202 does not significantly change the properties of the protein; subunit assembly, RNA binding, and poly(rC)-activated ATP hydrolysis are all relatively unperturbed by the covalent attachment of these fluorescent moieties. On the other hand, the spectral, quenching, and anisotropy properties of the fluorescent groups are all significantly modified by attachment to the protein. No energy transfer is seen between fluorescein-labeled subunits within rho hexamers, indicating that the Cys-202 residues on these subunits are located at least 40 A apart. These fluorescently labeled rho molecules should represent useful probes to study the conformations and inter- and intrasubunit geometries of this termination factor at various stages of its interaction with nascent RNA transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1481090816,"Purified PhoE-porins were reconstituted into black lipid bilayer membranes, and the selectivity and size of the reconstituted pores were determined. Addition of polyphosphates influenced the internal charge situation of the pore resulting in a shift from anion to cation selectivity. However, the pore size as judged from single channel conductances was not influenced by the addition of polyphosphates. A strong inhibition of the pore conductance only occurred when Mg2+ was also present in the aqueous phase. The inhibition of the pore function is presumably caused by the formation of a chelate between the divalent cation and the polyphosphate. Nevertheless, neither this inhibition nor the selectivity shift are specific to phosphate, because both effects can be mimicked by other polyvalent anions such as citrate. Inhibition of the PhoE pore function by polyphosphate in in vivo experiments confirmed the results of in vitro experiments that polyphosphate is only able to affect the permeability of the outer membrane toward beta-lactam antibiotics if Mg2+ is present. The outcome of the in vivo and the in vitro experiments are consistent with the assumption that the PhoE-porins do not contain a specific binding site for phosphate or polyphosphates but are anion selective because of an excess of positively charged amino acids inside or at the surface of the pore."
https://openalex.org/W1573120651,"The DNA sequence specificity of the cancer chemotherapeutic agent, bleomycin, has been investigated in three clones of human alpha RI-DNA. The three 340-base pair alpha RI-DNA sequences were almost identical in their nucleotide sequence enabling the study of subtle effects of base substitutions on bleomycin cleavage. By utilizing densitometer scanning and statistical analysis of the degree of bleomycin DNA cleavage, we found 17 significant differences between the three DNA sequences. Eleven of these differences could be attributed to base substitutions close to the dinucleotide cleavage site. However, six of the differences were at positions two or more base pairs from the base substitution sites. The significant differences were up to 12 base pairs from base substitutions. It is proposed that these long range effects are due to base substitutions causing microvariation in the DNA structure to which bleomycin cleavage is sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1899385764,"We have shown previously that low density lipoproteins (LDL) suppressed the synthesis of lactosylceramide in normal human proximal tubular cells, but stimulated such synthesis in proximal tubular cells from LDL receptor negative subjects (Chatterjee, S., Clarke, K., and Kwiterovich, P.O., Jr. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13474-13479). To understand the mechanism(s) of this effect of LDL, we have studied here the effects of LDL on the activity of UDP-GalCer:beta-galactosyltransferase (GalT-2). Maximum suppression (70-80%) of the activity of GalT-2 in normal proximal tubular cells at 37 degrees C occurred at a LDL concentration of 25 micrograms/ml medium. Such suppression was not observed either when the cells were incubated with LDL at 4 degrees C, or when the cells were preincubated with leupeptin, followed by incubation with LDL at 37 degrees C. High density lipoproteins and fetuin did not suppress the activity of GalT-2 in normal proximal tubular cells. In contrast LDL modified by reductive methylation (M-LDL, 100 micrograms/ml) stimulated the activity of GalT-2, approximately 3-fold. The effects of LDL and M-LDL were not related to their glycosphingolipid content. Much less suppression and stimulation of the activity of GalT-2 in proximal tubular cells by LDL and M-LDL, respectively, was found in normal human skin fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and bovine smooth muscle cells, suggesting that the LDL-mediated effect may be tissue-specific. In cells grown to very high density, the activity of the LDL receptor is decreased, and there was less suppression of GalT-2 activity by LDL. In normal proximal tubular cells, LDL stimulated the activity of UDP-Gal:LacCer, alpha-galactosyltransferase activity, UDP-Gal:LcOse3Cer, beta-galactosyltransferase, and CMP-NeuAc:LacCer,alpha-sialyltransferase activity but did not alter the activity of sulfotransferase. In conclusion, LDL that entered the normal proximal tubular cells via the LDL receptor-mediated pathway decreased GalT-2 activity, an effect that was dependent upon the binding, internalization, and degradation of receptor-bound LDL. In contrast LDL that entered normal or LDL receptor-negative proximal tubular cells via an LDL receptor-independent pathway failed to suppress GalT-2 activity, and led to a stimulation of LacCer synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1600358206,"Residualizing labels for protein, such as dilactitol-125I-tyramine (125I-DLT) and cellobiitol-125I-tyramine, have been used to identify the tissue and cellular sites of catabolism of long-lived plasma proteins, such as albumin, immunoglobulins, and lipoproteins. The radioactive degradation products formed from labeled proteins are relatively large, hydrophilic, resistant to lysosomal hydrolases, and accumulate in lysosomes in the cells involved in degradation of the carrier protein. However, the gradual loss of the catabolites from cells (t1/2 approximately 2 days) has limited the usefulness of residualizing labels in studies on longer lived proteins. We describe here a higher molecular weight (Mr approximately 5000), more efficient residualizing glycoconjugate label, inulin-125I-tyramine (125I-InTn). Attachment of 125I-InTn had no effect on the plasma half-life or tissue sites of catabolism of asialofetuin, fetuin, or rat serum albumin in the rat. The half-life for hepatic retention of degradation products from 125I-InTn-labeled asialofetuin was 5 days, compared to 2.3 days for 125I-DLT-labeled asialofetuin. The whole body half-lives for radioactivity from 125I-InTn-, 125I-DLT-, and 125I-labeled rat serum albumin were 7.5, 4.3, and 2.2 days, respectively. The tissue distribution of degradation products from 125I-InTn-labeled proteins agreed with results of previous studies using 125I-DLT, except that a greater fraction of total degradation products was recovered in tissues. Kinetic analyses indicated that the average half-life for retention of 125I-InTn degradation products in tissues is approximately 5 days and suggested that in vivo there are both slow and rapid routes for release of degradation products from cells. Overall, these experiments indicate that 125I-InTn should provide greater sensitivity and more accurate quantitative information on the sites of catabolism of long-lived circulating proteins in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1632440844,"Cultured cells depend on cytokine mediators for sustained growth and maintenance and are routinely employed in bioassays to detect and measure minute changes in biological mediators, e.g. the interferons and interleukins. We evaluated the effects of mycoplasma infection on the steady-state mRNA levels of two cytokines IL-1 alpha and beta. Noninfected human squamous carcinoma cell line A431 expressed constitutively IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA. In contrast freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the monocytic cell line U937 expressed abundant IL-1 mRNA only after the appropriate stimulation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and U937 steady-state IL-1 beta mRNA levels were considerably greater than IL-1 alpha mRNA levels, whereas nearly equivalent high levels of IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA were detected in A431 cells. Mycoplasma infection of cultured A431 cells reduced the steady-state levels of IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA. This effect was nonspecific for A431 cells as actin mRNA steady-state levels showed similar decreases to mycoplasma contamination. However, this response was cell specific since mycoplasma-free and contaminated U937 cells differed little in IL-1 mRNA expression. These results show that the response to mycoplasma infection is at least partly cell-type dependent."
