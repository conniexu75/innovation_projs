https://openalex.org/W3016833507,"Bioelectronics for modulating the nervous system have shown promise in treating neurological diseases1-3. However, their fixed dimensions cannot accommodate rapid tissue growth4,5 and may impair development6. For infants, children and adolescents, once implanted devices are outgrown, additional surgeries are often needed for device replacement, leading to repeated interventions and complications6-8. Here, we address this limitation with morphing electronics, which adapt to in vivo nerve tissue growth with minimal mechanical constraint. We design and fabricate multilayered morphing electronics, consisting of viscoplastic electrodes and a strain sensor that eliminate the stress at the interface between the electronics and growing tissue. The ability of morphing electronics to self-heal during implantation surgery allows a reconfigurable and seamless neural interface. During the fastest growth period in rats, morphing electronics caused minimal damage to the rat nerve, which grows 2.4-fold in diameter, and allowed chronic electrical stimulation and monitoring for 2 months without disruption of functional behavior. Morphing electronics offers a path toward growth-adaptive pediatric electronic medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3016978893,"Leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) underlie cancer therapy resistance but targeting these cells remains difficult. The Wnt–β-catenin and PI3K–Akt pathways cooperate to promote tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. In a mouse model in which both pathways are activated in stem and progenitor cells, LSCs expanded under chemotherapy-induced stress. Since Akt can activate β-catenin, inhibiting this interaction might target therapy-resistant LSCs. High-throughput screening identified doxorubicin (DXR) as an inhibitor of the Akt–β-catenin interaction at low doses. Here we repurposed DXR as a targeted inhibitor rather than a broadly cytotoxic chemotherapy. Targeted DXR reduced Akt-activated β-catenin levels in chemoresistant LSCs and reduced LSC tumorigenic activity. Mechanistically, β-catenin binds multiple immune-checkpoint gene loci, and targeted DXR treatment inhibited expression of multiple immune checkpoints specifically in LSCs, including PD-L1, TIM3 and CD24. Overall, LSCs exhibit distinct properties of immune resistance that are reduced by inhibiting Akt-activated β-catenin. These findings suggest a strategy for overcoming cancer therapy resistance and immune escape. Targeting resistant stem cells in leukaemia, Perry et al. show that doxorubicin at low doses decreases Akt-mediated β-catenin activity, downregulates expression of multiple immune-checkpoint genes and dampens tumorigenesis of leukaemia stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W3017368995,"Abstract Combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy improves clinical outcome in advanced oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, however relapse is inevitable. Here, we show in model systems that other than loss of RB1 few gene-copy number (CN) alterations are associated with irreversible-resistance to endocrine therapy and subsequent secondary resistance to palbociclib. Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2, CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2 . Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading to decreased expression of ‘classical’ oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling, leading to the re-wiring of ER. Kinome-knockdown confirmed dependency on ERBB-signalling and G2/M–checkpoint proteins such as WEE1, together with the cell cycle master regulator, CDK7. Noteworthy, sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition was associated with loss of ER and RB1 CN. Overall, we show that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is dependent on kinase re-wiring and the redeployment of signalling cascades previously associated with endocrine resistance and highlights new therapeutic networks that can be exploited upon relapse after CDK4/6 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3016325919,"Our knowledge about the structure and function of Andean forests at regional scales remains limited. Current initiatives to study forests over continental or global scales still have important geographical gaps, particularly in regions such as the tropical and subtropical Andes. In this study, we assessed patterns of structure and tree species diversity along ~ 4000 km of latitude and ~ 4000 m of elevation range in Andean forests. We used the Andean Forest Network (Red de Bosques Andinos, https://redbosques.condesan.org/) database which, at present, includes 491 forest plots (totaling 156.3 ha, ranging from 0.01 to 6 ha) representing a total of 86,964 identified tree stems ≥ 10 cm diameter at breast height belonging to 2341 identified species, 584 genera and 133 botanical families. Tree stem density and basal area increases with elevation while species richness decreases. Stem density and species richness both decrease with latitude. Subtropical forests have distinct tree species composition compared to those in the tropical region. In addition, floristic similarity of subtropical plots is between 13 to 16% while similarity between tropical forest plots is between 3% to 9%. Overall, plots ~ 0.5-ha or larger may be preferred for describing patterns at regional scales in order to avoid plot size effects. We highlight the need to promote collaboration and capacity building among researchers in the Andean region (i.e., South-South cooperation) in order to generate and synthesize information at regional scale."
https://openalex.org/W3017096042,"Lenvatinib is an approved first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the effect of dose modification on its efficacy is unclear. We analyzed the relationship between the relative dose intensity during the initial 4 weeks of therapy [4W-relative dose intensity (RDI)] and the efficacy of lenvatinib therapy in the real-world setting. A total of 48 consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who received lenvatinib therapy for more than 4 weeks were included. The 4W-RDI was calculated as the cumulative dose in the initial 4 weeks divided by the weight-based standard dose, and we evaluated its association with overall survival (OS) and best response by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (mRECIST). The baseline factors predicting high 4W-RDI were analyzed further. The median durations of follow-up and of therapy among the 48 participants were 7.6 and 6.6 months, respectively. The median OS was not reached. Drug interruption and/or dose reduction were necessary in 30 patients (62.5%) and the median 4W-RDI was 70% (range 22%-100%). Patients with 4W-RDI ≥70% had longer OS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.28, 95% confidential interval (CI):0.09-0.90, p = 0.03], and longer duration of lenvatinib therapy (HR 0.39, 95%CI:0.16-0.92, p = 0.03). Patients with 4W-RDI ≥70% showed higher disease control rate compared to those with 4W-RDI <70% (91.7% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.008). A baseline albumin level >3.4g/dL or ALBI score less than -2.171 were significantly associated with achieving 4W-RDI ≥70%. In conclusion, 4W-RDI of lenvatinib therapy is associated with favorable radiological response and longer OS."
https://openalex.org/W3016876337,"Polymers are commonly used in medical device manufacturing, e.g. for drug delivery systems, bone substitutes and stent coatings. Especially hydrogels exhibit very promising properties in this field. Hence, the development of new hydrogel systems for customized application is of great interest, especially regarding the swelling behavior and mechanical properties as well as the biocompatibility. The aim of this work was the preparation and investigation of various polyelectrolyte and poly-ionic liquid based hydrogels accessible by radical polymerization. The obtained polymers were covalently crosslinked with N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA) or different lengths of poly(ethyleneglycol)diacrylate (PEGDA). The effect of different crosslinker-to-monomer ratios has been examined. In addition to the compression curves and the maximum degree of swelling, the biocompatibility with L929 mouse fibroblasts of these materials was determined in direct cell seeding experiments and the outcome for the different hydrogels was compared."
https://openalex.org/W3016533114,"Despite growing demand for practicable methods of research evaluation, the use of bibliometric indicators remains controversial. This paper examines performance assessment practice in Europe—first, identifying the most commonly used bibliometric methods and, second, identifying the actors who have defined wide-spread practices. The framework of this investigation is Abbott’s theory of professions, and I argue that indicator-based research assessment constitutes a potential jurisdiction for both individual experts and expert organizations. This investigation was conducted using a search methodology that yielded 138 evaluation studies from 21 EU countries, covering the period 2005 to 2019. Structured content analysis revealed the following findings: (1) Bibliometric research assessment is most frequently performed in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Italy, and the United Kingdom. (2) The Web of Science (WoS) is the dominant database used for public research assessment in Europe. (3) Expert organizations invest in the improvement of WoS citation data, and set technical standards with regards to data quality. (4) Citation impact is most frequently assessed with reference to international scientific fields. (5) The WoS classification of science fields retained its function as a de facto reference standard for research performance assessment. A detailed comparison of assessment practices between five dedicated organizations and other individual bibliometric experts suggests that corporate ownership and limited access to the most widely used citation databases have had a restraining effect on the development and diffusion of professional bibliometric methods during this period."
https://openalex.org/W3016468730,"There is increasing evidence that several factors, including both cognitive and non-cognitive ones, play an important role in mathematics achievement. Relatively little is known about how socio-emotional features and the quality of the student-teacher relationship correlate with mathematics achievement among adolescents in transition to middle school. The aim of the present study is to examine the role of cognitive factors (general cognitive abilities), non-cognitive factors (math anxiety and self-esteem), and the quality of the student-teacher relationship on mathematics achievement. A large sample of Italian sixth graders was evaluated upon entering middle school. The results showed that general cognitive ability was the best predictor of mathematics achievement. As regards non-cognitive factors, the level of math anxiety was effective in predicting mathematics achievement, after controlling for other measures including self-esteem and the quality of the student-teacher relationship. In particular, we found that the quality of the student-teacher relationship had an indirect influence on mathematics achievement through the mediation of math anxiety. Our findings seem to indicate that the quality of the student-teacher relationship may be related to mathematics achievement, through its effects on math anxiety. This may have important implications for practitioners and educators, as we can suggest that interventions devoted to improving the quality of the student-teacher relationship may play a positive role in both preventing math anxiety and promoting mathematics learning."
https://openalex.org/W3016295087,"The Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist (PCL) is the most widely used questionnaire to screen for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), based on the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental disorders (DSM-IV) criteria. In the latest edition of the DSM (DSM-5), the criteria for PTSD were revised leading to the development of the PCL-5. So far, there is no validated Dutch version of the PCL-5. The aim of this study is to determine psychometric characteristics of the Dutch translation and linguistic validation of the PCL-5 and to evaluate internal consistency, criterion and structural validity. In a population of 495 civilian, traumatic brain injury patients, the PCL-5, the Generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire and the Depression scale of the Patient health questionnaire were administered. The PCL-5 was translated in Dutch following a strict procedure of linguistic validation and cognitive debriefing. Results show an excellent internal consistency and high criterion validity. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for the four-factor DSM-5 model, but a superior fit for the six-factor Anhedonia model and the seven-factor Hybrid model, similar to the English version of the PCL-5. Preliminary validation of the Dutch translation of the PCL-5 was proven to be psychometrically sound and can be used for clinical and academic purposes, specifically for TBI patients. Future research should examine concurrent and discriminant validity for the Dutch translation in broader populations at risk for PTSD, and include a structured interview to evaluate diagnostic utility."
https://openalex.org/W3016457610,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a transdiagnostic process and a promising target for prevention and treatment of mental disorders. RNT is typically assessed via self-report questionnaires with most studies focusing on one type of RNT (i.e., worry or rumination) and one specific disorder (i.e., anxiety or depression). However, responses to such questionnaires may be biased by memory and metacognitive beliefs. Recently, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has been employed to minimize these biases. This study aims to develop an EMA paradigm to measure RNT as a transdiagnostic process in natural settings. Based on empirical and theoretical considerations, an item pool was created encompassing RNT content and processes. We then (1) tested model fit of a content-related and a process-related model for assessing RNT as an individual difference variable, (2) investigated the reliability and construct validity of the proposed scale(s), and (3) determined the optimal sampling design. One hundred fifty healthy participants aged 18 to 40 years filled out baseline questionnaires on rumination, worry, RNT, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Participants received 8 semi-random daily prompts assessing RNT over 14 days. After the EMA phase, participants answered questionnaires on depression, anxiety, and stress again. Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis revealed excellent model fit for the process-related model but unsatisfactory fit for the content-related model. Different hybrid models were additionally explored, yielding one model with satisfactory fit. Both the process-related and the hybrid scale showed good reliability and good convergent validity and were significantly associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress after the EMA phase when controlling for baseline scores. Further analyses found that a sampling design of 5 daily assessments across 10 days yielded the best tradeoff between participant burden and information retained by EMA. In sum, this paper presents a promising paradigm for assessing RNT in daily life."
https://openalex.org/W3016517788,"There are four screening sarcopenia questionnaires (SARC-F, SARC-CalF, MSRA-5, MSRA-7). To unambiguously determine which of them is the most effective tool in community-dwelling older adults, we performed a diagnostic accuracy study. The aim of the analysis was to assess the diagnostic values of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, MSRA-5, MSRA-7 and compare their psychometric properties against six criterion standards (EWGSOP1, EWGSOP2, FNIH, AWGS, IWGS, SCWD criteria).We included 100 community-dwelling volunteers aged ≥ 65yrs. The sensitivity/specificity analyses were performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curves (AUC) were calculated to compare the overall diagnostic accuracy of the four questionnaires. Ideal screening tools should have reasonably high sensitivity and specificity, and an AUC value above 0.7.With respect to the six criterion standards used, the sensitivity of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, MSRA-5, and MSRA-7 ranged 35.0-90.0%, 20.0-75.0%, 64.7-90.0%, 76.5-91.7%, respectively, whereas the specificity ranged 86.9-91.1%, 80.0-90.0%, 45.8-48.8%, 28.9-31.0% respectively. The AUCs of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, MSRA-5, and MSRA-7 ranged from 0.655-0.882, 0.711-0.874, 0.618-0.782 and 0.588-0.711 respectively. Only SARC-CalF had AUC >0.7 and <0.9 against the six criterion standards but obesity was a confounding factor, which may affect the diagnostic power of SARC-CalF. MSRA-7 had the smallest AUC of all the questionnaires and MSRA-5 had slightly larger AUC than MSRA-7.Based on our analysis, the standard sarcopenia screening questionnaires deliver contradictory results in many practically occurring cases. It appears that SARC-CalF is an optimal choice for screening sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3016693808,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading known inherited intellectual disability and the most common genetic cause of autism. The full mutation results in transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene and loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. Defects in neuroenergetic capacity are known to cause a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, we explored the integrity of forebrain mitochondria in Fmr1 knockout mice during the peak of synaptogenesis. We found inefficient thermogenic respiration due to futile proton leak in Fmr1 KO mitochondria caused by coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiency and an open cyclosporine-sensitive channel. Repletion of mitochondrial CoQ within the Fmr1 KO forebrain closed the channel, blocked the pathological proton leak, restored rates of protein synthesis during synaptogenesis, and normalized the key phenotypic features later in life. The findings demonstrate that FMRP deficiency results in inefficient oxidative phosphorylation during the neurodevelopment and suggest that dysfunctional mitochondria may contribute to the FXS phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3016815881,"Chemotherapy has been reported to upregulate sphingomylinases and increase cellular ceramide, often linked to the induction to cell death. In this work, we show that sublethal doses of doxorubicin and vorinostat still increased cellular ceramide, which was located predominantly at the plasma membrane. To interrogate possible functions of this specific pool of ceramide, we used recombinant enzymes to mimic physiological levels of ceramide at the plasma membrane upon chemotherapy treatment. Using mass spectrometry and network analysis, followed by experimental confirmation, the results revealed that this pool of ceramide acutely regulates cell adhesion and cell migration pathways with weak connections to commonly established ceramide functions (eg, cell death). Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) was identified as responsible for the generation of plasma membrane ceramide upon chemotherapy treatment, and both ceramide at the plasma membrane and nSMase2 were necessary and sufficient to mediate these side effects of chemotherapy on cell adhesion and migration. This is the first time a specific pool of ceramide is interrogated for acute signaling functions, and the results define plasma membrane ceramide as an acute signaling effector necessary and sufficient for regulation of cell adhesion and cell migration under chemotherapeutical stress."
https://openalex.org/W3016873959,"The ability to construct coherent narratives about significant personal experiences, commonly referred to as autobiographical memory coherence, has been related to various emotional disorders, though insight regarding mechanisms that might underlie this relation is scarce. The present study contributes to this growing body of research by examining the relation between memory coherence and both depression and PTSD and by investigating the role of rumination, cognitive avoidance, executive functioning, and meaning making in that relation in a large-scale community sample. The negative relation between memory coherence and both depression and PTSD could not be replicated, nor could the hypothesized negative relation between memory coherence and both rumination and cognitive avoidance be confirmed. In contrast, results indicated more memory coherence to be related to more rumination. Additional analyses in light of these surprising findings revealed that there was a significant indirect relation between memory coherence and both depression and PTSD-related symptoms through rumination. When the latter was controlled for, memory coherence was predictive of PTSD diagnosis and the hypothesized negative association with cognitive avoidance could be confirmed. In line with predictions, both executive functioning and meaning making were positively related to memory coherence. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed."

Here, we identified a novel mTORC1-interacting protein called protein kinase A anchoring protein 8L (AKAP8L). Using biochemical assays, we found that the N-terminal region of AKAP8L binds to mTORC1 in the cytoplasm. Importantly, loss of AKAP8L decreased mTORC1-mediated processes such as translation, cell growth, and cell proliferation. AKAPs anchor protein kinase A (PKA) through PKA regulatory subunits, and we show that AKAP8L can anchor PKA through regulatory subunit Iα. Reintroducing full-length AKAP8L into cells restored mTORC1-regulated processes, whereas reintroduction of AKAP8L missing the N-terminal region that confers the interaction with mTORC1 did not. Our results suggest a multifaceted role for AKAPs in the cell.

https://openalex.org/W3017107284,"Background Hypertension prevalence increases when socioeconomic status decreases but gender differences in the relationship between socioeconomic status and hypertension have been less studied. This work aimed to explore the pattern of associations between three indicators of socioeconomic status at individual, household, and municipal levels with hypertension across genders in a large sample of French adults from the CONSTANCES cohort. Methods Using data at inclusion from 59 805 participants (52% women) aged 25–69 years and recruited between 2012 and 2015, multilevel log-Poisson regressions with robust variance estimates were used to assess the associations of Relative Index of Inequality in education, monthly income per consumption unit and residential deprivation with hypertension. Modifying effects of gender and age in those associations were tested. Results Hypertension prevalence was higher in men than in women. Steep socioeconomic gradients of hypertension were observed for the three socioeconomic indicators in both genders and from the youngest to the oldest age class. Socioeconomic inequalities, especially educational inequalities, were larger among women than men: Relative Index of Inequality for highest versus lowest education among the 25–34 years were 0.43 [95%-confidence interval = 0.28–0.67] in women and 0.70 [95%-confidence interval = 0.53–0.92] in men. With increasing age, socioeconomic gradients of hypertension eased in men and even more in women so that gender differences decreased. Conclusions In this cross-sectional analysis of a large sample of adults, prevalence of hypertension was higher in men than in women. Moreover, socioeconomic status and especially education displayed a stronger association with hypertension prevalence in women compared to men. Reducing inequalities in hypertension may require gender-specific approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3016762722,"Cohesin is a DNA-associated protein complex that forms a tripartite ring controlling sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation and organization, DNA replication, and gene expression. Sister chromatid cohesion is established by the protein acetyltransferase Eco1, which acetylates two conserved lysine residues on the cohesin subunit Smc3 and thereby ensures correct chromatid separation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and other eukaryotes. However, the consequence of Eco1-catalyzed cohesin acetylation is unknown, and the exact nature of the cohesive state of chromatids remains controversial. Here, we show that self-interactions of the cohesin subunits Scc1/Rad21 and Scc3 occur in a DNA replication–coupled manner in both yeast and human cells. Using cross-linking MS-based and in vivo disulfide cross-linking analyses of purified cohesin, we show that a subpopulation of cohesin may exist as dimers. Importantly, upon temperature-sensitive and auxin-induced degron-mediated Eco1 depletion, the cohesin-cohesin interactions became significantly compromised, whereas deleting either the deacetylase Hos1 or the Eco1 antagonist Wpl1/Rad61 increased cohesin dimer levels by ∼20%. These results indicate that cohesin dimerizes in the S phase and monomerizes in mitosis, processes that are controlled by Eco1, Wpl1, and Hos1 in the sister chromatid cohesion-dissolution cycle.

https://openalex.org/W3016354375,"Introduction Even though use of antiretroviral therapy (HAART) decreases the incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs) they are continuing to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Studies concerning this problem are scarce in Eastern Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and predictors of OIs after initiation of HAART in Ethiopia. Methods A health facility based single centered cohort study using structured data extraction sheet was conducted. The study population was all HIV positive ART naive adolescents and adults who started HAART between January 2009 and May 2012. Simple random sampling technique was used to select 317 patients from the record. Multivariate binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors for the occurrence of OIs after initiation of HAART. Results The incidence of OIs after HAART was 7.5 cases/100person years. Tuberculosis, oral candidiasis, pneumonia and toxoplasmosis were the leading OIs after HAART. A bed ridden functional status at initiation of HAART, presence of OIs before HAART, non-adherence and low hemoglobin level were predictors for the occurrence of OIs after HAART. Conclusion The incidence of OIs after HAART was higher than in previous studies. Patients with the identified risk factors need strict follow up to reduce the morbidity and mortality attributed to OIs. Earlier initiation of HAART before advanced immune suppression, better management of TB and extended baseline assessment could help to reduce opportunistic infections and mortality after the initiation of HAART in Ethiopian patients."
https://openalex.org/W3017166115,"The aberrant metabolism of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). Aβ is produced via the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. However, the precise regulatory mechanism of Aβ generation still remains unclear. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of Aβ production, we established a genetic screening method based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify novel regulators of Aβ production. We successfully identified calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) as a potential negative regulator of Aβ production. The disruption of Cib1 significantly upregulated Aβ levels. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CIB1 interacts with the γ-secretase complex. Moreover, the disruption of Cib1 specifically reduced the cell-surface localization of mature Nicastrin (Nct), which is a component of the γ-secretase complex, without changing the intrinsic activity of γ-secretase. Finally, we confirmed using the single-cell RNA-seq data in human that CIB1 mRNA level in neuron was decreased in the early stage of AD. Taken together, our results indicate that CIB1 regulates Aβ production via controlling the subcellular localization of γ-secretase, suggesting CIB1 is involved in the development of AD."

We posited here that NCBP1 and DHX9/RHA (RHA) support a translation pathway of JUND RNA that is independent of mTOR. We present evidence from reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments indicating that NCBP1 and RHA both are components of messenger ribonucleoproteins in several cell types. Moreover, tandem affinity and RT–quantitative PCR results revealed that JUND mRNA is a component of a previously unknown ribonucleoprotein complex.

Subsequently, CBC bound at the 5′-RNA cap is exchanged to cytoplasmic cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). eIF4E engages eIF4G and other components of preinitiation complexes (PIC) to initiate canonical cap-dependent translation. The eIF4E-dependent messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) activate polysome assembly and steady-state protein synthesis (17Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G.

The traditional view has been that eIF4E is necessary for cap-dependent protein synthesis (16Isken O. Maquat L.E. The multiple lives of NMD factors: balancing roles in gene and genome regulation.Nat.

Immunoprecipitations (IPs) of HIV-1 polysomes identified that late mRNAs are enriched in NCBP1 co-precipitates while undetected in eIF4E immunoprecipitates. These results posited a non-eIF4E pathway for cap-dependent translation of select mRNAs (31Sharma A. Yilmaz A. Marsh K. Cochrane A. Boris-Lawrie K. Thriving under stress: selective translation of HIV-1 structural protein mRNA during Vpr-mediated impairment of eIF4E translation activity.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 (22457629): e100261210.1371/journal.ppat.1002612Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently an additional cap-binding protein, NCBP3, was identified to serve redundantly with NCBP2 under physiological conditions (9Gebhardt A. Habjan M. Benda C. Meiler A. Haas D.A. Hein M.Y. Mann A. Mann M. Habermann B. Pichlmair A. mRNA export through an additional cap-binding complex consisting of NCBP1 and NCBP3.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26382858): 819210.1038/ncomms9192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The observation that co-depletion of NCBP2/NCBP3 curtailed NCBP1 association with 5′-caps demonstrated that NCBP1 alternatively forms CBC with NCBP2 or NCBP3 (9Gebhardt A. Habjan M. Benda C. Meiler A. Haas D.A. Hein M.Y. Mann A. Mann M. Habermann B. Pichlmair A. mRNA export through an additional cap-binding complex consisting of NCBP1 and NCBP3.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26382858): 819210.1038/ncomms9192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further evidence demonstrated that NCBP3 is essential to mount a precise and appropriate stress response (34Gebhardt A. Bergant V. Schnepf D. Moser M. Meiler A. Togbe D. MacKowiak C. Reinert L.S. Paludan S.R. Ryffel B. Stukalov A. Staeheli P. Pichlmair A.

NCBP3-deficient mice suffered from severe lung pathology and increased morbidity after influenza A virus challenge, suggesting that NCBP3 supports expression of stress-responsive genes (34Gebhardt A. Bergant V. Schnepf D. Moser M. Meiler A. Togbe D. MacKowiak C. Reinert L.S. Paludan S.R. Ryffel B. Stukalov A. Staeheli P. Pichlmair A. The alternative cap-binding complex is required for antiviral defense in vivo.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 (31856218): e100815510.1371/journal.ppat.1008155Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Given that NCBP2 and NCBP3 function redundantly to support nuclear processing of mRNAs and that NCBP3-deficient cells evoke a reduced antiviral response, we posited that the noncanonical CBC (consisting of NCBP1/NCBP3) is important for translation of stress response genes (31Sharma A. Yilmaz A. Marsh K. Cochrane A. Boris-Lawrie K. Thriving under stress: selective translation of HIV-1 structural protein mRNA during Vpr-mediated impairment of eIF4E translation activity.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 (22457629): e100261210.1371/journal.ppat.1002612Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The gap in knowledge remains in determining the involvement of the noncanonical CBC in translation of select mRNAs. AP-1 transcription factors are stress-response proteins (JUND, JUNB, c-Jun) (35Hernandez J.M. Floyd D.H. Weilbaecher K.N. Green P.L. Boris-Lawrie K. Multiple facets of junD gene expression are atypical among AP-1 family members.Oncogene. 2008; 27 (18427548): 4757-476710.1038/onc.2008.120Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). JUND, a negative regulator of cell proliferation, is among the subset of host mRNAs selectively translated during post-translational down-regulation of eIF4E (19Short J.D. Pfarr C.M. Translational regulation of the JunD messenger RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (12105216): 32697-3270510.1074/jbc.M204553200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previous investigations identified translation of JUND, and retroviral transcripts depend upon nuclear RNA helicase A (DHX9/RHA) (36Hartman T.R. Qian S. Bolinger C. Fernandez S. Schoenberg D.R. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicase A is necessary for translation of selected messenger RNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13 (16680162): 509-51610.1038/nsmb1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). DHX9/RHA binds to a specific class of post-transcriptional control element (PCE) in JUND and several retroviral 5′-UTRs to stimulate polysome formation (36Hartman T.R. Qian S. Bolinger C. Fernandez S. Schoenberg D.R. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicase A is necessary for translation of selected messenger RNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol.

RHA down-regulation or ectopic expression of the two N-terminal RNA-binding domains (RBDs) were found to attenuate the synthesis of JUND and HIV-1 virion proteins (36Hartman T.R. Qian S. Bolinger C. Fernandez S. Schoenberg D.R. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicase A is necessary for translation of selected messenger RNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The RHA co-factors necessary for assembling polysomes remain to be identified. Given the mutual engagement of NCBP1 and RHA to select mRNAs, we posited that NCBP1 and RHA are components of the same RNP that facilitates cap-dependent translation of JUND. To address the hypothesis that NCBP1 and RHA are components of a mutual RNP, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) were performed with specific antisera in three or more replicate experiments. HEK293 cytoplasmic (cyto) lysates were incubated with specific antisera or isotype-specific IgG. Analysis of the immune complexes by Western blots (WB) revealed that the antiserum to NCBP1 co-precipitated RHA, NCBP2, NCBP3, and cytoplasmic poly-A–binding protein (PABPC1). In the course of seven independent experiments, neither eIF4E nor eIF4G were detectable in the NCBP1-RHA immune complexes (Fig. 1A). Antiserum to eIF4E co-precipitated eIF4G, PABPC1, and DDX3 (Fig. 1B) (39Soto-Rifo R. Rubilar P.S. Ohlmann T. The DEAD-box helicase DDX3 substitutes for the cap-binding protein eIF4E to promote compartmentalized translation initiation of the HIV-1 genomic RNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23630313): 6286-629910.1093/nar/gkt306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Shih J.W. Tsai T.Y. Chao C.H. Wu Lee Y.H. Candidate tumor suppressor DDX3 RNA helicase specifically represses cap-dependent translation by acting as an eIF4E inhibitory protein.Oncogene. 2008; 27 (17667941): 700-71410.1038/sj.onc.1210687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The eIF4E complexes were devoid of detectable NCBP1, RHA, NCBP2, or NCBP3 (Fig. 1B), validating that NCBP1-RHA and eIF4E-DDX3 are components of mutually exclusive mRNPs (Fig. 1). Antiserum to NCBP2 or NCBP3 independently co-precipitated NCBP1 (Fig. 1A), corroborating the previous finding that NCBP1 independently enriches NCBP2- or NCBP3-bound 5′-capped mRNAs (9Gebhardt A. Habjan M. Benda C. Meiler A. Haas D.A. Hein M.Y. Mann A. Mann M. Habermann B. Pichlmair A. mRNA export through an additional cap-binding complex consisting of NCBP1 and NCBP3.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26382858): 819210.1038/ncomms9192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The RHA immune complexes co-precipitated NCBP1 and NCBP2 or NCBP3, and the results of seven replicate experiments confirmed the lack of detectable eIF4E and eIF4G, recapitulating different mRNPs. Reciprocal IPs validated each of the indicated interactions (Fig. 1A). NCBP3 co-precipitated DDX3, but not other components of the eIF4E RNPs. The observed NCBP3-DDX3 interaction may be attributable to DDX3 in transitional interaction between NCBP-bound and eIF4E-bound 5′-caps. In summary, the immune complexes of NCBP1-RHA did not bind DDX3, whereas eIF4E did not bind RHA. The results suggest that there are multiple NCBP3 complexes. To ascertain whether NCBP1-RHA RNP is conserved in other cell types, we investigated cyto lysates of several other cell lines such as simian fibroblasts (COS), HTLV-1–transformed SLB-1 human T lymphocytes, and CEM×174 human T lymphocytes. The studies assessed co-precipitation of NCBP1 and RHA with or without NCBP2, NCBP3, or eIF4E. The results from three independent experiments demonstrated that NCBP1-RHA complexes selectively interact with NCBP3 or NCBP2 and are mutually exclusive of eIF4E in these cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings were not surprising because prior studies have demonstrated NCBP1, NCBP3, or NCBP2 and RHA exhibit high-level amino acid sequence conservation across Mammalia and translation of viral mRNAs requires RHA of bovine, feline, human, and simian origin (36Hartman T.R. Qian S. Bolinger C. Fernandez S. Schoenberg D.R. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicase A is necessary for translation of selected messenger RNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13 (16680162): 509-51610.1038/nsmb1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Next, experiments employed tandem IPs to document whether RHA and NCBP1, NCBP3, or NCBP2 are components of the same RNP in polysomes (Fig. 3, A and B). Exogenous expression of pFLAG-RHA was performed, and the HEK293 cells were collected in the lysis buffer and designated as Input cyto lysate (Fig. 3B). Next the Inputs were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, and polysome fractions were collected (Fig. 3A) and subjected to WB (Fig. 3C). WB by several antiserum verified FLAG-RHA, NCBP3, NCBP1, and NCBP2 in the Input cyto lysate (Fig. 3C, lane 1). Noticeably, FLAG-RHA, NCBP3, and NCBP1 were enriched in polysomes, whereas NCBP2 was absent (Fig. 3C, lane 2). These results exposed functional differences between canonical CBC (NCBP1-NCBP2) and noncanonical CBC (NCBP1-NCBP3). The lack of NCBP2 detection in polysomes corroborated previous demonstration of CBC activity in pioneer round, but not steady-state translation (41Ishigaki Y. Li X. Serin G. Maquat L.E. Evidence for a pioneer round of mRNA translation: mRNAs subject to nonsense-mediated decay in mammalian cells are bound by CBP80 and CBP20.Cell. 2001; 106 (11551508): 607-61710.1016/S0092-8674(01)00475-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Next, the Input and polysome samples were incubated with FLAG antiserum conjugated to protein G magnetic beads. Immune complexes were washed and collected by competitive elution with 3× FLAG peptides (250 μg/ml) as depicted in Fig. 3B. The WB of the cyto IP verified the enrichment of FLAG-RHA and the co-precipitation of NCBP1, NCBP2, and NCBP3 (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Moreover, the WB of the polysome IP verified the enrichment of FLAG-RHA and the co-precipitation of NCBP1 and NCBP3. Importantly, NCBP2 was not detectable in the polysome IP (Fig. 3C, lane 4), corroborating the lack of NCBP2 in the WB of the collected polysomes (Fig. 3C, lane 2). There was no detectable enrichment of the proteins in the protein G–negative control (Fig. 3, lane 5). Next, the eluates were subjected to tandem IP with NCBP1 antiserum conjugated to protein G magnetic beads and analyzed by WB (Fig. 3B). The results validated that the NCBP1 tandem IP captured FLAG-RHA from cyto and polysome samples (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 and 7, FLAG-RHA panel). The tandem IP ascertained NCBP3 and NCBP2 enrichment in the cyto tandem IP (Fig. 3C, lane 6). However, the polysome tandem IP captured NCBP3 but failed to capture NCBP2 (Fig. 3C, lane 7). There was no enrichment of these proteins in the IgG isotype control (Fig. 3C, lanes 8 and 9). We concluded that NCBP3 is the mutual component of FLAG-RHA-NCBP1 RNPs in polysomes. To validate that JUND is a component of the FLAG-RHA-NCBP1-NCBP3 RNPs, replicate tandem IP samples were extracted with TRIzol-LS, and the co-precipitating RNA was collected and subjected to RT-qPCR using JUND and GAPDH specific primer pairs. The JUND transcripts were readily detectable in the FLAG-RHA-NCBP1-NCBP3 RNP, whereas GAPDH transcripts were less than the minimum detectable (<MD) (Fig. 3D). Both JUND and GAPDH were <MD in the IgG controls (Fig. 3D). These results validated that FLAG-RHA-NCBP1-NCBP3 are mutual components of JUND polysomes. NCBP1-NCBP3 may be tethered to RHA through RNA or via protein–protein interaction, which would be sensitive or resistant to RNase treatment, respectively. To examine the nature of the interaction between RHA and NCBP1-NCBP3, reciprocal IPs were performed using cyto lysates treated with RNase A. The cyto lysate was incubated with RHA or NCBP1 antiserum conjugated to protein G magnetic beads with or without RNase A (1 μg/ml) for 2 h. Immune complexes were washed and collected in SDS sample buffer. The RHA IP and NCBP1 IP co-precipitated RHA, NCBP1, NCPB3, and NCBP2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). However, RNase A treatment of the RHA IP eliminated NCBP1, NCBP3, and NCBP2 (Fig. 4A, lane 2). RNase A treatment of the NCBP1 IP eliminated RHA co-precipitation, establishing that the interaction is RNA-dependent (Fig. 4A, lane 4). We concluded NCBP1 is tethered to RHA through RNA. Because RHA binding to PCE RNA requires the N-terminal double-stranded (ds) RBDs and is eliminated by mutation of surface-exposed lysine residues (K54A, K55A, and K236E) (42Ranji A. Shkriabai N.

https://openalex.org/W3016415314,"Excessive generation of oxidants by immune cells results in acute tissue damage. One mechanism by which oxidant exposure could have long-term effects is modulation of epigenetic pathways. We hypothesized that methylation of newly synthesized DNA in proliferating cells can be altered by oxidants that target DNA methyltransferase activity or deplete its substrate, the methyl donor SAM. To this end, we investigated the effect of two oxidants produced by neutrophils, H2O2 and glycine chloramine, on maintenance DNA methylation in Jurkat T lymphoma cells. Using cell synchronization and MS-based analysis, we measured heavy deoxycytidine isotope incorporation into newly synthesized DNA and observed that a sublethal bolus of glycine chloramine, but not H2O2, significantly inhibited DNA methylation. Both oxidants inhibited DNA methyltransferase 1 activity, but only chloramine depleted SAM, suggesting that removal of substrate was the most effective means of inhibiting DNA methylation. These results indicate that immune cell–derived oxidants generated during inflammation have the potential to affect the epigenome of neighboring cells."
https://openalex.org/W3017019022,"Pulsed light, as a postharvest technology, is an alternative to traditional fungicides, and can be used on a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for sanitization or pathogen control. In addition to these applications, other effects also are detected in vegetal cells, including changes in metabolism and secondary metabolite production, which directly affect disease control response mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate pulsed ultraviolet light in controlling postharvest rot, caused by Fusarium pallidoroseum in 'Spanish' melon, in natura, and its implications in disease control as a function of metabolomic variation to fungicidal or fungistatic effects. The dose of pulsed light (PL) that inhibited F. pallidoroseum growth in melons (Cucumis melo var. Spanish) was 9 KJ m-2. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass analyzer identified 12 compounds based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation patterns. Chemometric analysis by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squared Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and corresponding S-Plot were used to evaluate the changes in fruit metabolism. PL technology provided protection against postharvest disease in melons, directly inhibiting the growth of F. pallidoroseum through the upregulation of specific fruit biomarkers such as pipecolic acid (11), saponarin (7), and orientin (3), which acted as major markers for the defense system against pathogens. PL can thus be proposed as a postharvest technology to prevent chemical fungicides and may be applied to reduce the decay of melon quality during its export and storage."
https://openalex.org/W3017210763,"Tissue engineering represents a promising alternative for reconstructive surgical procedures especially for the repair of bone defects that do not regenerate spontaneously. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the elastin matrix (E24/50 and E96/37) incorporated with hydroxyapatite (HA) or morphogenetic protein (BMP) on the bone repair process in the distal metaphysis of rat femur. The groups were: control group (CG), hydrolyzed elastin matrix at 50°C/24h (E24/50), E24/50 + HA (E24/50/HA), E24/50 + BMP (E24/50/BMP), hydrolyzed elastin matrix at 37°C/96h (E96/37), E96/37 + HA (E96/37/HA), E96/37 + BMP (E96/37/BMP). Macroscopic and radiographic analyses showed longitudinal integrity of the femur in all groups without fractures or bone deformities. Microtomographically, all groups demonstrated partial closure by mineralized tissue except for the E96/37/HA group with hyperdense thin bridge formation interconnecting the edges of the ruptured cortical. Histologically, there was no complete cortical recovery in any group, but partial closure with trabecular bone. In defects filled with biomaterials, no chronic inflammatory response or foreign body type was observed. The mean volume of new bone formed was statistically significant higher in the E96/37/HA and E24/50 groups (71.28 ± 4.26 and 66.40 ± 3.69, respectively) than all the others. In the confocal analysis, it was observed that all groups presented new bone markings formed during the experimental period, being less evident in the CG group. Von Kossa staining revealed intense calcium deposits distributed in all groups. Qualitative analysis of collagen fibers under polarized light showed a predominance of red-orange birefringence in the newly regenerated bone with no difference between groups. It was concluded that the E24/50 and E96/37/HA groups promoted, with greater speed, the bone repair process in the distal metaphysis of rat femur."
https://openalex.org/W3016459535,"The increased focus on addressing severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality has led to studies investigating patient and hospital characteristics associated with longer hospital stays. Length of stay (LOS) for delivery hospitalizations has a strongly skewed distribution with the vast majority of LOS lasting two to three days in the United States. Prior studies typically focused on common LOSs and dealt with the long LOS distribution tail in ways to fit conventional statistical analyses (e.g., log transformation, trimming). This study demonstrates the use of Gamma mixture models to analyze the skewed LOS distribution. Gamma mixture models are flexible and, do not require data transformation or removal of outliers to accommodate many outcome distribution shapes, these models allow for the analysis of patients staying in the hospital for a longer time, which often includes those women experiencing worse outcomes. Random effects are included in the model to account for patients being treated within the same hospitals. Further, the role and influence of differing placements of covariates on the results is discussed in the context of distinct model specifications of the Gamma mixture regression model. The application of these models shows that they are robust to the placement of covariates and random effects. Using New York State data, the models showed that longer LOS for childbirth hospitalizations were more common in hospitals designated to accept more complicated deliveries, across hospital types, and among Black women. Primary insurance also was associated with LOS. Substantial variation between hospitals suggests the need to investigate protocols to standardize evidence-based medical care."
https://openalex.org/W3016608062,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most lethal cancers. Known risk factors for this disease are currently insufficient in predicting mortality. In order to better prognosticate patients with PDAC, we identified 20 genes by utilizing publically available high-throughput transcriptomic data from GEO, TCGA and ICGC which are associated with overall survival and event-free survival. A score generated based on the expression matrix of these genes was validated in two independent cohorts. We find that this “Pancreatic cancer prognostic score 20 –PPS20” is independent of the confounding factors in multivariate analyses, is dramatically elevated in metastatic tissue compared to primary tumor, and is higher in primary tumors compared to normal pancreatic tissue. Transcriptomic analyses show that tumors with low PPS20 have overall more immune cell infiltration and a higher CD8 T cell/Treg ratio when compared to those with high PPS20. Analyses of proteomic data from TCGA PAAD indicated higher levels of Cyclin B1, RAD51, EGFR and a lower E-cadherin/Fibronectin ratio in tumors with high PPS20. The PPS20 score defines not only prognostic and biological sub-groups but can predict response to targeted therapy as well. Overall, PPS20 is a stronger and more robust transcriptomic signature when compared to similar, previously published gene lists."
https://openalex.org/W3016458055,"On-demand cloud computing is one of the rapidly evolving technologies that is being widely used in the industries now. With the increase in IoT devices and real-time business analytics requirements, enterprises that ought to scale up and scale down their services have started coming towards on-demand cloud computing service providers. In a cloud data center, a high volume of continuous incoming task requests to physical hosts makes an imbalance in the cloud data center load. Most existing works balance the load by optimizing the algorithm in selecting the optimal host and achieves instantaneous load balancing but with execution inefficiency for tasks when carried out in the long run. Considering the long-term perspective of load balancing, the research paper proposes Stackelberg (leader-follower) game-theoretical model reinforced with the satisfaction factor for selecting the optimal physical host for deploying the tasks arriving at the data center in a balanced way. Stackelberg Game Theoretical Model for Load Balancing (SGMLB) algorithm deploys the tasks on the host in the data center by considering the utilization factor of every individual host, which helps in achieving high resource utilization on an average of 60%. Experimental results show that the Stackelberg equilibrium incorporated with a satisfaction index has been very useful in balancing the loading across the cluster by choosing the optimal hosts. The results show better execution efficiency in terms of the reduced number of task failures by 47%, decreased ‘makespan’ value by 17%, increased throughput by 6%, and a decreased front-end error rate as compared to the traditional random allocation algorithms and flow-shop scheduling algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W3016510556,"Background Web-based treatments and online self-management interventions extend the range of therapeutic supply. Since the number of online self-management interventions is steadily increasing, we aimed to examine, how web-based services currently influence mental health care, asking about previous internet use and future interests of patients with mental disorders. Methods We consulted patients (n = 400) from all services of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University of Leipzig using a 28-item questionnaire. Overall, 301 questionnaires could be used for analysis. The data were analysed by means of descriptive statistics and group comparisons. Results The majority of patients (98.3%) were using the internet. Data revealed younger patients were searching for information on diseases (p < .001; M = 35.7 ±13.2), psychiatrists (p < .001; M = 34.6 ±11.6) and exchange with other patients (p < .001; M = 32 ±10.6) more often than older patients. We also found the internet was consulted more often regarding the search for information (p = .011; M = 58.3 ±10.9) and psychiatrists (p < .001; M = 35.7 ±13.2) the lower the patients’ level of functioning was. While only a small proportion (10.1%) of the sample had used online self-management interventions before, there is a far greater number (46.1%) who stated an interest to use online self-management interventions in the future. This interest was greater in patients who were younger (p < .001; M = 33.8 ±13.2) had a higher education level (p = .003; university degree = 59.2%, high school degree = 52.3%; mandatory school degree: 34.8%). Conclusions While only a small percentage of patients uses online self-management interventions, there is a far greater interest to include them into the treatment. Further research has to investigate how the integration of web-based services into the whole treatment process can be optimized. In addition, standardized diagnostic methods have to be found to evaluate the needs and experiences of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3016843298,"Drug resistance is a primary obstacle in cancer treatment. In many patients who at first respond well to treatment, relapse occurs later on. Various mechanisms have been explored to explain drug resistance in specific cancers and for specific drugs. In this paper, we consider resistance to anti-PD-1, a drug that enhances the activity of anti-cancer T cells. Based on results in experimental melanoma, it is shown, by a mathematical model, that resistances to anti-PD-1 can be significantly reduced by combining it with anti-TNF-α. The model is used to simulate the efficacy of the combined therapy with different range of doses, different initial tumor volume, and different schedules. In particular, it is shown that under a course of treatment with 3-week cycles where each drug is injected in the first day of either week 1 or week 2, injecting anti-TNF-α one week after anti-PD-1 is the most effective schedule in reducing tumor volume."
https://openalex.org/W3017179613,"Universities undertake the majority of publicly funded research in Germany and hence bear a responsibility to contribute to global health efforts. So far, involvement and impact of German medical faculties in global health are unknown. Our aim was to systematically asses and evaluate German medical faculties' contribution to global health related research and education, as well as their policies and practices concerning open access publishing and equitable licensing.We assessed the involvement in global health of all 36 publicly funded medical faculties in Germany during 2010-2014 in three areas: innovation, access and education, using the following indicators: research funding and publications focused on global health or poverty-related and neglected diseases; open access publishing and policies promoting access to medical innovations worldwide; provision of global health education. Data were gathered from public databases, university websites and questionnaires sent to individual universities for validation and triangulation.There was a high level of variability between institutions and indicators. The proportion of research funding for poverty-related and neglected diseases research ranged between 0.0-1.1%. The top five institutions received nearly 85% of the total poverty-related and neglected diseases research funding. 20 of 36 universities had an institutional open access publishing policy, 19 had an open access publishing fund, 16 had neither. Only one university reported having used an equitable licensing policy. 22 of 36 faculties provided some global health education, but only one of them included global health in their core undergraduate medical curriculum as a compulsory course with more than just single lectures.Obtained data indicate that global health and poverty-related and neglected diseases research at German medical faculties is highly concentrated in a few institutions, open-access publishing and equitable licensing policies are mostly absent, and only little global health education exists. Universities and government should address global health strategically in both research and education at medical faculties to reflect the country's economic and political weight and human resource potential."
https://openalex.org/W3017257572,"One of the core objectives of many animal-welfare organisations is to achieve improvements in animal welfare through school education programmes. However, whilst many charities and organisations develop and deliver these educational activities, impact relating to specific animal welfare attitudes and behaviours remains largely undescribed. This study evaluated the effects of an hour-long dog welfare workshop delivered to children aged 7-11, evaluating 2732 learners in state primary schools across the UK. Two types of workshop were evaluated; ""Be Dog Smart"" (BDS) and ""Responsible Dog Ownership"" (RDO). This study assessed short-term impact on attitude outcomes, as a first step in developing a full education monitoring and evaluation framework. Learners within each class were randomly assigned to two groups; one completing an attitude-based questionnaire before (control) and the other after the workshop (treatment). Dog ownership status, age, gender, and social deprivation (measured as access to free school meals) were collected for all participants. Questionnaire scores were compared between treatment and control groups. Mean scores were significantly different (BDS p<0.001; Cohen's D 0.65; RDO p<0.001; Cohen's D 0.51) between control (BDS 13.57 ± 3.15; RDO 22.97 ± 4.78) and treatment groups (BDS 15.61 ± 3.10; RDO 25.47 ± 5.06) for both workshops, suggesting workshops effectively convey key messages and improve learner attitudes concerning dogs. Gender, age and social deprivation were found to significantly influence questionnaire responses. These findings contribute to a broader effort to improve canine welfare via childhood education while also demonstrating the feasibility of effective monitoring and evaluation during operational delivery of a schools workshop programme. Ongoing impact assessment is important in ensuring successful development, delivery and refinement of educational programmes to maximise the probabilty of positive changes in participants. Further work is needed to evaluate longer term impact, and ensure that desired influences on human behaviour change, and animal welfare, are achieved."

https://openalex.org/W3017063712,"Cognitive impairment is prevalent but still poorly diagnosed in hemodialysis adults, mainly because of the impracticality of current tools. This study examined whether remotely monitoring mobility performance can help identifying digital measures of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. Sixty-nine diabetes mellitus hemodialysis patients (age = 64.1±8.1years, body mass index = 31.7±7.6kg/m2) were recruited. According to the Mini-Mental State Exam, 44 (64%) were determined as cognitive-intact, and 25 (36%) as cognitive-impaired. Mobility performance, including cumulated posture duration (sitting, lying, standing, and walking), daily walking performance (step and unbroken walking bout), as well as postural-transition (daily number and average duration), were measured using a validated pendant-sensor for a continuous period of 24-hour during a non-dialysis day. Motor capacity was quantified by assessing standing balance and gait performance under single-task and dual-task conditions. No between-group difference was observed for the motor capacity. However, the mobility performance was different between groups. The cognitive-impaired group spent significantly higher percentage of time in sitting and lying (Cohens effect size d = 0.78, p = 0.005) but took significantly less daily steps (d = 0.69, p = 0.015) than the cognitive-intact group. The largest effect of reduction in number of postural-transition was observed in walk-to-sit transition (d = 0.65, p = 0.020). Regression models based on demographics, addition of daily walking performance, and addition of other mobility performance metrics, led to area-under-curves of 0.76, 0.78, and 0.93, respectively, for discriminating cognitive-impaired cases. This study suggests that mobility performance metrics could be served as potential digital biomarkers of cognitive impairment among hemodialysis patients. It also highlights the additional value of measuring cumulated posture duration and postural-transition to improve the detection of cognitive impairment. Future studies need to examine potential benefits of mobility performance metrics for early diagnosis of cognitive impairment/dementia and timely intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3017090520,"Potato is a plant with high water requirements. This factor affects not only the weight of potato tubers but also their quality parameters. In order to achieve quantity and quality goal, it is helpful if we apply the principles of precision agriculture, which also contributes to sustainable management of environmental resources. Accurate identification of the water requirements of crops is the basis for determining optimal irrigation doses and dates. After their application, it is possible to assess the effectiveness of irrigation treatments and their impact on the air-water conditions in soil with a root system. The aim of the presented study was to analyse the influence of volumetric soil moisture diversity on the vegetation of early potato varieties. Two potato varieties were subject to investigation: Denar and Julinka. Pot experiments were carried out at the Department of Horticulture of Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences. Three variants were analysed: one with a low water content in the soil (pF 2.7), one with the optimal water content (pF 2.5) and one with a high water content (pF 2.2). The basis for the selection of the frequency and application rate of water doses was soil moisture measured with an SM150-Kit set. Volumetric moisture was measured with a TDR apparatus. It was found that the water requirements of both potato varieties differ and increase along with the development of the aboveground and underground parts. Moreover, it was shown that the irrigation requirements of cv. Julinka are higher than those of Denar (31.4–33.0% higher), depending on the adopted variant. The research also showed that the most effective method of potato cultivation is to maintain soil moisture at a lower level. This should be taken into account in regions where the cultivation of this species uses supplementation of the water requirements by irrigation."
https://openalex.org/W3017305860,"Background Malaria data reported through Mozambique’s routine health information system are used to guide the implementation of prevention and control activities. Although previous studies have identified issues with the quality of aggregated data reported from public health facilities in the country, no studies have evaluated the quality of routine indicators recorded in health facility registries. This study addresses this issue by comparing indicators calculated from data from exit interviews and re-examinations of patients with data based on registry records from health facilities in order to measure the quality of registry data and data reporting in three provinces in Mozambique. Methods Data were collected from 1,840 outpatients from 117 health facilities in Maputo, Zambézia, and Cabo Delgado Provinces interviewed and examined as part of a malaria-specific health facility survey. Key indicators based on exit interview / re-examination data were compared to the same indicators based on records from health facility registries. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with indicators matching in re-examination / exit interview data and health facility registries. Aggregated indicators abstracted from facility registries were compared to those reported through the routine health management information system (HMIS) for the same time period. Results Sensitivity of exit interview / re-examination data compared with those recorded in facility registries was low for all indicators in all facilities. The lowest sensitivities were in Maputo, where the sensitivity for recording negative RDT results was 9.7%. The highest sensitivity was for recording positive RDT results in Cabo Delgado, at 75%. Multivariable analysis of factors associated with agreement between gold standard and registry data showed patients were less likely to be asked about having a fever in the triage ward in Maputo and Cabo Delgado (adjusted Odds Ratio 0.75 and 0.39 respectively), and in the outpatient ward in Cabo Delgado (aOR = 0.37), compared with the emergency department. Patients with positive RDT were also more likely to have RDT results recorded in all three provinces when patients had been managed according to national treatment guidelines during initial examination. Comparison of retrospective data abstracted from facility registries to HMIS data showed discrepancies in all three provinces. The proportion of outpatient cases with suspected and confirmed malaria were similar in registry and HMIS data across all provinces (a relatively low difference between registry and HMIS data of 3% in Maputo and Zambézia), though the total number of all-cause outpatient cases was consistently higher in the HMIS. The largest difference was in Maputo, where a total of 87,992 all-cause outpatient cases were reported in HMIS, compared with a total of 42,431 abstracted from facility registries. Conclusion This study shows that care should be taken in interpreting trends based solely on routine data due to data quality issues, though the discrepancy in all-cause outpatient cases may be indicative that register availability and storage are important factors. As such, simple steps such as providing consistent access and storage of registers that include reporting of patient fever symptoms might improve the quality of routine data recorded at health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3016399476,"Islet transplantation in man is limited by multiple factors including islet availability, islet cell damage caused by collagenase during isolation, maintenance of islet function between isolation and transplantation, and allograft rejection. In this study, we describe a new approach for preparing islets that enhances islet function in vitro and reduces immunogenicity. The approach involves culture on native decellularized 3D bone marrow-derived extracellular matrix (3D-ECM), which contains many of the matrix components present in pancreas, prior to islet transplantation. Compared to islets cultured on tissue culture plastic (TCP), islets cultured on 3D-ECM exhibited greater attachment, higher survival rate, increased insulin content, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, culture of islets on 3D-ECM promoted recovery of vascular endothelial cells within the islets and restored basement membrane-related proteins (eg, fibronectin and collagen type VI). More interestingly, culture on 3D-ECM also selectively decontaminated islets of “passenger” cells (co-isolated with the islets) and restored basement membrane-associated type VI collagen, which were associated with an attenuation in islet immunogenicity. These results demonstrate that this novel approach has promise for overcoming two major issues in human islet transplantation: (a) poor yield of islets from donated pancreas tissue and (b) the need for life-long immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W3016604720,"Background Serum albumin level improves in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) with antiviral therapy. However, it remains controversial whether liver volume increases along with SVR. Methods Patients with chronic HCV infection with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who achieved SVR with anti-HCV treatment from March 2003 to November 2017 were enrolled. Patients were followed up with periodic computed tomography (CT) scans to detect HCC recurrence. Patients who underwent treatment for HCC recurrence within 1 year after initiation of anti-HCV treatment were excluded. Laboratory data, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, serum albumin level, and platelet count, were collected at baseline and timepoints after treatment initiation. Liver volume was evaluated at baseline and 24 and 48 weeks after treatment initiation using a CT volume analyzer. A linear mixed-effects model was applied to analyze the chronologic change in liver volume. The correlations between changes in ALT level, albumin level, and liver volume were also evaluated. Results Of 108 enrolled patients, 78 had cirrhosis. Serum albumin level continued to increase through 48 weeks after treatment initiation. A significant increase in liver volume was observed only in patients without cirrhosis (P = 0.005). There was a significant correlation between ALT level decrease and albumin level increase (P = 0.018). Conclusions Improved liver albumin production with SVR was contributed by improved liver cell function rather than increased liver volume in patients with cirrhosis."

Results We found that there is no significant difference in the pregnancy outcome for NLR (OR:0.92, CI95%:0.72, 1.17) and PLR (OR:1.00, CI%:0.99, 1.01). However, a difference had a statistical significance in the pregnancy outcome when LMR less than 2.19 (OR:0.39, CI95%:0.19,0.82). Conclusions This study suggested that higher LMR was related to the lower risk of miscarriage in the women with early threatened abortion in a way."
https://openalex.org/W3017296512,"Background Prior research has shown that individuals with experience of out-of-home care (foster family care or residential care) in childhood are educationally disadvantaged compared to their peers. In order to be better equipped to design interventions aimed at improving the educational outcomes of children for whom society has assumed responsibility, this study seeks to further our understanding about which factors that contribute to the educational disparities throughout the life course. Methods Using longitudinal data from a cohort of more than 13,000 Swedes, of which around 7% have childhood experience of out-of-home care, Peters-Belson decomposition is utilized to quantify the extent to which the gap in educational achievement in school (age 16) and midlife educational attainment (age 50) captures differences in the prevalence of factors influencing educational outcomes, and differences in the impacts between these factors. Results We find that the achievement and the attainment gap was around 13% and 9% respectively. These gaps were to a large extent explained by differences in the distribution of predictors. The major explanatory factor for placed children’s lower achievement was a lower average cognitive ability. Yet there were some evidence that the rewards of cognitive ability in these children differed across the life course. While the lower returns of cognitive ability suggest that they were underperforming in compulsory school, the higher returns of cognitive ability on midlife attainment indicate that–given previous underperformance–their attainment at age 50 reflects their cognitive capacity more accurately than their achievement at age 16 do. Conclusion The large influence of the unequal distribution of predictors suggests that policy efforts are needed to promote equity in the distribution of factors contributing to educational achievement and attainment. Since cognitive ability was found to be an important contributory factor, such efforts may include promoting cognitive and intellectual development among children in out-of-home care, preferably starting at a young age."

Prior work revealed the classical mono-exponential model fails to precisely depict decay in DW signal at high b-values. In this study, we aim to investigate signal decay behaviors at ultra-high b-values for non-invasive assessment of spinal cord alterations in the transgenic SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. A multiexponential diffusion analysis using regularized non-negative least squares (rNNLS) algorithm was applied to a series of thirty DW MR images with b-values ranging from 0 to 858,022 s/mm2 on ex vivo spinal cords of transgenic SOD1G93A and age-matched control mice. We compared the distributions of measured diffusion coefficient fractions between the groups. The measured diffusion weighted signals in log-scale showed non-linear decay behaviors with increased b-values. Faster signal decays were observed with diffusion gradients applied parallel to the long axis of the spinal cord compared to when oriented in the transverse direction. Multiexponential analysis at the lumbar level in the spinal cord identified ten subintervals. A significant decrease of diffusion coefficient fractions was found in the ranges of [1.63×10-8,3.70×10-6] mm2/s (P = 0.0002) and of [6.01×10-6,4.20×10-5] mm2/s (P = 0.0388) in SOD1G93A mice. Anisotropic diffusion signals persisted at ultra-high b-value DWIs of the mouse spinal cord and multiexponential diffusion analysis offers the potential to evaluate microstructural alterations of ALS-affected spinal cord non-invasively."
https://openalex.org/W3016794473,"Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are prokaryotes that sense the geomagnetic field lines to geolocate and navigate in aquatic sediments. They are polyphyletically distributed in several bacterial divisions but are mainly represented in the Proteobacteria. In this phylum, magnetotactic Deltaproteobacteria represent the most ancestral class of MTB. Like all MTB, they synthesize membrane-enclosed magnetic nanoparticles, called magnetosomes, for magnetic sensing. Magnetosome biogenesis is a complex process involving a specific set of genes that are conserved across MTB. Two of the most conserved genes are mamB and mamM, that encode for the magnetosome-associated proteins and are homologous to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) protein family. In magnetotactic Alphaproteobacteria MTB species, MamB and MamM proteins have been well characterized and play a central role in iron-transport required for biomineralization. However, their structural conservation and their role in more ancestral groups of MTB like the Deltaproteobacteria have not been established. Here we studied magnetite cluster MamB and MamM cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD) structures from a phylogenetically distant magnetotactic Deltaproteobacteria species represented by BW-1 strain, which has the unique ability to biomineralize magnetite and greigite. We characterized them in solution, analyzed their crystal structures and compared them to those characterized in Alphaproteobacteria MTB species. We showed that despite the high phylogenetic distance, MamBBW-1 and MamMBW-1 CTDs share high structural similarity with known CDF-CTDs and will probably share a common function with the Alphaproteobacteria MamB and MamM."
https://openalex.org/W3016955222,"Michael S. Moore is among the most prominent normative theorists to argue that retributive justice, understood as the deserved suffering of offenders, justifies punishment. Moore claims that the principle of retributive justice is pervasively supported by our judgments of justice and sufficient to ground punishment. We offer an experimental assessment of these two claims, (1) the pervasiveness claim, according to which people are widely prone to endorse retributive judgments, and (2) the sufficiency claim, according to which no non-retributive principle is necessary for justifying punishment. We test these two claims in a survey and a related survey experiment in which we present participants (N = ~900) with the stylized description of a criminal case. Our results seem to invalidate claim (1) and provide mixed results concerning claim (2). We conclude that retributive justice theories which advance either of these two claims need to reassess their evidential support."
https://openalex.org/W3016360849,"Marine phytoplankton are responsible for approximately half of photosynthesis on Earth. However, their ability to drive ocean productivity depends on critical nutrients, especially bioavailable nitrogen (N) which is scarce over vast areas of the ocean. Phytoplankton differ in their preferences for N substrates as well as uptake efficiencies and minimal N requirements relative to other critical nutrients, including iron (Fe) and phosphorus. In this study, we used the MicroTOOLs high-resolution environmental microarray to examine transcriptomic responses of phytoplankton communities in the California Current System (CCS) transition zone to added urea, ammonium, nitrate, and also Fe in the late summer when N depletion is common. Transcript level changes of photosynthetic, carbon fixation, and nutrient stress genes indicated relief of N limitation in many strains of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and eukaryotic phytoplankton. The transcriptomic responses helped explain shifts in physiological and growth responses observed later. All three phytoplankton groups had increased transcript levels of photosynthesis and/or carbon fixation genes in response to all N substrates. However, only Prochlorococcus had decreased transcript levels of N stress genes and grew substantially, specifically after urea and ammonium additions, suggesting that Prochlorococcus outcompeted other community members in these treatments. Diatom transcript levels of carbon fixation genes increased in response to Fe but not to Fe with N which might have favored phytoplankton that were co-limited by N and Fe. Moreover, transcription patterns of closely related strains indicated variability in N utilization, including nitrate utilization by some high-light adapted Prochlorococcus. Finally, up-regulation of urea transporter genes by both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in response to filtered deep water suggested a regulatory mechanism other than classic control via the global N regulator NtcA. This study indicated that co-existing phytoplankton strains experience distinct nutrient stresses in the transition zone of the CCS, an understudied region where oligotrophic and coastal communities naturally mix."
https://openalex.org/W3016572324,"In general, requirements expressed in natural language are the first step in the software development process and are documented in the form of use cases. These requirements can be specified formally using some precise mathematical notation (e.g. Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), Computational Tree Logic (CTL) etc.) or using some modeling formalism (e.g. a Kripke structure). The rigor involved in writing formal requirements requires extra time and effort, which is not feasible in several software development scenarios. A number of existing approaches are able to transform informal software requirements to formal specifications. However, most of these approaches require additional skills like understanding of specification languages additional artifacts, or services of domain expert(s). Consequently, an automated approach is required to reduce the overhead of effort for converting informal requirements to formal specifications. This work introduces an approach that takes a use case model as input in the proposed template and produces a Kripke structure and LTL specifications as output. The proposed approach also considers the common use case relationships (i.e., include and extend). The generated Kripke structure model of the software allows analysis of software behavior early at the requirements specification stage which otherwise would not be possible before the design stage of the software development process. The generated LTL formal specifications can be used against a formal model like a Kripke structure generated during the software development process for verification purpose. We demonstrate the working of the proposed approach by a SIM vending machine example, where the use cases of this system are inputs in the proposed template and the corresponding Kripke structure and LTL formal specifications are produced as final output. Additionally, we use the NuSMV tool to verify the generated LTL specifications against the Kripke structure model of the software, which reports no counterexamples thus validating the proposed approach."
https://openalex.org/W3016630629,"It is a trope in psychological science to define the human species as inherently social. Yet, despite its key role in human behaviour, the mechanisms by which social bonding actually shapes social behaviour have not been fully characterized. Across six studies, we show that the motivation for social bonding does not indiscriminately increase individuals’ willingness to approach others but that it is instead associated with specific variations in social evaluations. Studies 1–4 demonstrate that social motivation is associated with a larger importance granted to cooperation-related impressions, i.e. perceived trustworthiness, during social evaluations. Studies 5 and 6 further reveal that this weighting difference leads strongly socially motivated participants to approach more partners that are perceived as both dominant and trustworthy. Taken together, our results provide support for the idea that humans’ social motivation is associated with specific social preferences that could favour successful cooperative interactions and a widening of people’s cooperative circle."
https://openalex.org/W3016827499,"Genetic factors are often overlooked in conservation planning, despite their importance in small isolated populations. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite markers to investigate population genetics of the adder (Vipera berus) in southern Britain, where numbers are declining. We found no evidence for loss of heterozygosity in any of the populations studied. Genetic diversity was comparable across sites, in line with published levels for mainland Europe. However, further analysis revealed a striking level of relatedness. Genetic networks constructed from inferred first degree relationships suggested a high proportion of individuals to be related at a level equivalent to that of half-siblings, with rare inferred full-sib dyads. These patterns of relatedness can be attributed to the high philopatry and low vagility of adders, which creates high local relatedness, in combination with the polyandrous breeding system in the adder, which may offset the risk of inbreeding in closed populations. We suggest that reliance on standard genetic indicators of inbreeding and diversity may underestimate demographic and genetic factors that make adder populations vulnerable to extirpation. We stress the importance of an integrated genetic and demographic approach in the conservation of adders, and other taxa of similar ecology."

https://openalex.org/W3016920826,"Acute transfusion reactions can manifest in many forms including acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, allergic reaction and transfusion-related acute lung injury. We previously developed an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction rat model mediated by transfusion of incompatible human erythrocytes against which rats have preexisting antibodies resulting in classical complement pathway mediated intravascular hemolysis. In this study, the acute hemolytic transfusion reaction model was adapted to yield an acute lung injury phenotype. Adolescent male Wistar rats were primed in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide followed by transfusion of incompatible erythrocytes. Blood was collected at various time points during the course of the experiment to determine complement C5a levels and free DNA in isolated plasma. At 4 hours, blood and lung tissue were recovered and assayed for complete blood count and histological acute lung injury, respectively. Compared to sham animals or animals receiving increasing amounts of incompatible erythrocytes (equivalent to a 15-45% transfusion) in the absence of lipopolysaccharide, lungs of animals receiving lipopolysaccharide and a 30% erythrocyte transfusion showed dramatic alveolar wall thickening due to neutrophil infiltration. C5a levels were significantly elevated in these animals indicating that complement activation contributes to lung damage. Additionally, these animals demonstrated a significant increase of free DNA in the blood over time suggestive of neutrophil extracellular trap formation previously associated with transfusion-related acute lung injury in humans and mice. This novel 'two-hit' model utilizing incompatible erythrocyte transfusion in the presence of lipopolysaccharide yields a robust acute lung injury phenotype."
