https://openalex.org/W2126902408,"In the coming years, continued population growth, rising incomes, increasing meat and dairy consumption and expanding biofuel use will place unprecedented demands on the world's agriculture and natural resources. Can we meet society's growing food needs while reducing agriculture's environmental harm? Here, an international team of environmental and agricultural scientists uses new geospatial data and models to identify four strategies that could double food production while reducing environmental impacts. First, halt agricultural expansion. Second, close 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands. Third, increase cropping efficiency. And finally, we need to change our diets and shift crop production away from livestock feed, bioenergy crops and other non-food applications. Increasing population and consumption are placing unprecedented demands on agriculture and natural resources. Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world’s future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture’s environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing ‘yield gaps’ on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W1984582197,"Before human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be used to treat genetically inherited human disease, it will be necessary to develop methods of correcting disease-causing mutations that are compatible with clinical applications, combining efficiency with efficacy and leaving no residual sequences in the targeted genome. Yusa et al. present a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating the complete genetic correction of a disease-causing mutation in patient-specific iPS cells. They use zinc finger nucleases and piggyBac technology to correction a point mutation in the α1-antitrypsin gene, which is responsible for α1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD). The corrected iPS cells could efficiently differentiate to form hepatocyte-like cells and engraft into an animal model for liver injury without tumour formation. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a unique opportunity for regenerative medicine because they offer the prospect of generating unlimited quantities of cells for autologous transplantation, with potential application in treatments for a broad range of disorders1,2,3,4. However, the use of human iPSCs in the context of genetically inherited human disease will require the correction of disease-causing mutations in a manner that is fully compatible with clinical applications3,5. The methods currently available, such as homologous recombination, lack the necessary efficiency and also leave residual sequences in the targeted genome6. Therefore, the development of new approaches to edit the mammalian genome is a prerequisite to delivering the clinical promise of human iPSCs. Here we show that a combination of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)7 and piggyBac8,9 technology in human iPSCs can achieve biallelic correction of a point mutation (Glu342Lys) in the α1-antitrypsin (A1AT, also known as SERPINA1) gene that is responsible for α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Genetic correction of human iPSCs restored the structure and function of A1AT in subsequently derived liver cells in vitro and in vivo. This approach is significantly more efficient than any other gene-targeting technology that is currently available and crucially prevents contamination of the host genome with residual non-human sequences. Our results provide the first proof of principle, to our knowledge, for the potential of combining human iPSCs with genetic correction to generate clinically relevant cells for autologous cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2026944808,"The mouse-sized naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a very unusual mammal. It is a social animal, living in groups in burrows beneath arid African deserts. It can live for 30 or more years in atmospheres with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide, and is remarkably resistant to cancer. So the genome sequence, published in this issue, might be expected to contain some intriguing characteristics. Analysis of the genome and its transcriptome reveals unusual genomic features and molecular adaptations including strategies for improved genome stability, low mutation rate and improved protein maintenance. The data also reveal molecular adaptations consistent with poor visual function, poikilothermy, hairlessness, circadian rhythms, taste sensing and insensitivity to low oxygen. The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a strictly subterranean, extraordinarily long-lived eusocial mammal1. Although it is the size of a mouse, its maximum lifespan exceeds 30 years, making this animal the longest-living rodent. Naked mole rats show negligible senescence, no age-related increase in mortality, and high fecundity until death2. In addition to delayed ageing, they are resistant to both spontaneous cancer and experimentally induced tumorigenesis3,4. Naked mole rats pose a challenge to the theories that link ageing, cancer and redox homeostasis. Although characterized by significant oxidative stress5, the naked mole rat proteome does not show age-related susceptibility to oxidative damage or increased ubiquitination6. Naked mole rats naturally reside in large colonies with a single breeding female, the ‘queen’, who suppresses the sexual maturity of her subordinates7. They also live in full darkness, at low oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations8, and are unable to sustain thermogenesis9 nor feel certain types of pain10,11. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the naked mole rat genome, which reveals unique genome features and molecular adaptations consistent with cancer resistance, poikilothermy, hairlessness and insensitivity to low oxygen, and altered visual function, circadian rythms and taste sensing. This information provides insights into the naked mole rat’s exceptional longevity and ability to live in hostile conditions, in the dark and at low oxygen. The extreme traits of the naked mole rat, together with the reported genome and transcriptome information, offer opportunities for understanding ageing and advancing other areas of biological and biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2028910660,"Sclerostin is a product of mature osteocytes embedded in mineralised bone and is a negative regulator of bone mass and osteoblast differentiation. While evidence suggests that sclerostin has an anti-anabolic role, the possibility also exists that sclerostin has catabolic activity. To test this we treated human primary pre-osteocyte cultures, cells we have found are exquisitely sensitive to sclerostin, or mouse osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells, with recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) and measured effects on pro-catabolic gene expression. Sclerostin dose-dependently up-regulated the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) mRNA and down-regulated that of osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA, causing an increase in the RANK:OPG mRNA ratio. To examine the effects of rhSCL on resulting osteoclastic activity, MLO-Y4 cells plated onto a bone-like substrate were primed with rhSCL for 3 days and then either mouse splenocytes or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were added. This resulted in cultures with elevated osteoclastic resorption (approximately 7-fold) compared to untreated co-cultures. The increased resorption was abolished by co-addition of recombinant OPG. In co-cultures of MLO-Y4 cells with PBMC, SCL also increased the number and size of the TRAP-positive multinucleated cells formed. Importantly, rhSCL had no effect on TRAP-positive cell formation from monocultures of either splenocytes or PBMC. Further, rhSCL did not induce apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells, as determined by caspase activity assays, demonstrating that the osteoclastic response was not driven by dying osteocytes. Together, these results suggest that sclerostin may have a catabolic action through promotion of osteoclast formation and activity by osteocytes, in a RANKL-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2034222413,"Hybrid quantum devices, in which a superconducting qubit is coupled to a dedicated quantum memory based on natural atomic or molecular ensembles, are promising for quantum information processing. However, it has not been clear whether the required strength of coherent quantum coupling could be achieved. Zhu et al. improve the prospects of such technology, demonstrating coherent strong coupling and exchange of a quantum of energy between a superconducting flux qubit and an ensemble of electron spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond. During the past decade, research into superconducting quantum bits (qubits) based on Josephson junctions has made rapid progress1. Many foundational experiments have been performed2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and superconducting qubits are now considered one of the most promising systems for quantum information processing. However, the experimentally reported coherence times are likely to be insufficient for future large-scale quantum computation. A natural solution to this problem is a dedicated engineered quantum memory based on atomic and molecular systems. The question of whether coherent quantum coupling is possible between such natural systems and a single macroscopic artificial atom has attracted considerable attention9,10,11,12 since the first demonstration of macroscopic quantum coherence in Josephson junction circuits2. Here we report evidence of coherent strong coupling between a single macroscopic superconducting artificial atom (a flux qubit) and an ensemble of electron spins in the form of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond. Furthermore, we have observed coherent exchange of a single quantum of energy between a flux qubit and a macroscopic ensemble consisting of about 3 × 107 such colour centres. This provides a foundation for future quantum memories and hybrid devices coupling microwave and optical systems."
https://openalex.org/W2060772907,"Once thought to be a part of the ‘dark matter’ of the genome, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as an integral functional component of the mammalian transcriptome. LncRNAs are a novel class of mRNA-like transcripts which, despite no known protein-coding potential, demonstrate a wide range of structural and functional roles in cellular biology. However, the magnitude of the contribution of lncRNA expression to normal human tissues and cancers has not been investigated in a comprehensive manner. In this study, we compiled 272 human serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries to delineate lncRNA transcription patterns across a broad spectrum of normal human tissues and cancers. Using a novel lncRNA discovery pipeline we parsed over 24 million SAGE tags and report lncRNA expression profiles across a panel of 26 different normal human tissues and 19 human cancers. Our findings show extensive, tissue-specific lncRNA expression in normal tissues and highly aberrant lncRNA expression in human cancers. Here, we present a first generation atlas for lncRNA profiling in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2061620419,"Determining the signalling pathways that direct tissue expansion is a principal goal of regenerative biology. Vigorous pancreatic β-cell replication in juvenile mice and humans declines with age, and elucidating the basis for this decay may reveal strategies for inducing β-cell expansion, a long-sought goal for diabetes therapy. Here we show that platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Pdgfr) signalling controls age-dependent β-cell proliferation in mouse and human pancreatic islets. With age, declining β-cell Pdgfr levels were accompanied by reductions in β-cell enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (Ezh2) levels and β-cell replication. Conditional inactivation of the Pdgfra gene in β-cells accelerated these changes, preventing mouse neonatal β-cell expansion and adult β-cell regeneration. Targeted human PDGFR-α activation in mouse β-cells stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation, leading to Ezh2-dependent expansion of adult β-cells. Adult human islets lack PDGF signalling competence, but exposure of juvenile human islets to PDGF-AA stimulated β-cell proliferation. The discovery of a conserved pathway controlling age-dependent β-cell proliferation indicates new strategies for β-cell expansion. Pancreatic β-cell expansion declines with age, and the identification of the mechanism involved could help with the design of treatments for diabetes mellitus. Chen et al. show, surprisingly, that reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signalling underlies this problem in mouse and human pancreatic islets. Declining β-cell PDGFR expression reduces levels of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), and impedes replication of the β cells."

https://openalex.org/W2083474696,"Multisite phosphorylation of proteins has been proposed to transform a graded protein kinase signal into an ultrasensitive switch-like response. Although many multiphosphorylated targets have been identified, the dynamics and sequence of individual phosphorylation events within the multisite phosphorylation process have never been thoroughly studied. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of S phase is thought to be governed by complexes of Cdk1 and Cln cyclins that phosphorylate six or more sites on the Clb5-Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1, directing it to SCF-mediated destruction. The resulting Sic1-free Clb5-Cdk1 complex triggers S phase. Here, we demonstrate that Sic1 destruction depends on a more complex process in which both Cln2-Cdk1 and Clb5-Cdk1 act in processive multiphosphorylation cascades leading to the phosphorylation of a small number of specific phosphodegrons. The routes of these phosphorylation cascades are shaped by precisely oriented docking interactions mediated by cyclin-specific docking motifs in Sic1 and by Cks1, the phospho-adaptor subunit of Cdk1. Our results indicate that Clb5-Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation generates positive feedback that is required for switch-like Sic1 destruction. Our evidence for a docking network within clusters of phosphorylation sites uncovers a new level of complexity in Cdk1-dependent regulation of cell cycle transitions, and has general implications for the regulation of cellular processes by multisite phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2065292811,"Single photons are excellent quantum information carriers, but current schemes for preparing, processing and measuring them are inefficient. This paper introduces a process termed coherent photon conversion that could provide a new way to generate and process complex multiquanta states for photonic quantum information applications. The new scheme is not restricted to optical systems, and could also function in optomechanical, electromechanical and superconducting systems that exhibit even stronger intrinsic nonlinearities. Single photons are excellent quantum information carriers: they were used in the earliest demonstrations of entanglement1 and in the production of the highest-quality entanglement reported so far2,3. However, current schemes for preparing, processing and measuring them are inefficient. For example, down-conversion provides heralded, but randomly timed, single photons4, and linear optics gates are inherently probabilistic5. Here we introduce a deterministic process—coherent photon conversion (CPC)—that provides a new way to generate and process complex, multiquanta states for photonic quantum information applications. The technique uses classically pumped nonlinearities to induce coherent oscillations between orthogonal states of multiple quantum excitations. One example of CPC, based on a pumped four-wave-mixing interaction, is shown to yield a single, versatile process that provides a full set of photonic quantum processing tools. This set satisfies the DiVincenzo criteria for a scalable quantum computing architecture6, including deterministic multiqubit entanglement gates (based on a novel form of photon–photon interaction), high-quality heralded single- and multiphoton states free from higher-order imperfections, and robust, high-efficiency detection. It can also be used to produce heralded multiphoton entanglement, create optically switchable quantum circuits and implement an improved form of down-conversion with reduced higher-order effects. Such tools are valuable building blocks for many quantum-enabled technologies. Finally, using photonic crystal fibres we experimentally demonstrate quantum correlations arising from a four-colour nonlinear process suitable for CPC and use these measurements to study the feasibility of reaching the deterministic regime with current technology4,7. Our scheme, which is based on interacting bosonic fields, is not restricted to optical systems but could also be implemented in optomechanical, electromechanical and superconducting systems8,9,10,11,12 with extremely strong intrinsic nonlinearities. Furthermore, exploiting higher-order nonlinearities with multiple pump fields yields a mechanism for multiparty mediation of the complex, coherent dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2079983821,"DNA molecules provide what is probably the most iconic example of self-replication--the ability of a system to replicate, or make copies of, itself. In living cells the process is mediated by enzymes and occurs autonomously, with the number of replicas increasing exponentially over time without the need for external manipulation. Self-replication has also been implemented with synthetic systems, including RNA enzymes designed to undergo self-sustained exponential amplification. An exciting next step would be to use self-replication in materials fabrication, which requires robust and general systems capable of copying and amplifying functional materials or structures. Here we report a first development in this direction, using DNA tile motifs that can recognize and bind complementary tiles in a pre-programmed fashion. We first design tile motifs so they form a seven-tile seed sequence; then use the seeds to instruct the formation of a first generation of complementary seven-tile daughter sequences; and finally use the daughters to instruct the formation of seven-tile granddaughter sequences that are identical to the initial seed sequences. Considering that DNA is a functional material that can organize itself and other molecules into useful structures, our findings raise the tantalizing prospect that we may one day be able to realize self-replicating materials with various patterns or useful functions."
https://openalex.org/W2058339004,"Glucocorticoid receptor-α (GRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) regulate adipogenesis by controlling the balance between lipolysis and lipogenesis. Here, we show that protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), a nuclear receptor co-chaperone, reciprocally modulates the lipometabolic activities of GRα and PPARγ. Wild-type and PP5-deficient (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were used to show binding of PP5 to both GRα and PPARγ. In response to adipogenic stimuli, PP5-KO mouse embryonic fibroblast cells showed almost no lipid accumulation with reduced expression of adipogenic markers (aP2, CD36, and perilipin) and low fatty-acid synthase enzymatic activity. This was completely reversed following reintroduction of PP5. Loss of PP5 increased phosphorylation of GRα at serines 212 and 234 and elevated dexamethasone-induced activity at prolipolytic genes. In contrast, PPARγ in PP5-KO cells was hyperphosphorylated at serine 112 but had reduced rosiglitazone-induced activity at lipogenic genes. Expression of the S112A mutant rescued PPARγ transcriptional activity and lipid accumulation in PP5-KO cells pointing to Ser-112 as an important residue of PP5 action. This work identifies PP5 as a fulcrum point in nuclear receptor control of the lipolysis/lipogenesis equilibrium and as a potential target in the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1970660523,"A distinctively uneven profile of intelligence is a feature of the autistic spectrum. Within the spectrum, Asperger individuals differ from autistics in their early speech development and in being less likely to be characterized by visuospatial peaks. While different specific strengths characterize different autistic spectrum subgroups, all such peaks of ability have been interpreted as deficits: isolated, aberrant, and irreconcilable with real human intelligence. This view has recently been challenged by findings of autistic strengths in performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), an important marker of general and fluid intelligence. We investigated whether these findings extend to Asperger syndrome, an autistic spectrum subgroup characterized by verbal peaks of ability, and whether the cognitive mechanisms underlying autistic and Asperger RPM performance differ. Thirty-two Asperger adults displayed a significant advantage on RPM over Wechsler Full-Scale and Performance scores relative to their typical controls, while in 25 Asperger children an RPM advantage was found over Wechsler Performance scores only. As previously found with autistics, Asperger children and adults achieved RPM scores at a level reflecting their Wechsler peaks of ability. Therefore, strengths in RPM performance span the autistic spectrum and imply a common mechanism advantageously applied to different facets of cognition. Autistic spectrum intelligence is atypical, but also genuine, general, and underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2072746903,"We previously described fusion-inhibitory peptides that are targeted to the cell membrane by cholesterol conjugation and potently inhibit enveloped viruses that fuse at the cell surface, including HIV, parainfluenza, and henipaviruses.

We propose that for these viruses, too, membrane targeting via cholesterol conjugation may yield potent compounds. Here we compare the activity of fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and show that although the unconjugated peptides are inactive, the cholesterol-conjugated compounds are effective inhibitors of infectivity and membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the cholesterol moiety, by localizing the peptides to the target cell membrane, allows the peptides to follow the virus to the intracellular site of fusion.

The impact of influenza infection is felt each year when approximately 20% of the population of the world falls ill. In the United States, influenza infections occur in epidemics each winter. Although vaccination is the primary strategy for influenza prevention, there are a number of likely scenarios for which vaccination is inadequate, and effective antiviral agents would be of utmost importance (1Moscona A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2008; 59: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). During any influenza season, antigenic drift in the virus may occur after formulation of the vaccine of the year has taken place, rendering the vaccine less protective so that outbreaks can occur more easily. Vaccine production by current methods cannot be carried out with the speed required to halt the progress of a new strain of influenza virus. Antiviral agents form an important part of the approach to epidemic and pandemic influenza (2Moscona A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Although two classes of anti-influenza compounds are available, the neuraminidase inhibitor class of compounds are currently the only option in most clinical settings because of the high level of resistance to the amantadine class of antivirals (2Moscona A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). As predicted by molecular studies, however, resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors is now emerging rapidly (3Moscona A. N. Engl. J.

Peptides that correspond to a number of viral fusion proteins can bind to conformational intermediates during viral entry and inhibit infection. For HIV, one such clinically effective peptide is enfuvirtide. Enfuvirtide is derived from the C-terminal region of HIV gp41. It binds in trans to the prehairpin (extended) intermediate state in which the N-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 has inserted into the target host membrane, whereas the C-terminal transmembrane domain of gp41 remains anchored in the viral envelope. Enfuvirtide binding inhibits the conversion of gp41 from the prehairpin to the post-fusion, hairpin (folded) state where the two membranes would be drawn together. For several other viruses that utilize class I fusion proteins, this approach has been hindered by the relatively low potency and short half-life in vivo of the corresponding peptides. Recently, we showed that cholesterol-conjugated, membrane-targeted peptides derived from the fusion protein of enveloped viruses are potent inhibitors of infection and also gain improved pharmacokinetic properties. In particular, we showed that a cholesterol-conjugated inhibitor of HIV is 50–400-fold (depending on the viral strain) more potent than enfuvirtide (4Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Ladwa N.A. Wang Y.J.

We have suggested previously that cholesterol conjugation of antiviral peptides could also be useful for viruses that fuse in the endosomal compartment, including influenza virus, by endowing the inhibitory peptides with the ability to be trafficked, along with virus, to the intracellular sites of membrane fusion (8Porotto M.

Here we demonstrate that a cholesterol-conjugated peptide derived from the influenza virus HA, the receptor binding/fusion protein, inhibits influenza infection. This targeted peptide traps HA in a transient intermediate state, thus preventing the progression of fusion. Transfections were performed according to the Lipofectamine and Plus or the Lipofectamine 2000 manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). 293T (human kidney epithelial), Vero (African green monkey kidney cells) and CV1 cells were grown in DMEM (Mediatech, Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics in 5% CO2. The effect of peptides on H3N2 influenza (from ATCC, VR-544, lot 57899071) plaque number was assessed by a plaque reduction assay. Briefly, CV-1 cell monolayers were inoculated with 100–200 plaque-forming units of influenza H3N2 in the presence of various concentrations of peptides. After 120 min, 2× minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS was mixed with 1% methylcellulose and added to the dishes. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 days. After removing the medium overlay, the cells were stained for plaque detection. The number of plaques in the control (no peptide, HPIV3-derived peptides) and experimental wells were counted under a dissecting stereoscope. The IC50 (concentrations required for a 50% decrease in plaque number) were determined by plotting the percent of decrease in plaque number versus inhibitor concentration. We previously adapted a fusion assay on the basis of α complementation of β-gal (10Moosmann P. Rusconi S.

Receptor-bearing cells expressing the ω peptide of β-gal are mixed with 1918 HA-expressing cells that also express the α peptide of β-gal, in the presence of or absence of inhibitory peptide. Cell fusion leads to complementation. Fusion was stopped by lysing the cells and, after addition of the substrate, fusion was quantitated on a Spectramax M5 microplate reader. 0.5% RBCs in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen, catalog no. 18045) were labeled using VybrantTM DiO (Molecular Probes, catalog no. V22889) cell labeling solution at 37 °C for 30 min. The RBCs were washed and then resuspended to 2% final RBC concentration. 293T cells expressing 1918 HA were treated with cycloheximide and 40 milliunit neuraminidase for 1 h. They were then overlaid with DiO-labeled RBCs at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then washed with CO2-independent medium and treated with CO2-independent medium at pH 4.9 or 7.4 in the absence or presence of 50 mm of the indicated peptide. After 30 min at room temperature, pictures were taken using a fluorescent microscope. The VSV-ΔG-RFP is a recombinant VSV derived from the cDNA of VSV Indiana, in which the G gene is replaced with the Ds-Red (RFP) gene. Pseudotypes with 1918 HA were generated as described (12Takada A.

Junin envelope glycoprotein (GP-C) in pCAGGS was generously provided by Thomas Briese. All peptides were produced by standard Fmoc-solid phase methods. The cholesterol moiety was attached to the peptide via reaction with a bromoacetyl derivative of cholesterol, as described previously (4Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Ladwa N.A. Wang Y.J. Hrin R.

Gradient-purified X31 (H3N2) influenza A virus grown in embryonated eggs was purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Virus stocks were first centrifuged at 2,320 relative centrifugal force for 5 min to remove precipitates formed by egg proteins. Then the virion supernatant was concentrated to 5–6 mg/ml by centrifugation at 21,000 rcf and stored in 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.5) buffer. Labeling with the lipophilic dye DiD (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) was performed by adding 500 μl of approximately 1 mg/ml X31 virus-diluted solutions to 5 μl of DiD Vybrant solution (Invitrogen) followed by a 2-h incubation at 37 °C with gentle rocking. The dye-labeled virus was harvested by ultracentrifugation and again resuspended to 5–6 mg/ml X31 virus solution, then stored at 4 °C. Liposomes composed of either pure DOPC or DOPC and cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids) in 4:1 w/w ratios were performed as described previously with a few modifications (15Lee K.K. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1299-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The buffer used for resuspension of dried lipids was 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.5) containing 25 mm sulforhodamine B (SRB) fluorophore (Invitrogen). Resuspended lipid was subjected to five sequential freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen followed by 25 extrusions through polycarbonate filters with 200-nm pore size (Avanti Polar Lipids). The dye-encapsulating liposomes eluted as a single band from PD-10 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare) and were stored in the same pH 7.5 buffer used for virus storage. Prior to fluorescence experiments, the cholesterol-tagged P155–185-chol peptide was incubated with SRB-containing DOPC and DOPC:cholesterol liposomes at 1, 3, and 5 μm final concentrations for 30 min at 25 °C. In control experiments with P155–185 peptide lacking the cholesterol tag, an identical procedure was followed. DiD-labeled virus and inhibitor-decorated liposomes were mixed in a ratio of 1:10 with liposomes in excess. Parallel experiments in which the cholesterol-tagged inhibitor was incubated first with virus and then mixed with inhibitor-naïve liposomes were also carried out. To initiate the fusion reactions, the pH was dropped to 5.0 or 5.25 by the addition of aliquots of 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.0) buffer. Fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out in a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer using excitation/emission spectral pairs: λ excitation, 565 nm; λ emission, 585 nm (SRB) and λ excitation, 644 nm and λ emission, 665 nm (DiD) with 2.5 nm slit widths. The fluorescence cuvette was thermostated at 25 °C. In all experiments, the extent of liposome content leakage (SRB dequenching) and lipid mixing (DiD dequenching) was determined relative to the value of fully dequenched fluorescence exhibited following Triton X-100 solubilization of liposomes and virus (15Lee K.K. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1299-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cholesterol-tagged P155–185-chol inhibitor and DOPC or DOPC:cholesterol liposomes were first mixed together at 5 μm inhibitor concentration and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Approximately 10-fold greater concentrations of liposomes and virus were used compared with the conditions in the fluorescence experiments to produce a reasonable density of particles in the field of view. After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C and pH 5.0, 5.25, or 5.5, 3 μl of each sample was transferred onto glow-discharged, carbon-coated electron microscope grids and stained with either nano-W (methylaminetungstate, NanoProbes) or nano-van (methylaminevanadate, NanoProbes). Imaging was performed using an FEI Company Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV coupled to a Gatan Ultrascan 1000 charge-coupled device. 293T cell monolayers were transiently transfected with 1918 HA (tagged at the C terminus with a GFP-derived epitope) and incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The transfected cells were washed with Optimem and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in Optimem supplemented with 100 mg/ml cyclohexamide to prevent de novo protein synthesis (16Obrig T.G. Culp W.J. McKeehan W.L. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 40 milliunits of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (Sigma). The cells were treated with trypsin 5 mg/ml at 37 °C for 15 min and then incubated at room temperature in medium at the indicated pH with or without 50 mm of P155–185-chol-peptide. The cells were then lysed in DH buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml dodecyl maltoside, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). HA was immunoprecipitated with LC89 antibody (obtained from Judith M. White with permission from John J. Skehel) or with fusion peptide serum (from Judith M. White) (17Leikina E. Ramos C. Markovic I. Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a control, HA was also immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies conjugated to HRP. 293T cells were incubated in Optimem with the indicated concentration of peptide or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 48 h. 10% v/v Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was read at an excitation of 570 nm and emission of 590 nm using a microplate fluorescence reader (Spectramax M5). The 16 subtypes of influenza HA can be divided in two major groups: group 1 (with two clades including H3) and group 2 (with 3 clades including H1) (18Russell R.J. Kerry P.S. Stevens D.J. Steinhauer D.A. Martin S.R. Gamblin S.J. Skehel J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17736-17741Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On the basis of the post-fusion structure of the X-31 H3 HA ectodomain of the HA2 subunit of HA, EHA2 (19Chen J. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8967-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1QU1), we generated three peptides corresponding to residues 155–185, containing 31, 27, or 21 residues (Fig. 1, A and B). These peptides were synthesized either with or without a cholesterol moiety linked via a thioether bond to a cysteine residue added C-terminally to the peptide (“cholesterol-tagged”). The 155–185 domain of HA, which is immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain, was chosen for the inhibitory peptide because it packs against the inner coiled-coil of HA as identified in the post-fusion, low-pH structure of the protein (19Chen J. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8967-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20Chen J. Lee K.H. Steinhauer D.A. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). According to the commonly accepted model for viral fusion driven by class I proteins (21Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), formation of a complex between region 155–185 and the inner coiled-coil is central to the energetics of fusion (22Park H.E. Gruenke J.A. White J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Within this domain, residues 176–185 participate in the “N-cap” motif, which forms an extensive set of interactions that terminates the central coiled-coil and fixes the N- and C-terminal regions of the molecule together at one extreme end of the rod-like structure (19Chen J. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8967-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We compare inhibitors with or without this subdomain. Finally, residues 182–185, visible only in one of the monomers of the crystal structure, occupy a position between the end of the N-capped coiled-coil and transmembrane domain, similar to the role of the membrane proximal external region of HIV gp41 fusion protein (23Noah E. Biron Z. Naider F. Arshava B. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6782-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In HIV, this region rich in tryptophan and aromatic residues (24Salzwedel K. West J.T. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2469-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) interacts with the membrane and, in particular, with cholesterol (25Veiga A.S. Castanho M.A. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The role of the HIV membrane proximal external region in facilitating the generation of membrane curvature and increasing the stability of the post-fusion structure has been highlighted recently (26Buzon V. Natrajan G. Schibli D. Campelo F. Kozlov M.M. Weissenhorn W. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6e1000880Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For influenza HA, the presence of Trp-185 and Tyr-182 in this short stretch may suggest a similar role. If so, cholesterol conjugation may interfere with the natural function of this region and be detrimental to inhibitory activity, as we found for HIV (4Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Ladwa N.A. Wang Y.J. Hrin R. Veneziano M. Bonelli F. Ketas T.J. Moore J.P. Miller M.D. Pessi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We therefore compare cholesterol-tagged inhibitors with or without the 182–185 region. We hypothesized that, as for the parainfluenza virus (8Porotto M. Yokoyama C.C. Palermo L.M. Mungall B. Aljofan M. Cortese R. Pessi A. Moscona A. J. Virology. 2010; 84: 6760-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and HIV (4Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Ladwa N.A. Wang Y.J. Hrin R. Veneziano M. Bonelli F. Ketas T.J. Moore J.P. Miller M.D. Pessi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), cholesterol conjugation would result in trafficking of the inhibitor peptide to the membrane compartment where the fusion protein is activated. For influenza, this would be the membrane of the endosome, where acidification drives HA to its fusion-ready state. At this point, the fusion inhibitory peptides would prevent progression of virus-cell membrane fusion by blocking the key HA folding steps required for the membrane merger (15Lee K.K. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1299-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that the cholesterol-tagged peptides are effective inhibitors of infection with influenza A/H3N2 in cell culture. The longer peptide we designed (P155–185-chol) inhibits viral entry with an IC50 of 0.4 μm (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the C-terminal four residues resulted in an increase in IC50 to 2 μm, whereas truncation of residues 176–185, involved in the N-Cap motif in the HA2 hairpin structure, further reduces efficacy with IC50 > 10 μm (Fig. 1). The same peptides without a cholesterol tag did not significantly inhibit infection. Highly conserved sites on influenza virus HA proteins have been recently identified, and several groups have proposed that targeting these conserved sites may allow for broad-spectrum anti-influenza agents (28Harrison C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One target is a highly conserved helical region in the stem of HA, and broadly cross-subtype neutralizing antibodies binding to this region have been independently identified, which neutralize the virus by blocking the conformational rearrangements associated with HA-mediated membrane fusion (29Corti D. Voss J. Gamblin S.J. Codoni G. Macagno A. Jarrossay D. Vachieri S.G. Pinna D. Minola A. Vanzetta F. Silacci C. Fernandez-Rodriguez B.M. Agatic G. Bianchi S. Giacchetto-Sasselli I. Calder L.

We therefore asked whether our H3-derived fusion inhibitory peptides would likewise display cross-subtype neutralization or whether the inhibition would be restricted to homotypic HA. To this end, we tested the efficacy of our H3-derived peptide versus the H1 subtype 1918 HA. For these experiments, we adapted the pseudotyping strategy that we employ for highly pathogenic viruses (5Porotto M. Carta P. Deng Y. Kellogg G.E. Whitt M. Lu M. Mungall B.A. Moscona A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10567-10574Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Porotto M. Orefice G. Yokoyama C.C. Mungall B.A. Realubit R. Sganga M.L. Aljofan M. Whitt M. Glickman F. Moscona A. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 5148-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For the experiment in Fig. 2, HA was pseudotyped onto a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP) but lacks its attachment protein, G (33Schmidt A.G. Yang P.L. Harrison S.C. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 12549-12554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Porotto M. Orefice G. Yokoyama C.C. Mungall B.A. Realubit R. Sganga M.L. Aljofan M. Whitt M. Glickman F. Moscona A. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 5148-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The resulting pseudotyped virus bears the influenza HA. Supplemental Fig. 1A shows the hemagglutination titer of the H1 HA-pseudotyped virus. Infection of target 293T cells in 96-well plates by pseudotyped virus in the presence of various concentrations of P155–185-chol and P155–185, lacking the cholesterol anchor, was quantified by assessing the production of red fluorescence. The infected plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and the fluorescence in each well was measured. The cholesterol-conjugated peptide completely blocks H1 virus infection at a concentration of 20 μm, whereas the untagged peptide is only weakly active at the same concentration. To ensure that inhibition was specific to the HA-pseudotyped virus, we tested P155–185-chol on Junin GPC-pseudotyped virus (35Rojek J.M. Kunz S. Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and found no significant activity (supplemental Fig. 1B). As a control for the effect of cholesterol tagging, a previously described HIV-derived cholesterol-tagged peptide (4Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Ladwa N.A. Wang Y.J. Hrin R. Veneziano M. Bonelli F. Ketas T.J. Moore J.P. Miller M.D. Pessi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was also included in the experiment shown in Fig. 2. The HIV-derived cholesterol peptide has negligible activity at 20 μm and no inhibitory activity at 10 μm, at which concentration P155–185-chol peptide showed approximately 85% inhibition of viral entry. This minimal antiviral activity of the HIV-derived cholesterol-tagged peptide may be attributable to the toxic effect that this specific peptide exhibits in our cell viability assay at the same concentration (supplemental Fig. 1C). The influenza derived P155–185-chol peptide instead does not alter cell viability (supplemental Fig. 1C). We then asked whether P155–185-chol blocks HA-mediated fusion by trapping HA in a transient intermediate state and preventing it from progressing through the folding steps that lead to membrane merger. To test this idea, we used 200 nm of DOPC or DOPC:cholesterol (4:1 w/w) liposomes containing 25 mm sulforhodamine B fluorophore. The liposomes were incubated with 1, 3, 5, and 10 μm P155–185-chol for 30 min at 25 °C (pH 7.5). The inhibitor-de"

However, the dominant Australian CA-MRSA strain, ST93-IV [2B] appears distantly related to USA300 despite strikingly similar clinical and epidemiological profiles. Here, we compared the virulence of a recent Australian ST93 isolate (JKD6159) to other MRSA, including USA300, and found that JKD6159 was the most virulent in a mouse skin infection model. We fully sequenced the genome of JKD6159 and confirmed that JKD6159 is a distinct clone with 7616 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distinguishing this strain from all other S. aureus genomes. Despite its high virulence there were surprisingly few virulence determinants. However, genes encoding α-hemolysin, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and α-type phenol soluble modulins were present. Genome comparisons revealed 32 additional CDS in JKD6159 but none appeared to encode new virulence factors, suggesting that this clone's enhanced pathogenicity could lie within subtler genome changes, such as SNPs within regulatory genes. To investigate the role of accessory genome elements in CA-MRSA epidemiology, we next sequenced three additional Australian non-ST93 CA-MRSA strains and compared them with JKD6159, 19 completed S. aureus genomes and 59 additional S. aureus genomes for which unassembled genome sequence data was publicly available (82 genomes in total). These comparisons showed that despite its distinctive genotype, JKD6159 and other CA-MRSA clones (including USA300) share a conserved repertoire of three notable accessory elements (SSCmecIV, PVL prophage, and pMW2). This study demonstrates that the genetically distinct ST93 CA-MRSA from Australia is highly virulent. Our comparisons of geographically and genetically diverse CA-MRSA genomes suggest that apparent convergent evolution in CA-MRSA may be better explained by the rapid dissemination of a highly conserved accessory genome from a common source."
https://openalex.org/W1975823960,"Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons send projections widely throughout the brain consistent with their role in regulating numerous homeostatic processes and mediating analgesia and reward. Recent data suggest that POMC neurons located in the rostral and caudal extents of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus may mediate selective actions, however it is not clear if POMC neurons in these regions of the arcuate nucleus innervate specific target sites. In the present study, fluorescent microspheres and cholera toxin B were used to retrogradely label POMC neurons in POMC-DsRed transgenic mice. The number and location of POMC cells projecting to the supraoptic nucleus, periaqueductal gray, ventral tegmental area, paraventricular nucleus, lateral hypothalamic nucleus, amygdala and the dosal vagal complex was determined. Tracer injected unilaterally labeled POMC neurons in both sides of the arcuate nucleus. While the total number of retrogradely labeled cells in the arcuate nucleus varied by injection site, less than 10% of POMC neurons were labeled with tracer injected into any target area. Limited target sites appear to be preferentially innervated by POMC neurons that reside in the rostral or caudal extremes of the arcuate nucleus, whereas the majority of target sites are innervated by diffusely distributed POMC neurons. The modest number of cells projecting to each target site indicates that relatively few POMC neurons may mediate potent and specific physiologic responses and therefore disturbed signaling in a very few POMC neurons may have significant consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2035584918,"The adult hippocampus consists of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions and is essential for learning and memory functions. During embryonic development, hippocampal neurons are derived from hippocampal neuroepithelial cells and dentate granular progenitors. The molecular mechanisms that control hippocampal progenitor proliferation and differentiation are not well understood. Here we show that noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for early hippocampal development in mice. Conditionally ablating the RNAase III enzyme Dicer at different embryonic time points utilizing three Cre mouse lines causes abnormal hippocampal morphology and affects the number of hippocampal progenitors due to altered proliferation and increased apoptosis. Lack of miRNAs at earlier stages causes early differentiation of hippocampal neurons, in particular in the CA1 and DG regions. Lack of miRNAs at a later stage specifically affects neuronal production in the CA3 region. Our results reveal a timing requirement of miRNAs for the formation of specific hippocampal regions, with the CA1 and DG developmentally hindered by an early loss of miRNAs and the CA3 region to a late loss of miRNAs. Collectively, our studies indicate the importance of the Dicer-mediated miRNA pathway in hippocampal development and functions."
https://openalex.org/W2080781639,"Acetylxylan esterases hydrolyze the ester linkages of acetyl groups at positions 2 and/or 3 of the xylose moieties in xylan and play an important role in enhancing the accessibility of xylanases to the xylan backbone. The hemicellulolytic system of the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 comprises a putative acetylxylan esterase gene, axe2. The gene product belongs to the GDSL hydrolase family and does not share sequence homology with any of the carbohydrate esterases in the CAZy Database. The axe2 gene is induced by xylose, and the purified gene product completely deacetylates xylobiose peracetate (fully acetylated) and hydrolyzes the synthetic substrates 2-naphthyl acetate, 4-nitrophenyl acetate, 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate, and phenyl acetate. The pH profiles for k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) suggest the existence of two ionizable groups affecting the binding of the substrate to the enzyme. Using NMR spectroscopy, the regioselectivity of Axe2 was directly determined with the aid of one-dimensional selective total correlation spectroscopy. Methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-β-d-xylopyranoside was rapidly deacetylated at position 2 or at positions 3 and 4 to give either diacetyl or monoacetyl intermediates, respectively; methyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was initially deacetylated at position 6. In both cases, the complete hydrolysis of the intermediates occurred at a much slower rate, suggesting that the preferred substrate is the peracetate sugar form. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser-15, His-194, and Asp-191 resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme, consistent with their role as the catalytic triad. Overall, our results show that Axe2 is a serine acetylxylan esterase representing a new carbohydrate esterase family."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of STAT3 knockdown in nude mouse xenografts of pancreatic cancer cells and underlying gene expression.A STAT3 shRNA lentiviral vector was constructed and infected into SW1990 cells. qRT-PCR and western immunoblot were performed to detect gene expression. Nude mouse xenograft assays were used to assess changes in phenotypes of these stable cells in vivo. HE staining was utilized to evaluate tumor cell invasion and immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze gene expression.STAT3 shRNA successfully silenced expression of STAT3 mRNA and protein in SW1990 cells compared to control cells. Growth rate of the STAT3-silenced tumor cells in nude mice was significantly reduced compared to in the control vector tumors and parental cells-generated tumors. Tumor invasion into the vessel and muscle were also suppressed in the STAT3-silenced tumors compared to controls. Collagen IV expression was complete and continuous surrounding the tumors of STAT3-silenced SW1990 cells, whereas collagen IV expression was incomplete and discontinuous surrounding the control tumors. Moreover, microvessel density was significantly lower in STAT3-silenced tumors than parental or control tumors of SW1990 cells. In addition, MMP-7 expression was reduced in STAT3-silenced tumors compared to parental SW1990 xenografts and controls. In contrast, expression of IL-1β and IgT7α was not altered.These data clearly demonstrate that STAT3 plays an important role in regulation of tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis, which could be act by reducing MMP-7 expression in pancreatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993036564,"Background DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in a variety of biological processes. Methylated DNA is specifically bound by Methyl-CpG Binding Proteins (MBPs). Three different types of MBPs have been identified so far: the Methyl-CpG Binding Domain (MBD) family proteins, three BTB/POZ-Zn-finger proteins, and UHRF1. Most of the known MBPs have been identified via homology with the MBD and Zn-finger domains as present in MeCP2 and Kaiso, respectively. It is conceivable that other proteins are capable of recognizing methylated DNA. Methodology/Principal Findings For the purpose of identifying novel ‘readers’ we set up a methyl-CpG pull-down assay combined with stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). In a methyl-CpG pull-down with U937 nuclear extracts, we recovered several known MBPs and almost all subunits of the MBD2/NuRD complex as methylation specific binders, providing proof-of-principle. Interestingly, RBP-J, the transcription factor downstream of Notch receptors, also bound the DNA in a methylation dependent manner. Follow-up pull-downs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that RBP-J binds methylated DNA in the context of a mutated RBP-J consensus motif. Conclusions/Significance The here described SILAC/methyl-CpG pull-down constitutes a new approach to identify potential novel DNAme readers and will advance unraveling of the complete methyl-DNA interactome."

Ferucarbotran is a clinically approved SPIO-coated carboxydextran with a diameter of about 45–60 nm. We investigated the mechanism of cellular uptake of Ferucarbotran with a cell model using the murine macrophage cell line Raw 264.7. We observed a dose-dependent uptake of these SPIO particles by spectrophotometer analysis and also a dose-dependent increase in the granularity of the macrophages as determined by flow cytometry. There was a linear correlation between the side scattering mean value and iron content (P<0.001, R2 = 0. 8048). For evaluation of the endocytotic pathway of these ingested SPIO particles, different inhibitors of the endocytotic pathways were employed. There was a significant decrease of side scattering counts in the cells and a less significant change in signal intensity based on magnetic resonance in the phenylarsine oxide-treated macrophages. After labeling with SPIO particles, the macrophages showed an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species at 2, 24, and 48 h; a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential at 24 h; and an increase in cell proliferation at 24 h. We concluded that Ferucarbotran was internalized into macrophages via the clathrin-mediated pathway and can change the cellular behavior of these cells after labeling."
https://openalex.org/W2098603091,"The areas of wild land around the edges of agricultural fields are a vital resource for many species. These include insect pollinators, to whom field margins provide both nest sites and important resources (especially when adjacent crops are not in flower). Nesting pollinators travel relatively short distances from the nest to forage: most species of bee are known to travel less than two kilometres away. In order to ensure that these pollinators have sufficient areas of wild land within reach of their nests, agricultural landscapes need to be designed to accommodate the limited travelling distances of nesting pollinators. We used a spatially-explicit modelling approach to consider whether increasing the width of wild strips of land within the agricultural landscape will enhance the amount of wild resources available to a nesting pollinator, and if it would impact differently on pollinators with differing foraging strategies. This was done both by creating field structures with a randomised geography, and by using landscape data based upon the British agricultural landscape. These models demonstrate that enhancing field margins should lead to an increase in the availability of forage to pollinators that nest within the landscape. With the exception of species that only forage within a very short range of their nest (less than 125 m), a given amount of field margin manipulation should enhance the proportion of land available to a pollinator for foraging regardless of the distance over which it normally travels to find food. A fixed amount of field edge manipulation should therefore be equally beneficial for both longer-distance nesting foragers such as honeybees, and short-distance foragers such as solitary bees."
https://openalex.org/W2132285179,"While the populations of large herbivores are being depleted in many tropical rainforests, the importance of their trophic role in the ecological functioning and biodiversity of these ecosystems is still not well evaluated. This is due to the outstanding plant diversity that they feed upon and the inherent difficulties involved in observing their elusive behaviour. Classically, the diet of elusive tropical herbivores is studied through the observation of browsing signs and macroscopic analysis of faeces or stomach contents. In this study, we illustrate that the original coupling of classic methods with genetic and ethnobotanical approaches yields information both about the diet diversity, the foraging modalities and the potential impact on vegetation of the largest terrestrial mammal of Amazonia, the lowland tapir. The study was conducted in the Guianan shield, where the ecology of tapirs has been less investigated. We identified 92 new species, 51 new genera and 13 new families of plants eaten by tapirs. We discuss the relative contribution of our different approaches, notably the contribution of genetic barcoding, used for the first time to investigate the diet of a large tropical mammal, and how local traditional ecological knowledge is accredited and valuable for research on the ecology of elusive animals."
https://openalex.org/W2064304304,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness affecting as many as 2.2 million Americans. All current glaucoma treatment strategies aim to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). IOP results from the resistance to drainage of aqueous humor (AH) produced by the ciliary body in a process requiring bicarbonate. Once secreted into the anterior chamber, AH drains from the eye via two pathways: uveoscleral and pressure-dependent or conventional outflow (C(t)). Modulation of ""inflow"" and ""outflow"" pathways is thought to occur via distinct, local mechanisms. Mice deficient in the bicarbonate channel bestrophin-2 (Best2), however, exhibit a lower IOP despite an increase in AH production. Best2 is expressed uniquely in nonpigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells providing evidence for a bicarbonate-dependent communicative pathway linking inflow and outflow. Here, we show that bicarbonate-sensitive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is highly expressed in the ciliary body in NPE cells, but appears to be absent from drainage tissues. Pharmacologic inhibition of sAC in mice causes a significant increase in IOP due to a decrease in C(t) with no effect on inflow. In mice deficient in sAC IOP is elevated, and C(t) is decreased relative to wild-type mice. Pharmacologic inhibition of sAC did not alter IOP or C(t) in sAC-deficient mice. Based on these data we propose that the ciliary body can regulate C(t) and that sAC serves as a critical sensor of bicarbonate in the ciliary body regulating the secretion of substances into the AH that govern outflow facility independent of pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2059807882,"The role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of RNA nervous necrosis virus infection is still unknown. Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) induced free radical species (ROS) production at 12–24 h post-infection (pi; early replication stage) in fish GF-1 cells, and then at middle replication stage (24–48 h pi), this ROS signal may upregulate some expressions of the anti-oxidant enzymes Cu/Zn SOD and catalase, and eventually expression of the transcription factor Nrf2. Furthermore, both antioxidants diphenyliodonium and N-acetylcysteine or overexpression of zebrafish catalase in GF-1 cells also reduced ROS production and protected cells for enhancing host survival rate due to RGNNV infection. Furthermore, localization of ROS production using esterase activity and Mitotracker staining assays found that the ROS generated can affect mitochondrial morphology changes and causes ΔΨ loss, both of which can be reversed by antioxidant treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that RGNNV induced oxidative stress response for playing dual role that can initiate the host oxidative stress defense system to upregulate expression of antioxidant enzymes and induces cell death via disrupting the mitochondrial morphology and inducing ΔΨ loss, which can be reversed by anti-oxidants and zfcatalase, which provide new insight into betanodavirus-induced ROS-mediated pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091417232,"Multiple lineages of bats have evolved striking facial and body pelage makings, including spots, stripes and countershading. Although researchers have hypothesized that these markings mainly evolved for crypsis, this idea has never been tested in a quantitative and comparative context. We present the first comparative study integrating data on roosting ecology (roost type and colony size) and pelage coloration patterns across bats, and explore the hypothesis that the evolution of bat pelage markings is associated with roosting ecologies that benefit from crypsis. We find that lineages that roost in the vegetation have evolved pelage markings, especially stripes and neck collars, which may function in crypsis through disruptive coloration and a type of countershading that might be unique to bats. We also demonstrate that lineages that live in larger colonies and are larger in size tend not to have pelage markings, possibly because of reduced predation pressures due to the predator dilution effect and a lower number of potential predators. Although social functions for pelage color patterns are also possible, our work provides strong support for the idea that roosting ecology has driven the evolution of pelage markings in bats."

https://openalex.org/W2036673470,"Malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa varies seasonally in intensity. Outbreaks of malaria occur after the beginning of the rainy season, whereas, during the dry season, reports of the disease are less frequent. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the main malaria vector, are observed all year long but their densities are low during the dry season that generally lasts several months. Aestivation, seasonal migration, and local adaptation have been suggested as mechanisms that enable mosquito populations to persist through the dry season. Studies of chromosomal inversions have shown that inversions 2La, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd, and 2Ru are associated with various physiological changes that confer aridity resistance. However, little is known about how phenotypic plasticity responds to seasonally dry conditions. This study examined the effects of desiccation stress on transcriptional regulation in An. gambiae. We exposed female An. gambiae G3 mosquitoes to acute desiccation and conducted a genome-wide analysis of their transcriptomes using the Affymetrix Plasmodium/Anopheles Genome Array. The transcription of 248 genes (1.7% of all transcripts) was significantly affected in all experimental conditions, including 96 with increased expression and 152 with decreased expression. In general, the data indicate a reduction in the metabolic rate of mosquitoes exposed to desiccation. Transcripts accumulated at higher levels during desiccation are associated with oxygen radical detoxification, DNA repair and stress responses. The proportion of transcripts within 2La and 2Rs (2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd, and 2Ru) (67/248, or 27%) is similar to the percentage of transcripts located within these inversions (31%). These data may be useful in efforts to elucidate the role of chromosomal inversions in aridity tolerance. The scope of application of the anopheline genome demonstrates that examining transcriptional activity in relation to genotypic adaptations greatly expands the number of candidate regions involved in the desiccation response in this important malaria vector."
https://openalex.org/W2159107352,"Ubiquitination has been implicated in negatively regulating insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) activity. Because of the relative stability of IGF-IR in the presence of ligand stimulation, IGF-IR ubiquitination sites have yet to be mapped and characterized, thus preventing a direct demonstration of how the receptor ubiquitination contributes to downstream molecular cascades. We took advantage of an anti-IGF-IR antibody (h10H5) that induces more efficient receptor down-regulation to show that IGF-IR is promptly and robustly ubiquitinated. The ubiquitination sites were mapped to the two lysine residues in the IGF-IR activation loop (Lys-1138 and Lys-1141) and consisted of polyubiquitin chains formed through both Lys-48 and Lys-29 linkages. Mutation of these ubiquitinated lysine residues resulted in decreased h10H5-induced IGF-IR internalization and down-regulation as well as a reduced cellular response to h10H5 treatment. We have therefore demonstrated that IGF-IR ubiquitination contributes critically to the down-regulating and antiproliferative activity of h10H5. This finding is physiologically relevant because insulin-like growth factor I appears to mediate ubiquitination of the same major sites as h10H5 (albeit to a lesser extent), and ubiquitination is facilitated by pre-existing phosphorylation of the receptor in both cases. Furthermore, identification of a breast cancer cell line with a defect in IGF-IR ubiquitination suggests that this could be an important tumor resistance mechanism to evade down-regulation-mediated negative regulation of IGF-IR activity in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2156508708,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are ubiquitous phosphotransfer enzymes responsible for producing most of the nucleoside triphosphates except for ATP. This role is important for the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins and the metabolism of sugars and lipids. Apart from this housekeeping role NDPKs have been shown to have many regulatory functions in diverse cellular processes including proliferation and endocytosis. Although the protein has been shown to have a positive regulatory role in clathrin- and dynamin-mediated micropinocytosis, its roles in macropinocytosis and phagocytosis have not been studied. The additional non-housekeeping roles of NDPK are often independent of enzyme activity but dependent on the expression level of the protein. In this study we altered the expression level of NDPK in the model eukaryotic organism Dictyostelium discoideum through antisense inhibition and overexpression. We demonstrate that NDPK levels affect growth, endocytosis and exocytosis. In particular we find that Dictyostelium NDPK negatively regulates endocytosis in contrast to the positive regulatory role identified in higher eukaryotes. This can be explained by the differences in types of endocytosis that have been studied in the different systems - phagocytosis and macropinocytosis in Dictyostelium compared with micropinocytosis in mammalian cells. This is the first report of a role for NDPK in regulating macropinocytosis and phagocytosis, the former being the major fluid phase uptake mechanism for macrophages, dendritic cells and other (non dendritic) cells exposed to growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2049672658,"VSIG1, a cell adhesion protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is preferentially expressed in stomach, testis, and certain gastric, esophageal and ovarian cancers. Here, we describe the expression patterns of three alternatively spliced isoforms of mouse Vsig1 during pre- and postnatal development of stomach and potential function of Vsig1 in differentiation of gastric epithelia. We show that isoforms Vsig1A and Vsig1B, which differ in the 3′untranslated region, are expressed in the early stages of stomach development. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that VSIG1 is restricted to the adherens junction of the glandular epithelium. The shorter transcript Vsig1C is restricted to the testis, encodes an N-terminal truncated protein and is presumably regulated by an internal promoter, which is located upstream of exon 1b. To determine whether the 5′ flanking region of exon 1a specifically targets the expression of Vsig1 to stomach epithelia, we generated and analyzed transgenic mice. The 4.8-kb fragment located upstream of exon 1a was sufficient to direct the expression of the reporter gene to the glandular epithelia of transgenic stomach. To determine the role of VSIG1 during the development of stomach epithelia, an X-linked Vsig1 was inactivated in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Although Vsig1−/Y ESCs were only able to generate low coat color chimeric mice, no male chimeras transmitted the targeted allele to their progeny suggesting that the high contribution of Vsig1−/Y cells leads to the lethality of chimeric embryos. Analysis of chimeric stomachs revealed the differentiation of VSIG1-null cells into squamous epithelia inside the glandular region. These results suggest that VSIG1 is required for the establishment of glandular versus squamous epithelia in the stomach."
https://openalex.org/W1966220515,"Objective To estimate HIV incidence and prevalence in Windhoek, Namibia and to analyze socio-economic factors related to HIV infection. Method In 2006/7, baseline surveys were performed with 1,753 private households living in the greater Windhoek area; follow-up visits took place in 2008 and 2009. Face-to-face socio-economic questionnaires were administrated by trained interviewers; biomedical markers were collected by nurses; GPS codes of household residences were recorded. Results The HIV prevalence in the population (aged>12 years) was 11.8% in 2006/7 and 14.6% in 2009. HIV incidence between 2007 and 2009 was 2.4 per 100 person year (95%CI = 1.9–2.9). HIV incidence and prevalence were higher in female populations. HIV incidence appeared non-associated with any socioeconomic factor, indicating universal risk for the population. For women a positive trend was found between low per-capita consumption and HIV acquisition. A HIV knowledge score was strongly associated with HIV incidence for both men and women. High HIV prevalence and incidence was concentrated in the north-western part of the city, an area with lower HIV knowledge, higher HIV risk perception and lower per-capita consumption. Discussion The HIV incidence and prevalence figures do not suggest a declining epidemic in Windhoek. Higher vulnerability of women is recorded, most likely related to economic dependency and increasing transactional sex in Namibia. The lack of relation between HIV incidence and socio-economic factors confirms HIV risks for the overall urban community. Appropriate knowledge is strongly associated to lower HIV incidence and prevalence, underscoring the importance of continuous information and education activities for prevention of infection. Geographical areas were identified that would require prioritized HIV campaigning."

The ability of this yeast to effectively survive the harsh host environments suggests the presence of stress response capabilities that are likely to be unique to this yeast. Oxidative stress is one of the major stress conditions faced by yeast pathogens in vivo (4Chauhan N. Latge J.P. Calderone R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and an effective response is required by the yeast pathogen to defend itself from the host immune system. C. albicans has both a thioredoxin-dependent and a glutathione-dependent pathway of redox homeostasis (5Michán C. Pueyo C. FEMS Yeast Res. 2009; 9: 1078-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the redox functions of these pathways have been shown to partially overlap in S. cerevisiae (6Muller E.G. Mol.

Desai P.R. Rai M.N. Kaur R. Ganesan K. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The abundance of glutathione in the human host and the presence of apparent homologues of glutathione utilization pathways of S. cerevisiae in C. albicans have made the essentiality of glutathione biosynthesis for the survival of C. albicans in vivo surprising. Two possible explanations could be put forward to explain these observations. The first is that the high levels of intracellular glutathione that are required by these yeast pathogens in vivo might demand continuous glutathione biosynthesis. Glutathione levels in all eukaryotic cells reach up to 10 mm (10Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), and these levels might be difficult to reach only from extracellular sources. A second explanation for the essentiality of glutathione biosynthesis in vivo might be the absence of an efficient glutathione utilization pathway in C. albicans, as a consequence of which glutathione, though abundant in the environment, would be inefficiently utilized by the yeast. Exogenous glutathione utilization requires both a transporter and a degradation pathway. Glutathione transporters in several yeasts have now been identified and found to belong to the peptide transporter clade of the oligopeptide transporter superfamily (11Bourbouloux A. Shahi P.

Glutathione degradation has been shown to require the alternative pathway (DUG pathway) of glutathione degradation (14Ganguli D. Kumar C. Bachhawat A.K. Genetics. 2007; 175: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) whose homologues are present in all yeasts and fungi barring Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The DUG pathway involves the proteins DUG1, DUG2, and DUG3. The DUG1 has been shown to be a Cys-Gly peptidase (15Kaur H. Kumar C. Junot C. Toledano M.B. Bachhawat A.K. J. Biol.

Morschhäuser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 795-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Of these, OPT1–OPT7 belonged to the peptide transporter (PT) clade, and among these OPT1 is the closest in similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae glutathione transporter, HGT1. Despite the strong similarity to HGT1, OPT1 was shown not to play a role in glutathione transport as seen from heterologous complementation experiments (13Thakur A. Bachhawat A.K. Biochem. J. 2010; 429: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus it was possible that C. albicans lacks the ability to efficiently transport and utilize glutathione. This would be akin to the situation in Candida glabrata that completely lacks the homologues of the oligopeptide transporter superfamily belonging to the PT clade and in fact fails to transport and utilize glutathione when provided from external sources (9Yadav A.K.

We investigated the role of the OPTs as well as the DUG pathway, and our studies revealed that C. albicans can utilize glutathione efficiently, and the transport is dependent on an unusual member of the OPT family, OPT7, whereas degradation was dependent on the DUG pathway.

For preparing the two disruption cassettes for each of the alleles, we excised the SAT1 flipper from pSFS2a by ApaI-SacI, blunted and cloned into the MscI and BsmI sites. A second disruption cassette was made by PCR amplifying an internal piece of the MET15 clone corresponding to, but internal to, the site and inserting the SAT1 flipper into the HpaI-BstEII site of this smaller MET15 fragment. To use the first cassette for disruption, we evicted the same with SmaI and transformed into the appropriate C. albicans strain. To create a disruption in the second allele, we first evicted the SAT1 flipper from the first strain by growth in maltose medium as described earlier (19Reuss O. Vik A. Kolter R. Morschhäuser J. Gene. 2004; 341: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The second disruption cassette was excised with SmaI sites and then transformed into the strain containing a disruption in the first allele. The MET15 gene was disrupted in this manner in both alleles of C. albicans SC5314 to yield strain ABA 2490, in OPT7M4AB to yield strain ABA 3031, in OPT1M4AB to yield strain ABA 2546, in OPT12345M4AB to yield strain ABA 2548, and in ABA 2558 to yield strain ABA 2592. The disruptions were confirmed by diagnostic PCR, and the absence of a third allele was also confirmed by diagnostic PCR. The SAT1 flipper was evicted using maltose-containing medium as described previously. The DUG3 gene of C. albicans was cloned by PCR amplifying the ORF including 100 bp upstream and downstream of the ORF with SmaI sites introduced into the primers and cloning into the SmaI site of pBSK. For preparing the two disruption cassettes for each of the alleles, we excised the SAT1 flipper from pSFS2a by ApaI-SacI, blunted and cloned into the NdeI-HpaI sites. A second disruption cassette was made by PCR amplifying an internal piece of the DUG3 clone corresponding to, but internal to, the NdeI-HpaI site and inserting the SAT1 flipper into the BclI-MscI site of this smaller DUG3 fragment. To use the first cassette for disruption, we evicted the same with SmaI and transformed into the appropriate C. albicans strain. To create a disruption in the second allele, we first evicted the SAT1 flipper from the first strain by growth in maltose medium as described earlier. The second disruption cassette was excised with SmaI sites and then transformed into the strain containing a disruption in the first allele. In this way both alleles of DUG3 of C. albicans SC5314 were disrupted to yield strain ABA 2558. The disruptions were confirmed by diagnostic PCR, and the absence of a third allele was also confirmed by diagnostic PCR. The SAT1 flipper was evicted using maltose-containing medium. The ORF OPT7 was PCR-amplified from C. albicans genomic DNA using the primer pairs OPT7F and OPT7R (supplemental Table S3). The 2.3-kb PCR product obtained was digested with Xba1 and BamHI and cloned downstream of the TEF promoter in the single copy, URA3-based expression vector to construct p416TEF-OPT7 (20Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). OPT7 was tagged with HA epitope by PCR mutagenesis. The reverse primer had the HA tag before the stop codon. For growth assays, S. cerevisiae strains were grown overnight in minimal medium without uracil, whereas C. albicans strains were grown in SD minimal medium. The cells were reinoculated in fresh medium to an A600 of 0.1 and grown up to exponential phase. The exponential phase cells were harvested washed with water and resuspended in water to an A600 of 0.2. These were serially diluted to 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000. 10 μl of these cell resuspensions were spotted on minimal medium containing different concentration of either glutathione, γ-Glu-Cys, α-Glu-Cys, Cys-Gly, Leu-Tyr-Met-Arg, GSSG, or methionine. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days, and photographs were taken. The S. cerevisiae ABC 817 strain (met15Δhgt1Δ) transformed with appropriate plasmids was grown in minimal medium containing methionine and other supplements, without uracil. C. albicans strains met15Δ, met15Δ-opt7Δ, and cbf1Δ were grown in SD minimal medium containing 20 μm to 40 μm methionine (nonrepressive sulfur conditions) or 1 mm methionine (repressive sulfur conditions) overnight. These cultures were reinoculated in the same medium and allowed to grow till they reached exponential phase. The cells were harvested and washed and put on ice in a pH 5.5 MES-buffered medium, until the transport was initiated. Transport experiments were carried out with [35S]GSH as described earlier. The results were expressed as nanomoles of glutathione·mg·protein−1 min−1 as described previously (21Kaur J. Srikanth C.V. Bachhawat A.K. FEMS Yeast Res. 2009; 9: 849-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For saturation kinetics, the initial rate of glutathione uptake was measured at different concentrations of glutathione with specific activity kept constant at each concentration. The initial rate of glutathione uptake was determined by measuring the radioactive glutathione in the cell. After subtracting background uptake observed with vector alone from uptake with P416TEF-OPT7, the data were plotted. The Lineweaver-Burke best fit line was plotted and was used to calculate the kinetic parameters Km and Vmax. The experiment was repeated a minimum of two times in duplicate at each glutathione concentration. Inhibition studies were done with different peptides, Glu-Cys, Cys-Gly, Leu-Gly, Met-Gly, Gly-Gly-Gly, GSH, and GSSG. The inhibitors were added at 10-fold excess along with the assay medium, and the initial rates of glutathione were measured. For the studies done with the metabolic inhibitors, the cells were preincubated with the metabolic inhibitor for 15 min at 30 °C before measuring the initial rate of glutathione uptake. For determining the pH optima, the initial rates of glutathione uptake in the OPT7 were determined at different pH levels ranging from 3.5 to 7.5. The different pH levels were maintained using different buffers: 20 mm acetate-sodium acetate (pH 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5), 20 mm MES/KOH (pH 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0) and 20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5). In each case, the buffer also contained 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.25 mm MgCl2, and 2% glucose. For localization studies, the P416TEF-OPT7HA construct was transformed in the S. cerevisiae met15Δhgt1Δ strain, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed using a previously published protocol (21Kaur J. Srikanth C.V. Bachhawat A.K. FEMS Yeast Res. 2009; 9: 849-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The OPT sequences were retrieved from Entrez. The multiple sequence alignment of the protein sequences was generated using the ClustalX program using default parameters (22Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35463) Google Scholar). The MEGA 3.1 software (23Kumar S. Nei M. Dudley J. Tamura K. Brief Bioinform. 2008; 9: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2862) Google Scholar) was used to visualize the phylogenetic tree of the family. Experimentation with mice was done under the health and safety executive guidelines for level 2 biohazard containment. Male BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks were used for the survival and IVET experiment. To investigate the virulence of C. albicans opt7Δ and dug3Δ strains in comparison with C. albcians WT (SC5314), both of the strains were grown on minimal medium for 16 h; further, the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and resuspended in the same buffer. To correlate the number of cells to 1 A600, hemocytometer cell counting was done. The mice were intravenously injected with 5 × 105 cells of C. albicans WT SC5314, opt7Δ, and dug3Δ and individually and observed for survival. For the in vivo expression technology experiments, two mice were sacrificed after every 2 days, the kidneys were isolated and homogenized in buffer, and an aliquot (after dilutions) was plated on selective plates. The MET15 gene of S. cerevisiae codes for O-acetyl homoserine thiolase, an enzyme in the sulfur assimilation pathway. Deletion of this gene has been found to lead to organic sulfur auxotrophy in both S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. met15Δ strains have been previously created in C. albicans, and these disruptants were shown to be methionine auxotrophs, although prolonged growth on minimal medium permitted growth even on inorganic sulfate (24Viaene J. Tiels P. Logghe M. Dewaele S. Martinet W. Contreras R. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the growth on other sulfur compounds was never examined. We decided to recreate the met15Δ in a WT background to re-evaluate the earlier findings, and further to examine whether the strain would be useful to evaluate growth on glutathione. The met15Δ strain in SC5314 background was created as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These strains were not only methionine auxotrophs as described previously, but organic sulfur auxotrophs because the strain did not grow on inorganic sulfate but were able to grow on cysteine, cystine, and glutathione as a source of sulfur (Fig. 1). They could also grow on homocysteine (data not shown). However, prolonged growth of met15Δ led to growth even in the absence of any organic sulfur sources in accordance with the previous observations that it was not a strict auxotrophy (24Viaene J. Tiels P. Logghe M. Dewaele S. Martinet W. Contreras R. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Despite this, and considering that the growth on organic sulfur sources was much faster, they have proved useful in investigating growth on sulfur sources. The ability to grow on other sulfur sources was shared with S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. The only difference was that the C. glabrata met15Δ strain could not utilize glutathione as a sulfur source, but C. albicans met15Δ strain could efficiently utilize glutathione as a sulfur source. We used this glutathione-dependent growth of met15Δ strains of C. albicans to identify and investigate the glutathione transport and degradation pathways. The first step in the glutathione utilization pathway of yeasts is transport. In S. cerevisiae glutathione transport is mediated by the glutathione transporter Hgt1p, which belongs to the family of oligopeptide transporters (11Bourbouloux A. Shahi P. Chakladar A. Delrot S. Bachhawat A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The absence of glutathione utilization in C. glabrata was shown to be due to the absence of homologues of HGT1 (9Yadav A.K. Desai P.R. Rai M.N. Kaur R. Ganesan K. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Analysis of the C. albicans genome has revealed the presence of eight members of the oligopeptide transporter family. Seven of these belong to the peptide transporter clade (OPT1–OPT7), whereas OPT8 belonged to the more remote YSL (yellow stripe-like) clade. The PT clade members include the previously identified ORFs: OPT1, OPT2, OPT3, OPT4, and OPT5, which were found to be induced during nitrogen limiting conditions and shown to transport different oligopeptides of different sequence and sizes, as well as two other hypothetical ORFs, OPT6 and OPT7 (16Reuss O. Morschhäuser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 795-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The OPT1 of C. albicans, which shows maximum similarity and identity to HGT1 (25Lubkowitz M.A. Hauser L. Breslav M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), did not display significant capability to transport glutathione during heterologous complementation in S. cerevisiae (13Thakur A. Bachhawat A.K. Biochem. J. 2010; 429: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of OPT1 and the combined contribution of OPT1 to OPT5 in glutathione uptake in its native host, we created met15Δ knockouts in previously deleted opt1Δ and opt1–5Δ mutant strains, the latter being deleted for five OPTs (16Reuss O. Morschhäuser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 795-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We observed that both opt1Δmet15Δ and opt1–5Δ met15Δ strains showed a very marginal (almost negligible) growth defect on glutathione as compared with met15Δ strains grown on glutathione (Fig. 2). This indicated that OPT1, as observed previously by heterologous complementation in S. cerevisiae met15Δhgt1Δ, was not contributing to glutathione transport in C. albicans in any significant manner. Furthermore, none of the other four OPTs, OPT2–OPT5, were contributing to glutathione transport either. We corroborated these findings biochemically by carrying out glutathione uptake assays in different strains carrying the different OPT genes under control of the ADH1 promoter that had been integrated into an opt123Δ mutant strain (16Reuss O. Morschhäuser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 795-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We compared the accumulation of radiolabeled glutathione ([35S]GSH) in the opt12345Δ delete strain with the OPT1–OPT5 genes expressed under constitutive ADH1 promoter. Although OPT1, OPT2, and OPT5 led to a slight accumulation of radiolabeled glutathione as compared with the deletion strain opt12345Δ, the contributions did not appear to be significant (data not shown). These observations further confirm that OPT1 to OPT5 family members of C. albicans do not function as glutathione transporters of the cell. The ability of C. albicans met15Δ to grow on glutathione as a sulfur source in the absence of involvement of the OPTs OPT1–OPT5 was surprising. The immediate question was whether glutathione needed to be transported inside to be utilized or whether it was being degraded extracellularly following the transport of the constituents inside. We addressed this issue by arguing that if glutathione was being transported inside, then it would most likely involve the alternative degradation pathway, the DUG pathway that required the DUG1/DUG2/DUG3 proteins. In S. cerevisiae exogenous utilization of glutathione as a sulfur source has been shown to be mediated by the alternative pathway of glutathione degradation (DUG pathway) (14Ganguli D. Kumar C. Bachhawat A.K. Genetics. 2007; 175: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Putative orthologues of the Dug proteins (Dug1p, Dug2p, and Dug3p) were identified in C. albicans, and to investigate the role of the Dug pathway in glutathione degradation in C. albicans, the DUG3 gene (19.5159) was deleted in a met15Δ background. This strain was severely compromised in its ability to utilize exogenous glutathione in C. albicans, clearly demonstrating that the Dug pathway is critical for utilization of extracellular glutathione in C. albicans (Fig. 3). The absence of involvement of OPT1–OPT5 with the requirement for the DUG pathway suggested the presence of an unidentified transporter enabling efficient glutathione transport in C. albicans. To identify a possible transporter enabling growth on glutathione, we"

Phytophthora sojae, a pathogen of soybean, secretes a Ca2+-dependent TGase (GP42) that is activating defense responses in both host and non-host plants. A GP42 fragment of 13 amino acids, termed Pep-13, was shown to be absolutely indispensable for both TGase and elicitor activity. GP42 does not share significant primary sequence similarity with known TGases from mammals or bacteria. This suggests that GP42 has evolved novel structural and catalytic features to support enzymatic activity. We have solved the crystal structure of the catalytically inactive point mutant GP42 (C290S) at 2.95 Å resolution and identified residues involved in catalysis by mutational analysis. The protein comprises three domains that assemble into an elongated structure. Although GP42 has no structural homolog, its core region displays significant similarity to the catalytic core of the Mac-1 cysteine protease from Group A Streptococcus, a member of the papain-like superfamily of cysteine proteases. Proteins that are taxonomically related to GP42 are only present in plant pathogenic oomycetes belonging to the order of the Peronosporales (e.g. Phytophthora, Hyaloperonospora, and Pythium spp.) and in marine Vibrio bacteria. This suggests that a lateral gene transfer event may have occurred between bacteria and oomycetes. Our results offer a basis to design and use highly specific inhibitors of the GP42-like TGase family that may impair the growth of important oomycete and bacterial pathogens.

TGase activity has been implicated in a multitude of physiological activities in animals, plants, and bacteria (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Human TGases such as the blood coagulation factor XIIIa or the tissue TGase 2 have been structurally characterized (4Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Despite the low degree of homology at the amino acid sequence level, it appears that human TGases share a core structural fold with the papain-like cysteine proteases (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of TGases and cysteine proteases is based on a catalytic triad formed by Cys, His, and Asp residues and proceeds via an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which the active site cysteine is covalently bound to the ligand (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). This is a striking example of the conservation in evolutionary distant taxa of a tertiary structure in proteins mechanistically related but with highly diverging primary sequences. Bioinformatics analyses performed by Makarova et al. (6Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) demonstrated a statistically significant sequence similarity between mammalian TGases and a group of microbial proteins of which the only functionally characterized member is a protease (7Pfister P. Wasserfallen A. Stettler R. Leisinger T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was suggested that animal TGases have evolved from ancestral cysteine proteases, but to date, there is a lack of evidence to support such a model of divergent evolution.Phytophthora species are pathogens that infect various plants, leading to major economic and environmental damage. Phytophthora sojae in particular causes root and stem rot of soybeans. Immunolocalization assays demonstrated that the GP42 TGase is associated with hyphal cell walls of P. sojae growing in planta (8Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Logemann E. Nürnberger T. Parniske M. Reinold S. Sacks W.R. Schmelzer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 4150-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that extracellular TGase activity is detectable in at least 10 different Phytophthora spp. and that proteins serologically related to GP42 are expressed in all these species (9Brunner F.

A stretch of 13 amino acids (Pep-13; VWNQPVRGFKVYE), located in the C-terminal region of GP42, has been shown to be sufficient for receptor-mediated perception and plant immunogenic activity (11Nürnberger T. Nennstiel D. Jabs T. Sacks W.R. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Cell. 1994; 78: 449-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar).To provide a platform for understanding the molecular mechanism of the GP42-catalyzed transamidation reaction and to allow for its comparison with other known enzymes, we have determined the crystal structure of a catalytically inactive form of GP42 in which the active site cysteine residue is replaced with a serine. The core region of GP42 superposes well with the canonical domain characteristic of proteins belonging to the papain-like protein superfamily of cysteine proteases. However, the GP42 sequences surrounding the catalytic core fold into domains that are novel and have not been observed to date in other proteins. Moreover, the arrangement of the catalytic triad in GP42 differs from that seen in cysteine proteases. Hence, the structural analysis clearly suggests that GP42 has arisen through convergent evolution. GP42-related sequences are only present in closely related oomycetes belonging to the order of the Peronosporales and in a small group of marine Vibrio bacteria that can infect numerous fish species and marine invertebrates (12Austin B. Zhang X.H. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 2006; 43: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We show that the TGase-like protein from Vibrio harveyi displays significant TGase activity in vitro. We therefore conclude that TGases from plant pathogenic oomycetes were acquired from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer, probably conferring a selective advantage to Peronosporales over other oomycetes.

The core region of GP42 superposes well with the canonical domain characteristic of proteins belonging to the papain-like protein superfamily of cysteine proteases. However, the GP42 sequences surrounding the catalytic core fold into domains that are novel and have not been observed to date in other proteins. Moreover, the arrangement of the catalytic triad in GP42 differs from that seen in cysteine proteases. Hence, the structural analysis clearly suggests that GP42 has arisen through convergent evolution. GP42-related sequences are only present in closely related oomycetes belonging to the order of the Peronosporales and in a small group of marine Vibrio bacteria that can infect numerous fish species and marine invertebrates (12Austin B.

We therefore conclude that TGases from plant pathogenic oomycetes were acquired from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer, probably conferring a selective advantage to Peronosporales over other oomycetes.

Despite the low degree of homology at the amino acid sequence level, it appears that human TGases share a core structural fold with the papain-like cysteine proteases (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of TGases and cysteine proteases is based on a catalytic triad formed by Cys, His, and Asp residues and proceeds via an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which the active site cysteine is covalently bound to the ligand (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2040451865,"The rotenone-insensitive internal NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from yeast, Ndi1, has been shown to work as a replacement molecule for complex I in the respiratory chain of mammalian mitochondria. In the so-called transkingdom gene therapy, one major concern is the fact that the yeast protein is foreign in mammals. Long term expression of Ndi1 observed in rodents with no apparent damage to the target tissue was indicative of no action by the host's immune system.In the present study, we examined rat skeletal muscles expressing Ndi1 for possible signs of inflammatory or immune response. In parallel, we carried out delivery of the GFP gene using the same viral vector that was used for the NDI1 gene. The tissues were subjected to H&E staining and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies specific for markers, CD11b, CD3, CD4, and CD8. The data showed no detectable signs of an immune response with the tissues expressing Ndi1. In contrast, mild but distinctive positive reactions were observed in the tissues expressing GFP. This clear difference most likely comes from the difference in the location of the expressed protein. Ndi1 was localized to the mitochondria whereas GFP was in the cytosol.We demonstrated that Ndi1 expression did not trigger any inflammatory or immune response in rats. These results push forward the Ndi1-based molecular therapy and also expand the possibility of using foreign proteins that are directed to subcellular organelle such as mitochondria."

The disease and associated conditions cluster in families, suggesting that PCOS may be the reproductive consequence of underlying chronic disease susceptibility.To determine whether parents of young women with PCOS were more likely to have a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease in later adult life.Structured interviews with 715 members of a cohort constructed by tracing female infants born at a single general hospital in Adelaide between 1973 and 1975. Participants were asked whether they had a pre-existing medical diagnosis of PCOS, and whether each parent had ever had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke, or heart disease. Maternal high blood pressure during pregnancy was taken from the medical record of the pregnancy with the study participant.Mothers of women with PCOS were more likely than mothers of other women to have any cardiovascular disease (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.29, 2.47), and nearly twice as likely to have high blood pressure (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.38, 2.76). Fathers of women with PCOS were more than twice as likely to have heart disease (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.44, 3.88) and over four times as likely to have had a stroke (RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.97, 9.70). Occurrence of cardiovascular disease in both mother and father are associated with the risk of PCOS in daughters. Further detailed study is required to elucidate the precise pathways that may be causally related to the observations."

Even though disease has profound effects on condition, few studies have experimentally tested its effects on trait expression and even fewer have identified a mechanistic basis for these effects. Recent evidence suggests that black and white, but not grey, plumage colors of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) are sexually selected. We therefore hypothesized that birds afflicted with avian keratin disorder, a condition that affects the beak and other keratinized tissues, would show reduced expression of black and white, but not grey, color. UV-vis spectrometry of black-capped chickadees affected and unaffected by avian keratin disorder revealed spectral differences between them consistent with this hypothesis. To elucidate the mechanistic bases of these differences, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and a feather cleaning experiment. SEM showed extreme feather soiling in affected birds, and EDX revealed that this was most likely from external sources. Experimentally cleaning the feathers increased color expression of ornamental feathers of affected, but not unaffected, birds. These data provide strong evidence that black and white color is an honest indicator in chickadees, and that variation in feather dirtiness, likely due to differences in preening behavior is a mechanism for this association."

https://openalex.org/W2078643680,"The COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenic) signalosome (CSN), composed of eight subunits, is a highly conserved protein complex that regulates processes such as cell cycle progression and kinase signalling. Previously, we found the expression of the COP9 constitutive photomorphogenic homolog subunit 3 (CSN3) and subunit 5 (CSN5) changes as oocytes mature for the first time, and there is no report regarding roles of COP9 in the mammalian oocytes. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated transient knockdown of each subunit on the meiotic cell cycle in mice oocytes. Following knockdown of either CSN3 or CSN5, oocytes failed to complete meiosis I. These arrested oocytes exhibited a disrupted meiotic spindle and misarranged chromosomes. Moreover, down-regulation of each subunit disrupted the activity of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) and concurrently reduced degradation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) substrates Cyclin B1 and Securin. Our data suggest that the CSN3 and CSN5 are involved in oocyte meiosis by regulating degradation of Cyclin B1 and Securin via APC/C."

Ten subjects actively observed familiar biological motions embedded in point-light and video displays. Electroencephalograms were recorded from 64 electrodes. Activity was considered in three frequency bands (4–8 Hz, 8–10 Hz, and 10–13 Hz) using a non-linear measure of functional connectivity. In the 4–8 Hz and 8–10 Hz frequency bands, functional connectivity for the SMA was greater during the observation of biological motions presented in a point-light display compared to the observation of motions presented in a video display. The reverse was observed for the 4–8 Hz frequency band for the left temporal area. Explanations related to: (i) the task demands (i.e., attention and mental effort), (ii) the role(s) of theta and alpha oscillations in cognitive processes, and (iii) the function(s) of cortical areas are discussed. It has been suggested that attention was required to process human biological motions under unfamiliar viewing conditions such as point-light display."

Treatment reduces the cryoglobulins that cause vasculitis, yet it also leads to a transient increase in liver enzymes and HCV genomic RNA in the periphery. The mechanism underlying the increased viral load is unclear and both direct and indirect roles have been proposed for B cells in HCV infection. We previously reported that HCV can associate with B cells and can trans-infect hepatocytes. We established an in vitro assay to study the effect(s) of rituximab on B cell-associated HCV infectivity. Rituximab-mediated lysis of B cells in vitro increases the level of infectious HCV released from B cells. Our results, using a model where virus does not replicate in B cells, recapitulate observations seen in patients and may explain in part the rapid increase in blood HCV RNA observed after rituximab treatment."

The current study investigated to what extent the origin of this saliency of point-light displays is related to its intrinsic Gestalt qualities. In particular, we studied whether biological motion perception is facilitated when the elements can be grouped according to good continuation and similarity as Gestalt principles of perceptual organization. We found that both grouping principles enhanced biological motion perception but their effects differed when stimuli were inverted. These results provide evidence that Gestalt principles of good continuity and similarity also apply to more complex and dynamic meaningful stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1965498337,"A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how neural circuits encode memory and guide behavior changes. Many of the molecular mechanisms underlying memory are conserved from flies to mammals, and Drosophila has been used extensively to study memory processes. To identify new genes involved in long-term memory, we screened Drosophila enhancer-trap P(Gal4) lines showing Gal4 expression in the mushroom bodies, a specialized brain structure involved in olfactory memory. This screening led to the isolation of a memory mutant that carries a P-element insertion in the debra locus. debra encodes a protein involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway as a mediator of protein degradation by the lysosome. To study debra's role in memory, we achieved debra overexpression, as well as debra silencing mediated by RNA interference. Experiments conducted with a conditional driver that allowed us to specifically restrict transgene expression in the adult mushroom bodies led to a long-term memory defect. Several conclusions can be drawn from these results: i) debra levels must be precisely regulated to support normal long-term memory, ii) the role of debra in this process is physiological rather than developmental, and iii) debra is specifically required for long-term memory, as it is dispensable for earlier memory phases. Drosophila long-term memory is the only long-lasting memory phase whose formation requires de novo protein synthesis, a process underlying synaptic plasticity. It has been shown in several organisms that regulation of proteins at synapses occurs not only at translation level of but also via protein degradation, acting in remodeling synapses. Our work gives further support to a role of protein degradation in long-term memory, and suggests that the lysosome plays a role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1977465189,"Reactivations of waking experiences during sleep have been considered fundamental neural processes for memory consolidation. In songbirds, evidence suggests the importance of sleep-related neuronal activity in song system motor pathway nuclei for both juvenile vocal learning and maintenance of adult song. Like those in singing motor nuclei, neurons in the basal ganglia nucleus Area X, part of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit essential for vocal plasticity, exhibit singing-related activity. It is unclear, however, whether Area X neurons show any distinctive spiking activity during sleep similar to that during singing. Here we demonstrate that, during sleep, Area X pallidal neurons exhibit phasic spiking activity, which shares some firing properties with activity during singing. Shorter interspike intervals that almost exclusively occurred during singing in awake periods were also observed during sleep. The level of firing variability was consistently higher during singing and sleep than during awake non-singing states. Moreover, deceleration of firing rate, which is considered to be an important firing property for transmitting signals from Area X to the thalamic nucleus DLM, was observed mainly during sleep as well as during singing. These results suggest that songbird basal ganglia circuitry may be involved in the off-line processing potentially critical for vocal learning during sensorimotor learning phase."
