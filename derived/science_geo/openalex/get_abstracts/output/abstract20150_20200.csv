https://openalex.org/W2020637870,"Adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes to post-capillary venular endothelium or uninfected red cells is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Neoantigens at the infected red-cell surface adhere to a variety of host receptors, demonstrate serological diversity in field isolates and may also be a target of the host-protective immune response. Here we use sequential cloning of P. falciparum by micromanipulation to investigate the ability of a parasite to switch antigenic and cytoadherence phenotypes. Our data show that antigens at the parasitized cell surface undergo clonal variation in vitro in the absence of immune pressure at the rate of 2% per generation with concomitant modulations of the adhesive phenotype. A clone has the potential to switch at high frequency to a variety of antigenic and adhesive phenotypes, including a new type of cytoadherence behaviour, 'auto-agglutination' of infected erythrocytes. This rapid appearance of antigenic and functional heterogeneity has important implications for pathogenesis and acquired immunity."

https://openalex.org/W1981716245,"Nanosecond lasers were used to measure the rate of conformational changes in myoglobin after ligand dissociation at ambient temperatures. At low solvent viscosities the rate is independent of viscosity, but at high viscosities it depends on approximately the inverse first power of the viscosity. Kramers theory for unimolecular rate processes can be used to explain this result if the friction term is modified to include protein as well as solvent friction. The theory and experiment suggest that the dominant factor in markedly reducing the rate of conformational changes in myoglobin at low temperatures (less than 200 K) is the very high viscosity (greater than 10(7) centipoise) of the glycerol-water solvent. That is, at low temperatures conformational substates may not be ""frozen"" so much as ""stuck."""

https://openalex.org/W2034079946,"A three-dimensional analysis of the nuclear pore complex reveals the underlying, highly symmetric framework of this supramolecular assembly, how it is anchored in the nuclear membrane, and how it is built from many distinct, interconnected subunits. The arrangement of the subunits within the membrane pore creates a large central channel, through which active nucleocytoplasmic transport is known to occur, and eight smaller peripheral channels that are probable routes for passive diffusion of ions and small molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1536230526,"The synthetic antithrombin-binding heparin pentasaccharide and a full-length heparin of approximately 26 saccharides containing this specific sequence have been compared with respect to their interactions with antithrombin and their ability to promote inhibition and substrate reactions of antithrombin with thrombin and factor Xa. The aim of these studies was to elucidate the pentasaccharide contribution to heparin's accelerating effect on antithrombin-proteinase reactions. Pentasaccharide and full-length heparins bound antithrombin with comparable high affinities (KD values of 36 +/- 11 and 10 +/- 3 nM, respectively, at I 0.15) and induced highly similar protein fluorescence, ultraviolet and circular dichroism changes in the inhibitor. Stopped-flow fluorescence kinetic studies of the heparin binding interactions at I 0.15 were consistent with a two-step binding process for both heparins, involving an initial weak encounter complex interaction formed with similar affinities (KD 20-30 microM), followed by an inhibitor conformational change with indistinguishable forward rate constants of 520-700 s-1 but dissimilar reverse rate constants of approximately 1 s-1 for the pentasaccharide and approximately 0.2 s-1 for the full-length heparin. Second order rate constants for antithrombin reactions with thrombin and factor Xa were maximally enhanced by the pentasaccharide only 1.7-fold for thrombin, but a substantial 270-fold for factor Xa, in an ionic strength-independent manner at saturating oligosaccharide. In contrast, the full-length heparin produced large ionic strength-dependent enhancements in second order rate constants for both antithrombin reactions of 4,300-fold for thrombin and 580-fold for factor Xa at I 0.15. These enhancements were resolvable into a nonionic component ascribable to the pentasaccharide and an ionic component responsible for the additional rate increase of the larger heparin. Stoichiometric titrations of thrombin and factor Xa inactivation by antithrombin, as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the products of these reactions, indicated that pentasaccharide and full-length heparins similarly promoted the formation of proteolytically modified inhibitor during the inactivation of factor Xa by antithrombin, whereas only the full-length heparin was effective in promoting this substrate reaction of antithrombin during the reaction with thrombin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1521689717,"Resistance against the cytotoxic actions of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is an active process requiring the synthesis of TNF-inducible proteins. The specific TNF-induced proteins so far identified (manganese superoxide dismutase and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2) as having a role in resistance against TNF cytotoxicity are able to confer only partial protection to cells, suggesting that other genes are involved. A20 is a TNF-induced primary response gene which encodes a novel zinc finger protein. In this report we demonstrate that A20 protein is induced by TNF in a variety of cells. A survey of A20 expression in human breast carcinoma cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant to TNF cytotoxicity revealed increased expression of A20 message and protein in TNF-resistant cells. Constitutive expression of A20 after stable transfection of NIH 3T3 and WEHI 164 cells results in significant, but partial, resistance to TNF cytotoxicity. This work gives additional support to a role for TNF-induced immediate early response genes in protecting cells from TNF-induced death."
https://openalex.org/W1484985322,"The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2 MR/LRP) is a large cell-surface glycoprotein consisting of a 515-kDa and an 85-kDa polypeptide; this receptor is thought to be responsible for the binding and endocytosis of activated alpha 2-macroglobulin and apoE-enriched beta-very low density lipoprotein. A similar high molecular weight glycoprotein has been identified as a potential receptor for Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE). We demonstrate that the alpha 2 MR/LRP and the PE-binding glycoprotein have a similar mobility upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and are immunologically indistinguishable. Furthermore, affinity-purified alpha 2 MR/LRP binds specifically to PE but not to a mutant toxin defective in its ability to bind cells. The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, which blocks binding of ligands to alpha 2 MR/LRP, also prevents binding and subsequent toxicity of PE for mouse fibroblasts. The concentration of receptor-associated protein that was required to reduce binding and toxicity to 50% was approximately 14 nM, a value virtually identical to the KD measured for the interaction of receptor-associated protein with the purified receptor. Overall, the studies strongly suggest that the alpha 2 MR/LRP is responsible for internalizing PE."
https://openalex.org/W2049912734,"The Agrobacterium single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediate T-strand is likely transferred to the plant cell nucleus as a complex with a single VirD2 molecule at its 5 â€² end and multiple VirE2 molecules along its length. VirD2 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS); however, because the T-strand is principally coated with VirE2 molecules, VirE2 also might assist in nuclear uptake. Indeed, VirE2 fused to a reporter protein localizes to plant cell nuclei, a process mediated by two amino acid sequences with homology to the bipartite NLS of Xenopus nucleoplasmin. Moreover, tumorigenicity of an avirulent virE2 mutant is restored when inoculated on transgenic plants expressing VirE2, supporting in planta function of VirE2."

https://openalex.org/W2038093678,"The RuvA and RuvB proteins of E. coli, which are induced as part of the cellular response to DNA damage, act together to promote the branch migration of Holliday junctions. Addition of purified RuvA and RuvB to a RecA-mediated recombination reaction stimulates the rate of strand exchange and the formation of heteroduplex DNA. Stimulation does not occur via interaction with RecA; instead, RuvA and RuvB act directly upon recombination intermediates (Holliday junctions) made by RecA. We show that RuvAB-mediated branch migration requires ATP and can bypass UV-induced DNA lesions. At high RuvB concentrations, the requirement for RuvA is overcome, indicating that the RuvB ATPase provides the motor force for branch migration. RuvA protein provides specificity by binding to the Holliday junction, thereby reducing the requirement for RuvB by 50-fold. The newly discovered biochemical properties of RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC are incorporated into a model for the postreplicational repair of DNA following UV irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1966835460,"Although leishmaniasis is transmitted to humans almost exclusively by the bite of infected phlebotomine sandflies, little is known about the molecules controlling the survival and development of Leishmania parasites in their insect vectors. Adhesion of Leishmania promastigotes to the midgut epithelial cells of the sandfly was found to be an inherent property of noninfective-stage promastigotes, which was lost during their transformation to metacyclic forms, thus permitting the selective release of infective-stage parasites for subsequent transmission by bite. Midgut attachment and release was found to be controlled by specific developmental modifications in terminally exposed saccharides on lipophosphoglycan, the major surface molecule on Leishmania promastigotes."
https://openalex.org/W1483734912,"The less than optimal accumulation of immunoliposome-associated reagents at target sites has often been attributed to the rapid in vivo clearance of immunoliposomes from the blood. In an attempt to overcome the drawback of rapid clearance and use the targeting potential of immunoliposomes, we have prepared long-circulating, 111In-labeled immunoliposomes. Targeting properties and enhanced circulation times were demonstrated in a rabbit model of acute experimental myocardial infarct. The specificity of liposomes for newly exposed intracellular cardiac myosin at the necrotic sites was achieved by incorporating monoclonal antimyosin antibody. Extended circulation times were achieved by cocoating the antimyosin-liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The half-life of the immunoliposomes was 40 min, which increased to 200 min with 4% mol PEG and to approximately 1000 min with 10% mol PEG. The degree of binding of modified immunoliposomes at the target sites was also dependent on the concentration of PEG incorporated at the liposome surface. This study demonstrates the accumulation of long-circulating targeted liposomes at the area of acute rabbit experimental myocardial infarction."

https://openalex.org/W1510575902,"Laminin and type IV collagen are two major basement membrane glycoproteins. In previous studies it has been shown that nonenzymatic glucosylation induces structural alterations of these macromolecules and also reduces their ability to self-associate. In the present study, endothelial cells were tested for their ability to adhere and spread on nonenzymatically glucosylated laminin and type IV collagen. Adhesion and spreading were reduced when glucosylated macromolecules were used as substrates. Glucosylation-induced changes in adhesion and spreading may be an important initial event signaling other phenotypic modifications of cells in the microvasculature and may be a crucial factor in order to understand the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy at the molecular level."

https://openalex.org/W1580329779,"A 21-mer oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the polyadenylation signal for human hepatitis B virus (HBV) was complexed to a soluble DNA-carrier system that is targetable to hepatocytes via asialoglycoprotein receptors present on those cells. A cell line, HepG2 (2.2.15) that possesses asialoglycoprotein receptors and is permanently transfected with hepatitis B virus (ayw subtype) was exposed to complexed antisense DNA or controls. In the presence of complexed antisense DNA, the concentration of hepatitis B surface antigen in medium was 80% lower than controls after 24 h. Furthermore, during the next 6 days, there was no significant increase in surface antigen concentration in the presence of complexed antisense DNA. The inhibition could be effectively blocked by competition with an excess of free asialoglycoprotein. Total protein synthesis remained unchanged by exposure to complexed antisense sequences under identical conditions. In addition, HBV DNA in the medium and cell layers after 24-h exposure to complexed antisense sequences was 80% lower than in controls. The data indicate that antisense oligonucleotides complexed by a soluble DNA-carrier system can be targeted to cells via asialoglycoprotein receptors resulting in specific inhibition of hepatitis B viral gene expression and replication."
https://openalex.org/W1992824521,"Unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, in combination with molecular modeling and simulation techniques, was used to probe the effect of side chain structure on protein stability. Specific replacements at position 133 in T4 lysozyme included (i) leucine (wt), norvaline, ethylglycine, and alanine to measure the cost of stepwise removal of methyl groups from the hydrophobic core, (ii) norvaline and O-methyl serine to evaluate the effects of side chain solvation, and (iii) leucine, S,S-2-amino-4-methylhexanoic acid, and S-2-amino-3-cyclopentylpropanoic acid to measure the influence of packing density and side chain conformational entropy on protein stability. All of these factors (hydrophobicity, packing, conformational entropy, and cavity formation) significantly influence protein stability and must be considered when analyzing any structural change to proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1994001202,"During thymic development, thymocytes that can recognize major histocompatability complex (MHC) molecules on thymic epithelial cells are selected to survive and mature (positive selection), whereas thymocytes that recognize MHC on hematopoietic cells are destroyed (negative selection). It is not known how MHC recognition can mediate both death and survival. One model to explain this paradox proposes that thymocytes whose T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) recognize MHC with high affinity are eliminated by negative selection, whereas low affinity TCR-MHC interactions are sufficient to mediate positive selection. Here we report that, while the expression of a 2C TCR transgene leads to positive selection of thymocytes in H-2b mice, expression of both a CD8 transgene and a 2C TCR transgene causes negative selection. This observation indicates that quantitative differences in TCR-MHC recognition are a critical determinant of T cell fate, a finding predicted by the affinity model for thymic selection."
https://openalex.org/W2068543852,"Recombinant DNA techniques are now being used to develop new plant varieties that will be sources of foods, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and their by-products. These techniques enable developers to make specific genetic modifications in plants, including modifications that introduce substances into plants that could not be introduced by traditional methods. To ensure the safety of the resulting foods and to foster innovation, the FDA is taking the initiative, before foods from such plants are ready to enter the market, to see that there is an agreed upon scientific basis to evaluate the safety of whole foods and animal feeds derived from new plant varieties. Here, the authors summarize their regulatory framework and their approach to safety assessment and discuss its scientific basis. Their safety assessment approach addresses new varieties of food crops developed by both traditional and newer methods of genetic modification and provides guidance on how safety issues should be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W1996051858,"The J kappa RBP binds to the immunoglobulin recombination signal sequence flanking the kappa-type J segment. We previously isolated the highly conserved homolog of the J kappa RBP gene from D. melanogaster, which is not thought to have immunoglobulin molecules. Using many deficiency mutants and in situ hybridization, we mapped the Drosophila J kappa RBP gene in a region containing two recessive lethal mutations, i.e., br26 and br7, which shows the dominant Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) phenotype in heterozygotes. All six Su(H) alleles analyzed at the DNA level contained mutations in the Drosophila J kappa RBP gene. Since the Su(H) mutation affects peripheral nervous system development, the Drosophila J kappa RBP gene product is involved in gene regulation of peripheral nervous system development. The results also imply that the immunoglobulin recombination signal sequence and the target sequence of the Drosophila J kappa RBP protein might have a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W2068381061,"U1 snRNA is an essential splicing factor known to base pair with 5' splice sites of premessenger RNAs. We demonstrate that pairing between the universally conserved CU just downstream from the 5' junction interaction region and the 3' splice site AG contributes to efficient splicing of Schizosaccharomyces pombe introns that typify the AG-dependent class described in mammals. Strains carrying mutations in the 3' AG of an artificial intron accumulate linear precursor, indicative of a first step block. Lariat formation is partially restored in these mutants by compensatory changes in nucleotides C7 and U8 of U1 snRNA. Consistent with a general role in fission yeast splicing, mutations at C7 are lethal, while U8 mutants are growth impaired and accumulate linear, unspliced precursor to U6 snRNA. U1 RNA-mediated recognition of the 3' splice site may have origins in analogous intramolecular interactions in an ancestral self-splicing RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1513605940,"In humans and non-human primates, alternative cleavage and polyadenylation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) pre-mRNA transcripts results in two forms of mature mRNA, an unstable 3.2-kilobase (kb) form, and a relatively more stable 2.2-kb form. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) increase steady state levels of PAI-1 mRNA in Hep G2 cells independently and synergistically. In the present study we found that the rate of transcription of the PAI-1 gene is not affected by insulin, IGF-1, or both but that insulin prolongs the half-life of the 3.2-kb PAI-1 mRNA species 2.7-fold without affecting the half-life of the 2.2-kb species. In contrast IGF-1, alone or with insulin, markedly prolongs the half-lives of both species. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of regulation of expression of the PAI-1 gene by insulin and IGF-1 operating at the post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1602936320,"Incubation of human eosinophils with arachidonic acid led to the formation of a novel and potent eosinophil chemotactic lipid (ECL) (Morita, E., Schroder, J.-M., and Christophers, E. (1990) J. Immunol. 144, 1893-1900). To test the working hypothesis of whether ECL could have been formed via eosinophil-arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase we investigated whether other arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenases such as soybean lipoxygenase I catalyze formation of a similar ECL. In the presence of hemoproteins and soybean lipoxygenase I arachidonic acid is converted to an ECL, which has physicochemical properties similar to those found for the eosinophil-derived ECL. Purification of this ECL by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that ECL is structurally different from well known eosinophil chemotactic eicosanoids such as leukotriene B4, 5,15-(6E,8Z,11Z,13E)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5,15-diHETE), and (8S,15S)-(5Z,9E,11Z,13E)-dihydroxyeicosatetra eno ic acid ((8S,15S)-diHETE). UV spectra of this ECL with absorbance maxima at 230 and 278 nm revealed the presence of two independent chromophores such as a conjugated oxodiene and a conjugated diene. Catalytic hydrogenation of ECL methyl ester led to the formation of 5,15-dihydroxyarachidic acid methyl ester. Reduction of ECL with sodium borohydride produced a product which is identical with authentic (5S,15S)-(6E,8Z,11Z,13E)-diHETE. Formation of an ECL monomethoxime derivative supports the conclusion that this highly potent eosinophil chemotactic eicosanoid is structurally identical with 5-oxo-15-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2051429179,"The NH2-terminus of the signal-anchor sequence of an integral, bitopic protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane was extended both in amino acid length (from 11 to 38 amino acids) and net charge (from +4 to +8)--changes that confer on the NH2-terminus characteristics of a strong matrix-targeting signal. The protein was inserted into the outer membrane but in an inverted orientation (Ncyto-Cin). These findings suggest that, in common with other membrane systems, the orientation of a protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane can be determined by a signal that causes retention of the NH2-terminus on the cytosolic side of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1651425934,"Synthetic sialic acid analogues varying in the substitutents at position C-9 were analyzed for their ability to replace the natural receptor determinant for influenza C virus, N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). By incubation of erythrocytes with sialyltransferase and the CMP-activated analogues, the cell surface was modified to contain sialic acid with one of the following C-9 substituents: an azido, an amino, an acetamido, or a hexanoylamido group. Among these, only 9-acetamido-N-acetylneuraminic acid (9-acetamido-Neu5Ac) was able to function as a receptor determinant for influenza C virus as indicated by the ability of the virus to agglutinate the modified red blood cells. In contrast to the natural receptors, 9-acetamido-Neu5Ac-containing receptors were found to be resistant against the action of sialate 9-O-acetylesterase, the viral receptor-destroying enzyme. No difference in the hemolytic activity of influenza C virus was detected when analyzed with erythrocytes containing either Neu5,9Ac2 or 9-acetamido-Neu5Ac on their surface. This finding indicates that cleavage of the receptor is not required for the viral fusion activity. The sialic acid analogues should be useful for analyzing not only the importance of the receptor-destroying enzyme of influenza C virus, but also other biological processes involving sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1479875723,"The insulin receptor is a ligand-activated tyrosine kinase composed of two alpha and two beta subunits. A single transmembrane domain composed of 23 hydrophobic residues is contained in each beta subunit. We examined the role of the transmembrane domain in regulating insulin receptor signaling by inserting a negatively charged amino acid (Asp) for Val938 (V938D). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were stably transfected with a plasmid containing both the neomycin-resistance gene and either the wild-type or the mutant (V938D) insulin receptor cDNA. Insulin binding increased similarly in CHO cells stably transfected with the wild-type and the V938D-mutant insulin receptor cDNA. Insulin stimulated glucose transport and cell growth in cells expressing the normal insulin receptor. By contrast, in the absence of insulin, glucose transport and cell growth in CHO-V938D cells were as high as in insulin-stimulated control cells and no longer responsive to insulin stimulation. Phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor was also increased in CHO-V938D cells not exposed to insulin. These results support an essential role of the transmembrane domain of the insulin receptor in the transduction of insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1542133388,"The FLP protein of the 2-microns plasmid of yeast belongs to the integrase family of site-specific recombinases whose members form a covalent bond between a conserved tyrosine of the recombinase and the 3'-phosphoryl group at the site of cleavage. We have made an activated DNA substrate and have shown that FLP can promote efficient strand ligation without forming a covalent intermediate with the DNA substrate. The strand ligation activity of FLP is independent of its ability to cleave DNA. Since site-specific recombinases are members of the larger class of topoisomerases, these findings may be generally applicable to other members of this class of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1647030316,"The complete amino acid sequence of bacterial omega-amino acid:pyruvate aminotransferase (omega-APT) was determined from its primary structure. The enzyme protein was fragmented by CNBr cleavage, trypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 digestions. The peptides were purified and sequenced by Edman degradation. omega-ATP is composed of four identical subunits of 449 amino acids each. The calculated molecular weight of the enzyme subunit is 48,738 and that of the enzyme tetramer is 194,952. No disulfide bonds or bound sugar molecules were found in the enzyme structure, although 6 cysteine residues were determined per enzyme subunit. Sequence homologies were found between an omega-aminotransferase, i.e. mammalian and yeast ornithine delta-aminotransferases, fungal gamma-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and 7,8-diaminoperalgonate aminotransferase, and 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase. The enzyme structure is not homologous to those of aspartate aminotransferases (AspATs) including the enzymes of Escherichia coli and Sufolobus salfactaricus, though significant homology in the three-dimensional structures around the cofactor binding site has been found between omega-APT and AspATs (Watanabe, N., Sakabe, K., Sakabe, N., Higashi, T., Sasaki, K., Aibara, S., Morita, Y., Yonaha, K., Toyama, S., and Fukutani, H.

https://openalex.org/W1575853540,"Incubation of [7-2H2]cholesterol with soybean lipoxygenase and linoleic acid in the presence of oxygen gave a mixture of 5-cholestene-3 beta,7 alpha-diol, 5-cholestene-3 beta,7 beta-diol, 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholesten-7-one,5 alpha,6 alpha-epoxycholestan-3 beta-ol, and 5 beta,6 beta-epoxycholestan-3 beta-ol. The conversion into the 7-oxygenated products was associated with a very high intermolecular isotope effect (KH/KD = 15-17), suggesting that the rate-limiting step in the overall conversion is likely to be the abstraction of hydrogen at C-7 in a radical reaction. Evidence that linoleic acid is to some extent directly involved was obtained with the use of [7-3H]cholesterol. Incubation of [7-3H]cholesterol resulted in a significant incorporation of 3H in the reisolated linoleic acid fraction. The isotope effect associated with conversion of [7 alpha-2H]cholesterol into 7-oxygenated products in the lipoxygenase system was 2-3, indicating that the extraction of hydrogen is nonstereospecific. Incubation of [7-2H2]cholesterol with 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid gave the above 7-oxygenated products with relatively small isotope effects (KH/KD = 3-4). It is concluded that the most important mechanism for oxidation of cholesterol at C-7 in the lipoxygenase system involves participation of radicals and that a carbon-centered linoleic acid radical can extract hydrogen directly from cholesterol. Fatty acid hydroperoxides and their secondary products seem to be less important as initiators in connection with oxidation of cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1523269262,"Studies on sphingomyelin metabolism in rat hepatocytes were facilitated by the use of choline-deficient cells which allowed for the rapid labeling of phosphatidylcholine and as a result sphingomyelin. Pulse and pulse-chase studies with [methyl-3H]choline and [methyl-3H]methionine demonstrated that both compounds were effectively used for sphingomyelin biosynthesis and that newly made and pre-existing phosphatidylcholine could be used for sphingomyelin biosynthesis. When hepatocytes were incubated with brefeldin A, there was a 2.4-fold stimulation of the conversion of phosphatidylcholine into sphingomyelin. Since brefeldin A causes collapse of the cis/medial Golgi into the endoplasmic reticulum the stimulation of sphingomyelin biosynthesis could be due to more rapid access of the labeled phosphatidylcholine in the endoplasmic reticulum to sphingomyelin synthase in the collapsed Golgi. Forskolin inhibited the brefeldin A-induced stimulation of sphingomyelin biosynthesis. To investigate whether or not phosphorylation reactions regulate sphingomyelin metabolism, hepatocytes were incubated with okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Rather than stimulating sphingomyelin biosynthesis, okadaic acid enhanced the catabolism of sphingomyelin. In contrast, a cyclic AMP analogue and forskolin had no effect on sphingomyelin biosynthesis or catabolism. Surprisingly, other pulse-chase studies demonstrated that okadaic acid stimulated the catabolism of only newly made sphingomyelin. The brefeldin A and okadaic acid effects were independent of lysosomal involvement. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that brefeldin A and okadaic acid effects were generalized in all sphingomyelin containing membranes. The brefeldin A studies suggest that the rate of transfer of phosphatidylcholine from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi might be limiting for sphingomyelin biosynthesis. The okadaic acid studies indicate that the catabolism of sphingomyelin by a sphingomyelinase is regulated by an unidentified protein kinase and by either protein phosphatase 1 and/or 2A activity in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1618656829,"A photoactive photosystem I complex has been purified from the filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413. Cells were broken using glass beads, and the membrane fraction was solubilized with beta-dodecyl maltoside followed by two rounds of fast protein liquid chromatography on anion exchange columns. The polypeptide composition of the isolated complex was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the fractionated proteins. The purified complex consists of at least 11 proteins, identified as the PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaI, PsaJ, PsaK, PsaL, and PsaN proteins. The spectrum of the flash-induced absorbance change measured between 670 and 830 nm shows that the purified complex contains 99 +/- 11 chlorophyll a molecules per P700, the primary donor in photosystem I. The kinetics of the rereduction of oxidized P700 following an actinic flash indicate that forward electron transfer from P700 to the FA/FB iron-sulfur center acceptors is functional in the isolated complex."
https://openalex.org/W1488834070,"Phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PPH) activity was determined in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) by measuring the hydrolysis of [32P]phosphatidic acid (PA) added to cell sonicates. Enzyme activity was localized primarily to a soluble fraction. Soluble and particulate activities required magnesium and were inhibited by calcium, N-ethylmaleimide, sphingosine, and propranolol. The activity in unstimulated PMNs was 0.64 +/- 0.11 nmol of PA hydrolyzed.mg protein-1.min-1 in particulate and 4.20 +/- 0.42 in soluble fractions. Stimulation of PMNs with 1 microM f-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) for 10 min caused a slight decrease in soluble activity and a small increase in the activity of particulate fractions. Preincubation with 10 microM cytochalasin B for 5 min before FMLP stimulation markedly enhanced both of these changes. The effect of FMLP plus cytochalasin B was rapid (less than 10 s), whereas the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 microM) and phorbol myristate acetate (100 ng/ml) caused slower and smaller changes in enzyme activity. These results indicate that after chemoattractant stimulation; PPH activity decreases in the soluble fraction and increases in the particulate fraction suggesting that PPH may participate in signal transduction in the PMN."
https://openalex.org/W1585881952,"Amplification of myc proto-oncogenes has been reported in many human malignancies, but whether the amplified genes are properly regulated has not been well studied. Transcription factors that control gene expression are of limited abundance, and we have previously shown (Johnston, R.N., and Kucey, B.L. (1988) Science 242, 1551-1554) that amplified heat shock promoter sequences can compete with natural heat shock genes for these factors, resulting in heat shock gene disregulation. To establish whether protooncogenes may also be disregulated in this manner, a previously identified negative regulatory domain from the human c-myc promoter was amplified by up to 800-fold in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The amplified cells showed up to a 14-fold increase in hamster c-myc transcript abundance when compared with controls and also displayed reduced doubling times, enhanced incorporation of tritiated thymidine, elevated growth in soft agar, and a fusiform morphology, consistent with an elevation in the degree of cellular transformation. We infer that overexpression of endogenous hamster c-myc genes in the experimental cells was elicited in trans by sequestration of an inhibitory factor or complex that bound to excess nonfunctional human c-myc promoter domains. The transcriptional inhibitory activity we detect is consistent with anti-oncogene function."
