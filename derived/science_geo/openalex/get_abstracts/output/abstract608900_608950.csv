https://openalex.org/W2802943395,"Human cerebral organoids undergo vascularization and maturation in the mouse brain. Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to small brain-like structures known as brain organoids offers an unprecedented opportunity to model human brain development and disease. To provide a vascularized and functional in vivo model of brain organoids, we established a method for transplanting human brain organoids into the adult mouse brain. Organoid grafts showed progressive neuronal differentiation and maturation, gliogenesis, integration of microglia, and growth of axons to multiple regions of the host brain. In vivo two-photon imaging demonstrated functional neuronal networks and blood vessels in the grafts. Finally, in vivo extracellular recording combined with optogenetics revealed intragraft neuronal activity and suggested graft-to-host functional synaptic connectivity. This combination of human neural organoids and an in vivo physiological environment in the animal brain may facilitate disease modeling under physiological conditions."

Many popular methods, such as antibody labeling, are used to add physical fluorescent labels to specific cellular constituents. However, these approaches have significant drawbacks, including inconsistency; limitations in the number of simultaneous labels because of spectral overlap; and necessary perturbations of the experiment, such as fixing the cells, to generate the measurement. Here, we show that a computational machine-learning approach, which we call “in silico labeling” (ISL), reliably predicts some fluorescent labels from transmitted-light images of unlabeled fixed or live biological samples. ISL predicts a range of labels, such as those for nuclei, cell type (e.g., neural), and cell state (e.g., cell death). Because prediction happens in silico, the method is consistent, is not limited by spectral overlap, and does not disturb the experiment. ISL generates biological measurements that would otherwise be problematic or impossible to acquire. Microscopy is a central method in life sciences.

ISL generates biological measurements that would otherwise be problematic or impossible to acquire. Microscopy offers a uniquely powerful way to observe cells and molecules across time and space. However, visualizing cellular structure is challenging, as biological samples are mostly water and are poorly refractile. Optical and electronic techniques amplify contrast and make small signals visible to the human eye, but resolving certain structural features or functional characteristics requires different techniques. In particular, fluorescence labeling with dyes or dye-conjugated antibodies provides unprecedented opportunities to reveal macromolecular structures, metabolites, and other subcellular constituents. Nevertheless, fluorescence labeling has limitations. Specificity varies; labeling is time consuming; specialized reagents are required; labeling protocols can kill cells; and even live cell protocols can be phototoxic. The reagents used for immunocytochemistry commonly produce non-specific signals because of antibody cross-reactivity, have significant batch-to-batch variability, and have limited time windows for image acquisition in which they maintain signal. Lastly, measuring the label requires an optical system that can reliably distinguish it from other signals in the sample while coping with fluorophore bleaching. We hypothesized that microscopic images of unlabeled cells contain more information than is readily apparent, information that traditionally requires immunohistochemistry to reveal. To test this, we leveraged major advances in deep learning (DL), a type of machine learning that has resulted in deep neural networks capable of superhuman performance on specialized tasks (Schroff et al., 2015Schroff, F., Kalenichenko, D., and Philbin, J.

Prior work using deep learning to analyze microscopy images has been limited, often relying on known cell locations (Held et al., 2010Held M. Schmitz M.H.A. Fischer B. Walter T. Neumann B. Olma M.H.

As such, it is unclear whether deep learning approaches would provide a significant and broad-based advance in image analysis and are capable of extracting useful, not readily apparent, information from unlabeled images. Here, we sought to determine if computers can find and predict features in unlabeled images that normally only become visible with invasive labeling. We designed a deep neural network and trained it on paired sets of unlabeled and labeled images. Using additional unlabeled images of fixed or live cells never seen by the network, we show it can accurately predict the location and texture of cell nuclei, the health of a cell, the type of cell in a mixture, and the type of subcellular structure. We also show that the trained network exhibits transfer learning: once trained to predict a set of labels, it could learn new labels with a small number of additional data, resulting in a highly generalizable algorithm, adaptable across experiments. To train a deep neural network to predict fluorescence images from transmitted-light images, we first created a dataset of training examples, consisting of pairs of transmitted-light z-stack images and fluorescence images that are pixel registered. The training pairs come from numerous experiments across various labs, samples, imaging modalities, and fluorescent labels. This is a means to improve the network via multi-task learning: having it learn across several tasks (Figure 1A). Multi-task learning can improve networks when the tasks are similar, because common features can be learned and refined across the tasks. We chose deep neural networks (Figure 1B) as the statistical model to learn from the dataset because they can express many patterns and result in systems with substantially superhuman performance. We trained the network to learn the correspondence rule (Figure 1C) - a function mapping from the set of z-stacks of transmitted-light images to the set of images of all fluorescent labels in the training set. If our hypothesis is correct, the trained network would examine an unseen z-stack of transmitted-light images (Figure 1D) and generate images of corresponding fluorescent signals (Figure 1E). Performance is measured by the similarity of the predicted fluorescence images and the true images for held-out examples. The training datasets (Table 1) include different cell types with different labels made by different laboratories. We used human motor neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), primary murine cortical cultures, and a breast cancer cell line. Hoechst or DAPI was used to label cell nuclei; CellMask was used to label plasma membrane; and propidium iodide was used to label cells with compromised membranes. Some cells were immunolabeled with antibodies against the neuron-specific β-tubulin III (TuJ1) protein, the Islet1 protein for identifying motor neurons, the dendrite-localized microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2), or pan-axonal neurofilaments.Table 1Training Data Types and ConfigurationsCondition DesignationCell TypeFixedTransmitted LightFluorescent Label #1 and Imaging ModalityFluorescent Label #2 and Imaging ModalityFluorescent Label #3 and Imaging ModalityTraining Data (Wells)Testing Data (Wells)Microscope Field per Well (μm)Stitched Image per Well (Pixels)bApproximate size after preprocessing.Pixel Width before/after Image Processing (nm)LaboratoryA (red)human motor neuronsaDifferentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells.yesbright fieldHoechst (nuclei) wide fieldanti-TuJ1 (neurons) wide fieldanti-Islet1 (motor neurons) wide field223940 × 1,3001,900 × 2,600250/500RubinB (yellow)human motor neuronsaDifferentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells.yesphase contrastDAPI (nuclei) confocalanti-MAP2 (dendrites) confocalanti-neurofilament (axons) confocal2141,400 × 1,4004,600 × 4,600150/300FinkbeinerC (green)primary rat cortical culturesnophase contrastHoechst (nuclei) confocalpropidium iodide (dead cells) confocal–728720 × 7202,400 × 2,400150/300FinkbeinerD (blue)primary rat cortical culturesyesphase contrastDAPI (nuclei) confocalanti-MAP2 (dendrites) confocalanti-neurofilament (axons) confocal211,400 × 1,4004,600 × 4,600150/300FinkbeinerE (violet)human breast cancer lineyesDICDAPI (nuclei) confocalCellMask (membrane) confocal–1cThis condition purposely contains only a single well of training data to demonstrate that the model can learn new tasks from very little data through multi-task learning.11,100 × 1,1003,500 × 3,500160/320GoogleColor code, which is denoted in parentheses in the first column, refers to the border color in the figures that was added to enhance readability.a Differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells.b Approximate size after preprocessing.c This condition purposely contains only a single well of training data to demonstrate that the model can learn new tasks from very little data through multi-task learning.

To improve the accuracy of the network, we collected multiple transmitted-light images with varying focal planes. Monolayer cultures are not strictly two dimensional, so any single image plane contains limited information about each cell. Translating the focal plane through the sample captures features that are in sharp focus in some images while out of focus in others (Figure 1 in Data S1). Normally, out-of-focus features are undesirable, but we hypothesized the implicit three-dimensional information in these blurred features could be an additional source of information. We, thus, collected sets of images (z-stacks) of the same microscope field from several planes at equidistant intervals along the z axis and centered at the plane that was most in-focus for the majority of the cell bodies. During collection, the microscope stage was kept fixed in x and y, while all images in a set were acquired, to preserve (x, y) registration of pixels between the transmitted-light and fluorescence images (Figure 2; Table 1). With these training sets, we used supervised machine learning (ML) (Table S1) to determine if predictive relationships could be found between transmitted-light and fluorescence images of the same cells. We used the unprocessed z-stack as input for machine-learning algorithm development. The images were preprocessed to accommodate constraints imposed by the samples, data acquisition, and the network. For example, we normalized pixel values of the fluorescence images (STAR Methods) as a way to make the pixel-prediction problem well defined. In addition, we aimed to predict the maximum projection of the fluorescence images in the z axis. This was to account for the fact that pairs of transmitted and fluorescence images were not perfectly registered along the z axis and exhibited differences in depth of field and optical sectioning. Our deep neural network performs the task of non-linear pixel-wise classification. It has a multi-scale input (Figure 3). This endows it with five computational paths: a path for processing fine detail that operates on a small length-scale near the center of the network’s input, a path for processing coarse context that operates on a large length-scale in a broad region around the center of the network’s input, and three paths in between. Inspired by U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015Ronneberger O. Fischer P. Brox T. U-net: convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation.in: Navab N. Hornegger J. Wells W.M. Frangi A.F. International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention. Springer, 2015: 234-241Crossref Scopus (32829) Google Scholar) and shown in the leftmost path of Figure 3 in Data S1, the computational path with the finest detail stays at the original length scale of the input so that local information can flow from the input to the output without being blurred. Multi-scale architectures are common in animal vision systems and have been reported to be useful in vision networks (Farabet et al., 2013Farabet C. Couprie C. Najman L. Lecun Y. Learning hierarchical features for scene labeling.IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 2013; 35: 1915-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). We took a multi-scale approach (Farabet et al., 2013Farabet C. Couprie C. Najman L. Lecun Y. Learning hierarchical features for scene labeling.IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 2013; 35: 1915-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar), in which intermediate layers at multiple scales are aligned by resizing, but used transposed convolutions (Zeiler et al., 2010Zeiler, M.D., Krishnan, D., Taylor, G.W., and Fergus, R. (2010). Deconvolutional networks. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on (IEEE), pp. 2528–2535.Google Scholar) to learn the resizing function rather than fixing it like in Farabet et al., 2013Farabet C. Couprie C. Najman L. Lecun Y. Learning hierarchical features for scene labeling.IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 2013; 35: 1915-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar. This lets the network learn the spatial interpolation rule that best fits its task. The network is composed of repeated modules, as in the popular Inception network used in computer vision (Szegedy et al., 2015aSzegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Sermanet, P., Reed, S., Anguelov, D., Erhan, D., Vanhoucke, V., and Rabinovich, A. (2015a). Going deeper with convolutions. arXiv:1409.4842v1, https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842.Google Scholar), but with the Inception module optimized for performance (STAR Methods; Figure 2 in Data S1) using Google Hypertune (Golovin et al., 2017Golovin, D., Solnik, B., Moitra, S., Kochanski, G., Karro, J., and Sculley, D. (2017). Google Vizier: a service for black-box optimization. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (ACM), pp. 1487–1495.Google Scholar). Hypertune is an automatic function optimizer that tries to find a minimum of a function in a bounded space. We expressed module design choices as parameters and the prediction error as the function to be optimized, and used Hypertune to select the design, optimizing over the training dataset, with the test set withheld. The learned part of the deep neural network is primarily made up of convolutional kernels, small filters that convolve over prior layers to compute the next layers. These kernels are restricted to the interiors of the input layers (i.e., the convolutions are valid or not zero-padded) (Table S1) (Dumoulin and Visin, 2016Dumoulin, V., and Visin, F. (2016). A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning. arXiv:1603.07285v2, https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285.Google Scholar), making the network approximately translation invariant. As such, each predicted pixel of the network’s final output is computed by approximately the same function, but using different input data, improving the scalability and accuracy while minimizing boundary effects. We implemented the network in TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., et al. (2015). TensorFlow: large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems. arXiv, arXiv:1603.04467v2, https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04467.Google Scholar), a popular open-source library for deep learning. It was trained using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014Kingma, D., and Ba, J. (2014). Adam: A method for stochastic optimization. arXiv:1412.6980v9, https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980.Google Scholar), a commonly used gradient-based function optimizer included in TensorFlow. The final network (STAR Methods) produces a discrete probability distribution over 256 intensity values (corresponding to 8-bit pixels) for each pixel of the output image. It reads z-stacks of transmitted-light images collected with bright field, phase contrast, or differential interference contrast methods and outputs simultaneous predictions for every label kind that appeared in the training datasets. It achieves a lower loss on our data than other popular models while using fewer parameters (Figure S4B; STAR Methods). We asked whether we could train a network to predict the labeling of cell nuclei with Hoechst or DAPI in transmitted-light images of fixed and live cells. With our trained network, we made predictions of nuclear labels (Figures 4 and S1) on the test images (Table 1) (i.e., images withheld during network development and training). Qualitatively, the true and predicted nuclear labels looked nearly identical, and the network’s few mistakes appeared to be special cases (e.g., cell-like debris lacking DNA). We created heatmaps of true versus predicted pixel intensities and quantified the correlation. Pearson correlation (ρ) values of 0.87 or higher indicated that the network accurately predicted the extent and level of labeling and that the predicted pixel intensities reflect the true intensities on a per-pixel basis. The network learned features that could be generalized, given that these predictions were made using different cell types and image acquisition methods.Figure S1Example of Predicted Images Showing the Noise Floor, Related to Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6Show full captionUnlike the images in all other figures, pixel intensities here were not cropped at the approximate noise floor; this is why background regions are not black.

To assess the utility of the per-pixel predictions, we gave a team of biologists real and predicted nuclear label images and asked them to annotate the images with the locations of the cell centers. With annotations on real images as ground truth, we used the methodology of Coelho et al., 2009Coelho, L.P., Shariff, A., and Murphy, R.F. (2009). Nuclear segmentation in microscope cell images: a hand-segmented dataset and comparison of algorithms. Proc. IEEE Int. Symp. Biomed. Imaging 5193098, 518–521.Google Scholar to classify the network’s errors into four categories (Figures 4B and S2A). Under conditions where the amount of cellular debris was high (e.g., condition B) or distortions in image quality evident (e.g., condition C), the network’s precision and recall drops to the mid-90%. In other cases, the network was nearly perfect, even with dense cell clumps (e.g., condition D). To determine whether transmitted-light images contain sufficient information to predict whether a cell is alive or dead, we trained the network with images of live cells treated with propidium iodide (PI), a dye that preferentially labels dead cells. We then made predictions on withheld images of live cells (Figures 5A and S1). The network was remarkably accurate, though not as much as it was for nuclear prediction. For example, it correctly guessed that an entity (Figure 5A, second magnified outset) is actually DNA-free cell debris and not a proper cell and picked out a single dead cell in a mass of live cells (third outset). To obtain a quantitative grasp of the network’s behavior, we created heatmaps and calculated linear fits (Figure 5B). The Pearson ρ value of 0.85 for propidium iodide indicated a strong linear relationship between the true and predicted labels. To understand the network’s ability to recognize cell death and how it compared to a trained biologist, we had the real and predicted propidium iodide-labeled images annotated, following the same method as for the nuclear labels (Figure 5C). A subset of the discrepancies between the two annotations in which a biologist inspecting the phase contrast images determined that an “added” error is a correct prediction of DNA-free cell debris was reclassified into a new category (Figure S2; STAR Methods). The network has an empirical precision and recall of 98% at 97%, with a 1% chance that two dead cells will be predicted to be one dead cell. To further evaluate the utility and biological significance of the quantitative pixel-wise predictions of the network, we wondered whether network predictions of DAPI/Hoechst labeling could be used to perform morphological analysis of nuclei and accurately detect and distinguish live cells from dead ones. We showed previously that neurons in vitro tend to die by apoptosis, a programmed cell death process that causes nuclei to shrink and round up (Arrasate et al., 2004Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Inclusion body formation reduces levels of mutant huntingtin and the risk of neuronal death.Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). To perform the analysis, we used the transmitted-light images above to make predictions of nuclear labels and then used those collections of pixel predictions to define nuclear objects and measured their dimensions. We then compared the dimensions of nuclei among cells determined to be dead or alive based on propidium iodide labeling. We found that the mean size of nuclei of live cells quantified from morphological analysis of pixel-wise predictions was very similar to that measured from actual labels (6.8±1.3 μm vs. 7.0±1.4 μm) (Figure S3). Likewise, the nuclear sizes of dead cells from predicted labels was very similar to actual measurements (4.7±1.1 μm versus 4.9±1.0 μm). Importantly, quantitative analysis of nuclear morphology based on pixel predictions sensitively and accurately identified and distinguished a subset of dead cells from neighboring live cells based on a change in the size of their nucleus. The result corroborates the predictions based on propidium iodide staining and demonstrates the utility of the network to make biologically meaningful quantitative morphological measurements based on pixel predictions. We tested the network’s ability to predict which cells were neurons in mixed cultures of cells containing neurons, astrocytes, and immature dividing cells (Figures 6 and S1). Four biologists independently annotated real and predicted TuJ1 labeling, an indication that the cell is a neuron. We compared the annotations of each biologist (Figure 6) and assessed variability among biologists by conducting pairwise comparisons of their annotations on the real labels only. With TuJ1 labels for the condition A culture, the performance of biologists annotating whether an object is a neuron was highly variable, consistent with the prevailing view that determining cell type based on human judgment is difficult. We found humans disagree on whether an object is a neuron ∼10% of the time, and ∼2% of the time they disagree on whether an object is one cell or several cells. When a biologist was presented with true and predicted labels of the same sample, 11%–15% of the time the type of cell is scored differently from one occasion to the next, and 2%–3% of the time the number of cells is scored differently. Thus, the frequency of inconsistency introduced by using the predicted labels instead of the true labels is comparable to the frequency of inconsistency between biologists evaluating the same true labels. Given the success of the network in predicting whether a cell is a neuron, we wondered whether it also could accurately predict whether a neurite extending from a cell was an axon or a dendrite. The task suffers from a global coherence problem (STAR Methods), and it was also unclear to us a priori whether transmitted-light images contained enough information to distinguish dendrites from axons. Surprisingly, the final network could predict independent dendrite and axon labels (Figures S1 and S4). It does well in predicting dendrites in conditions of low- (condition B) and high- (condition D) plating densities, whereas the axon predictions are much better under conditions of low-plating densities (condition B). Does the network require large training datasets to learn to predict new things? Or does the generic model represented by a trained network enable it to learn new relationships in different datasets more quickly or with less training data than an untrained network? To address these questions, we used transfer learning to learn a label from a single well, demonstrating that the network can share learned features across tasks. To further emulate the experience of a new practitioner adapting this technique to their research, we chose data using a new label from a different cell type, imaged with a different transmitted-light technology, produced by a laboratory other than those that provided the previous training data. In condition E, differential interference contrast imaging was used to collect transmitted-light data from unlabeled cancer cells, and CellMask, a membrane label, was used to collect foreground data (Table 1). With only the 1,100 ×1,100 μm center of the one training well, regularized by simultaneously training on conditions A, B, C, and D, the network learned to predict cell foreground with a Pearson ρ score of 0.95 (Figures S1 and S5). Though that metric was computed on a single test well, the test images of the well contain 12 million pixels each and hundreds of cells. This suggests that the generic model represented by the trained network could continue to improve its performance with additional training examples, and increase the ability and speed with which it learns to perform new tasks. Here, we report a new approach: in silico labeling (ISL). This deep learning system can predict"
https://openalex.org/W2797326673,"Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant defense hormone required for immunity. Arabidopsis NPR1 and NPR3/NPR4 were previously shown to bind SA and all three proteins were proposed as SA receptors. NPR1 functions as a transcriptional co-activator, whereas NPR3/NPR4 were suggested to function as E3 ligases that promote NPR1 degradation. Here we report that NPR3/NPR4 function as transcriptional co-repressors and SA inhibits their activities to promote the expression of downstream immune regulators. npr4-4D, a gain-of-function npr4 allele that renders NPR4 unable to bind SA, constitutively represses SA-induced immune responses. In contrast, the equivalent mutation in NPR1 abolishes its ability to bind SA and promote SA-induced defense gene expression. Further analysis revealed that NPR3/NPR4 and NPR1 function independently to regulate SA-induced immune responses. Our study indicates that both NPR1 and NPR3/NPR4 are bona fide SA receptors, but play opposite roles in transcriptional regulation of SA-induced defense gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2801396275,"Accelerating PALM/STORM microscopy with deep learning allows super-resolution imaging of >1,000 cells in a few hours. The speed of super-resolution microscopy methods based on single-molecule localization, for example, PALM and STORM, is limited by the need to record many thousands of frames with a small number of observed molecules in each. Here, we present ANNA-PALM, a computational strategy that uses artificial neural networks to reconstruct super-resolution views from sparse, rapidly acquired localization images and/or widefield images. Simulations and experimental imaging of microtubules, nuclear pores, and mitochondria show that high-quality, super-resolution images can be reconstructed from up to two orders of magnitude fewer frames than usually needed, without compromising spatial resolution. Super-resolution reconstructions are even possible from widefield images alone, though adding localization data improves image quality. We demonstrate super-resolution imaging of >1,000 fields of view containing >1,000 cells in ∼3 h, yielding an image spanning spatial scales from ∼20 nm to ∼2 mm. The drastic reduction in acquisition time and sample irradiation afforded by ANNA-PALM enables faster and gentler high-throughput and live-cell super-resolution imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2797828983,"Cells demonstrate plasticity following injury, but the extent of this phenomenon and the cellular mechanisms involved remain underexplored. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and lineage tracing, we uncover that myoepithelial cells (MECs) of the submucosal glands (SMGs) proliferate and migrate to repopulate the airway surface epithelium (SE) in multiple injury models. Specifically, SMG-derived cells display multipotency and contribute to basal and luminal cell types of the SMGs and SE. Ex vivo expanded MECs have the potential to repopulate and differentiate into SE cells when grafted onto denuded airway scaffolds. Significantly, we find that SMG-like cells appear on the SE of both extra- and intra-lobular airways of large animal lungs following severe injury.

Because SMGs are abundant and present deep within airways, they may serve as a reserve cell source for enhancing human airway regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2801270766,"Little research has assessed the impact of emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) and economic IPV on women’s mental health. Using cross-sectional data from the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial baseline, in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa we assess three questions. First, whether emotional IPV and economic IPV make independent contributions to mental health outcomes; second what matters, severity, variety, or absolute experience? and third, are some items more important in driving mental health impacts than others? We assess associations between past 12-month emotional IPV, past 12-month economic IPV, and past week depressive symptoms and past four-week suicidal ideation. We describe the prevalence of each mental health outcome by individual items, including never/ever and frequency, and combined emotional IPV, and economic IPV, reporting depression scores and percentage of suicidal ideation and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Second, we created four-level categorical variables for combinations of emotional, economic, sexual and physical IPV, and present its frequency, and the mean/% and 95% CI for depression symptomatology and suicidal ideation. 680 women (aged 18–30) were enrolled. High levels of past year emotional IPV, economic IPV were reported. 45.3% reported clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and 30.0% past four-week suicidal ideation. All measures of emotional IPV and economic IPV showed a consistent positive correlation with CESD scores, and suicidal ideation. For all four-level categorical constructs the highest depression scores, and prevalence of suicidal ideation, were for combinations of emotional IPV or economic IPV with physical and/or sexual IPV. For depression in 17/18 combinations this was significantly different compared to women reporting no IPV. For suicidal ideation this was significant in 6/18 combinations all related to economic IPV. Emotional IPV and economic IPV have independent associations with women’s mental health, beyond physical IPV and sexual IPV, and also have distinct patterns between each other.

https://openalex.org/W2800773682,"Reduced climatic suitability due to climate change in cocoa growing regions of Ghana is expected in the coming decades. This threatens farmers’ livelihood and the cocoa sector. Climate change adaptation requires an improved understanding of existing cocoa production systems and farmers’ coping strategies. This study characterized current cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient within the cocoa belt of Ghana. The objectives were to 1) compare existing production and income diversification between dry, mid and wet climatic regions, and 2) identify shade trees in cocoa agroforestry systems and their distribution along the climatic gradient. Our results showed that current mean cocoa yield level of 288kg ha-1yr-1 in the dry region was significantly lower than in the mid and wet regions with mean yields of 712 and 849 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively. In the dry region, farmers diversified their income sources with non-cocoa crops and off-farm activities while farmers at the mid and wet regions mainly depended on cocoa (over 80% of annual income). Two shade systems classified as medium and low shade cocoa agroforestry systems were identified across the studied regions. The medium shade system was more abundant in the dry region and associated to adaptation to marginal climatic conditions. The low shade system showed significantly higher yield in the wet region but no difference was observed between the mid and dry regions. This study highlights the need for optimum shade level recommendation to be climatic region specific."
https://openalex.org/W2802236540,"Sea turtles are distributed in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2800838256,"The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many bHLH superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (Prunus persica) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from Arabidopsis. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 bHLH genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and Arabidopsis. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous bHLH genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of bHLH genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several bHLH genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2801530817,"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a causal agent of the amphibian fungal skin disease chytridiomycosis, has been implicated in the decline and extinction of over 200 species worldwide since the 1970s. Despite almost two decades of research, the history of Bd and its global spread is not well understood. However, the spread of the Global Panzootic Lineage of Bd (Bd-GPL), the lineage associated with amphibian die-offs, has been linked with the American bullfrog (Rana [Aqurana] catesbeiana) and global trade. Interestingly, R. catesbeiana is native to the eastern U.S., where no Bd-related declines have been observed despite Bd’s presence since the late 1800s. In contrast Bd has been found to have emerged in California and Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s, after which epizootics (i.e., epidemics in wildlife) ensued. We hypothesize that Bd-GPL spread from the eastern U.S. with the introduction of R. catesbeiana into the western US, resulting in epizootics and declines of native host species. Using museum records, we investigated the historical relationship between R. catesbeiana and Bd invasion in the western US and found that R. catesbeiana arrived in the same year or prior to Bd in most western watersheds that had data for both species, suggesting that Bd-GPL may have originated in the eastern US and R. catesbeiana may have facilitated Bd invasion in the western US. To predict areas with greatest suitability for Bd, we created a suitability model by integrating habitat suitability and host availability. When we incorporated invasion history with high Bd suitability, we found that watersheds with non-native R. catesbeiana in the mountain ranges of the West Coast have the highest disease risk. These findings shed light on the invasion history and disease dynamics of Bd in North America. Targeted historical surveys using archived specimens in natural history collections and present-day field surveys along with more localized, community-level studies, monitoring, and surveillance are needed to further test this hypothesis and grow our understanding of the disease ecology and host-pathogen dynamics of Bd."
https://openalex.org/W2802957985,"Across the boreal forest of Canada, habitat disturbance is the ultimate cause of caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) declines. Habitat restoration is a focus of caribou recovery efforts, with a goal to finding ways to reduce predator use of disturbances, and caribou-predator encounters. One of the most pervasive disturbances within caribou ranges in Alberta, Canada are seismic lines cleared for energy exploration. Seismic lines facilitate predator movement, and although vegetation on some seismic lines is regenerating, it remains unknown whether vegetation regrowth is sufficient to alter predator response. We used Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and GPS locations, to understand how vegetation and other attributes of seismic lines influence movements of two predators, wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). During winter, wolves moved towards seismic lines regardless of vegetation height, while during spring wolves moved towards seismic lines with higher vegetation. During summer, wolves moved towards seismic lines with lower vegetation and also moved faster near seismic lines with vegetation <0.7 m. Seismic lines with lower vegetation height were preferred by grizzly bears during spring and summer, but there was no relationship between vegetation height and grizzly bear movement rates. These results suggest that wolves use seismic lines for travel during summer, but during winter wolf movements relative to seismic lines could be influenced by factors additional to movement efficiency; potentially enhanced access to areas frequented by ungulate prey. Grizzly bears may be using seismic lines for movement, but could also be using seismic lines as a source of vegetative food or ungulate prey. To reduce wolf movement rate, restoration could focus on seismic lines with vegetation <1 m in height. However our results revealed that seismic lines continue to influence wolf movement behaviour decades after they were built, and even at later stages of regeneration. Therefore it remains unknown at what stage of natural regeneration, if any, wolves cease to respond to seismic lines. To reduce wolf response to seismic lines, active restoration tactics like blocking seismic lines and tree planting, along with management of alternate prey, could be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2800802049,"Subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) might be a meaningful indicator of dementia onset or mild cognitive impairment, and identifying the related factors of SCC could contribute to preventing these diseases. However, the relationship between SCC and lifestyle factors remains largely unproven. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of type of sedentary behavior, physical activity, or their combination with SCC among community-dwelling older adults. In 2016, 6677 community-living elderly were recruited to participate in a survey investigating cognition, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. In total, 5328 participants responded to the questionnaire (79.8% valid response rate). SCC was assessed using the National Functional Survey Questionnaire (Kihon checklist). The relationships between SCC and physical activity, sedentary behavior (reading books or newspapers, and television viewing), or combined physical activity and sedentary behavior were examined via multiple logistic regression analysis. The analysis revealed that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (≥150 min/week) was significantly related with a lower risk of SCC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74–0.97), and that reading behavior showed a dose-response relationship with SCC (OR for 10–20 min/day = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.53–0.75; OR for 20–30 min/day = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.49–0.71; OR for ≥30 min/day = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.39–0.57). In addition, among those reporting high physical activity and ≥30 min/day for reading time, the OR for SCC was 0.40 (95% CI = 0.32–0.50) compared with the combined group reporting lower physical activity and non-readers. The present study shows that increased physical activity and reading time may be related to a reduced risk for SCC among community-dwelling older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2801807401,"The molecular characterization of endometrial cancer (EC) can facilitate identification of various tumor subtypes. Although EC patients with POLE mutations reproducibly demonstrate better prognosis, the outcome of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) remains controversial. This study attempted to interrogate whether genetic stratification of EC can identify distinct subsets with prognostic significance.A cohort of 138 EC patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent was enrolled. Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in the POLE and KRAS genes. MSI analysis was performed using four mononucleotide repeat markers and methylation status of the MLH1 promoter was measured by a fluorescent bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protein expression for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).Extensive hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter was observed in 69.6% ECs with MLH1 deficiency and 3.5% with MMR proficiency, but in none of the ECs with loss of other MMR genes (P < .0001). MSI-positive and POLE mutations were found in 29.0% and 8.7% EC patients, respectively. Our MSI analysis showed a sensitivity of 92.7% for EC patients with MMR deficiency, and a specificity of 97.9% for EC patients with MMR proficiency. In univariate and multivariate analyses, POLE mutations and MSI status was significantly associated with progression-free survival (P = 0.0129 and 0.0064, respectively) but not with endometrial cancer-specific survival.This study provides significant evidence that analyses of proofreading POLE mutations and MSI status based on mononucleotide repeat markers are potentially useful biomarkers to identify EC patients with better prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2802477420,"Individuals with low levels of education systematically have worse health than those with medium or high levels of education. Yet there are few examples of attempts to summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions targeting health-related behavior among individuals with low education levels, and a large part of the literature is descriptive rather than analytical. A rapid review was carried out to examine the impact of such interventions. Special attention was given to the relative impact of the interventions among individuals with low education levels and their potential to reduce health inequality. Of 1,365 articles initially identified, only 31 were deemed relevant for the review, and of those, nine met the inclusion and quality criteria. The comparability of included studies was limited due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and definitions of exposure and outcome variables. Therefore, instead of performing a formal meta-analysis, an overall assessment of the available evidence was made and summarized into some general conclusions. We found no support for the notion that the methods used to reduce smoking decrease inequalities in health between educational groups. Evidence was also limited for decreasing inequality through interventions regarding dietary intake, physical activity and mental health. Only one study was found using an intervention designed to decrease socioeconomic inequalities by increasing the use of breast cancer screening. Thus, we concluded that there is a lack of support regarding this type of intervention as well. Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2801181825,"Background Despite concerns about the representativeness of patients from ALS tertiary centers as compared to the ALS general population, the extent of referral bias in clinical studies remains largely unknown. Using data from EURALS consortium we aimed to assess nature, extent and impact of referral bias. Methods Four European ALS population-based registries located in Ireland, Piedmont, Puglia, Italy, and Limousin, France, covering 50 million person-years, participated. Demographic and clinic characteristics of ALS patients diagnosed in tertiary referral centers were contrasted with the whole ALS populations enrolled in registries in the same geographical areas. Results Patients referred to ALS centers were younger (with difference ranging from 1.1 years to 2.4 years), less likely to present a bulbar onset, with a higher proportion of familial antecedents and a longer survival (ranging from 11% to 15%) when compared to the entire ALS population in the same geographic area. Conclusions A trend for referral bias is present in cohorts drawn from ALS referral centers. The magnitude of the possible referral bias in a particular tertiary center can be estimated through a comparison with ALS patients drawn from registry in the same geographic area. Studies based on clinical cohorts should be cautiously interpreted. The presence of a registry in the same area may improve the complete ascertainment in the referral center."
https://openalex.org/W2801406987,"Currently, information on nearshore reef-associated fisheries is frequently disparate or incomplete, creating a challenge for effective management. This study utilized an existing non-commercial fishery dataset from Hawaiʻi, covering the period 2004–13, to estimate a variety of fundamental fishery parameters, including participation, effort, gear use, and catch per unit effort. We then used those data to reconstruct total catches per island. Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold. By combining those data with reported commercial catch data, we estimated annual catch of nearshore reef-associated fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands over the study period to be 1,167,758 ± 43,059 kg year-1 (mean ± standard error). Average annual commercial reef fish catch over the same time period—184,911 kg year-1—was 16% of the total catch, but that proportion varied greatly among islands, ranging from 23% on Oʻahu to 5% on Molokaʻi. These results emphasize the importance of reef fishing in Hawaiʻi for reasons beyond commerce, such as food security and cultural practice, and highlight the large differences in fishing practices across the Hawaiian Islands."
https://openalex.org/W2801792634,"We previously demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 5 (TRPV5) expression was decreased in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared with that in normal kidney tissues, a finding that was correlated with vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, but further investigations is warranted. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether VDR could regulate the expression of TRPV5 and affect proliferation and metastasis in RCC. In this study, we used lentivirus to conduct the model of VDR overexpression and knockdown caki-1 and 786-O RCC cell lines in vitro. The results demonstrated that VDR overexpression significantly inhibited RCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis by the MTT, transwell cell migration/invasion and flow cytometry assays, respectively. However, VDR knockdown in RCC cells had the opposite effect. The RNA-sequence assay, which was assessed in caki-1 cells after VDR overexpression and knockdown, also indicated that significantly differentially expressed genes were associated with cell apoptotic, differentiation, proliferation and migration. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that VDR knockdown increased TRPV5 expression and VDR overexpression decreased TRPV5 expression in caki-1 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TRPV5 expression suppressed the VDR knockdown-induced change in the proliferation, migration and invasion in caki-1 cells. Taken together, these findings confirmed that VDR functions as a tumour suppressor in RCC cells and suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of RCC through regulating the expression of TRPV5."
https://openalex.org/W2800438080,"Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) has recently been studied extensively for its health-supplementing and therapeutic activities against a variety of ailments. Several independent studies have experimentally demonstrated pharmaceutical potential of its active Withanolides, Withaferin A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) and Withanolide A (Wil-A). However, to promote its use in herbal industry, an environmentally sustainable cultivation and high yield are warranted. In modern agriculture strategies, there has been indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers to boost the crop-yield, however the practice largely ignored its adverse effect on the quality of soil and the environment. In view of these, we attempted to recruit Vermicompost (Vcom, 20–100%) as an organic fertilizer of choice during the sowing and growing phases of Ashwagandha plants. We report that (i) pre-soaking of seeds for 12 h in Vermicompost leachate (Vcom-L) and Vermicompost tea (Vcom-T) led to higher germination, (ii) binary combination of pre-soaking of seeds and cultivation in Vcom (up to 80%) resulted in further improvement both in germination and seedling growth, (iii) cultivated plants in the presence of Vcom+Vcom-L showed higher leaf and root mass, earlier onset of flowering and fruiting and (iv) leaves from the Vcom+Vcom-L cultivated plants showed higher level of active Withanolides, Withanone (Wi-N), Withanolide A (Wil-A) and Withaferin A (Wi-A) and showed anticancer activities in cell culture assays.

Here, using fluorescence spectroscopy, we investigated the interaction between the LIP and peroxynitrite by monitoring peroxynitrite-dependent accumulation of nitrosated and oxidized fluorescent intracellular indicators. We found that, in murine macrophages, removal of the LIP with membrane-permeable iron chelators sustainably accelerates the peroxynitrite-dependent oxidation and nitrosation of these indicators. These observations could not be reproduced in cell-free assays, indicating that the chelator-enhancing effect on peroxynitrite-dependent modifications of the indicators depended on cell constituents, presumably including LIP, that react with these chelators. Moreover, neither free nor ferrous-complexed chelators stimulated intracellular or extracellular oxidative and nitrosative chemistries. On the basis of these results, LIP appears to be a relevant and competitive cellular target of peroxynitrite or its derived oxidants, and thereby it reduces oxidative processes, an observation that may change the conventional notion that the LIP is simply a cellular source of pro-oxidant iron.

https://openalex.org/W2802855755,"Morphologically, polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster consist of compact ""black"" bands alternating with less compact ""grey"" bands and interbands. We developed a comprehensive approach that combines cytological mapping data of FlyBase-annotated genes and novel tools for predicting cytogenetic features of chromosomes on the basis of their protein composition and determined the genomic coordinates for all black bands of polytene chromosome 2R. By a PCNA immunostaining assay, we obtained the replication timetable for all the bands mapped. The results allowed us to compare replication timing between polytene chromosomes in salivary glands and chromosomes from cultured diploid cell lines and to observe a substantial similarity in the global replication patterns at the band resolution level. In both kinds of chromosomes, the intervals between black bands correspond to early replication initiation zones. Black bands are depleted of replication initiation events and are characterized by a gradient of replication timing; therefore, the time of replication completion correlates with the band length. The bands are characterized by low gene density, contain predominantly tissue-specific genes, and are represented by silent chromatin types in various tissues. The borders of black bands correspond well to the borders of topological domains as well as to the borders of the zones showing H3K27me3, SUUR, and LAMIN enrichment. In conclusion, the characteristic pattern of polytene chromosomes reflects partitioning of the Drosophila genome into two global types of domains with contrasting properties. This partitioning is conserved in different tissues and determines replication timing in Drosophila."

The luminal domain of STIMs are made up of highly conserved canonical EF-hand (residues 63–96) and noncanonical EF-hand (residues 97–128) motifs adjacent to a similarly well conserved sterile α-motif (SAM) domain (residues 132–200) that make up the EFSAM core and mediate the Ca2+ sensing function (Fig. 1A).

Further, there are two cysteine residues (i.e. Cys49 and Cys56 in STIM1) that are conserved among vertebrate and some lower order STIM homologues (Fig. 1B). STIM1 Cys56 can undergo S-glutathionylation following oxidative stress, which results in constitutively activated SOCE, independent of luminal Ca2+ levels (27Hawkins B.J. Irrinki K.M.

Given this susceptibility to oxidative stress and other proteins found to be both S-glutathionylated and S-nitrosylated (28Aracena-Parks P. Goonasekera S.A. Gilman C.P. Dirksen R.T. Hidalgo C.

S-Nitrosylation is a readily reversible Cys modification that may occur in the presence of an NO donor and an electron acceptor. Specifically, S-nitrosylation involves the addition of NO groups onto reduced Cys residues to form S-nitrosocysteines (Fig. 1C). S-Nitrosylation of Cys residues can affect protein stability, activation, structure, localization, and function (30Gould N. Doulias P.-T. Tenopoulou M. Raju K. Ischiropoulos H. Regulation of protein function and signaling by reversible cysteine S-nitrosylation.J. Biol.

Here, we used high excess NO donor availability to study the effects of STIM1 S-nitrosylation on the Ca2+-sensing mechanism and Orai1 activation. Using biophysical and biochemical approaches, we found that S-nitrosylation of Cys49 and Cys56 enhances the thermodynamic stability, suppresses the surface-exposed hydrophobicity, and deoligomerizes the STIM1 luminal domain. Further, we identified an electropositive interaction site on the core EFSAM domain by solution NMR spectroscopy, which mediates stabilization through interactions with the Cys-containing nonconserved region. Remarkably, incorporation of negative charges into this patch by mutation increases the thermodynamic stability, independent of NO availability. Finally, we demonstrate in live HEK293 cells co-expressing full-length STIM1 and Orai1 that stabilization of the STIM1 luminal domain using NO donors or via mutation of the electropositive patch suppresses SOCE. Collectively, our experiments uncover a charge-sensing region in the core EFSAM domain that confers stabilization in response to S-nitrosylation and endows STIM1 with an additional layer of regulation. SOCE is initiated after Ca2+-depletion–dependent destabilization of the EFSAM core leads to oligomerization and STIM1 puncta formation (10Stathopulos P.B. Li G.-Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M.

The nonconserved, N-terminal region of STIM1 contains two Cys residues and plays a role in modulating the stability of the EFSAM core (25Stathopulos P.B. Zheng L. Ikura M. Stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 and STIM2 calcium sensing regions exhibit distinct unfolding and oligomerization kinetics.J. Biol.

Given the importance of EFSAM stability to SOCE activation, we performed a precise quantification of the thermodynamic stability of the entire STIM1 luminal domain (i.e. residues 23–213) using equilibrium chemical denaturation curves in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). The urea denaturation process was completely reversible and, thus, amenable to two-state equilibrium unfolding analysis. The Gibbs free energy of unfolding in water (ΔGH2O), denaturant dependence of the unfolding transition (m value), and the midpoint of urea denaturation (Cmid) were extracted from the urea denaturation curves using the linear extrapolation method (33Pace C.N. Determination and analysis of urea and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131 (3773761): 266-28010.1016/0076-6879(86)31045-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-loaded STIM1 luminal domain revealed a ΔGH2O of 5.9 kcal mol−1 in the presence of 1 mm DTT (i.e. reduced state). After S-nitrosylation of the Ca2+-loaded protein by ultrafiltration into a buffer containing 1 mm GSNO and no reducing agent, we observed an increase in the ΔGH2O by +2.0 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table S1). We observed a similar GSNO-dependent enhancement of ΔGH2O by +1.5 kcal mol−1 under the Ca2+-depleted conditions (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table S1). To probe whether the sensitivity to the presence of GSNO was facilitated by the Cys49 and Cys56 residues, we generated C49S/C56S to prevent S-nitrosylation at these sites. We focused on Ca2+-depleted equilibrium denaturation because this state is the SOCE initiation–competent state. The Ca2+-depleted C49S/C56S protein exhibited a similar ΔGH2O as the WT; however, whereas GSNO robustly enhanced the stability of the WT form, the double Cys mutant showed no enhancement of stability in the presence of the NO donor (Fig. 2, E and F, and Table S1). Thus, GSNO thermodynamically stabilizes the STIM1 luminal domain in a Cys49- and Cys56-specific manner. The Ca2+-depletion-induced oligomerization of STIM1 EFSAM is associated with increased solvent-accessible hydrophobicity (10Stathopulos P.B. Li G.-Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. Stored Ca2+ depletion-induced oligomerization of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) via the EF-SAM region: an initiation mechanism for capacitive Ca2+ entry.J. Biol.

Thus, we next sought to evaluate the level of exposed STIM1 23–213 hydrophobicity in the presence and absence of the NO donor using the extrinsic fluorescence probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS), which becomes hyperfluorescent when bound to exposed hydrophobic patches of proteins (34Stryer L. The interaction of a naphthalene dye with apomyoglobin and apohemoglobin: a fluorescent probe of non-polar binding sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13 (5867031): 482-49510.1016/S0022-2836(65)80111-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of ANS was enhanced >2-fold in the presence of the Ca2+-depleted WT STIM1 23–213; however, the addition of excess CaCl2 markedly decreased the ANS fluorescence indicative of Ca2+-binding induced folding (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the ANS fluorescence was only marginally increased when incubated with Ca2+-depleted WT STIM1 23–213 in the presence of 1 mm GSNO compared with the buffer alone; further, the addition of excess CaCl2 resulted in only a minimal change in the ANS fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the differences in ANS binding were caused by alterations in protein folding, we monitored the relative change in intrinsic fluorescence upon Ca2+ binding in the presence and absence of GSNO. Indeed, we observed a <2% compared with >20% maximal change in intrinsic fluorescence during Ca2+ titration experiments in the presence and absence of 1 mm GSNO, respectively (Fig. S1), indicating that the NO donor induces a conformation with suppressed Ca2+-binding–induced structural allostery. Next, we repeated the ANS-binding experiments using the C49S/C56S STIM1 23–213 protein to probe the role of the Cys residues in the GSNO responses. The C49S/C56S protein showed a >2-fold increase in the ANS fluorescence that was markedly suppressed by the addition of excess CaCl2 (Fig. 3C). Importantly, the C49S/C56S STIM1 23–213 protein exhibited a similar >2-fold increase in ANS fluorescence even in the presence of 1 mm GSNO; moreover, the addition of 5 mm CaCl2 suppressed this ANS fluorescence, consistent with the Ca2+-binding induced folding (Fig. 3D). Collectively, the ANS data demonstrate that Ca2+ binding or GSNO treatment suppresses solvent exposed hydrophobicity of STIM1 23–213 and that the effect of the NO donor depends on the presence of the Cys49 and Cys56 thiols. To test whether the effects of S-nitrosylation on stability, hydrophobicity, and structure correlate with oligomerization propensity, we next assessed hydrodynamic size of STIM1 23–213 by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Because the Ca2+-loaded state of STIM1 23–213 is a monomer (10Stathopulos P.B. Li G.-Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M.

Regularization deconvolution of the size distributions from the autocorrelation functions showed that exchange of Ca2+-depleted STIM1 23–213 from DTT-containing buffer to 1 mm GSNO-containing buffer systematically decreased the smallest distribution of hydrodynamic radii (Fig. 3E). Although the change in hydrodynamic size distribution appears modest, the difference is, in fact, marked given that light scattering intensity scales with particle size to the sixth power (35Li Y. Lubchenko V. Vekilov P.G. The use of dynamic light scattering and brownian microscopy to characterize protein aggregation.Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2011; 82 (21639491, 053106)10.1063/1.3592581Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the hydrodynamic sizes <7 nm contribute >95% of the light scattering signal in the GSNO-treated sample. On the other hand, the STIM1 23–213 C49S/C56S double mutant protein did not undergo deoligomerization after being exchanged into the GSNO (Fig. 3F). Taken together, the DLS observations demonstrate that GSNO deoligomerizes luminal STIM1 in a Cys49- and Cys56-dependent manner, consistent with the suppressed hydrophobicity and the enhanced stability observed for the S-nitrosylated and Ca2+-depleted protein. Although the atomic-resolution structure of the STIM1 EFSAM core has been solved by solution NMR spectroscopy (24Stathopulos P.B. Zheng L. Li G.-Y. Plevin M.J. Ikura M.

https://openalex.org/W2800145886,"From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover cis-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)—genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping."
https://openalex.org/W2800409676,"A live-bearing reproductive strategy can induce large morphological changes in the mother during pregnancy. The evolution of the placenta in swimming animals involves a shift in the timing of maternal provisioning from pre-fertilization (females supply their eggs with sufficient yolk reserves prior to fertilization) to post-fertilization (females provide all nutrients via a placenta during the pregnancy). It has been hypothesised that this shift, associated with the evolution of the placenta, should confer a morphological advantage to the females leading to a more slender body shape during the early stages of pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying three-dimensional shape and volume changes during pregnancy and in full-grown virgin controls of two species within the live-bearing fish family Poeciliidae: Poeciliopsis gracilis (non-placental) and Poeciliopsis turneri (placental). We show that P. turneri is more slender than P. gracilis at the beginning of the interbrood interval and in virgins, and that these differences diminish towards the end of pregnancy. This study provides the first evidence for an adaptive morphological advantage of the placenta in live-bearing fish. A similar morphological benefit could drive the evolution of placentas in other live-bearing (swimming) animal lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2801569816,"Background Estimating mortality risk during TB treatment in HIV co-infected patients is challenging for health professionals, especially in a low TB prevalence population, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic system. The current study aimed to develop and validate a simple mortality prognostic scoring system for TB/HIV co-infected patients. Methods Using data from the CDC’s Tuberculosis Genotyping Information Management System of TB patients in Texas reported from 01/2010 through 12/2016, age ≥15 years, HIV(+), and outcome being “completed” or “died”, we developed and internally validated a mortality prognostic score using multiple logistic regression. Model discrimination was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The model’s good calibration was determined by a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow’s goodness of fit test. Results Among the 450 patients included in the analysis, 57 (12.7%) died during TB treatment. The final prognostic score used six characteristics (age, residence in long-term care facility, meningeal TB, chest x-ray, culture positive, and culture not converted/unknown), which are routinely collected by TB programs. Prognostic scores were categorized into three groups that predicted mortality: low-risk (<20 points), medium-risk (20–25 points) and high-risk (>25 points). The model had good discrimination and calibration (AUC = 0.82; 0.80 in bootstrap validation), and a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.71. Conclusion Our simple validated mortality prognostic scoring system can be a practical tool for health professionals in identifying TB/HIV co-infected patients with high mortality risk."
https://openalex.org/W2802183324,"The hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are unknown. We performed a prospective single center placebo controlled randomized study with parallel group design in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Participants received paracetamol (1 gram) IV or placebo (an equal volume of 0.9% saline) preoperatively followed by two postoperative doses 6 hours apart. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in systolic (SBP) 30 minutes after the preoperative infusion, analysed using an ANCOVA model. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and other key hemodynamic variables after each infusion. All other endpoints were analysed using random-effect generalized least squares regression modelling with individual patients treated as random effects. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Post preoperative infusion, paracetamol decreased SBP by a mean (SD) of 13 (18) mmHg, p = 0.02, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (11) mmHg with saline. Paracetamol decreased MAP and DBP by a mean (SD) of 9 (12) mmHg and 8 (9) mmHg (p = 0.01 and 0.02), respectively, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (8) mmHg and 0 (6) mmHg with placebo. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in pressure or flow based hemodynamic parameters in both groups. This study provides high quality evidence that the administration of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery causes a transient decrease in preoperative blood pressure when administered before surgery but no adverse hemodynamic effects when administered in the postoperative setting."
https://openalex.org/W2952712845,"Toxoplasma gondii is a parasitic protist possessing a limited set of proteins involved in the autophagy pathway, a self-degradative machinery for protein and organelle recycling. This distant eukaryote has even repurposed part of this machinery, centered on protein ATG8, for a non-degradative function related to the maintenance of the apicoplast, a parasite-specific organelle. However, some evidence also suggest Toxoplasma is able to generate autophagic vesicles upon stress, and that some autophagy-related proteins, such as ATG9, might be involved solely in the canonical autophagy function. Here, we have characterised TgPROP1 and TgPROP2, two Toxoplasma proteins containing WD-40 repeat that can bind lipids for their recruitment to vesicular structures upon stress. They belong to the PROPPIN family and are homologues to ATG18/WIPI, which are known to be important for the autophagic process. We conducted a functional analysis of these two Toxoplasma PROPPINs. One of them is dispensable for normal in vitro growth, although it may play a role for parasite survival in specific stress conditions or for parasite fitness in the host, through a canonical autophagy-related function. The other, however, seems important for parasite viability in normal growth conditions and could be primarily involved in a non-canonical function. These divergent roles for two proteins from the same family illustrate the functional versatility of the autophagy-related machinery in Toxoplasma."
https://openalex.org/W2800757085,"In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the survival of patients detected by screening with those detected based on symptoms, according to their tumor stages. After propensity score matching, 2,130 patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer, identified by screening detection (SD) and clinical detection (CD), were included. We compared the survival rates of patients identified by SD and CD in the early and advanced stages of thyroid cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality between the two groups. Of the 1,065 patients in each group, 12 (1.1%) died in the SD group, compared to 44 (4.1%) in the CD group, during an average 9.4 years (p<0.001). For early stage, there was no significant difference in all-cause and thyroid cancer-specific mortality between the two groups (p = 0.08, p = 0.0502). However, for advanced stage, the survival rates in the SD group were significantly higher than in the CD group (p<0.001, p = 0.004). Moreover, after adjusting for covariates, the HRs of all-cause mortality of the SD group was significantly lower than that of the CD group for the advanced stage patients (HRs: 0.37 [95% CIs: 0.17–0.80]), while no significant difference was observed in the early stage. While screening for thyroid cancer was not beneficial for early stage patients, our findings suggest that detection via screening is associated with better survival for patients with advanced stage cancer. However, the effects of selection bias and lead time bias could not be entirely excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2803038080,"Human β-tryptase, a tetrameric trypsin-like serine protease, is an important mediator of the allergic inflammatory responses in asthma. During acute hypersensitivity reactions, mast cells degranulate, releasing active tetramer as a complex with proteoglycans. Extensive efforts have focused on developing therapeutic β-tryptase inhibitors, but its unique mechanism is less well-explored. Tryptase is active only after proteolytic removal of the pro-domain followed by tetramer formation via two distinct symmetry-related interfaces. We show that the cleaved I16G mutant cannot tetramerize, likely due to impaired insertion of its N terminus into its activation pocket, indicating allosteric linkage at multiple sites on each protomer. We engineered cysteines into each of the two distinct interfaces (Y75C for small or I99C for large) to assess the activity of each tetramer and disulfide-locked dimer. Using size-exclusion chromatography and enzymatic assays, we demonstrate that the two large tetramer interfaces regulate enzymatic activity, elucidating the importance of this protein-protein interaction for allosteric regulation. Notably, the I99C large interface dimer is active, even in the absence of heparin. We show that a monomeric β-tryptase mutant (I99C*/Y75A/Y37bA, where C* is cysteinylated Cys-99) cannot form a dimer or tetramer, yet it is active but only in the presence of heparin. Thus heparin both stabilizes the tetramer and allosterically conditions the active site. We hypothesize that each β-tryptase protomer in the tetramer has two distinct roles, acting both as a protease and as a cofactor for its neighboring protomer, to allosterically regulate enzymatic activity, providing a rationale for direct correlation of tetramer stability with proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2802702828,"Background Results-based aid (RBA) is increasingly used to incentivize action in health. In Mesoamerica, the region consisting of southern Mexico and Central America, the RBA project known as the Salud Mesoamérica Initiative (SMI) was designed to target disparities in maternal and child health, focusing on the poorest 20% of the population across the region. Methods and findings Data were first collected in 365 intervention health facilities to establish a baseline of indicators. For the first follow-up measure, 18 to 24 months later, 368 facilities were evaluated in these same areas. At both stages, we measured a near-identical set of supply-side performance indicators in line with country-specific priorities in maternal and child health. All countries showed progress in performance indicators, although with different levels. El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama reached their 18-month targets, while the State of Chiapas in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize did not. A second follow-up measurement in Chiapas and Guatemala showed continued progress, as they achieved previously missed targets nine to 12 months later, after implementing a performance improvement plan. Conclusions Our findings show an initial success in the supply-side indicators of SMI. Our data suggest that the RBA approach can be a motivator to improve availability of drugs and services in poor areas. Moreover, our innovative monitoring and evaluation framework will allow health officials with limited resources to identify and target areas of greatest need."
https://openalex.org/W2799490915,"To examine effects of scan duration on estimates of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS), we reanalyzed data from thirty-nine previously reported L-[1-11C]leucine PET studies. Subjects consisted of 12 healthy volunteers studied twice, awake and under propofol sedation, and 15 subjects with fragile X syndrome (FXS) studied once under propofol sedation. All scans were acquired on a high resolution scanner. We used a basis function method for voxelwise estimation of parameters of the kinetic model of L-[1-11C]leucine and rCPS over the interval beginning at the time of tracer injection and ending 30, 45, 60, 75 or 90 min later. For each study and scan interval, regional estimates in nine regions and whole brain were obtained by averaging voxelwise estimates over all voxels in the region. In all three groups rCPS was only slightly affected by scan interval length and was very stable between 60 and 90 min. Furthermore, statistical comparisons of rCPS between awake and sedated healthy volunteers provided almost identical results when they were based on 60 min scan data as when they were based on data from the full 90 min interval. Statistical comparisons between sedated healthy volunteers and sedated subjects with FXS also yielded almost identical results when based on 60 and 90 min scan intervals. We conclude that, under the conditions of our studies, scan duration can be shortened to 60 min without loss of precision."
https://openalex.org/W2800480656,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects a large number of people throughout the world. Anxiety, depression and fatigue are common symptoms of SLE that substantially contribute to decreased quality of life. This study investigates the interplay between physical and psychiatric manifestations of lupus. To this end, an SLE patient cohort was examined for correlations between clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and psychological indicators.Seventy-two lupus patients were evaluated for psychological status using a battery of instruments, including assessments for fatigue (CFS & FSS), depression (HADS), anxiety (HADS), overall health (SF-36 & PSQI) and intimate relationship satisfaction (RAS & CSI). Scores from these assessments were correlated with lupus clinical profiles and laboratory test values.The prevalence of depression in the SLE patient cohort was 41.7%, as measured by the hospital depression and anxiety scale. The study identified that pain (p = 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.026), Chalder's fatigue scale (p < 0.001), fatigue severity scale (p < 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001) are all positively correlated with depression in SLE patients. Total complement (CH50) (p = 0.032), and SF-36 physical and mental characteristic assessments are negatively correlated with depression. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the disease related complaint alopecia (p = 0.008) and relationship assessment scale scores (p = 0.004) may also be correlated to depression in SLE patients. Multivariant scrutiny of the clinical and psychosocial characteristics identified the fatigue severity scale (p = 0.026), SF-36 physical function (p = 0.040), physical role function (0.030), and mental health (p = 0.002) as the best indicators directly correlated with depression for the SLE cohort.These results reveal the influence of physical manifestations of lupus including fatigue, pain, body mass index and anxiety, as well as decreased physical and mental function, on depression. Fatigue is the strongest factor correlated with depression in SLE patients in the cohort. Both physical and social/psychological aspects likely contribute to the depression and anxiety in lupus."
https://openalex.org/W2604797722,"In this article we develop a Primitive Variable Recovery Scheme (PVRS) to solve any system of coupled differential conservative equations. This method obtains directly the primitive variables applying the chain rule to the time term of the conservative equations. With this, a traditional finite volume method for the flux is applied in order avoid violation of both, the entropy and “Rankine-Hugoniot” jump conditions. The time evolution is then computed using a forward finite difference scheme. This numerical technique evades the recovery of the primitive vector by solving an algebraic system of equations as it is often used and so, it generalises standard techniques to solve these kind of coupled systems. The article is presented bearing in mind special relativistic hydrodynamic numerical schemes with an added pedagogical view in the appendix section in order to easily comprehend the PVRS. We present the convergence of the method for standard shock-tube problems of special relativistic hydrodynamics and a graphical visualisation of the errors using the fluctuations of the numerical values with respect to exact analytic solutions. The PVRS circumvents the sometimes arduous computation that arises from standard numerical methods techniques, which obtain the desired primitive vector solution through an algebraic polynomial of the charges."
https://openalex.org/W2800428662,"Climate change is predicted to impact species' genetic diversity and distribution. We used Senegalia senegal (L.) Britton, an economically important species distributed in the Sudano-Sahelian savannah belt of West Africa, to investigate the impact of climate change on intraspecific genetic diversity and distribution. We used ten nuclear and two plastid microsatellite markers to assess genetic variation, population structure and differentiation across thirteen sites in West Africa. We projected suitable range, and potential impact of climate change on genetic diversity using a maximum entropy approach, under four different climate change scenarios. We found higher genetic and haplotype diversity at both nuclear and plastid markers than previously reported. Genetic differentiation was strong for chloroplast and moderate for the nuclear genome. Both genomes indicated three spatially structured genetic groups. The distribution of Senegalia senegal is strongly correlated with extractable nitrogen, coarse fragments, soil organic carbon stock, precipitation of warmest and coldest quarter and mean temperature of driest quarter. We predicted 40.96 to 6.34 per cent of the current distribution to favourably support the species' ecological requirements under future climate scenarios. Our results suggest that climate change is going to affect the population genetic structure of Senegalia senegal, and that patterns of genetic diversity are going to influence the species' adaptive response to climate change. Our study contributes to the growing evidence predicting the loss of economically relevant plants in West Africa in the next decades due to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2799365895,"Genioglossus is the largest upper airway dilator and its dilatory movement can be measured non-invasively with magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. The present study used a novel ultrasound method to assess genioglossus movement in conditions in which ventilatory drive or respiratory mechanics were changed. Methods Twenty healthy subjects (10 males, age 28±5 years [mean ± SD]) lay supine, awake, with the head in a neutral position. Ventilation was monitored with inductance bands. Real-time B-mode ultrasound movies were analysed. We measured genioglossus motion (i) during spontaneous breathing, voluntary targeted breathing (normal tidal volume Vt), and voluntary hyperpnoea (at 1.5Vt and 2 Vt); (ii) during inspiratory flow resistive loading; (iii) with changes in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). Results Average peak inspiratory displacement of the infero-posterior region of genioglossus was 0.89±0.56 mm; 1.02±0.88 mm; 1.27±0.70 mm respectively for voluntary Vt, and during voluntary hyperpnoea at 1.5Vt and 2Vt. A change in genioglossus motion was observed with increased Vt. During increasing inspiratory resistive loading, the genioglossus displaced less anteriorly (p = 0.005) but more inferiorly (p = 0.027). When lung volume was altered, no significant changes in genioglossus movement were observed (p = 0.115). Conclusion In healthy subjects, we observed non-uniform heterogeneous inspiratory motion within the inferoposterior part of genioglossus during spontaneous quiet breathing with mean peak displacement between 0.5–2 mm, with more displacement in the posterior region than the anterior. This regional heterogeneity disappeared during voluntary targeted breathing. This may be due to different neural drive to genioglossus during voluntary breathing. During inspiratory resistive loading, the observed genioglossus motion may serve to maintain upper airway patency by balancing intraluminal negative pressure with positive pressure generated by upper airway dilatory muscles. In contrast, changes in EELV were not accompanied by major changes in genioglossus motion."
https://openalex.org/W2802428973,"TB infection in patients after kidney transplantation remains a concern in a successful long-term outcome. This retrospective, descriptive study was performed on tuberculosis infection after kidney transplantation in the Department of Infectious Disease of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, a tertiary care hospital in China, from January 2011 to April 2017, with the aim to explain the clinical features of active tuberculosis after kidney transplantation and explore the correlated factors for diagnostic delay and mortality. It included 48 cases. All these cases were followed up for at least 12 months after anti-tuberculosis therapy, except the ones who died during this period. The median time of transplantation to active tuberculosis of these 48 patients was about 5.4 years. The time from a first hospital visit to the diagnosis (diagnostic delay) of 12 (25%) cases was more than 30 days. The correlated factors for the diagnostic delay more than 30 days were a fever for more than 2 weeks and antibiotic use for more than 2 weeks. Nine (18.8%) cases died during the anti-tuberculosis therapy or following-up period due to TB relapse. The risk factors for mortality were severe complications, such as encephaledema, severe pneumonia, intestinal perforation, liver function failure, and the following multiple-organ failure. In conclusion, the possibility of tuberculosis infection should be carefully assessed and sometimes diagnostic anti-tuberculosis therapy may be required for patients who had a fever for more than 2 weeks or used antibiotics for more than 2 weeks after kidney transplantation. Severe complications and the following multiple-organ failure might increase the mortality among these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2800414852,"The centrifuge is among the oldest and most widely used pieces of laboratory equipment, with significant applications that include clinical diagnostics and biomedical research. A major limitation of laboratory centrifuges is their “black box” nature, limiting sample observation to before and after centrifugation. Thus, optimized protocols require significant trial and error, while unoptimized protocols waste time by centrifuging longer than necessary or material due to incomplete sedimentation. Here, we developed an instrumented centrifuge tube receptacle compatible with several commercial benchtop centrifuges that can provide real-time sample analysis during centrifugation. We demonstrated the system by monitoring cell separations during centrifugation for different spin speeds, concentrations, buffers, cell types, and temperatures. We show that the collected data are valuable for analytical purposes (e.g. quality control), or as feedback to the user or the instrument. For the latter, we verified an adaptation where complete sedimentation turned off the centrifuge and notified the user by a text message. Our system adds new functionality to existing laboratory centrifuges, saving users time and providing useful feedback. This add-on potentially enables new analytical applications for an instrument that has remained largely unchanged for decades."
https://openalex.org/W2799737387,"The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25-70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2-22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0-5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6-55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality. Resolving these issues may improve the clinical performance of the STAN device."

Ssy5 comprises a catalytic (Cat) domain and an extensive regulatory prodomain. Ssy5 is refractory to both broad-spectrum and serine protease–specific inhibitors, confounding its classification as a protease, and no information about Ssy5’s cleavage-site preferences and its mechanism of substrate selection is available. Here, using mutational and inhibition experiments, we investigated the biogenesis and catalytic properties of Ssy5 and conclusively show that it is a serine protease.

https://openalex.org/W2800442992,"Radio-hyperthermo-chemo (RHC) therapy, which combines radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and chemotherapy, for malignant soft tissue tumors has been introduced with the aim of decreasing the possibility of local recurrence after surgery. To avoid unnecessary neoadjuvant therapy and to plan the appropriate surgical treatment, surveillance of RHC therapeutic efficacy during treatment is necessary. In this study, we determined the optimal response criteria to evaluate the efficacy of RHC by comparing preoperative images before and after RHC with pathological evaluation of necrosis in the resected tumor.From 2004 to 2014, 20 patients were enrolled into this study. Needle biopsy revealed 6 cases of myxoid liposarcoma, 6 cases of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, 4 cases of myxofibrosarcoma, and 4 cases of synovial sarcoma. Based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or modified RECIST, we calculated the responses to RHC therapy by comparing pre- and post-RHC therapy images. In addition, resected specimens underwent pathological analysis to evaluate response based on tumor necrosis. The correlation between assessment based on preoperative images and resected tumors were evaluated by the Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient.From the surgical specimens, pathological assessment of necrosis in resected tumor were assessed as less than 50% (2 cases), 50-90% (9 cases), 90-99% (6 cases), and total necrosis (3 cases). Use of the RECIST 1.1 underestimated good responders as stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) in 5 out of 15 cases; on the other hand, use of the modified RECIST did not underestimate the pathological assessment of necrosis. The correlations between responses based on preoperative images and those based on histological assessments were 0.23 (RECIST 1.1) and 0.76 (modified RECIST).Because pathological responses can be underestimated using the RECIST 1.1, the modified RECIST, which take into consideration tumor viability, as assessed by contrast MRI, should also be considered when evaluating the efficacy of RHC."
https://openalex.org/W2800915632,"Background Data are sparse on the range of BMI among patients acutely admitted to general hospitals. We investigated BMI values and associated patient characteristics, reasons for hospital admission, and mortality in Denmark. Methods We identified all persons with an acute inpatient admission 2011–2014 in Central Denmark Region and assessed BMI measurements recorded in the Clinical Information System. We used cross-sectional and cohort analyses to examine the BMI distribution and its association with demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medication use, tobacco smoking, reasons for admission, and 30-day mortality. Results Among 92,027 acutely admitted patients (median age 62 years, 49% female) with a BMI measurement, 4% had a BMI (kg/m2) <18.5, 42% a BMI between 18.5 and 25, 34% a BMI between 25 and 30, and 20% a BMI ≥30. Compared with normal-weight patients, 30-day mortality was high among patients with BMI <18.5 (7.5% vs. 2.8%, age- and smoking-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0–2.9, whereas patients with overweight (aOR 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6–0.8) and obesity class I (aOR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6–0.9)). Compared with the total population, patients with BMI <18.5 were older (68 years median); more were female (73%); more had comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score >0 in 42% vs. 33% overall), more were current smokers (45% vs. 27% overall), and acute admissions due to respiratory diseases or femoral fractures were frequent. In contrast, patients with BMI ≥30 were relatively young (59 years median), fewer smoked (24%): type 2 diabetes, sleep disorders, cholelithiasis, and heart failure were frequent diagnoses. Prevalence of therapies for metabolic syndrome, pain, and psychiatric disorders increased with higher BMI, while patients with BMI <18.5 frequently used asthma medications, glucocorticoids, and antibiotics. Conclusion In patients acutely admitted to general hospitals, reasons for hospital admission and associated clinical characteristics differ substantially according to BMI range. BMI <18.5 is a clinical predictor of high short-term mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2799966375,"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) is most frequently caused by mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (in short, BRCA) genes. The incidence of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of BRCA mutation carriers who test negative for the familial mutation (non-carriers) may be increased. However, the data is controversial, and at this time, these individuals are recommended the same cancer surveillance as general population. One possible explanation for BRCA phenocopies (close relatives of BRCA carriers who have developed cancer consistent with HBOC but tested negative for a familial mutation) is natural chimerism where lack of detectable mutation in blood may not rule out the presence of the mutation in the other tissues. To test this hypothesis, archival tumor tissue from eleven BRCA phenocopies was investigated. DNA from the tumor tissue was analyzed using sequence-specific PCR, capillary electrophoresis, and pyrosequencing. The familial mutations were originally detected in the patients’ first-degree relatives by commercial testing. The same testing detected no mutations in the blood of the patients under study. The test methods targeted only the known familial mutation in the tumor tissue. Tumor diagnoses included breast, ovarian, endometrial and primary peritoneal carcinoma. None of the familial mutations were found in the tumor samples tested. These results do not support, but do not completely exclude, the possibility of chimerism in these patients. Further studies with comprehensive sequence analysis in a larger patient group are warranted as a chimeric state would further refine the predictive value of genetic testing to include BRCA phenocopies."
https://openalex.org/W2802443783,"The experimental set-up of this study mimicked recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) where water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity were controlled and wastes produced by fish and feeding were converted to inorganic forms. A key process in the RAS was the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate through nitrification. It was hypothesized that algae inclusion in RAS would improve the ammonia removal from the water; thereby improving RAS water quality and stability. To test this hypothesis, the stability of the microbiota community composition in a freshwater RAS with (RAS+A) or without algae (RAS-A) was challenged by introducing an acute pH drop (from pH 7 to 4 during three hours) to the system. Stigeoclonium nanum, a periphytic freshwater microalga was used in this study. No significant effect of the algae presence was found on the resistance to the acute pH drop on ammonia conversion to nitrite and nitrite conversion to nitrate. Also the resilience of the ammonia conversion to the pH drop disruption was not affected by the addition of algae. This could be due to the low biomass of algae achieved in the RAS. However, with regard to the conversion step of nitrite to nitrate, RAS+A was significantly more resilient than RAS-A. In terms of overall bacterial communities, the composition and predictive function of the bacterial communities was significantly different between RAS+A and RAS-A."
https://openalex.org/W2799894168,"Background Our previous study examined an effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) or intravenous nicorandil on reduction of periprocedural myocardial injury (pMI) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). We further investigated the effect of RIPC or nicorandil on pMI in older patients. Methods Patients with stable CAD who planned to undergo PCI were assigned to a 1:1:1 ratio to control, intravenous nicorandil, or upper-limb RIPC groups. This substudy analyzed patients aged >65 years (n = 282) from the principal cohort. The primary outcome was the incidence of pMI following PCI. We defined pMI as an elevated level of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T or creatine kinase myocardial band 12 or 24 hours after PCI. Results We found that pMI following PCI was significantly reduced in the nicorandil group compared with the control group (37.2% vs. 53.7%, multiplicity-adjusted p = 0.046), but not in the RIPC group compared with the control group (43.0% vs. 53.7%, multiplicity-adjusted p = 0.245). The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for pMI in the RIPC and nicorandil groups versus the control group were 0.63 (0.34 to 1.16) and 0.51 (0.27 to 0.96), respectively. Conclusion Intravenous nicorandil significantly reduces pMI following PCI in a subgroup of older patients with stable CAD. Phase 3 trials are required to validate our results.

https://openalex.org/W2800163364,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of infection and poorer responses to vaccination. This suggests that CKD patients have an impaired responsiveness to all antigens, even those first encountered before CKD onset. To examine this we evaluated antibody responses against two childhood vaccine antigens, tetanus (TT) and diphtheria toxoids (DT) and two common pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SEn) in two independent cohorts consisting of age-matched individuals with and without CKD. Sera were evaluated for antigen-specific IgG titres and the functionality of antibody to SEn was assessed in a serum bactericidal assay. Surprisingly, patients with CKD and control subjects had comparable levels of IgG against TT and DT, suggesting preserved humoral memory responses to antigens encountered early in life. Lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG titres and serum bactericidal activity in patients with CKD were also not inferior to controls. CMV-specific IgG titres in seropositive CKD patients were similar or even increased compared to controls. Therefore, whilst responses to new vaccines in CKD are typically lower than expected, antibody responses to antigens commonly encountered prior to CKD onset are not. The immunodeficiency of CKD is likely characterised by failure to respond to new antigenic challenges and efforts to improve patient outcomes should be focussed here."
https://openalex.org/W2802354382,"Larvae of parasitoid wasps develop on a single arthropod host, and often face resource limitation that induces a tradeoff between egg maturation and somatic growth. Part of the variation in the growth-reproduction allocation was shown to be heritable, but how the larval developmental environment affects this allocation is not well-known. Detection of life history tradeoffs is often facilitated under stress conditions. We therefore exposed developing female larvae of the polyembryonic parasitoid Copidosoma koehleri (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) to laboratory manipulations aimed to restrict host resources (either host-starvation or high larval density). We compared the females' body sizes and egg loads shortly after adult emergence (<24 h) to those of closely related control females, which developed at a lower larval density within non-starved hosts. Host-starvation reduced the females' body sizes but not their initial egg loads. Females that experienced high larval density produced more eggs but were similar in body size to the low-density controls. Thus, the relative allocation to reproduction increased in response to both manipulations of host condition. Developmental duration and longevity were similar in all treatments. The negative correlation between body size and reproductive allocation, observed in the host-starvation treatment, is compatible with previous evidence from other parasitoids. In the high larval density treatment, however, reproductive allocation increased while body size was maintained, suggesting that the higher density increased rather than limited host resources per developing parasitoid female. The additional host resources that were diverted into egg production possibly resulted from increased feeding and body mass gain by hosts parasitized by large broods of wasps. Our results demonstrate phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation between growth and reproduction in a developing parasitoid. This plasticity may contribute to an adaptive balance between longevity and mobility vs. fecundity during the adult stage."
https://openalex.org/W2799428187,"Governments have an ethical imperative to safeguard children in residential care institutions at all times, including in the aftermath of an emergency. Yet, a lack of accurate data about how the magnitude and characteristics of this population may change due to an emergency impedes leaders' ability to formulate responsive policies and services, mobilize resources and foster accountability. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the feasibility of evaluating movement of children into residential care following an emergency.The pilot study took place in Les Cayes commune in the Sud Department of Haiti in April 2017. Six months prior to the pilot, the area was severely affected by Hurricane Matthew, with widespread devastation to property, livestock and livelihoods. Using a two-stage process, the team created a comprehensive list of residential care institutions in Les Cayes. At each facility, the data collectors attempted to administer four separate tools: a group count tool, a record review tool, interviews with staff, and interviews with children 10 years of age and older.Out of 27 known institutions in Les Cayes, 22 institutions consented to participate in the research. Within these 22 institutions, the prevalence of new arrivals to residential care since Hurricane Matthew varied significantly across the four tools, ranging from 0.69% according to the aggregated child interviews to 20.96% according to the aggregated staff interviews. Record availability and quality was very poor and child participation was difficult to arrange due to travel and scheduling constraints.Robust measurement of new arrivals to residential care institutions was not feasible in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew. Moreover, many of the challenges encountered are likely to be encountered in humanitarian emergencies in other settings. Therefore, the research team does not recommend scale-up of these methods in most humanitarian settings. Alternative approaches that incorporate household survey methods to ascertain movement into residential care based on reports from caregivers may be more realistic in places with poor pre-existing governance systems and weak registries and records for residential care institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2765257267,"Understanding the determinants of syntactic choice in sentence production is a salient topic in psycholinguistics. Existing evidence suggests that syntactic choice results from an interplay between linguistic and non-linguistic factors, and a speaker’s attention to the elements of a described event represents one such factor. Whereas multimodal accounts of attention suggest a role for different modalities in this process, existing studies examining attention effects in syntactic choice are primarily based on visual cueing paradigms. Hence, it remains unclear whether attentional effects on syntactic choice are limited to the visual modality or are indeed more general. This issue is addressed by the current study. Native English participants viewed and described line drawings of simple transitive events while their attention was directed to the location of the agent or the patient of the depicted event by means of either an auditory (monaural beep) or a motor (unilateral key press) lateral cue. Our results show an effect of cue location, with participants producing more passive-voice descriptions in the patient-cued conditions. Crucially, this cue location effect emerged in the motor-cue but not (or substantially less so) in the auditory-cue condition, as confirmed by a reliable interaction between cue location (agent vs. patient) and cue type (auditory vs. motor). Our data suggest that attentional effects on the speaker’s syntactic choices are modality-specific and limited to the visual and motor, but not the auditory, domain."
