https://openalex.org/W1975368731,"THE deep structure of a sentence, according to Chomsky1, includes (1) a specification of its fundamental grammatical relations, such as its “logical” subject and object; and (2) a series of transformational “footnotes” indicating the form taken by the actual sentence, for example, that it is passive. When a sentence is remembered verbatim, such “footnotes” seem to be separately and independently stored2, and to take up a detectable amount of space in short-term memory3. But they may be rapidly forgotten, as Sachs4 has shown; and this is likely in ordinary discourse, because utterances are not usually remembered verbatim."

https://openalex.org/W2041926823,"EXPERIMENTAL manipulations of female rats have significantly influenced the open field behaviour of their grandpups. This phenomenon has been called “non-genetic transmission of information”1. Whereas the experimental manipulations of the grandmothers reported in ref. 1 consisted of pre-weaning infantile “handling”, we have investigated whether stress of the grandmother rat before and during pregnancy affected the open field behaviour of the offspring of the foetuses carried during or immediately after the periods of stress."

https://openalex.org/W2016659733,"THE antiviral activity of a culture filtrate from Penicillium stoloniferum was first described in 19521. Landmarks in the evaluation of this material, termed ‘Statolon’, came with its initial chemical characterization as a polysaccharide2 and the discovery that its mode of action was by the induction of interferon3. Later it became apparent that a ribonucleic acid component accompanying the polysaccharide had interferon stimulating ability (personal communication from Professor Sir Ernst Chain). It has subsequently been shown that the antiviral activity resided in virus-like particles present in the mould4 and in the double-stranded ribonucleic acid (ds-RNA) of these virus-like particles5,6. During our screening programme for antiviral substances from microorganisms, antiviral activity of a Stemphylium culture was discovered* which was attributed to the presence of virus-like particles. Coincidental with this, workers at the Merck Institute showed that the antiviral activity of helenine (also an antiviral agent produced by a mould) was attributable to ds-RNA, and that other ds-RNAs (poly I.poly C and the replicative form of MS2 phage) possessed similar antiviral activity7. Recently, there have been further publications (for example, refs. 8–10) in which the toxicity of poly I.poly C has been examined. It will be interesting to see if the naturally produced ds-RNA is less toxic than poly I.poly C, as might be postulated because of the unnatural base composition in the latter material."

https://openalex.org/W2053494689,"RECENTLY, Shaw and Smith1 have discussed the question of heterozygote advantage for the Tay-Sachs gene in Jewish populations with reference to our published computations2 and more generally. Their estimate of 5.3 per cent advantage over normal homozygote, based on trial values in a discrete model, is better than our value of 4.6 per cent from a very rough continuous approximation. But they seem to imply that we also accepted another estimate of 1.3 per cent advantage; this value was mentioned only to indicate how little heterosis would be required simply to cancel deaths of the recessive homozygotes."

https://openalex.org/W2032110487,"WHEN a dog brain is isolated from all structures except the skull and perfused with blood from a compatible donor animal, it has properties which make it especially useful for metabolic studies of neural tissue1,2. In all studies conducted with the isolated dog brain, the EEG has been used as a measure of the viability of the isolated and extra-corporeally maintained brain. There remains the question of whether the isolated brain is functioning sufficiently well to respond to normal external stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2027162817,"RETINAL images made up of equally spaced parallel vertical lines can readily be fused at disparities differing by a multiple of the line spacing, so giving rise to illusions of depth. In steady light, however, a figure of this kind is normally seen as a single surface, even when tilted away from the frontal plane so that the image lines on one retina intersect the corresponding loci to those on the other retina at several different disparities (Fig. 1)."
