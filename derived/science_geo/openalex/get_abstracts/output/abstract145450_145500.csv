https://openalex.org/W2119390770,"Hepatic steatosis is common in non-insulin-dependent diabetes and can be associated with fibrosis and cirrhosis in a subset of individuals. Increased rates of fatty acid synthesis have been reported in livers from rodent models of diabetes and may contribute to the development of steatosis. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of regulated transcription factors that stimulate lipid synthesis in liver. In the current studies, we measured the content of SREBPs in livers from two mouse models of diabetes, obese ob/ob mice and transgenic aP2-SREBP-1c436 (aP2-SREBP-1c) mice that overexpress nuclear SREBP-1c only in adipose tissue. The aP2-SREBP-1c mice exhibit a syndrome that resembles congenital generalized lipodystrophy in humans. Both lines of mice develop hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis. Nuclear SREBP-1c protein levels were significantly elevated in livers from ob/ob and aP2-SREBP-1c mice compared with wild-type mice. Increased nuclear SREBP-1c protein was associated with elevated mRNA levels for known SREBP target genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, which led to significantly higher rates of hepatic fatty acid synthesis in vivo. These studies suggest that increased levels of nuclear SREBP-1c contribute to the elevated rates of hepatic fatty acid synthesis that leads to steatosis in diabetic mice.

Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is a common disorder that affects approximately 5% of the population. Affected patients are usually obese, and they manifest insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. As many as 40% of non-insulin-dependent diabetics develop evidence of hepatic steatosis or “fatty liver,” a condition that leads to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in a subset of individuals (1Van Steenbergen W. Lanckmans S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19 (Suppl. 3): S27-S36PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic fatty acid synthesis is increased in rodent models of hyperinsulinemia and likely contributes to the development of fatty livers (2Martin R.J.

Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). SREBPs belong to the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family of transcription factors (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family, SREBPs are synthesized as ≈1150-amino acid precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). To be active, the NH2-terminal segment must be released from the membrane by a sequential two-step cleavage process (6Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 7Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Following the second cleavage (site-2 cleavage), the ≈500-amino acid NH2-terminal segment of SREBP is released from the membrane and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to enhancer regions of target genes to activate transcription.To date, three SREBP isoforms have been identified and characterized (4Brown M.S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and -1c are derived from a single gene through the use of alternative transcription start sites that produce alternate forms of exon 1 (9Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The third SREBP isoform, SREBP-2, is derived from a separate gene and is ≈45% identical to SREBP-1a (10Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In most cultured cell lines, the predominant SREBP-1 isoform is SREBP-1a (11Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In contrast, most animal tissues, including liver, express SREBP-1c as the predominant SREBP-1 isoform (11Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 have different relative effects on target genes. SREBP-1 is relatively selective in activating genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, while SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (12Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To gain insight into the separate roles of each SREBP isoform in vivo, we previously produced and characterized transgenic mice that overexpress the truncated, transcriptionally active nuclear forms of human SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2 in liver (13Shimano H.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Mice that overexpressed SREBP-1c, the predominant SREBP-1 isoform, had a 4-fold increase in the rate of fatty acid synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of [3 H]water. Corresponding 2–6-fold increases were measured in mRNA levels for the lipogenic genes ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), malic enzyme, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glu-6-PD) (13Shimano H.

Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). No changes were measured in the mRNAs for the cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and squalene synthase or in the in vivo rates of cholesterol synthesis (13Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 15Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast, mice that overexpressed nuclear SREBP-2 (nSREBP-2) had 28-fold higher rates of cholesterol synthesis in vivo, and corresponding 10–12-fold increases in mRNAs for several enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (15Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SREBP-2 transgenic mice also had 4-fold higher rates of fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo. This demonstrated that at high levels of expression, nSREBP-2 is capable of activating the enzyme cascade required for fatty acid biosynthesis, albeit much less efficiently than for that of cholesterol biosynthesis.In the current studies, we demonstrate that the amount of nSREBP-1 is increased in fatty livers from two distinct animal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The first model is the “obese” (ob/ob) mouse that develops severe obesity and hyperinsulinemia (18Bray G.A. York D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 719-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The second model utilizes transgenic mice that overexpress nuclear SREBP-1c exclusively in adipose tissue (aP2-SREBP-1c). These transgenic animals are one of three recently described mouse models that resemble generalized lipodystrophy in humans (19Burant C.F. Sreenan S. Hirano K. Tai T.A. Lohmiller J. Lukens J. Davidson N.O. Ross S. Graves R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2900-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 20Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M. Krylov D. Gavrilova O. Marcus-Samuels B. Feigenbaum L. Lee E. Aoyama T. Eckhaus M. Reitman M.L. Vinson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 21Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The aP2-SREBP-1c transgenic mice have very little adipose tissue, apparently as a result of disturbed adipocyte differentiation. They also develop severe hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and lipid accumulation in liver. Despite the striking differences in the amounts of body fat, both diabetic mouse models manifest increased nSREBP-1c protein content in liver, corresponding elevations in mRNAs for multiple lipogenic genes, and increased rates of fatty acid biosynthesis. In contrast, nSREBP-2 levels and mRNAs for genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis were unchanged in the livers from ob/ob and aP2-SREBP-1c mice. We propose that increased nSREBP-1c protein results in the transcriptional activation of genes responsible for lipogenesis and therefore contributes to the fatty liver phenotype observed in diabetic mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and General MethodsAll chemicals used were from Sigma. [α-32 P]dCTP and [α-32 P]CTP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The content of cholesterol and triglyceride in plasma and liver was measured as described previously (22Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Plasma insulin was measured with a monoclonal anti-rat insulin radioimmunoassay using the Rat Insulin RIA kit (Linco Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO). Plasma glucose and free fatty acids were measured using the Glucose (Trinder) 100 kit (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO), and the Wako NEFA C test kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), respectively.Animals“Obese” (C57BL/6J-ob/ob), and C57BL/6J wild-type mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Transgenic mice that overexpress the truncated form of human SREBP-1c (amino acids 1–436) in adipose tissue under the control of the adipocyte-specific aP2 enhancer/promoter were described previously (21Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The aP2-SREBP-1c mice are on a mixed genetic background consisting of C57BL/6J and SJL strains. All mice were housed in colony cages in a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle and were maintained on Teklad 6% (w/w) Mouse/Rat Diet 7002 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets (Madison, WI). In experiment A, 5 male wild-type C57BL/6J and 5 male ob/ob mice were studied at 13 weeks of age. For experiment B, 4 male wild-type and 4 male transgenic aP2-SREBP-1c littermate mice were studied at 17-weeks of age. All mice were sacrificed during the mid-dark cycle following a 1–2-h fast.ImmunoblotsPooled liver membranes and nuclear extracts from livers of mice in experiments A and B were prepared and immunoblot analysis for endogenous SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 was performed as described previously (14Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar).RNA AnalysisFor Northern gel analysis, equal aliquots of total RNA made from each mouse liver were pooled (total, 10 μg), denatured with formaldehyde and formamide, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for hybridization. Hybridization conditions and cDNA probe preparation were carried out as described (15Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). As a loading control, a cDNA probe for mouse β-actin was prepared using reverse transcriptase-PCR and mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA as a template as described previously (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used were as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-CATTGAACATGGCATTGTTACCAACTGGGA-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-GCCATCTCCTGCTCAGAGTCTAGAGCAACA-3′ (24Tokunaga K. Taniguchi H. Yoda K. Shimizu M. Sakiyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Northern blot filters were exposed to a Fuji PhosphorImager, and the resulting bands were quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer with BAS1000 MacBAS software (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). The -fold change for each mRNA was calculated after normalization by the signal generated by β-actin. The RNase protection assay for SCD1 and SCD2 mRNA transcripts was carried out as described previously (17Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Cholesterol and Fatty Acid Synthesis in VivoThe rates of liver cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis were measured in nonfasted mice using [3 H]water as described previously (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The data presented are pooled results from two independent experiments, each of which included 5 12–16-week-old male mice of the indicated genotype.Tissue Cholesterol and Fatty Acid CompositionThe relative hepatic fatty acid compositions in the indicated lipid fractions were measured as described previously (17Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).RESULTSTable I shows the phenotypic characteristics of the mice used in the current studies. In experiment A, we studied male ob/ob mice on the C57BL/6J background and age-matched wild-type C57BL/6J male mice as controls. In experiment B, we studied aP2-SREBP-1c mice that overexpress human nSREBP-1c exclusively in adipose tissue and sex-matched littermate wild-type controls. The aP2-SREBP-1c mice were derived from the C57BL/6J and SJL strains. The ob/ob and aP2-SREBP-1c mice had similar elevations in plasma glucose and insulin, indicating they had similar levels of insulin resistance and diabetes. Liver cholesterol was increased 2–3-fold in both diabetic models. Liver triglyceride content was markedly elevated in livers from ob/ob (10-fold) and aP2-SREBP-1c (16-fold) mice compared with wild-type levels. The two models differ in that the ob/ob mice had massive peripheral fat stores and higher plasma free fatty acid concentrations compared with their wild-type controls. Conversely, the aP2-SREBP-1c mice had markedly reduced peripheral fat stores with a slight reduction in plasma free fatty acid levels, compared with their littermate controls.Table IPhenotypic comparison of wild-type, ob/ob, and aP2-SREBP-1c transgenic miceParameterExperiment AExperiment BWild-typeob/obWild-typeaP2-SREBP-1cNo. and sex5 males5 males4 males4 malesBody weight (g)27.0 ± 0.654.4 ± 1.5ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.27.6 ± 0.234.2 ± 0.9ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Liver weight (g)1.1 ± 0.104.1 ± 0.30ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.1.5 ± 0.044.6 ± 0.51ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Liver weight/body weight (%)4.2 ± 0.137.5 ± 0.29ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.5.4 ± 0.1113.3 ± 1.3ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Epididymal fat weight (g)0.43 ± 0.054.1 ± 0.22ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.0.36 ± 0.050.13 ± 0.03ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Epididymal fat/body weight (%)1.6 ± 0.207.5 ± 0.44ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.1.3 ± 0.170.39 ± 0.08ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Plasma insulin (ng/ml)0.20 ± 0.0321.4 ± 2.0ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.0.48 ± 0.1623.2 ± 4.1ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Plasma glucose (mg/dl)168 ± 15332 ± 21ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.160 ± 24295 ± 32bp < 0.05 (Student's t test) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Plasma FFA (mm/liter)361 ± 37562 ± 17ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.670 ± 69454 ± 24bp < 0.05 (Student's t test) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Total plasma cholesterol (mg/dl)94 ± 0.8172 ± 13ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.77 ± 3.7155 ± 8.9ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Total plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)83 ± 4.286 ± 9.2133 ± 13306 ± 57bp < 0.05 (Student's t test) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Liver cholesterol content (mg/g)2.4 ± 0.037.7 ± 0.80ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.1.9 ± 0.054.5 ± 1.2Liver triglyceride content (mg/g)15.4 ± 1.7154 ± 15ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.5.2 ± 1.284.0 ± 19ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest) between wild-type and ob/ob mice or aP2-SREBP-1c mice.Each value represents the mean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows immunoblots of SREBP-1 and -2 in nuclear extracts (N) and membranes (P) from livers of ob/ob mice, aP2-SREBP-1c mice, and their respective wild-type controls after a brief 1–2-h fast. The amount of transcriptionally active nSREBP-1 was 3–4-fold increased in livers from ob/ob (lane 2) and aP2-SREBP-1c (lane 6) mice compared with their respective wild-type controls (lanes 1 and 5). Consistent with previous experiments (11Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 17Shimomura I.

Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12354-12359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the predominant SREBP-1 mRNA transcript present was SREBP-1c as determined by an RNase protection assay (data not shown). This suggests that the SREBP-1 isoform measured by immunoblot is predominantly the SREBP-1c isoform. In contrast to the increase in nSREBP-1c, the amount of nSREBP-2 showed very little change in livers from either diabetic model (lanes 4 and8 versus lanes 3 and 7, respectively). Similar results were obtained in one other independent experiment.To quantify the mRNA levels of known SREBP-1c target genes, a series of Northern blot analyses were performed on pooled samples of total RNA from the livers of the mice described in Table I. The mRNA levels for several key genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and lipogenesis are shown in Fig. 2 for wild-type (WT) and ob/ob (ob) mice (panel A) and for wild-type (WT) and aP2-SREBP-1c (Tg) mice (panel B). Both hyperinsulinemic models had similar 2.5–5-fold elevations in the mRNAs for the lipogenic enzymes ATP citrate lyase, ACC, FAS, GPAT, and the NADPH-producing enzymes malic enzyme and Glu-6-PD. Less significant changes were measured in the mRNAs for the genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (i.e. low density lipoprotein receptor, HMG-CoA synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase). Similar results were obtained in one additional independent experiment (data not shown).Figure 2Amounts of various mRNAs as measured by blot hybridization in livers of wild-type C57BL/6J (WT) and C57BL/6J (ob/ob) (ob) mice (A), and wild-type (WT) and transgenic aP2-SREBP-1c (Tg) mice (B). The mice used in this experiment are described in Table I. Total RNA isolated from livers of individual mice was pooled, and 10-μg aliquots were subjected to electrophoresis and blot hybridization with the indicated 32 P-labeled cDNA probe. The dried filters were exposed to ReflectionTM NEF 496 film with intensifying screens at −80 °C for 3–36 h. The amount of radioactivity in each band was quantified by exposing the filters to a Fuji PhosphorImager and using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer with BAS1000 MacBAS software (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). The -fold change in each mRNA from ob/ob mice (A) and aP2-SREBP-1c mice (B), relative to that of the respective wild-type mice, was calculated after correction for loading differences with β-actin. These values are shown below each blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the changes measured in the mRNAs for the lipogenic enzymes resulted in increased rates of fatty acid synthesis in vivo, we used [3 H]water to directly measure newly synthesized cholesterol and fatty acids in livers of wild-type and diabetic mice (Table II). The fatty acid synthetic rates were 6-fold higher per gram of liver and 23-fold higher per organ in ob/ob mice. Livers from aP2-SREBP-1c mice had fatty acid synthetic rates that were 2.5- and 5.4-fold increased per gram and organ, respectively. In contrast, livers from ob/oband aP2-SREBP-1c mice had 6- and 3-fold reductions in the rate of incorporation of [3 H]water into digitonin-precipitable sterols per gram of liver, respectively. The lower cholesterol synthetic rates presumably reflect post-transcriptional suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity owing to the increased level of hepatic cholesterol (26Goldstein J.L.

Open table in a new tab A major fatty acid modifying enzyme in liver is the Δ9 desaturase, also known as stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Two isoforms of SCD (SCD1 and SCD2) are currently known (27Ntambi J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The major substrates for both SCD isoforms are palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acids, which are converted to palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) acids, respectively (27Ntambi J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the mRNA for SCD1 was increased in transgenic mice that overexpress nuclear SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2 in liver (17Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y.

https://openalex.org/W2091484442,"We earlier demonstrated that leptin induces expression of SOCS-3 mRNA in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, transfection data suggest that SOCS-3 is an inhibitor of leptin signaling. However, little is known about the regulation of SOCS-3 expression by leptin and the mechanism by which SOCS-3 inhibits leptin action. We here show that in CHO cells stably expressing the long form of the leptin receptor (CHO-OBRl), leptin induces transient expression of endogenous SOCS-3 mRNA but not of CIS, SOCS-1, or SOCS-2 mRNA. SOCS-3 protein levels were maximal after 2–3 h of leptin treatment and remained elevated at 20 h. Furthermore, in leptin-pretreated CHO-OBRl cells, proximal leptin signaling was blocked for more than 20 h after pretreatment, thus correlating with increased SOCS-3 expression. Leptin pretreatment did not affect cell surface expression of leptin receptors as measured by<sup>125</sup> I-leptin binding assays. In transfected COS cells, forced expression of SOCS-3 results in inhibition of leptin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. Finally, JAK2 co-immunoprecipitates with SOCS-3 in lysates from leptin-treated COS cells. These results suggest that SOCS-3 is a leptin-regulated inhibitor of proximal leptin signaling <i>in vivo</i>. Excessive SOCS-3 activity in leptin-responsive cells is therefore a potential mechanism for leptin resistance, a characteristic feature in human obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2054462517,"Intestinal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP) is a cytosolic protein that binds bile acids (BAs) with a high affinity. In the small intestine, its expression is restricted to the ileum where it is involved in the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Using the human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cell line, we have recently shown that BAs increased I-BABP gene expression. To determine whether this regulation occurs in vivo, the effect of BA depletion or supplementation was studied in mice. A dramatic drop in I-BABP mRNA levels was observed in mice treated with the BA-binding resin cholestyramine, whereas an increase was found in animals fed with taurocholic acid. BAs are physiological ligands for the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Both FXR and I-BABP are co-expressed along the small intestine and in Caco-2 cells. To determine the role of FXR in the regulation of I-BABP expression, the promoter of the human I-BABP gene was cloned. In Caco-2 cells, cotransfection of FXR and RXRα is required to obtain the full transactivation of the I-BABP promoter by BAs. Deletion and mutation analyses demonstrate that the FXR/RXRα heterodimer activates transcription through an inverted repeat bile acid responsive element located in position −160/−148 of the human I-BABP promoter. In conclusion, we show that FXR is a physiological BA sensor that is likely to play an essential role in BA homeostasis through the regulation of genes involved in their enterohepatic circulation.

Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4749-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In most mammals, bile is stored in the gall bladder. During a meal, BAs are released into the duodenum where they are required for the efficient absorption of dietary fat and lipid-soluble vitamins. In the distal gut, conjugated BAs may undergo bacterial modifications leading to the formation of secondary BAs. In humans, more than 90% of BAs are reabsorbed throughout the intestine and return, via the portal blood, to the liver where they are secreted again into bile. This enterohepatic circulation is essential for the maintenance of BA and cholesterol homeostasis (1Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4749-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Intestinal absorption of BAs takes place as a function of their chemical form (hydrophobicity index) through three complementary mechanisms: passive nonionic diffusion and facilitated and active protein-mediated transports. After bacterial deconjugation, passive diffusion of protonated BAs occurs in the ileum and colon. Passive absorption of glycine-conjugated BAs has also been recently reported in the jejunum of guinea pig (2Amelsberg A. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.-T. Hofmann A.F. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1098-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Conjugated dihydroxy-BAs are primarily absorbed at the jejunal level via facilitated transport, whereas taurine and glycine trihydroxy-BA are actively transported in the ileum (3Aldini R. Montagnani M. Roda A. Hrelia S. Biagi P.L. Roda E. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of jejunal carrier-mediated transport under physiological conditions remains to be determined. By contrast, the active ileal absorption of conjugated BAs has been the subject of extensive research. BA uptake in the ileum is mediated by an ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (IBAT) located in the brush border membrane of ileocytes. This 38-kDa integral plasma membrane protein has been cloned in various species including humans (4Craddock A.L. Love M.W. Daniel R.W. Kirby L.C. Walters H.C. Wong M.H. Dawson P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G157-G169PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological importance of IBAT for the maintenance of the enterohepatic circulation of BAs, and hence, cholesterol homeostasis, is supported by the observation that patients with mutations in the IBAT gene fail to absorb BAs efficiently and have reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Once in the cell, BAs are bound to the intestinal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP), a 14–15-kDa cytoplasmic protein whose expression is restricted to the ileum (7Coppola C.P. Gosche J.R. Arrese M. Ancowitz B. Madsen J. Vanderhoof J. Shneider B.L. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1172-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The I-BABP gene has been cloned and characterized from mouse (8Crossman M.W. Hauft S.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1547-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and rabbit (9Stengelin S. Apel S. Becker W. Maier M. Rosenberger J. Bewersdorf U. Girbig F. Weyland C. Wess G. Kramer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). I-BABP binds BAs with a high affinity and may be involved in cellular BA uptake and trafficking because it has been found to be transiently associated with the IBAT in the brush border membrane (10Kramer W.

Therefore, the synthesis of I-BABP may constitute a rate-limiting step in the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have recently shown that BAs are potent inducers of I-BABP gene expression in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells (11Kanda T. Foucaud L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P.

We report here that BAs induce expression of the human I-BABP gene through the interaction of the FXR/RXR heterodimer with a positive BA responsive element (BARE) in the proximal I-BABP promoter. The physiological relevance of these data is supported by the fact that BA-mediated regulation of I-BABP expression is also found in vivo in the mouse. Cholic acid, glycocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid were purchased from Steraloids, whereas chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and taurocholic acid (TCA) were purchased from Sigma. French guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals were followed. Male Swiss mice (30 ± 2 g) purchased from Centre d'Elevage R. Janvier (France) were used. Animals were housed individually in a controlled environment (constant temperature and humidity, darkness from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.) and fed ad libitum a standard chow containing 3% (w/w) lipid (UAR A-04, Usine d'Alimentation Rationnelle, France). To study the effect of BA depletion or supplementation on intestinal I-BABP expression in vivo, mice were fed laboratory chow for 10 days containing either 4% (w/w) cholestyramine or 0.5% (w/w) TCA and CDCA, respectively. The efficiency of treatments were assessed by the evaluation of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels (17Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After sacrifice, intestinal and hepatic samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNAs were extracted. In adult Swiss mice, the length of the small intestine is 50 ± 5 cm. To determine whether I-BABP and FXR are co-expressed in the gut, the small intestine was divided in five segments of 10 ± 0.5 cm from the pylorus to the ileocecal valvula. The jejunum is known to start usually only after the Treitz's ligament. The first 10 cm (segment 1) were arbitrary considered to be the duodenum, the following 25 cm (segments 2–4) were considered to be the jejunum, and the last 15 cm (segments 4–5) were considered to be the ileum. Total RNAs were extracted from liver and intestinal mucosa by the phenol-chloroform-LiCl method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNAs were prepared using Oligotex suspension (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs (20–50 μg) or poly(A+) (4.5 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to Gene Screen membranes (NEN Life Science Products) using previously published procedures (19Besnard P.

Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the megaprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 24-residue oligonucleotide specific for rat 18 S rRNA was used as probe to ensure that equivalent amounts of RNAs were loaded and transferred. This oligonucleotide was 5′ end-labeled using T4polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A human genomic library (CLONTECH, HL1111j) was screened using an EcoRI fragment of human I-BABP cDNA as hybridization probe (22Fujita M. Fujii H. Kanda T. Sato E. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 million plaque-forming units were screened, and several positive clones were isolated then purified. A clone containing the longest 5′-flanking region was characterized by subcloning in pUC119 and then sequencing on both strands by the dideoxy-chain termination method with a 373A Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems). This clone was found to contain a large 5′-flanking fragment and the transcription region covering exon 1 of hI-BABP gene. Human FXR and human RXRα were synthesized in vitro using the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel mobility shift assays (20 μl) contained 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg of poly(dI-dC), and freshly synthesized FXR and RXRα proteins (2.5 μl each). Competitor oligonucleotides including the wild type I-BABP IR-1 (I-BABP IR-1, gat cgg cca GGG TGA ATA ACC Tcg ggg), mutated I-BABP IR-1 (I-BABPmut IR-1, gat cgg cca GGA AGA ATA TTC Tcg ggg; mutations indicated in bold), and idealized IR-1 containing an IR-1 consensus (ideal IR1, gat cgg cca AGG TCA ATG ACC tcg ggg) were included at a 5- or 25-fold excess. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 10 ng of 5′ end-labeled [γ-32P]ATP oligonucleotide (I-BABP IR-1) was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 10 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. The 3.7-kilobase DNA genomic fragment of human I-BABP was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction-based generation of different deletion and mutation constructs of the promoter region. Polymerase chain reactions were performed with a proofreading DNA polymerase (Pfu DNA polymerase, Stratagene) and a common antisense primer that ended 44 bp downstream the transcription start site. The −2769/+44 and −1204/+44 bp fragments were cloned upstream the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the pCAT3-basic vector (Promega). The -148/+44 bp fragment was obtained by AvaI digestion of the -2769/+44 bp fragment. Mutation and deletion of the IR-1 sequence was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the following oligonucleotides 5′-TCCCCAGCCTGAATAAGGTCGGG-3′ (mutations in the IR-1 BARE underlined) and 5′-GGCAATGGGGTGACAGCACTTGGGGCTTGTCCCTCCAGGT-3′, respectively. All constructs were confirmed prior to use by both restriction digestions and sequencing with the dideoxy chain termination method. The enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells were used for the transfection studies. They were plated in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of phenol red supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum at 50–60% confluency. In general, transfection mixes contained 250 ng of human FXR and/or human RXRα expression vectors, 4 μg of I-BABP-CAT reporter plasmid, 500 ng of human IBAT expression vector (generous gift of Dr P. Dawson, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC), 500 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were transfected overnight by calcium phosphate precipitation. The medium was changed by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without phenol red) supplemented with 10% delipidated calf serum and BAs, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activities. An in vivo study was designed to assess the effect of alterations in the luminal BA levels on I-BABP gene expression. The experiments were conducted in mice rather than in rats, because their intestines are subject to intermittent fluxes of BAs released from the gall bladder. BA depletion was achieved pharmacologically by the addition of the BA sequestrant resin cholestyramine in the diet. The BA loading was performed by supplementation of the diet with either TCA or CDCA. No significant changes in body mass or in food intake were found between controls and treated mice through the course of the experiment (data not shown). The effectiveness of the treatments was demonstrated by an increase or a decrease in hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene expression in response to cholestyramine and BAs, respectively (17Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). In ileum, a dramatic drop in I-BABP mRNA levels was seen in BA-depleted mice, whereas a significant increase occurred after chronic TCA feeding. By contrast, the unconjugated BA CDCA exerted no effect on I-BABP expression under these conditions (Fig.1). These data demonstrate that changes in BA pool size result in marked alterations in I-BABP gene expressionin vivo. The small intestine is a heterogeneous organ characterized by variable gene expression along the gastrocolic axis at the origin of functional specialization. If the nuclear receptor FXR is involved in the regulation of I-BABP gene expression, these proteins should be coexpressed within this tissue. As shown in Fig.2 A, ileum is the exclusive intestinal segment where FXR, I-BABP, and IBAT are expressed. By contrast, L-FABP, an I-BABP-related protein known to also bind BA (23Thumser A.E.A. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), exhibits a nonoverlapping pattern of expression with FXR (Fig.2 A). It is noteworthy that L-FABP gene expression is not regulated by BAs (11Kanda T. Foucaud L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (15Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perimann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), FXR was also found in the kidney and at a lower level in the liver (Fig.2 B). Low levels of FXR mRNA were detectable in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells used in the transfection studies. By contrast, IBAT mRNA were undetectable in these cells. As described previously (11Kanda T. Foucaud L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H. Biochem.

Interestingly, CDCA treatment led to an apparent decrease in FXR mRNA levels (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the BAs regulate FXR expression. FXR regulates gene transcription as an heterodimer with RXR (15Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perimann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.

To determine whether this heterodimer is involved in the BA-dependent induction of the human I-BABP gene, a −2769/+44 bp fragment of I-BABP promoter was cloned upstream of a CAT reporter gene. This reporter was transiently transfected into Caco-2 cells together with human FXR and/or human RXRα expression vectors in the presence or absence of 100 μm CDCA and/or 1 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid. As shown in Fig.3 A, reporter gene activity was induced efficiently in presence of FXR and CDCA. Weaker activation was seen with RXRα and its ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid. Maximum transactivation was obtained when both FXR and RXRα expression vectors were co-transfected, and the cells were treated with CDCA and 9-cis-retinoic acid. These data demonstrate that the I-BABP gene is regulated by the FXR/RXR heterodimer. We next evaluated the ability of different physiologically relevant BAs to activate transcription of the human I-BABP promoter. Both CDCA and the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid were efficacious activators of the I-BABP promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 3 B). CDCA-mediated induction of reporter gene expression was dose-dependent with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 35 μm (Fig. 3 C). A significant activation occurred with concentrations as low as 5 μm. In contrast to CDCA and deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and the hydrophilic BA cholic acid exhibited relatively weak activation (Fig. 3 B), whereas the conjugated BAs failed to activate transcription through the I-BABP promoter. These last data are paradoxical because (i) the glyco- and tauro-conjugated BAs are the major forms found in vivoand (ii) TCA feeding significantly increases the I-BABP mRNA levels in the mouse (Fig. 1). We previously showed (12Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Conser T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar) that conjugated BAs require the presence of the membrane transporter (IBAT) to activate FXR in CV-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, IBAT is absent in the Caco-2 cells. To overcome this limitation, Caco-2 cells were cotransfected with a human IBAT expression vector together with FXR and RXRα. Under these conditions, the I-BABP promoter-reporter gene was strongly activated by 5 μm cholic acid, TCA, or glycocholic acid (Fig. 3 D). Thus, the major physiological BAs regulate expression of the human I-BABP gene promoter. The FXR/RXRα heterodimer recognizes the insect ecdysone responsive element that consists of an inverted repeat of the nuclear receptor half-site sequence AG(G/T)TCA separated by 1 nucleotide (IR-1) (15Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perimann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the proximal promoters of the human, rabbit, and mouse I-BABP genes revealed a highly conserved but imperfect IR-1 sequence (Fig. 4). To determine whether the FXR/RXRα heterodimer can bind to this IR-1 motif, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the32P-labeled IR-1 from the human I-BABP promoter in presence of human FXR and/or human RXRα. Neither FXR nor RXRα alone bound to the probe (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and 2). However, when mixed, the two proteins bound efficiently to the I-BABP IR-1 (Fig. 5 A,lane 3). This binding was specific, as demonstrated by competition with an excess of either wild type IR-1 motif or an idealized IR-1 sequence containing two consensus half-sites (Fig.5 A, lanes 4–7). A mutated IR-1 motif failed to compete (Fig. 5 A, lanes 8 and 9).Figure 5Characterization of a BARE in the human I-BABP gene reporter. A, the human I-BABP IR-1 binds the FXR/RXRα heterodimer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with in vitro translated FXR and RXRα and with the wild type human IR-1 as probe. Competition analysis was performed with a 5- or 25-fold excess of I-BABP IR-1, idealized IR-1 (Ideal IR-1) or mutated IR-1 (I-BABPmut IR-1). B, mutation-deletion analysis of the human I-BABP promoter. Caco-2 cells were cotransfected with FXR and RXRα expression vectors and the different I-BABP promoter construct as indicated. Lane 1, the −1204/+44 I-BABP construct contains the IR-1 sequence located between −160 and −148; lane 2, the −148/+44 I-BABP construct is a deletion of the 5′ end of the promoter that lacks the IR-1; lanes 3 and 4, the −1204/+44 I-BABPmut and I-BABPdel constructs mutate or delete the IR-1 (mutationunderlined). Cells were treated with 100 μmCDCA for 24 h. Data are expressed as fold activation relative to cells treated with the vehicle alone and represents mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the functional role of this FXR/RXRα-binding site in the regulation of human I-BABP gene by BAs, Caco-2 cells were cotransfected with human FXR and human RXRα expression vectors and I-BABP promoter-CAT reporter plasmids in which the IR-1 sequence was mutated. The −1204/+44 construct containing the native IR-1 sequence was transactivated about 30-fold in the presence of CDCA (Fig.5 B, lane 1). BA transactivation of the I-BABP gene was abolished in the −148/+44 construct in which the IR-1 sequence was partially deleted (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). Notably, mutation or deletion of the IR-1 motif resulted in the complete loss of reporter gene induction in response to CDCA (Fig.5 B, lanes 3 and 4). These data establish this IR-1 motif in the proximal human I-BABP promoter to be a functional BARE. I-BABP is a small cytoplasmic protein that belongs to the fatty acid-binding protein family (24Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the small intestine, it is found exclusively in the ileum where it binds BAs with high affinity. Although the cellular function of I-BABP is not yet fully understood, it may facilitate BA uptake and trafficking and/or serve as an intracellular buffer for protecting cells from the detergent effects of excess BAs. We have recently shown that I-BABP gene expression in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells is tightly regulated by BAs, especially CDCA (11Kanda T. Foucaud L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To establish the physiological relevance of these data, anin vivo study was conducted in mice chronically subjected to a BA depletion or excess. Adaptative up- and down-regulation of the I-BABP expression appears to depend on the size of the BA pool because the BA sequestrant cholestyramine triggered a dramatic drop in I-BABP mRNA levels while supplementation of the diet with TCA increased I-BABP expression levels. Surprisingly, CDCA exerted no regulatory action when it was added in the diet. It is possible that CDCA does not reach the ileum in a sufficient concentration to regulate I-BABP expression under these conditions. Indeed, it is known that protonated, unconjugated BAs passively diffuse along the small intestine. The acidic microclimate found in the unstirred water layer overlying the microvilli of enterocytes (25Shiau Y.F. Fernandez P. Jackson M.J. McMonagles S. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G608-G612PubMed Google Scholar) must favor the protonation of dietary CDCA and thus its passive uptake. The positive feedback reported here was not found by Arrese and co-workers (26Arrese M. Trauner M. Sacchiero R.J. Crossman M.W. Shneider B.L. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in the rat because neither common bile duct ligation nor pharmacological sequestration of BAs led to a change in the expression of IBAT and I-BABP. The origin of this discrepancy is likely due to differences in the regulation of BA metabolism and transport between species that have gall bladders (e.g. humans and mice), and those that do not (e.g. rats). Thus in humans and other mammals with gall bladders, it may be necessary to modulate the expression of I-BABP and other genes involved in BA homeostasis to cope with the fluxes that occur in BA levels within the enterohepatic circulation. The nuclear receptor FXR was recently proposed to be a physiological BA sensor (12Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Conser T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M.

Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). FXR is found in the tissues known to have significant BA metabolism, i.e. liver, kidney, adrenals, and gut (15Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perimann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Our detailed examination of its expression along the mouse small intestine shows that FXR displays an overlapping expression pattern with the BA-transporters (I-BABP and IBAT) in the ileum. This finding suggests that FXR could play a physiological role in the regulation of BA flux in the ileal segment of the small intestine. Indeed, analysis of the human I-BABP promoter reveals the existence of a specific BA responsive element, which interacts with the FXR/RXRα heterodimer. Because BAs exist predominantly in their conjugated form in vivo, it is noteworthy that physiological concentrations of both glyco- and tauro-conjugated BAs are able to transactivate the human I-BABP promoter when Caco-2 cells are co-transfected with the IBAT expression vector. Thus, conjugated BAs are likely to serve as natural FXR ligands in tissues that express IBAT such as the ileum. The fact that the positive BARE sequence is highly conserved in the proximal promoter of human, mouse, and rabbit I-BABP genes together with the recent finding that FXR regulates the mouse I-BABP gene (13Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M. Lusting K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that FXR plays a critical role in the modulation of I-BABP gene expression in multiple species. Because BAs bind to both I-BABP and FXR, we speculate that the induction of I-BABP expression by FXR may provide a mechanism for feedback regulation of ileal BA-sensitive genes through modulation of intracellular BA levels. In conclusion, we have presented the first data demonstrating that I-BABP gene expression is physiologically regulated by BA flux. The conservation of this regulatory pathway from mice to humans is consistent with the role of FXR as a physiological BA sensor in the gut. Because the fecal loss of BAs is a major way for the elimination of cholesterol, identification of FXR antagonists may provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hence, of cardiovascular diseases.

The function of this new protease, tentatively named stratum corneum tryptic enzyme, may be related to stratum corneum turnover and desquamation in the epidermis. In order to fulfill its role as an efficient physical-chemical barrier, the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, must have a high mechanical as well as chemical resistance. The cellular building blocks of the stratum corneum, the corneocytes, are well adapted to their function. The integration of the properties of individual corneocytes into the tissue as a functioning unit depends on strong intercellular adhesive structures. There is now strong evidence that the modified desmosomes of the stratum corneum play a crucial role in this context (1Lundström A. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 216-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chapman S.J. Walsh A. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1990; 282: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Egelrud T. Lundström A. Acta Dermato-Venereol. 1989; 69: 470-476PubMed Google Scholar).The stratum corneum is continuously being formed in the process of epidermal differentiation, in which a fraction of the basal, proliferating keratinocytes leave the basal membrane and migrate, while differentiating, toward the skin surface. Eventually, the cells become mature, anucleated, anabolically dead corneocytes. The cells stay in the stratum corneum for 2–4 weeks and are then shed from the skin surface in the process of desquamation.The mechanisms involved in desquamation and their regulation are poorly understood. Since corneocytes are anabolically dead and not responding to common cellular stimuli, the mechanisms responsible for desquamation must be present in the tissue when the deepest parts of the stratum corneum are being formed. In order not to interfere with stratum corneum function, these mechanisms must, however, be “programmed” to be more or less inactive for several weeks and then become activated.During the last several years, it has become clear that one of the mechanisms involved in desquamation is a well regulated proteolysis of intercellular adhesive structures (4Lundström A.

One such piece of evidence is that SCCE is formed as an inactive precursor with a seven-amino acid residue-long propeptide. The propeptide can be removed in vitro by means of tryptic cleavage of a Lys–Ile bond, yielding proteolytically active SCCE (9Hansson L. Strömqvist M. Bäckman A. Wallbrandt P. Carlstein A. Egelrud T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19420-19426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the stratum corneum, the SCCE precursor constitutes a significant fraction of the total SCCE protein present. 2A. Lundström and T. Egelrud, unpublished observation.2A. Lundström and T. Egelrud, unpublished observation. This suggests that SCCE activation catalyzed by an hitherto unknown trypsin-like protease may play a regulatory role in desquamation.In addition to SCCE activation, trypsin-like proteases may also be involved directly in the degradation of intercellular adhesive structures in the stratum corneum. By means of zymography of extracts of stratum corneum, components with caseinolytic activity with apparent molecular mass around 30 kDa can be detected in addition to SCCE. The 30-kDa protease(s) can be inhibited with leupeptin, but not by chymostatin (7Lundström A. Egelrud T. Acta Dermato-Venereol. 1991; 71: 471-474PubMed Google Scholar, 8Egelrud T. J. Invest.

The amino acid sequence data thus obtained were used to carry out molecular cloning of a cDNA representing a new, skin-derived serine protease that from the deduced amino acid sequence is predicted to have a trypsin-like primary substrate specificity. The enzyme is tentatively named “stratum corneum tryptic enzyme” (SCTE).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlantar stratum corneum was collected as described previously (8Egelrud T. J. Invest.

Samples were diluted in electrophoresis sample buffer without reducing agent and were not heated before application.The same starting material as for the purification of SCCE (8Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used, i.e. a KCl extract of plantar corneocytes that had undergone spontaneous dissociation during incubation at 37 °C of plantar stratum corneum in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA. Extracts corresponding to 50 g of dried tissue, approximately 250 ml, were filtered through a 0.45-μm Minisart N membrane (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) and applied on a 3-ml Resource RPC reversed phase chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to FPLC equipment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted with a linear gradient consisting of 0–100% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a total volume of 100 ml, flow rate 2 ml/min. Fractions containing SCTE and SCCE, which eluted together at approximately 50% acetonitrile, were pooled (1–2 ml), diluted with 5 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and applied on a 1-ml Resource S FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The column was eluted with a linear gradient consisting of 0–1 m NaCl in equilibrating buffer in a total volume of 100 ml, flow rate 1 ml/min. SCTE-containing fractions were pooled (4 ml) and again subjected to reversed phase chromatography as above. The fraction (1 ml) containing peak SCTE activity was lyophilized in portions and subjected to further purification by means of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (SDS-PAGE) (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) with and without reduction prior to electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore AB, Sundbyberg, Sweden) and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1).

Sequencing was performed with cycle programs adapted to our reaction cartridges and chemicals from the manufacturer.Cloning and Sequencing of scte cDNATwo degenerated oligomers, rD1 and rD2, were designed from the amino acid sequence obtained for the purified SCTE (Table I). DNA was extracted from the λgt11 library by phenol/chloroform extraction. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was set up where 150 of the product from the first PCR reaction was used as a template in the second round. PCR was performed according to standard protocols using Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR 1 was run for 15 cycles, and PCR 2 was run for 30 cycles. To amplify the cDNA encoding for the N-terminal part of SCTE, the primer pair rD1-F1 (see Table I) was used followed by a PCR using rD2-F2.

Open table in a new tab From the obtained nucleotide sequence, specific primers were designed that were used in the subsequent cloning reactions by means of which λgt11 clones were obtained that covered the whole coding sequence.To verify the sequence, total RNA was extracted from HaCaT cells and human epidermis with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Täby, Sweden) as recommended by the manufacturer. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed according to standard protocols with oligo(dT) (Perkin-Elmer) in the RT reaction and scte-specific primer pairs in the PCRs. To obtain sequence down to the poly(A), the oligomers (dT)17-Ad and Ad (see Table I) were designed (20Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In the following PCR, the Ad primer binding to the end of the oligomer used in the RT reaction was used in combination with the scte specific primer P4. Using the sequence information obtained, primer rP7 could be designed and used in the subsequent PCRs to verify the 3′-end sequence. Reversed transcriptase and RNasin were purchased from Promega (Falkenberg, Sweden). Cloning and sequencing was performed as described above. In order to detect and avoid PCR mismatches, all sequence analyses were performed on at least three independently cloned products. Homology searches were carried out with the Gapped Blast 2.0.6 On-net program (National Center for Biotechnology Information), and prediction of the signal cleavage site was performed with the SignalP Version 1.1 On-net program (Expasy Tools, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis).Northern Blot AnalysesMessenger RNA was recovered from total RNA from HaCat cells using the Oligotex Midi kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Two μg of mRNA was denaturated with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, followed by capillary transfer to a positively charged nylon filter (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 10× SSC according to standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After UV cross-linking, deglyoxylation was performed by washing the membrane in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 65 °C for 15 min. Prehybridization for 30 min and hybridization overnight at 68 °C was performed in DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For this purpose, a scte-specific digoxygenin-labeled riboprobe, covering positions −62 to 343 in thescte cDNA nucleotide sequence (Fig. 2), was prepared with the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membrane was washed in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 3 × 20 min before detection reactions were performed as recommended (DIG wash and Block Buffer Set and CDP-Star; Roche Molecular Biochemicals).Figure 2The nucleotide sequence of scte derived from the human keratinocyte line HaCaT and the predicted amino acid sequence of an SCTE preproprotein. The methionine at position −66 in the amino acid sequence is the suggested start of the signal sequence. The proposed cleavage site of the signal peptide is at alanine −37. Underlinings in the amino acid sequence show the conserved sequences of the catalytic triad of serine proteases. Italics in the amino acid sequence denote the proposed propeptide of SCTE. Boldface letters in the amino acid sequence show amino acid residues consistent with amino acid sequence data for purified SCTE. The underlined nucleotide cat position −212 in the nucleotide sequence is in the λgt11 cDNA clones exchanged for an a.

The production and characterization of these antibodies will be described in detail elsewhere. 4E. Ekholm, M. Brattsand, and T. Egelrud, manuscript in preparation. SCCE-specific antibodies (22Sondell B. Dyberg P. Anneroth G.K.B. Östman P.-O. Egelrud T. Acta Dermato-Venereol. 1996; 76: 177-181PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Symbicom AB (Umeå, Sweden).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Pro-SCTEFor expression of recombinant pro-SCTE (r-pro-SCTE) in mammalian cells, the Semliki Forest Virus system (Life Technologies, Inc., Täby, Sweden) was used as described (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston1995: 16.20Google Scholar). A PCR fragment corresponding to positions −207 to 684 in the scte cDNA (Fig. 2) was amplified using the XbaI-containing oligomers xP8 and rP9x (see Table I) with Pfu Taq polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as recommended. The fragment obtained was ligated into the XbaI site of the pSFV1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Messenger RNA from the recombinant pSFV1 and the pSFV-Helper 2 plasmids were in vitro transcribed and electroporated into BHK-21 cells as described (22Sondell B. Dyberg P. Anneroth G.K.B. Östman P.-O. Egelrud T. Acta Dermato-Venereol. 1996; 76: 177-181PubMed Google Scholar). Virus particles containing recombinant SCTE cDNA were collected and used for infection of CHO-K1 cells, cultured in DMEM/NUT.MIX F-12 W/Glutamax I (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the subsequent purification, r-pro-SCTE was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antiserum Br-1. Conditioned culture medium (60–300 ml) was diluted with 1 volume of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Resource S column eluted with 0–1m NaCl in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, total volume 50 ml. r-pro-SCTE-containing fractions were pooled and further purified, either by reversed phase chromatography as above, or by gel exclusion chromatography on two serially coupled Superdex 75HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.2 m NaCl. N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses were performed as above on fractions from reversed phase chromatography after lyophilization, SDS-PAGE, and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.Biochemical AnalysesFor activation of r-pro-SCTE, 250 μl of a fraction from gel exclusion chromatography was made 0.5m in NaCl and incubated at room temperature for 90 min with 25 μl of sedimented trypsin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm; catalog no. T-4019). After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered and analyzed by zymography as above and immunoblotting.For glycosidase treatment r-pro-SCTE containing fractions from gel exclusion chromatography or preparations of partially purified native SCTE (see below) were dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid, lyophilized, and treated with N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Treated samples were analyzed by immunoblotting.Partially purified preparations of native SCTE used for glycosidase treatment and comparative studies were prepared from plantar stratum corneum. Ten g of tissue was ground in a mortar and mechanically homogenized in 200 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7. The suspension was left at room temperature for 1 h, the insoluble material was recovered by centrifuging, and the pellet was extracted with 40 ml of 1 m acetic acid. The extract was cleared by centrifuging and filtration before being either dialyzed against 0.01m acetic acid and lyophilized in portions or subjected to reversed phase chromatography as above. Fractions containing SCTE, as detected by zymography and immunoblotting, were further purified by gel exclusion chromatography as above in 0.2 m acetic acid, 0.3m NaCl.Analyses of SCTE Expression in Human TissuescDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of mRNA, recovered as described above, from human skin using Ready to Go T-primed First Strand Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR was performed on cDNA from epidermis and Human Multiple Tissue Panel I (CLONTECH), using the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH) as recommended. For scte, human scce andg3pdh primer pairs P4-rP7, S1-rS2, and G1-rG2 (TableI), respectively, were used in the amplification reactions. Samples were collected after 25, 30, and 35 PCR cycles, and the products were visualized by EtBr staining after separation on 1% agarose gels.RESULTSPurification of Native Human SCTEElectrophoretic analyses of a preparation obtained after the three chromatogaphy steps (reversed phase chromatography, cationic ion exchange chromatography, and reversed phase chromatography) are shown in Fig.1. Zymography (Fig. 1 A) in gels containing casein showed one strong proteolytic band with apparent molecular mass around 25 kDa and one weaker component with slightly lower mobility. These two bands correspond to unglycosylated and glycosylated SCCE, respectively (9Hansson L. Strömqvist M. Bäckman A. Wallbrandt P. Carlstein A. Egelrud T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19420-19426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a zone of proteolysis, apparently consisting of one stronger band with molecular mass around 30 kDa, and two weaker bands, one with slightly higher mobility and one with slightly lower mobility than the major band, were seen. Coomassie staining of a membrane with transferred proteins after SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig. 1 B. Samples that had not been reduced prior to electrophoresis (right part of Fig. 1 B) were found to contain two groups of proteins with molecular mass apparently similar to the two groups of proteolytic components seen on zymograms with apparent molecular mass of about 30 and 25 kDa, respectively. Samples that had been reduced prior to electrophoresis contained several components: one group with apparent molecular mass around 33 kDa, one group with molecular mass around 30 kDa, and several components with lower molecular mass. Immunblotting with SCCE-specific antibodies (not shown) showed that the 25-kDa components (nonreduced samples), the 30-kDa components, and some of the smaller components (reduced samples) were related to SCCE.Amino acid sequence analyses of the Coomassie-stained components were carried out on membrane strips as outlined in Fig. 1 B, and the results are summarized in Table II. Strips from samples that had not been reduced prior to electrophoresis yielded two N-terminal amino acid sequences. Strips taken from the middle portion and strips taken from the edges of the diffuse 30-kDa band gave identical amino acid sequences. The major sequence in nonreduced samples was identical with the only sequence that could be found in strips from reduced samples. The minor sequence in nonreduced samples could later be identified as part of the amino acid sequence for SCTE deduced from its cDNA (see below).Table IIResults of amino acid sequence analyses for purified SCTEStripAmino acid sequence1IIGGSDCDM(A/H)TQPWQ2IIGGSDXDMHTQESGQQMFQGVKS3IIGGSDCDM(A/H)TQPWEAALLLaMajor sequence.ESGQQMFQGVKSIP(A/H)PGYSbMinor sequence.4IIGGSDXDMHTQESGQQMFQGKSThe numbering of strips refers to Fig. 1 B.

The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease via an unknown mechanism(s). As glia are the primary central nervous system cell type that synthesize apoE, we characterized lipoproteins secreted by astrocytes from wild type (WT), apoE (−/−), and apoE transgenic mice expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 in a mouseapoE (−/−) background. Nondenaturing size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that WT, apoE3, and apoE4 astrocytes secrete particles the size of plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) composed of phospholipid, free cholesterol, and protein, primarily apoE and apoJ. However, the lipid:apoE ratio of particles containing human apoE is significantly lower than WT. ApoE localizes across HDL-like particle sizes. ApoJ localizes to the smallest HDL-like particles.ApoE (−/−) astrocytes secrete little phospholipid or free cholesterol despite comparable apoJ expression, suggesting that apoE is required for normal secretion of astrocyte lipoproteins. Further, particles were not detected in apoE (−/−) samples by electron microscopy. Nondenaturing immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that apoE and apoJ reside predominantly on distinct particles. These studies suggest that apoE expression influences the unique structure of astrocyte lipoproteins, a process further modified by apoE species.

As a ligand for lipoprotein receptors, apoE helps to regulate plasma lipid and cholesterol metabolism. This process may also be operating in the parenchyma of the brain, as neural cells express a variety of receptors in the low density lipoprotein receptor family (7Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev.

Thus, lipoprotein secretion by isolated glial cells may provide a system in which to further dissect the role of apoE and apoJ in lipoprotein synthesis, secretion and function in the brain.In terms of function, several lines of evidence suggest that apoE and apoJ may be involved in neural homeostasis beyond their capacity to transport lipid. Both apoE and apoJ increase in response to different brain insults (3May P.C. Finch C.E. Trends Neurol. Sci. 1992; 15: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Poirier J.

For example, the type of particle and ratio of apoE to lipid determine the affinity of apoE for specific receptors (38Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Biochem. 1978; 17: 1440-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 39Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have characterized the particles secreted by primary astrocytes as an initial step toward understanding the function of lipoproteins unique to the CNS. Astrocytes were cultured from wild type, apoE (−/−), and apoEtransgenic mice in which human apoE3 or apoE4 is expressed under the control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter on a mouse apoE (−/−) background. Our data show that expression of apoE by astrocytes is required for normal lipoprotein secretion by these cells and that apoE species appears to influence lipoprotein composition.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimalsTransgenic mice expressing human apoE3(line 37) or apoE4 (line 1) by astrocytes in the brain in the absence of mouse apoE (apoE (−/−)) were generated as described (40Sun Y. Wu S. Bu G. Onifade M.K. Patel S.N. LaDu M.J. Fagan A.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mated with apoE (−/−) mice that had been backcrossed 10 times to the C57Bl/6 background (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Nontransgenic littermates (humanapoE-negative, mouse apoE (−/−)) and wild type mice (mouse apoE (+/+)) of the same background strain (C57Bl/6) were used as controls. Genotype was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (40Sun Y. Wu S. Bu G. Onifade M.K. Patel S.N. LaDu M.J. Fagan A.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments investigating the effect of apoE expression on astrocyte lipoproteins, mice hemizygous for the humanapoE transgene (human apoE (+/−), mouseapoE (−/−)) were mated with each other in order to generate human apoE (+/−) and human apoE (+/+) littermates. Transgenic genotype was confirmed by quantitative slot blot analysis of tail DNA using a probe specific for the humanapoE transgene (40Sun Y. Wu S. Bu G. Onifade M.K. Patel S.N. LaDu M.J. Fagan A.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as by test breedings.Primary Astrocyte CulturesPrimary cultures of forebrain astrocytes (>95% pure) were prepared from individual neonatal (1–2 day old) mice and grown to confluency (10–14 days) in T75 flasks as described (41Rose K. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. Tyson C.A. Frazier J.M. In Vitro Biological Methods: Methods in Toxicology. 1A. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 46-60Google Scholar). Growth medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 10% horse serum (Hyclone), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml; Sigma). Once confluent, medium was removed, cells were washed two times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and cultures were incubated in 5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing N2 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) for an additional 72 h. Conditioned medium was removed, clarified by centrifugation at ∼800 × g for 5 min, and stored at 4 °C until it was analyzed. ApoE levels in medium samples from individual cultures were quantified by Western blot or ELISA as described below. Concentrations ranged from ∼5–10 μg of apoE/ml of unconcentrated medium.FractionationAstrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) containing wild type mouse apoE, no apoE (apoE (−/−)), human apoE3, or human apoE4 was concentrated 50-fold (Centriplus-10 or Centriprep-10; Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to fractionation. One milliliter of concentrated ACM was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography with tandem Superose 6 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.02 mNaPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.03% EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide. Seventy fractions of 400 μl each were collected and analyzed.Lipid AnalysisPhospholipid (PL) (Wako; Richmond, VA), total cholesterol (TC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), free cholesterol (Wako), and triglyceride (TG) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were measured enzymatically using commercially available kits. Cholesteryl ester measures were determined by subtracting the free cholesterol value from the TC value. For compositional analyses, group differences were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferronit tests.Western BlotFor SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), samples containing 2× Laemmli buffer were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed on a 10–20% SDS-tricine gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and probed with rabbit antisera to rat or human apoE (1:5000) (6LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens S.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A.

Antisera to rat apoE cross-reacts with mouse apoE. Immunoreactivity was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation of apoE expression in unconcentrated ACM samples was determined by comparison to recombinant human apoE standards (42Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For analysis of relative immunostaining intensity between fractionated samples, blots were quantitated by densitometry and comparison to apoE standards purified from mouse or human plasma.Electron MicroscopyA concentrated aliquot (0.5 mg of protein/ml) from pooled ACM fractions (∼36–46) was placed on a carbon-coated electron microscopy grid and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid according to established procedures (43Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Particles were examined with a Phillips CM10 electron microscope.Nondenaturing Gradient Gel ElectrophoresisSamples of unconcentrated ACM were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 4–25% polyacrylamide gradient gel as described (37Holtzman D.M.

Equal volumes (30 μl) of medium samples before immunoprecipitation (IP) and the supernatant after IP were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies to human apoE or rat apoJ, as described above.RESULTSGel filtration chromatography was used to separate and isolate astrocyte lipoproteins. In contrast to density centrifugation, this technique has been shown to preserve the protein composition of lipoproteins during the process of fractionation (6LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens S.R.

Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 58-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACM from mice expressing wild type (WT) mouse apoE, no apoE(−/−, null), human apoE3 (E3), or human apoE4(E4) was fractionated, and selected fractions were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for apoE and apoJ (Fig.1). We were unable to detect apoAI or AII in these samples (data not shown). In all four conditions, apoJ is detected as a ∼80-kDa species, a covalently linked dimer of two ∼40-kDa subunits. The elution pattern of apoJ, as well as the magnitude of apoJ expression, did not vary across the four conditions, suggesting that the presence of apoE does not affect apoJ secretion by mouse astrocytes. As expected, no apoE is detected in the ACM fromapoE (−/−) animals. In WT- and E4-ACM, apoE is primarily detected as a ∼34–36-kDa monomer, as both mouse and human E4 have no cysteine residues (Arg-112 and Arg-158). In contrast, apoE is present as both a ∼35-kDa monomer and an ∼80-kDa dimer in the E3-ACM, as human apoE3 has a cysteine at residue 112. In all the samples, apoE and apoJ elute in fractions consistent with lipoproteins comparable in size to plasma HDLs (∼fractions 30–48, Fig. 1). The elution profiles for E3 and E4 are similar to wild type mouse apoE (peak, ∼fractions 37–41). In contrast to apoE, apoJ elution profiles are shifted slightly to the right (peak, ∼fractions 41–45), suggesting that on average, apoJ is associated with smaller particles.Consistent with the SDS-PAGE results, profiles of the distribution of lipid (PL and TC) and apoproteins (E and J) across the size gradient demonstrate that astrocyte lipoproteins from mice expressingapoE are generally the size of plasma HDLs (Fig.2). The broad distribution of lipid and apoproteins suggests a heterogenous population of particles ranging in size from small low density lipoprotein (∼fractions 22–29) to small HDLs (∼fractions 46–50). Lipid peaks in the void volume (∼fractions 8–12) do not contain apoproteins, suggesting the presence of large cell membrane fragments in some samples, not the presence of large lipoproteins. In general, the PL and TC distribution encompassed ∼fractions 35–48, peaking at fraction 41 (Fig. 2,A and B), and is consistent with the apoprotein distribution. The apoJ elution profile from the WT, null, E3, and E4 (Fig. 2 C) is comparable and consistent with apoJ being associated with a particle (peak, ∼fractions 39–49, Fig.2 C) slightly smaller than apoE, which peaks ∼fractions 35–45 (Fig. 2 D). Again, the distribution pattern of apoJ and the amount of apoJ secreted (∼1 μg/ml unconcentrated ACM) do not appear to vary with changes in the species (mouse versushuman) or amount of apoE secreted. In addition, there is little detectable lipid (<2 μg/ml) secreted in the absence of apoE, indicating that apoJ-containing “particles” are likely to be very lipid-poor. These observations suggest that apoJ, expressed at these levels, cannot support the normal production of astrocyte lipoproteins. To confirm that apoE is both necessary and sufficient for the secretion of lipoproteins by cultured mouse astrocytes, we analyzed the particles secreted by apoJ (−/−) mice (generously provided by M. Kindy, University of Kentucky, and B. Aronow and J. Harmony, University of Cincinnati). The lipid distribution of particles secreted byapoJ (−/−) mice are virtually identical to the WT particles (data not shown) demonstrating that it is apoE, not apoJ, that drives normal levels of lipoprotein secretion by cultured mouse astrocytes.Figure 2Distribution of lipids and apoproteins secreted by primary mouse astrocytes. Fifty ml of ACM from WT (blue squares), apoE null (green asterisks), apoE3 (pink circles), or apoE4 (brown triangles) mice was concentrated to 1 ml prior to fractionation via gel filtration chromatography. Adjacent fractions were pooled and analyzed for phospholipid (A) and total cholesterol (B). Selected fractions were immunoblotted for apoJ (C) and apoE (D) to show apoprotein distribution within each condition. Blots were quantitated by densitometry for analysis of relative immunostaining intensity between fractionated samples (C and D). ApoE levels were calculated by comparison to apoE standards purified from mouse or human plasma. Values are means ± S.E. Numbers in parenthesescorrespond to the number of samples in each group.

However, particles containing E3 and E4 contain less lipid than WT particles (Fig. 2, Aand B, Table I). This difference is not due to less apoE secreted by transgenicversus WT astrocytes as analysis of apoE levels demonstrates that E3 and E4 samples actually contained ∼2-fold moreapoE than WT samples (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the endogenous mouse apoE appears to support the production of a particle that has a greater lipid:apoE ratio than human apoE.Table ILipid composition of fractions containing HDL-like lipoproteins isolated by chromatography from mouse astrocyte conditioned mediaTCCEPLTGμg/mlWT6.4 ± 0.4aStatistically different from all genotype groups;p < 0.05.09.3 ± 1.0aStatistically different from all genotype groups;p < 0.05.0(41%)(0%)(59%)(0%)ApoE (−/−)1.1 ± 0.0601.5 ± 0.40(42%)(0%)(58%)(0%)ApoE32.6 ± 0.404.1 ± 0.40(39%)(0%)(61%)(0%)ApoE42.4 ± 0.903.9 ± 1.00(38%)(0%)(62%)(0%)Fifty ml of astrocyte conditioned media was concentrated to 1 ml and fractionated using tandem Superose 6 columns.

Open table in a new tab To directly investigate the relationship between the amount of lipid in astrocyte lipoproteins and the amount of apoE (by ELISA) within a given species, we compared ACM from mice homozygous (+/+) and hemizygous (+/−) for human E4 (Fig. 3). Lipoproteins secreted from E4 homozygotes contain more apoE (Fig.3 A) and more TC (Fig. 3 B) than those secreted from E4 hemizygotes. These data suggest that apoE synthesis is one predictor of the amount of lipid secreted by cultured astrocytes. Consistent with this hypothesis, astrocytes derived from apoE (−/−) mice produce little or no detectable lipoproteins, as assessed by phospholipid and cholesterol analysis of size exclusion chromatography fractions (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, compositional analysis of the peak fractions indicate that WT, E3, and E4 ACM contains greater amounts of HDL-associated lipid (PL and TC) than apoE (−/−) ACM (Table I). This analysis further suggests that, at the very least, a subset of astrocyte particles are discoidal in shape, as lipid analysis revealed no detectable TG or CE, the neutral lipids that make-up the core of a spherical particles (Table I). We have previously observed that the particles secreted by primary rat astrocytes in culture are discoidal, in contrast to the spherical particles found in human CSF and plasma (6LaDu M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2009219626,"Investigations into the capacity of the Bcl-2 protein to prevent apoptosis have targeted mitochondria as key sites of the preventative action accorded by Bcl-2 to cells. Using novel approaches with fluorescence probes and autofluorescence detection of endogenous NAD(P)H, we have examined the effects of expressing Bcl-2 in the Bcl-2 negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi. We evaluated for the first time the effect of Bcl-2 expression on the intracellular distribution and production of hydrogen peroxide, under basal conditions and after treatment with apoptosis inducing agents, ceramide analogs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Increased availability of mitochondrial NAD(P)H was detected in Bcl-2-expressing cells and was correlated with an increased constitutive mitochondrial production of hydrogen peroxide. Although production of hydrogen peroxide was increased by either C6-ceramide or TNF-α in Bcl-2 negative Daudi cells commensurate with the early phases of apoptosis, this increase did not occur in Bcl-2-expressing cells. Thus, Bcl-2 appears to allow cells to adapt to an increased state of oxidative stress, fortifying the cellular anti-oxidant defenses and counteracting the radical overproduction imposed by different cell death stimuli. Furthermore, we report altered cytological features of mitochondria during the early phases of apoptosis induced by C6-ceramide and TNF-α. In particular, mitochondria changed in appearance, clustering in the perinuclear region and Bcl-2 expression prevented these changes from occurring."

However, the biological importance of the ability of sPLA2-IIA to bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) on cell surfaces has remained controversial. Here we show that glypican, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored HSPG, acts as a physical and functional adaptor for sPLA2-IIA. sPLA2-IIA-dependent PGE2 generation by interleukin-1-stimulated cells was markedly attenuated by treatment of the cells with heparin, heparinase or GPI-specific phospholipase C, which solubilized the cell surface-associated sPLA2-IIA. Overexpression of glypican-1 increased the association of sPLA2-IIA with the cell membrane, and glypican-1 was coimmunoprecipitated by the antibody against sPLA2-IIA. Glypican-1 overexpression led to marked augmentation of sPLA2-IIA-mediated arachidonic acid release, PGE2 generation, and COX-2 induction in interleukin-1-stimulated cells, particularly when the sPLA2-IIA expression level was suboptimal. Immunofluorescent microscopic analyses of cytokine-stimulated cells revealed that sPLA2-IIA was present in the caveolae, a microdomain in which GPI-anchored proteins reside, and also appeared in the perinuclear area in proximity to COX-2. We therefore propose that a GPI-anchored HSPG glypican facilitates the trafficking of sPLA2-IIA into particular subcellular compartments, and arachidonic acid thus released from the compartments may link efficiently to the downstream COX-2-mediated PG biosynthesis.

However, the molecular mechanisms whereby these sPLA2s regulate AA metabolism are still poorly understood. sPLA2s-IIA and -V have high affinities for heparanoids (2Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T.

Association of sPLA2-IIA with heparan or chondroitin sulfate chains increases the hydrolytic rate of phosphatidylcholine present in lipoprotein particles modestly (30Sartipy P. Johansen B. Camejo G.

On the other hand, some reports have indicated that the actions of exogenous sPLA2-IIA on cells depend only on its interfacial interaction with substrate phospholipids rather than on its association with HSPGs (32Koduri R.S.

The cell surface HSPGs fall into two families of molecules that differ in their core protein domain structures (33David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The syndecans have core proteins with a transmembrane and a cytoplasmic domain, and they possess heparan and/or chondroitin sulfate chains near the N terminus distal to the plasma membrane (34Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Biol. 1992; 8: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The glypicans, by contrast, lack a membrane-spanning domain, are anchored to the external surface of the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), and have three heparan sulfate chains near the C terminus, which are close to the plasma membrane (35David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Consistent with a GPI-anchored moiety, glypicans are mobile in the cell membrane and exhibit both apical and basolateral distributions, whereas syndecans are distributed basolaterally to be attached to extracellular matrix proteins (36Mertens G. Van der Schueren B. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent immunohistochemical studies have revealed that significant portion of glypican translocates to the nucleus in cells undergoing cell division and activation (37Liang Y. Haring M. Roughley P.J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There is extensive literature concerning glycosaminoglycans in the nuclear compartment (38Ishihara M. Fedarko N.S. Conrad H.E. J. Biol.

These findings appear to be compatible with the observations that several extracellular heparin-binding growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and angiogenin, translocate into the nucleus via a HSPG-dependent route (41Wiedlocha A. Falnes P. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 42Sperinde G.V.

In an effort to clarify the role of sPLA2-IIA in the regulation of the PG-biosynthetic pathway, we have identified the cellular component that is functionally associated with sPLA2-IIA. We found that a GPI-anchored HSPG glypican acts as a cellular sPLA2-IIA-binding partner that contributed to enhancement of the sPLA2-IIA-mediated, cytokine-induced, delayed PG-biosynthetic response. In agreement with the emerging notion that GPI-anchored proteins reside in the microdomains called caveolae (45Smart E.J. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Establishment of 293 cell transformants that stably expressed sPLA2-IIA, cPLA2, COX-1, and COX-2 was described previously (2Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A.

Briefly, 1 μg of each cDNA subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium for 30 min and then added to cells that had attained 40–60% confluence in six-well plates (Iwaki) containing 1 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh culture medium comprising RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). After overnight culture, the medium was replaced again with 2 ml of fresh medium and culture was continued at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator flushed with 5% CO2 in humidified air. In order to establish stable transfectants, cells transfected with each cDNA were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in culture medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After culture for 3–4 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen and the expression of each protein was assessed by immunoblotting. The established clones were expanded and used for the experiments as described below. In order to establish sPLA2-IIA/glypican-1 double transformants, 293 transformants expressing sPLA2-IIA were subjected to a second transfection with glypican-1 cDNA, which had been subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) at theEcoRI site. Three days after transfection, the cells were used for the experiments or seeded into 96-well plates to be cloned by culture in the presence of 50 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) in order to establish stable transformants overexpressing both sPLA2-IIA and glypican-1. The expression of each was examined by immunoblotting, RNA blotting, and, in the case of sPLA2-IIA, by measuring the PLA2 activity of the supernatants. PLA2activity was assayed by measuring the amounts of free radiolabeled fatty acids released from the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each reaction mixture (total volume 250 μl) consisted of a 10-μl aliquot of the required sample, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm substrate. After incubation for 10–30 min at 37 °C, the [14 C]fatty acids released were extracted and the radioactivity was counted as described previously (22Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Approximately equal amounts (∼10 μg) of the total RNAs obtained from the transfected cells were applied to separate lanes of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with the respective cDNA probes that had been labeled with [32 P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random priming (Takara Shuzo). All hybridizations were carried out as described previously (22Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (105 cell eq) or culture supernatants were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 15% (w/v) gels for sPLA2-IIA and 10% gels for cPLA2, COX-1, COX-2, and glypican-1 under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were probed with the respective antibodies and visualized using the ECL Western blot system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (22Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 293 cells (5 × 104/ml) were seeded into each well of 24- or 48-well plates. To assess AA release, 0.1 μCi/ml [3 H]AA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the cells in each well on day 3, when they had nearly reached confluence, and culture was continued for another day. After three washes with fresh medium, 250 μl (24-well plate) or 100 μl (48-well plate) of RPMI 1640 with or without 1 ng/ml IL-1β and/or 10% FCS was added to each well and the amount of free [3 H]AA released into the supernatant during culture for 4 h was measured. The percentage release of AA was calculated using the formula [S/(S + P)] × 100, where S and P are the radioactivities measured in equal portions of the supernatant and cell pellet, respectively. The supernatants from replicate cells were subjected to the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay. AA release and PG generation by [3 H]AA-prelabeled cells were also assessed by thin layer chromatography. Among the radiolabeled products released, >90% were AA and the rest (<10%) corresponded to PGs. Among PGs, PGE2 was the major product, followed by modest production of PGD2 and PGF2α. Therefore it is likely that the radioactivity released into the supernatants largely reflects [3 H]AA release. Culture and cytokine stimulation of 3Y1 (14Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and BRL-3A (27Suga H. Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) cells were performed according to our previous studies with slight modifications. In brief, 3Y1 or BRL-3A cells that had attained 60–80% confluence in 12-well plates (Iwaki) were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) containing 2% FCS. After overnight culture, the cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml mouse IL-1β and 100 units/ml human TNFα for 24 h in the medium containing 10% FCS. HEK293 cells coexpressing sPLA2-IIA and glypican-1 were grown in a 150-mm diameter dish, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in 10 ml of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nakalai Tesque), 50 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1.5 μm pepstatin (Peptide Institute), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Wako), and 5 mm EDTA (cell lysis buffer). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the crude nuclear fraction was obtained by low spin centrifugation at 450 × g, as reported previously (52Oishi T. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Kudo I. Iino S. Takagi K. Yoshida S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The remaining supernatants were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were applied to a rabbit anti-sPLA2-IIA antibody-conjugated Sepharose column. After applying the samples, the column was washed with the cell lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2). In separate experiments, the column was washed with the cell lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl, followed by elution with glycine-HCl buffer. 293 cells expressing sPLA2-IIA, 3Y1 cells, and BRL-3A cells were seeded onto collagen-coated cover glasses (Iwaki Glass) at 2.5 × 104 cells/ml, cultured for 2 days, and activated with 1 ng/ml human IL-1β (for 293 cells) or with 100 units/ml human TNFα and 1 ng/ml mouse IL-1β (for 3Y1 and BRL-3A cells) for appropriate periods. In some samples, 1 mg/ml heparin was added temporally as required for the experiments. After removing the supernatants, the cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the cells were treated sequ"

However, cells that lack mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells) retain apparently normal apoptotic signaling. In the present study, we examined mitochondrial mechanisms of apoptosis in ρ0 osteosarcoma cells treated with staurosporine. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ρ0 cells maintained a normal cytochrome c distribution in mitochondria even though these cells were deficient in respiration. Upon staurosporine treatment, cytochrome c was released concomitantly with activation of caspase 3 and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). After mitochondrial loss of cytochrome c, ρ0 cells underwent little change in glutathione (GSH) redox potential whereas a dramatic oxidation in GSH/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) pool occurred in parental ρ+ cells. These results show that mitochondrial signaling of apoptosis via cytochrome c release was preserved in cells lacking mtDNA. However, intracellular oxidation that normally accompanies apoptosis was lost, indicating that the mitochondrial respiratory chain provides the major source of redox signaling in apoptosis.

(6Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that cell-free apoptosis inXenopus egg extract required an organelle fraction enriched in mitochondria. Meanwhile, other researchers found that cells induced to undergo apoptosis show a fall in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) (7Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). The Δψm disruption occurs before exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer cell membrane leaflet and before cells exhibit nuclear DNA fragmentation. Functional experiments indicate that the mechanism of the Δψm loss during apoptosis involves the opening of a large conductance channel known as permeability transition (PT) pore (8Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Masse B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 9Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Susin S.A. Masse B. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4830-4836PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria undergoing PT liberate an apoptogenic protein, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), which is capable of inducing nuclear apoptosis (10Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Marquez J. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). AIF has recently been cloned and characterized (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3433) Google Scholar); it is a protein that is translated with a mitochondrial targeting sequence that is cleaved upon import into mitochondria. The cleavage exposes a nuclear targeting sequence that allows the protein to target to the nucleus and induces nuclear changes upon release from the mitochondria. This mechanism has been suggested to be independent of a caspase-mediated pathway for apoptosis. A direct activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis was found to involve cytochrome c, an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (12Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). In many systems, release of cytochromec from mitochondria to cytosol has been demonstrated to be a crucial step in the activation of apoptosis (13Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4394) Google Scholar, 14Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Once released from mitochondria, cytochrome c, in interaction with apoptotic protease activity factor-1 and caspase 9, initiates the cleavage and activation of caspase 3 (17Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Active caspase 3 in turn activates other execution caspases and leads to the subsequent characteristic features of apoptosis, including cleavage of fodrin and lamin, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation (18Li P. Nijihawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6197) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and other related anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. Bcl-XL, can prevent cytochrome c release and inhibit caspase activation and apoptosis (13Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4394) Google Scholar, 14Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism(s) by which cytochrome c is released from mitochondria remain unknown, some observations suggest that the cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis is probably distinct from that mediated by AIF (2 and 16). The role of mitochondria in apoptosis may be not restricted to releasing apoptogenic proteins. There is accumulating evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may serve as signaling molecules in apoptosis. First, in some systems, addition of oxidants or depletion of endogenous antioxidants can promote apoptosis, while antioxidants can delay or inhibit apoptosis (20Ratan R.R. Murphy T.H. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 21Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 303-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Second, increases in intracellular ROS are often associated with apoptosis (23Uckun F.M. Tuelahlgren L. Song C.W. Waddick K. Myers D.E. Kirihara J. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9005-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 24Quillet-Mary A. Jaffrezou J.-P. Mansat V. Bordier C. Naval J. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Finally, Bcl-2 has been found to have an antioxidant effect (25Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3287) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are believed to be a major site of ROS production. Indeed, it has been found that both ROS accumulation and apoptosis require the presence of a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain in most ROS-dependent cell death systems (26Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. Yeh E.T.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which ROS induces apoptosis are not clear. A direct activation of some crucial components of apoptosis machinery by ROS or modification of the cellular redox potential by ROS, which would then regulate some key regulatory proteins, are suggested (2Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that disruption of mitochondrial electron transport and energy metabolism is involved in apoptosis. A disruption of the electron transport chain at the cytochromeb-c 1/cytochrome c step was found to occur in cells and in isolated mitochondria treated with ceramide (27Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In Fas-mediated apoptosis, an inhibition of electron transport was observed before nuclear changes of apoptosis, and results indicated that inactivation of cytochrome c at least in part contributes to the loss of mitochondrial function in this system (28Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-2 can both prevent and reverse cytochromec inactivation (29Adachi S. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21878-21882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data indicate that mitochondria play an important role in apoptosis by releasing AIF and cytochrome c, by generating ROS, and by disrupting electron transport. These pathways may represent alternative and independent pathways or they may function together to provide an efficient and fail-safe cell death program. In the latter case, cells lacking mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may still undergo apoptosis if one or some of these pathways are still maintained. In the present study, we report that pathways involving release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and disruption of Δψm are preserved in ρ0 osteosarcoma cells during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. However, the mitochondria-derived ROS pathway that causes oxidation in cellular thiol pool is largely attenuated, indicating that the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and loss of Δψm are not due to the oxidation of the cellular thiols as reflected in the GSH pool. Thus, the mitochondrial redox signaling in apoptosis is a downstream effect not essential for caspase activation but probably functioning in late-stage events such as caspase inactivation or marking proteins and membrane-bound fragments for degradation. The ρ0 cell line was derived from an osteosarcoma cell line 143BTK (ATCC CRL 8303) by growing cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, high glucose (4.5 mg/ml), 1 mm pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, and 50 ng/ml ethidium bromide for 13 weeks (30Trounce I. Neill S. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8334-8338Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Clones were screened for mtDNA content by Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction and a cell line (143B-87) containing no mtDNA was selected and grown for several weeks in the medium without ethidium bromide (30Trounce I. Neill S. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8334-8338Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). When oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark oxygen electrode, a rapid oxygen uptake was readily apparent in ρ+ cells but undetectable in ρ0 cells. Auxotrophy for uridine and pyruvate in ρ0 cells was demonstrated by the lack of growth in the absence of these nutrients (30Trounce I. Neill S. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8334-8338Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To eliminate the variance that could result from different culture conditions between ρ0 and ρ+, an identical medium was used to culture two cell lines in the present study, although the latter does not require uridine and pyruvate for growth. Anti-cytochrome c antibody was a gift from Dr. Ronald Jemmerson (University of Minnesota). Anti-heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) antibody (N-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Co. (Santa Cruz, CA). MitoTracker Red CMXRos, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) reference standard, and JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). TACSTM Annexin-V-FITC was obtained from Trevegen, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit-fluorescein for the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Jackson Laboratory Inc. (West Grove, PA). Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) was obtained from Peptide International (Louisville, KY). Cells were stained with Annexin-V-FITC following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells (2 × 105) were treated with staurosporine in a 6-well plate. After 17 h, both floating and adherent (released by trypsin) cells were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml Annexin-V-FITC. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, 400 μl of binding buffer was added and samples were processed by flow cytometry. Data acquisition and analysis were performed in a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). TUNEL was performed using the in situ cell death detection kit following the standard protocol provided by manufacturer. Briefly, after treatment with 1 μm staurosporine, both floating and adherent cells were collected and washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. To label DNA strand breaks, cells were incubated with 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and fluorescein-dUTP in the binding buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells grown on chambered coverglass (Lab-Tek 136439) were treated with 1 μm staurosporine. After 6 h, cells still remaining on the coverglass were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Following a further fixation and permeabilization in ice-cold 100% methanol for 5 min, cells were gently washed three times, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with a blocking buffer (2% horse serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with anti-cytochromec antibody (diluted 1:50 in PBS) or anti-HSP60 antibody (diluted 1:60 in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature. Excess antibody was removed by washing cells 3 times with PBS. The secondary antibody, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, diluted 1:60 in PBS, was added and the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To double-label nuclei, cells were further stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. To double-label mitochondria, cells were first incubated with 10 μmMitoTracker Red for 30 min in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator and then immunostained for cytochrome c or HSP60 as described above. The coverslips were analyzed using a Bio-Rad 1024 laser scanning confocal microscopy. A digitonin-permeabilization technique was used (31Bai C. Slife C.W. Aw T.Y. Jones D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to release cytosol from untreated or staurosporine-treated cells. Briefly, cells were washed once with PBS and then resuspended in a solution containing 70 mm Tris and 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.0. As a control for Fig. 3, 10 mm Tris and 300 mmsucrose, pH 7.0, was also used. Digitonin was added to provide a condition that resulted in 95% cells staining with 0.2% trypan blue (approximately 0.05 mg/ml final concentration). The cells were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected as cytosol. The amount of protein in the cytosol was measured by the Bradford method, and 50 μg of protein was loaded onto each lane of a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were blotted to 0.45 μm Hybond-polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 5% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then stained with anti-cytochrome c (diluted 1:1600 in PBS containing 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After being washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with 1:3000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature. The specific protein was then identified using NENTM Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent. Caspase activity that cleaves DEVD-AMC was measured by a method modified from Nicholsonet al. (32Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells adherent to the culture plate after staurosporine treatment were washed once with PBS and collected in 50 μl of PBS and frozen on a microtiter plate. Fifty microliters of reaction buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, 10% dithiothreitol, 10−6% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% CHAPS at pH 7.25 were added to each well along with 50 μm DEVD-AMC. Substrate cleavage to release free AMC (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) was monitored at 37 °C. Fluorescence was converted to picomoles of AMC using a standard curve generated with free AMC. To measure Δψ, cells were incubated with 1.25 μg/ml JC-1 for 30 min in culture medium at 37 °C (33Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The cells were washed once with PBS and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. GSH and GSSG were measured as theS-carboxymethyl-N-dansyl-derivatives by high performance liquid chromatography (34Jones D.P. Maellaro E. Jiang S. Slater A.F.G. Orrenius S. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 45: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with ice-cold 5% perchloric acid containing 0.2 m boric acid and 5 μm γ-glutamylglutamate (internal standard). Following centrifugation to remove protein, 300 μl is treated with 60 μl of iodoacetic acid (7.4 mg/ml) and adjusted to pH 9.0 ± 0.2 with 1 m KOH in saturated solution of potassium tetraborate. After 20 min, 300 μl of a dansylchloride solution (20 mg/ml in acetone) was added, and extracts were incubated in the dark at room temperature overnight. Unreacted dansyl chloride was extracted with 500 μl of chloroform and aliquots of the aqueous phase were separated by high performance liquid chromatography using a propylamine column (Custom LC, Houston).S-Carboxymethyl-N-dansyl-GSH andN,N′-bis-dansyl-GSSG derivatives were eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient formed from an initial 80% solvent A (80% methanol in water) to 100% solvent B (64% methanol, 4 msodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6) over 60 min. Dansyl derivatives were detected by fluorescence with 305–395 nm band-pass filter for excitation and a 520-nm cut off filter for emission. Peaks are quantified by integration relative to standards. For calculation of redox potential, intracellular volume was measured based upon3 H2O uptake with [14 C]polyethylene glycol used for correction for extracellular volume. Redox potential (E h) was calculated from the cellular GSH and GSSG concentrations using the Nernst equation and E 0 = −0.258 V at pH 7.3. ρ0 cells lacking functional mitochondria were treated with various concentrations of staurosporine for 17 h. Staining with Annexin-V revealed a dose-dependent exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of these cells (Fig.1). A time course study with 1 μm staurosporine showed that DNA cleavage could be detected as early as 1 h by TUNEL (Fig.2). On agarose gels, the cleaved DNA had a ladder-like appearance typical of apoptosis (data not shown). Confocal microscopy of cells stained with propidium iodide illustrated a well dispersed chromatin structure in untreated cells (Fig.3 A). In contrast, cells treated with staurosporine showed chromatin that was condensed and fragmented. Therefore, despite complete loss of mtDNA and deficiency in respiratory function, these ρ0 cells maintained normal apoptotic machinery that could be activated by staurosporine.Figure 2DNA cleavage in cells lacking mtDNA .Cells were untreated or treated with 1 μm staurosporine for various times (h), kinetics of DNA cleavage was determined by TUNEL. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry and percentages of cells with DNA cleavage were indicated.

In cells containing respiring mitochondria, it can be released into the cytosol during the early phase of apoptosis (12Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Like most mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c is encoded by nuclear DNA and then translocated into the mitochondria. To determine whether cytochrome c is translocated into and retained within mitochondria in respiration-deficient cells, we immunostained ρ0 cells with an antibody that specifically recognizes cytochrome c. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, a superimposed punctuate perinuclear component was stained. Double staining with a mitochondria-selective vital dye MitoTracker Red revealed that mitochondria of ρ0 cells were also distributed in a punctuate perinuclear pattern and the punctuate fraction of cytochrome c colocalized with mitochondria (overlapping red and green pixels seen as yellow). When viewed with confocal microscopy, mitochondrial appearance and cytochromec distribution in ρ0 cells were indistinguishable from those in parental ρ+ cells (data not shown). To determine whether cytochrome c in mitochondria of ρ0 cells is released during apoptosis, we examined cells stained with anti-cytochrome c antibody and then double-stained nuclei with propidium iodide. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, untreated cells showed the mitochondrial pattern of cytochrome c staining with diffuse nuclear staining by propidium iodide. However, in staurosporine-treated cells that have apoptotic morphology (condensed and fragmented nuclei), cytochromec staining was diffuse with no mitochondrial staining pattern visible. The release of cytochrome c was further confirmed with Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts prepared under a condition (70 mm Tris, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7) that keeps mitochondria intact. As shown in Fig. 3 C, cytosol from untreated cells contained little cytochrome c. In contrast, cytosol from staurosporine-treated cells had a significant amount of cytochrome c as early as 1 h and a marked increase in cytochrome c level was seen in cytosol from cells treated for 6 h, a time point when numerous apoptotic nuclei were also observed (see Fig. 3 A). Control experiments to verify that cytochrome c release was not due to the high ionic strength were performed with 10 mm Tris, 300 mm sucrose, pH 7. Comparable results were obtained for staurosporine treatment but there was somewhat more cytochromec release in the untreated cells (results not shown). The release of cytochrome cin ρ0 cells could result from overall damage to mitochondrial structure in apoptotic cells or it could be a specific event that causes little changes in mitochondria except outer membrane disruption as seen in other cell types. We distinguished these two possibilities by examining whether the mitochondrial matrix protein, HSP60, was also released during apoptosis. Staining the cells with an anti-HSP60 antibody revealed a similar pattern obtained with anti-cytochrome c antibody, i.e. a superimposed punctuate perinuclear staining that is colocalized with mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). In apoptotic ρ0 cells, a change in the staining pattern of heat shock protein due to the shrinkage of cytosol was observed (Fig.4 B). However, the diminished and diffused immunostaining pattern like that of cytochrome c was not seen. Therefore, matrix heat"

Complexes of fluorescence-labeled parathyroid hormone (PTH)-(1–34) agonist bound to the hPTH1-Rc internalized rapidly at 37 °C via clathrin-coated vesicles, whereas fluorescent PTH-(7–34) antagonist-hPTH1Rc complexes did not. A functional C terminus epitope-tagged receptor (C-Tag-hPTH1-Rc) was immunolocalized to the cell membrane and, to a lesser extent, the cytoplasm. PTH and PTH-related protein agonists stimulated C-Tag-hPTH1-Rc internalization. Relocalization to the cell membrane occurred 1 h after removal of the ligand. Endocytosis of fluorescent PTH agonist-hPTH1-Rc complexes was blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine but not by the specific protein kinase A inhibitorN-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide. Fluorescent PTH antagonist-hPTH1-Rc complexes were rapidly internalized after PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or thrombin, but not after stimulation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway by forskolin. In cells co-expressing the hPTH1-Rc and a green fluorescent protein-β-arrestin2 fusion protein (β-Arr2-GFP), PTH agonists stimulated β-Arr2-GFP mobilization to the cell membrane. Subsequently, fluorescent PTH-(1–34)-hPTH1Rc complexes and β-Arr2-GFP co-localized intracellularly. In conclusion, agonist-activated hPTH1-Rc internalization involves β-arrestin mobilization and targeting to clathrin-coated vesicles. Our results also indicate that receptor occupancy, rather than receptor-mediated signaling, is necessary, although not sufficient, for endocytosis of the hPTH1-Rc. Activation of PKC, however, is absolutely required. Endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of the human parathyroid hormone receptor subtype 1 (hPTH1-Rc) and its ligands was monitored independently by real-time fluorescence microscopy in stably transfected HEK-293 cells. Complexes of fluorescence-labeled parathyroid hormone (PTH)-(1–34) agonist bound to the hPTH1-Rc internalized rapidly at 37 °C via clathrin-coated vesicles, whereas fluorescent PTH-(7–34) antagonist-hPTH1Rc complexes did not. A functional C terminus epitope-tagged receptor (C-Tag-hPTH1-Rc) was immunolocalized to the cell membrane and, to a lesser extent, the cytoplasm. PTH and PTH-related protein agonists stimulated C-Tag-hPTH1-Rc internalization. Relocalization to the cell membrane occurred 1 h after removal of the ligand. Endocytosis of fluorescent PTH agonist-hPTH1-Rc complexes was blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine but not by the specific protein kinase A inhibitorN-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide. Fluorescent PTH antagonist-hPTH1-Rc complexes were rapidly internalized after PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or thrombin, but not after stimulation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway by forskolin. In cells co-expressing the hPTH1-Rc and a green fluorescent protein-β-arrestin2 fusion protein (β-Arr2-GFP), PTH agonists stimulated β-Arr2-GFP mobilization to the cell membrane. Subsequently, fluorescent PTH-(1–34)-hPTH1Rc complexes and β-Arr2-GFP co-localized intracellularly. In conclusion, agonist-activated hPTH1-Rc internalization involves β-arrestin mobilization and targeting to clathrin-coated vesicles. Our results also indicate that receptor occupancy, rather than receptor-mediated signaling, is necessary, although not sufficient, for endocytosis of the hPTH1-Rc.

The responsiveness of GPCRs to extracellular stimuli, and particularly to their natural ligands, is regulated by several mechanisms, including receptor phosphorylation, coupling and uncoupling from G proteins, receptor internalization (endocytosis), and regulation of receptor gene transcription (1Chuang T.T. Iacovelli L. Sallese M. De Blasi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 416-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Semin. Cell Dev.

In particular, a model for agonist-activated GPCR endocytosis, which involves mobilization of β-arrestins followed by agonist-receptor complex internalization through clathrin-coated pits, has been well characterized for the β2-adrenergic receptor (4Von Zastrow M. Koblika B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

For example, although the angiotensin receptor AT1 is rapidly internalized in response to agonist stimulation, the homologous AT2 receptor is not (10Hein L. Meinel L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Koblika B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although the μ-opioid receptor agonist etorphin promotes β-arrestin mobilization and receptor internalization, morphin does not (11Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to the widely observed requirement for receptor occupancy to enable endocytosis, heterologous protein kinase C (PKC) activation triggers internalization of the α1b-adrenoreceptor even in the absence of ligand (12Awaji T. Hirasawa A. Kataoka M. Shinoura H. Nakayama Y. Sugawara T. Izumi S. Tsujimoto G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1099-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Also, whereas endocytosis of many agonist-occupied GPCR involves clathrin-coated vesicles (1Chuang T.T. Iacovelli L. Sallese M. De Blasi A. Trends Pharmacol.

The natural ligands of this GPCR subfamily, which includes receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP), glucagon, calcitonin, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and others, are medium-sized polypeptides. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying ligand-receptor bimolecular recognition and interactions within the GPCR Class II subfamily is advancing rapidly (16Bisello A. Adams A.E. Mierke D.F.

Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding the relationship among receptor occupancy, signaling, and endocytosis. These issues are particularly interesting in light of recent models that propose multiple conformational states for GPCRs (21Kenakin T.P. Trends Pharmacol.

PTH is the major regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and plays a central role in bone metabolism (24Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar).

Previous studies have provided indirect evidence suggesting that PTH1-Rc internalization occurs upon agonist stimulation, possibly via clathrin-coated vesicles (31Silve C.M. Hradek G.T. Jones A.L. Arnaud C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Huang Z. Chen Y. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 151-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recovery of receptor function following blunted response to PTH stimulation has been attributed to receptor recycling to the cell surface (33Teitelbaum A.P. Silve C.M. Nyiredy K.O. Arnaud C.D. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More recently, both positive and negative endocytic signals have been identified as originating in the cytoplasmic tail of the opossum PTH1-Rc, transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (32Huang Z. Chen Y. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 151-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that structural changes in the receptor might contribute to the internalization process. However, neither receptor phosphorylation nor protein kinase activation seemed to play a role in agonist-induced internalization of the opossum PTH1-Rc when expressed in a human cell background (30Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Huang Z. Bambino T. Chen Y. Lameh J. Nissenson R.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1294-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relationship among ligand-receptor interactions, receptor activation, signaling, and endocytosis in the PTH system remains to be elucidated. Real-time monitoring of biomolecules by fluorescence microscopy is a powerful methodology for the study of internalization and trafficking of both hormones and receptors in living cells. In the present study, we designed and synthesized fluorescence-labeled PTH agonists and antagonists, as well as an epitope-tagged human PTH1-Rc, in order to examine independently the trafficking of both receptor and ligand and to determine directly the relationships between receptor occupancy, activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways, and endocytosis of ligand-hPTH1-Rc complexes. Furthermore, by using a GFP-β-arrestin2 fusion protein (β-Arr2-GFP) (7Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

We have investigated the endocytic and selective uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-CE by SR-BI using COS-7 cells transiently transfected with mouse SR-BI. Analysis of lipoprotein uptake data showed a concentration-dependent LDL-CE-selective uptake when doubly labeled LDL particles were incubated with SR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells. In contrast to vector-transfected cells, SR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells showed marked increases in LDL cell association and CE uptake by the selective uptake pathway, but only a modest increase in CE uptake by the endocytic pathway. SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake exceeded LDL endocytic uptake by 50–100-fold. SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake was not inhibited by the proteoglycan synthesis inhibitor,p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside or by the sulfation inhibitor sodium chlorate, indicating that SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE uptake occurs independently of LDL interaction with cell-surface proteoglycan. Analyses with subclones of Y1 adrenocortical cells showed that LDL-CE-selective uptake was proportional to the level of SR-BI expression. Furthermore, antibody directed to the extracellular domain of SR-BI blocked LDL-CE-selective uptake in adrenocortical cells. Thus, in cells that normally express SR-BI and in transfected COS-7 cells SR-BI mediates the efficient uptake of LDL-CE via the selective uptake mechanism. These results suggest that SR-BI may influence the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins in vivo by mediating LDL-CE uptake into SR-BI-expressing cells.

In humans, SR-BI (also referred to as Cla-1 (4Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) shows a similar tissue distribution (8Cao G.

Direct evidence for SR-BI function is provided by studies in which antibody to the extracellular domain of mouse (m) SR-BI blocked HDL-CE-selective uptake and the delivery of HDL cholesterol to the steroidogenic pathway in cultured murine adrenocortical cells (10Temel R.E.

In addition, inactivation of the SR-BI gene in mice increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels and reduced neutral lipid stores in the adrenal glands (11Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice carrying an induced SR-BI mutation that reduced hepatic SR-BI expression levels by 50% showed a similar reduction in hepatic HDL-CE-selective uptake (12Varban M.L. Rinninger F.

These studies with reduced SR-BI expression are complemented by studies in which hepatic SR-BI is overexpressed by either an adenovirus vector (13Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) or via a transgene (14Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In these studies HDL cholesterol and apoAI levels were greatly decreased by SR-BI overexpression. Taken together, these observations indicate that SR-BI plays a key role in mediating HDL-CE-selective uptake in the liver and in steroidogenic cells and in determining the plasma levels of HDL cholesterol in mice. Although it is clear that SR-BI binds native LDL (2Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and VLDL (3Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the role of SR-BI in the metabolism of apoB-containing particles is poorly understood. The cellular metabolism of LDL particles occurs primarily via the LDL receptor and other members of the LDL receptor family (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, the sizes of the LDL/intermediate density lipoprotein particles in the transgenic mice are reduced, a result consistent with the selective removal of LDL core CE by hepatic SR-BI (18Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in one study with transgenic mice, aortic root lesions were reduced by 80% in heterozygous LDL receptor-deficient mice overexpressing hepatic SR-BI when fed a high fat-, cholesterol-, and bile salt-containing diet (19Arai T. Wang N. Bezouevski M. Welch C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2366-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, mice deficient in both SR-BI and apoE show accelerated atherosclerotic lesion development in the aortic root region and an increased accumulation of VLDL-sized particles (20Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These data indicate that hepatic SR-BI can influence, directly or indirectly, the metabolism of apoB-containing particles and the development of arterial lesions. The in vivo studies noted above raise important questions about the role of SR-BI in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. First, are the observed effects indirect via changes in HDL metabolism or direct via processing of LDL particles by SR-BI? Second, if SR-BI can process LDL particles, does it do so by the selective uptake pathway or does SR-BI mediate LDL-CE uptake by endocytic mechanisms? Third, how does the efficiency of SR-BI-mediated CE uptake compare for LDL and HDL particles? The aim of this study was to determine directly whether mSR-BI processes LDL particles by the selective and endocytic uptake pathways. The results showed that mSR-BI mediates the efficient uptake of LDL-CE via the selective uptake mechanism in cells that normally express mSR-BI and in transfected COS-7 cells. These findings suggest that mSR-BI may influence the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins in vivo by mediating LDL-CE uptake into SR-BI-expressing cells. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (complete medium). At day 0, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 in a 10-cm dish in 10 ml of fresh media and incubated until approximately 80–90% confluence (∼24 h). On day 1 transfections were performed with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as directed by the manufacturer using pSG5 vector (Stratagene) and SR-BI-expressing pSG5 vector, pSG5(mSR-BI) (21Connelly M.A. Klein S.M.

On day 2, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in a total volume of 6 ml with fresh media, and plated 1 ml to each well of a 6-well plate. On day 3, COS-7 cells were incubated with doubly labeled LDL or HDL particles for the indicated times after which cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with 1.5 ml 0.1 n NaOH, and the lysate was processed to determine trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble 125I radioactivity and organic solvent-extractable 3H radioactivity as described (22Azhar S.

Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 125I radioactivity represents cell-associated apolipoprotein which is the sum of cell surface-bound apolipoprotein and endocytosed apolipoprotein which is not yet degraded. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I radioactivity represents endocytosed and degraded apolipoprotein that is trapped in lysosomes due to the dilactitol tyramine label. The sum of the125I-degraded and 125I cell-associated undegraded apolipoprotein expressed as CE equivalents was subtracted from the CE measured as extractable 3H radioactivity to get the selective uptake of LDL-CE and HDL-CE (22Azhar S.

Anti-SR-BI was detected by incubation with125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (NEN Life Science Products, 106 dpm/ml) and quantified with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Each subclone was analyzed at least twice in triplicate. Each gel also contained triplicate samples from the Y1-BS1 cell line. SR-BI levels in the subclones are expressed as a percentage of the SR-BI content of the Y1-BS1 line. Human (h) HDL3 (1.125 g/ml < ρ < 1.210 g/ml) and human LDL (1.019 g/ml < ρ < 1.063 g/ml) were doubly labeled with 125I-dilactitol tyramine and [3H]cholesteryl oleolyl ether as described (24Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the 125I,3H-hHDL ranged from 46 to 70 dpm/ng protein for 125I and from 6 to 28 dpm/ng protein for 3H. The specific activity of the125I,3H-hLDL ranged from 25 to 75 dpm/ng protein for 125I and from 3 to 30 dpm/ng protein for3H. For 125I-βVLDL rabbit βVLDL was prepared as described (26Kowal R.C.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except all protease inhibitors were omitted. βVLDL was iodinated with Na125I using the modified ICl method (27Goldstein J. Basu S.K. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Specific activities were 600–1000 dpm/ng protein. To inhibit proteoglycan synthesis, control or transfected COS-7 were preincubated with 2 mm p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (β-d-xyloside) for 20 h in complete medium prior to lipoprotein uptake assays. To inhibit sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, COS-7 cells were preincubated for 20 h in complete medium containing 30 mm NaClO3 prior to the addition of lipoprotein particles. In order to determine whether mSR-BI mediates the selective uptake of LDL-CE, COS-7 cells transfected with vector or with vector expressing mSR-BI were incubated for 4 h with 125I,3H-hLDL after which LDL cell association, LDL-CE-selective uptake, and LDL-CE endocytic uptake (Fig. 1) were measured. As shown in Fig.1 A, mSR-BI-expressing cells showed a concentration-dependent increase in the cell association of LDL that was approximately 2.5-fold greater than vector-transfected cells. mSR-BI-dependent cell association of LDL showed a high affinity component with an apparent K d of 14 μg/ml LDL protein, which is similar to that reported for the 4 °C binding of LDL to hamster SR-BI (K d = 5 μg/ml) (2Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of LDL-CE-selective uptake showed a similar 2.5-fold increase in mSR-BI-expressing cells in comparison to vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). LDL-CE-selective uptake showed both low and high efficiency components. The high efficiency component showed an apparent K m of 9.6 μg/ml. Within the concentration range of LDL examined, the low efficiency component showed a linear increase in LDL-CE-selective uptake as a function of LDL concentration (Fig. 1 B) with a slope that was considerably greater than that seen in vector-transfected cells. Thus, the low efficiency component of LDL-CE-selective uptake, as well as the high efficiency component, is dependent on mSR-BI expression. SR-BI expression also increased the endocytic uptake of LDL-CE (Fig. 1 C), but the increase was significantly less than that seen for LDL-CE-selective uptake. Importantly, the amount of SR-BI-dependent LDL-CE-selective uptake exceeded LDL endocytic uptake by approximately 50-fold in this experiment and by as much as 100-fold in other experiments (data not shown). These data indicate that SR-BI-mediated cell-surface binding of LDL leads to efficient CE uptake by the selective uptake pathway but only a marginal increase by endocytic uptake. To examine the relationship between SR-BI-dependent binding and LDL-CE-selective uptake, competition experiments were performed by preincubating transfected COS-7 cells with increasing concentrations of unlabeled LDL prior to addition of labeled LDL. Fig.2 A shows that unlabeled LDL competed effectively at low concentrations (<50 μg/ml) for the cell association of 125I-LDL to both vector-transfected and SR-BI-expressing cells. However, the mSR-BI-dependent component of the LDL cell association showed a more sluggish or gradual competition than occurs with the vector-transfected cells. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 B which shows the mSR-BI-dependent component (mSR-BI values minus the vector values at each LDL concentration) in comparison to vector-transfected cells. The competition curve for the mSR-BI-dependent LDL cell association is indicative of a mixture of low and high affinity components and showed only 70% competition at the highest concentration of competitor tested (300 μg/ml = 30-fold excess compared with radiolabeled LDL). This pattern is even more pronounced for the selective uptake of LDL-CE (Fig. 2 C). In this case, the mSR-BI-dependent component of LDL-[3H]CE-selective uptake was competed gradually over a broad LDL concentration range reaching a maximum of 45% competition at 300 μg/ml unlabeled LDL (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the shallow competition curve for mSR-BI-dependent LDL-[3H]CE-selective uptake is indicative of a mixture of affinities with a major fraction being of relatively low affinity. Note in contrast that the LDL-[3H]CE-selective uptake by vector-transfected cells was competed by 80% at 60 μg/ml unlabeled LDL, indicating a process of higher affinity than seen for the mSR-BI-dependent component (Fig. 2 D, vector). Thus, the LDL-CE-selective uptake in vector-transfected cells is distinct from that mediated by SR-BI. Note also that we have been unable to detect SR-BI expression in control or vector-transfected COS-7 cells confirming that the basal level of LDL-CE-selective uptake is not due to SR-BI. Similar experiments were carried out to test HDL as a competitor for mSR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake. Fig.3 shows that HDL competed modestly for LDL cell association in vector-transfected or mSR-BI-expressing cells (Fig. 3 A). HDL competed for LDL-CE-selective uptake in SR-BI-expressing cells over a wide concentration range but showed no competition for LDL-CE-selective uptake in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B). The mSR-BI-dependent component of LDL-[3H]CE-selective uptake was competed by HDL to a maximum of 65% competition at 300 μg/ml unlabeled HDL. Comparison of LDL and HDL as competitors for the mSR-BI-dependent component of LDL-CE-selective uptake (Fig.4) showed that both lipoproteins competed gradually over a broad concentration range and were similarly effective on a protein basis.Figure 4Comparison of hLDL and hHDL3 for inhibition of mSR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake. Competition of the mSR-BI-dependent component of LDL-CE-selective uptake by hLDL and hHDL3 are shown for comparison. Data for competition by hLDL are from Fig. 2 D. Data for competition by hHDL3 are from Fig. 3 B. These values show competition for the mSR-BI-dependent component and were obtained by subtracting the values obtained with vector-transfected cells from the values obtained with mSR-BI-expressing cells at each concentration of hHDL3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction of apoB-containing lipoproteins with cell-surface proteoglycans is believed to play a major role in concentrating LDL within the space of Disse in the liver (28Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in facilitating endocytic uptake of remnant particles by the hepatocyte low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (29Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in direct proteoglycan-mediated LDL endocytosis (30Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible significance of cell-surface proteoglycans for selective uptake of LDL-CE, two approaches were taken. In the first, cells were pretreated with 30 mm NaClO3 for 20 h to inhibit sulfation of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans prior to measurement of LDL-CE-selective uptake. As shown in Fig. 5 A, NaClO3treatment reduced LDL-CE-selective uptake by 50% in vector-transfected cells but only by 20% in mSR-BI-expressing cells. After correction for the absolute level of inhibition in the vector-transfected cells, the SR-BI-dependent component of LDL-CE-selective uptake was inhibited by only 15%. In the second approach, COS-7 cells were pretreated with 2 mm p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside for 20 h to inhibit the addition of glycosaminoglycan side chains during proteoglycan biosynthesis.p-Nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside is a potent inhibitor of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression but has little effect on heparan sulfate proteoglycans (31Kolset S.O. Sakurai K. Ivhed I. Overvatn A. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 B,p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside failed to inhibit LDL-CE-selective uptake in vector-transfected or mSR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells. To ensure that these inhibitors had effectively reduced cell-surface proteoglycans, untransfected COS-7 cells were pretreated with inhibitors as above and then incubated at 4 °C with rabbit 125I-βVLDL since previous studies showed that the cell-surface binding of βVLDL is mediated by proteoglycans (29Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results showed that the binding of125I-βVLDL was reduced by 41 and 55% by NaClO3 andp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside, respectively, indicating that the inhibitors were effective in reducing proteoglycan biosynthesis (data not shown). We conclude that mSR-BI-mediated selective uptake of LDL-CE occurs independently of cell-surface proteoglycan. To explore the physiological significance of the SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake as seen in transfected COS-7 cells, we examined the Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cell, which naturally expresses mSR-BI and in which mSR-BI has been shown to mediate HDL-CE-selective uptake (10Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Fig. 6shows the cell association (Fig. 6 A), selective uptake (Fig.6 B), and endocytic uptake (Fig. 6 C) of LDL-CE in Y1-BS1 cells as a function of LDL concentration using double-labeled125I,3H-hLDL particles. As was seen with the transfected COS-7 cells, these parameters show LDL concentration dependences indicative of both high and low affinity (or efficiency) components. The high affinity component for cell association showed an apparent K d = 6.3 μg/ml, and the high efficiency component for selective uptake showed an apparent K m= 3.2 μg/ml, values similar to those seen with the transfected COS-7 cells. Within the LDL concentration range examined, the low affinity components for cell association (Fig. 6 A), selective uptake (Fig. 6 B), and endocytic uptake (Fig. 6 C) behaved in a linear fashion. In order to test the relationship between mSR-BI expression levels and LDL-CE-selective uptake in Y1 cells, subclones of the parent Y1 cell line were isolated by limited dilution cloning. Measurements of mSR-BI levels and LDL-CE-selective uptake activity were made for 7 subclones and for the Y1-BS1 line. Fig.7 A shows the LDL-CE-selective uptake activities for these clones plotted versus the mSR-BI levels, which were expressed relative to that in the Y1-BS1 set as 100%. Correlation analysis shows a strong relationship (r 2 = 0.82, p = 0.002) between the LDL-CE-selective uptake activity and the expression level of mSR-BI. These data suggest that the level of LDL-CE-selective uptake is largely determined by the level of mSR-BI expression in adrenocortical cells. A similar degree of correlation (r 2 = 0.86, p = 0.001) was seen between mSR-BI levels and the HDL-CE-selective uptake activities among the Y1 subclones (Fig.7 B). As a further test of the role of mSR-BI in LDL-CE-selective uptake in Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells, we used antibody raised against the extracellular domain of mSR-BI to block LDL-CE-selective uptake. This antibody has been shown previously to block the selective uptake of HDL-CE in Y1-BS1 cells (10Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In comparison to control IgG, anti-mSR-BI inhibited the cell association of LDL by 40% at either of two LDL concentrations (Fig. 8 A). Anti-mSR-BI inhibited LDL-CE-selective uptake by 30% at 6 μg/ml LDL and by 75% at 3 μg/ml LDL (Fig. 8 B). Thus, at an LDL concentration near the apparent high efficiency K mfor LDL-CE-selective uptake, the major fraction of LDL-CE-selective uptake in Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells was inhibited by anti-mSR-BI antibody. In order to compare the efficiency of CE-selective uptake from LDL and HDL particles, the selective uptake data of Fig. 6 were expressed on the basis of the amount of cell-associated CE for LDL or HDL. Thus, this analysis shows the amount of CE uptake as a function of the steady state level of cell-associated lipoprotein during the uptake assay. Since the selective uptake and cell association measurements were done in replicate, the values for each individual measurement are shown plotted in Fig. 9. These data show that for a given amount of cell-associated lipoprotein CE, HDL delivers a much greater percent of its lipoprotein core as compared with LDL. Similar calculations were made in a variety of experiments with the Y1 BS-1 line with similar results. When these data were pooled with those shown in Fig. 9, the average delivery of HDL-CE was 7.4 ± 1.8 (S.D.)-fold greater than that of LDL-CE for an equivalent amount of cell-associated lipoprotein CE. Thus, the fractional delivery of HDL-CE was markedly greater than that of LDL-CE. When viewed on a molar basis, 2In comparing the delivery of CE from HDL and LDL on a molar basis, we assume that the molecular weight of an LDL particle is 2.35 × 106 and that of an HDL3 is 1.55 × 105. An LDL particle having 42% CE by mass contains 985 kDa of CE or 1513 molecules of CE using a molecular weight of 651 for an average CE. An HDL3particle having 15% CE by mass contains 22.5 kDa of CE or 35 molecules of CE. however, an LDL particle contains 43 times as many CE molecules per particle compared with an HDL3 particle. Consequently, for an equivalent steady state number of lipoprotein particles bound to the cell surface, an LDL particle delivered 6.2 times as many CE molecules compared with an HDL particle. Similar values were obtained when LDL-CE and HDL-CE uptake were compared in SR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells. In this case the fractional uptake of HDL-CE was 6.1-fold greater than the uptake of LDL-CE (data not shown). Although SR-BI has been characterized as an HDL receptor (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar, 10Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), its ability to bind LDL particles suggested that it might also play a role in LDL metabolism. Several studies with transgenic animals have demonstrated that SR-BI can influence plasma LDL-CE and apoB levelsin vivo (14Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2366-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), although it was not clear whether this occurred directly or was secondary to altered HDL metabolism. In the present study we have tested the ability of mSR-BI to mediate the selective and endocytic uptake of LDL-CE. The results show that in transfected COS-7 cells mSR-BI efficiently mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake with only a minimal increase in LDL endocytic uptake. SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake exceeded LDL endocytic uptake by 50–100-fold. In addition, the demonstration that mSR-BI mediates LDL-CE-selective uptake in Y1 adrenocortical cells shows that this activity of mSR-BI occurs in a physiological setting and is not the result of overexpressing this receptor in a transfected cell. These results suggest that at least some of changes in LDL metabolism observed in SR-BI transgenic animals may result from the ability of this receptor to mediate selective CE uptake from LDL particles. SR-BI-mediated changes in HDL metabolism might also indirectly alter the metabolism of apoB-containing particles in vivo.Interestingly, the SR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells showed very little SR-BI-dependent endocytosis of LDL, suggesting that the increased clearance of plasma apoB in SR-BI transgenic mice (18Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) may be an indirect result of SR-BI expression. Our results, which show directly that mSR-BI mediates LDL-CE-selective uptake, are in agreement with a recent report showing that mSR-BI expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells stimulates the esterification of cholesterol in response to LDL (32Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a result consistent with mSR-BI mediating the uptake of either free cholesterol or cholesteryl ester, or both, from LDL particles. In the context of the transfected COS-7 cell, cell-surface proteoglycans do not appear to have a significant role in SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake. The physiological significance of SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE metabolism in humans remains to be determined. LDL clearance in humans is primarily determined by the LDL receptor pathway that accounts for 67–80% of plasma LDL removal as judged by measurements of radioiodinated LDL clearance in normal individuals and patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (33Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1215-1250Google Scholar). It is possible that SR-BI contributes to the fraction of LDL not removed by the LDL receptor pathway or removes some CE from particles in the VLDL-LDL cascade. Further studies will be required to test these possibilities. Once bound to mSR-BI, lipoprotein CE is transferred to the cell in a process that appears to occur with different efficiencies for HDL and LDL. In either Y1 cells or mSR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells, the fractional transfer of lipoprotein CE was approximately 6–7-fold greater for HDL than LDL (Fig. 9). Whether this reflects differences in how LDL and HDL particles interact with mSR-BI or is due to inherent differences in the transfer of CE from the particles is not known. Interestingly, because the CE core of the LDL particle is so much larger than that of an HDL3, the absolute uptake of CE from the LDL particle is about 6-fold greater than from an HDL.2Thus, in terms of the absolute delivery of CE molecules, mSR-BI-mediated selective uptake of LDL-CE has the potential to provide for substantial cholesterol delivery to SR-BI-expressing cells. In previous work Reaven and colleagues (22Azhar S. Tsai L. Reaven E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1047: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that LDL was used efficiently by the selective uptake pathway of rat ovarian granulosa cells to support steroid production in vivo (34Reaven E. Chen Y.-D.I. Spicher M. Hwang S.-F. Mondon C.E. Azhar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1971-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in cell culture. Since these cells have now been shown to express high levels of SR-BI (6Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 35Azhar S. Nomoto A. Leers-Sucheta S. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1616-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the ovarian uptake of LDL-CE is largely due to SR-BI. The present data show that in addition to SR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake, COS-7 cells show an SR-BI-independent pathway for LDL-CE-selective uptake. The experiments in Figs. 1 B,2 B, and 3 B show that vector-transfected cells exhibit LDL-CE-selective uptake at levels of 10–40% that seen in mSR-BI-expressing cells. We have been unable to detect SR-BI expression by COS-7 cells indicating that this level of LDL-CE-selective uptake is unlikely due to low levels of endogenous SR-BI in untransfected cells. Furthermore, the lipoprotein competition data showed that the LDL-CE-selective uptake in vector-transfected COS-7 cells could be competed by LDL (Fig. 2, C and D) but not by HDL (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the mSR-BI-dependent component of LDL-CE-selective uptake was competed equally well by LDL and HDL (Fig. 4). Thus, the LDL-CE-selective uptake seen in untransfected COS-7 cells is not due to SR-BI. The physiological significance of this SR-BI-independent pathway for LDL-CE-selective uptake is unknown at present. An interesting feature of mSR-BI-mediated LDL-CE-selective uptake is that the LDL concentration dependence shows two components, one indicative of a high efficiency (or affinity) process and the other of a low efficiency process. This was seen in both mSR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 B) and in Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells (Fig.6 B). Consistent with the interpretation of multiple mSR-BI-dependent components, competition of LDL-[3H]CE-selective uptake by unlabeled LDL occurred gradually over a broad LDL concentration range reaching a maximum of only 45% competition at 300 μg/ml unlabeled LDL (Fig.2 D). One interpretation of these data is that mSR-BI occurs in two forms that exhibit high and low efficiencies of LDL-CE-selective uptake, possibly depending on the state of receptor multimerization or on its localization to different domains of the plasma membrane. An alternative interpretation is that mSR-BI expression alters the lipid domain organization of the plasma membrane in such a way as to promote low affinity LDL-cell membrane interactions that, while requiring mSR-BI expression, do not reflect direct mSR-BI-LDL binding and, thus, are not effectively competed by unlabeled LDL. Support for the idea that SR-BI expression alters membrane lipid organization is provided by recent studies showing that SR-BI expression in COS-7 cells increased the fraction of membrane-free cholesterol that was sensitive to oxidation by extracellular cholesterol oxidase (36de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weiber G. Sakar S.W. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 575-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mSR-BI expression markedly enhanced the efflux of membrane-free cholesterol to cyclodextrins, extracellular acceptors that do not bind to mSR-BI (37Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weiber G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although speculative, one possibility is that these changes reflect an altered plasma membrane domain with an increased capacity for free cholesterol flux and possibly for low affinity LDL interactions that lead to LDL-CE-selective uptake. We cannot distinguish these possibilities with the available evidence, but additional studies will serve to test these hypotheses. We thank Ronald DeMattos for providing the rabbit β-VLDL."

Tse A. Tse F.W. Bosma M.M. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 75-95PubMed Google Scholar). GnRH also mediates an influx of calcium through VGCCs in the gonadotrope plasma membrane. This influx of calcium appears to be independent of the IP3-mediated calcium event in that the two events can be blocked independently (2McArdle C.A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,3Iida T. Stojilkovic S.S. Izumi S. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, a long term interdependence of these two calcium pools has been described in that calcium influx is ultimately necessary for maintaining IP3-releasable stores (1Hille B. Tse A. Tse F.W. Bosma M.M. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 75-95PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of GnRH to mobilize discrete calcium pools has interesting implications for modulation of signal transduction pathways. Calcium is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in regulating signal transduction in many cell types (4Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). In some systems, cytoplasmic rises in intracellular calcium are pivotal for regulation of gene expression (5Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 6Deisseroth K. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). These studies have indicated that the spatial localization of intracellular calcium fluctuations is critical for determining how particular regulatory elements within genes will be influenced (7Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A recent review discussed the fundamental importance of elementary or local calcium signals versus global calcium oscillations or waves as signals for control of specific cell functions in nonendocrine cells such as myocytes and neurons (8Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R157-R159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have found that αT3-1 cells, a gonadotrope-derived cell line endogenously expressing GnRH-R, provide a unique and invaluable model system for investigating how signaling pathways may be regulated by discrete localized fluctuations in cell calcium. Stimulation of αT3-1 cells with the GnRH-R agonist buserelin results in activation of three members of the MAPK family (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), transcriptional activation of the gene for the common α-subunit of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (16Hamernik D.L. Nett T.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and activation of the transcription factor Elk 1 (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that activation of a MAPK family member, ERK, is absolutely required for buserelin-induced transcription of the α-subunit and the GnRH receptor gene (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17White B.R. Duval D.L. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Clay C.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 566-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following exposure of αT3-1 cells to GnRH, a biphasic calcium response consisting of an initial IP3-dependent spike phase followed by a sustained extracellular calcium-requiring plateau phase is observed (2McArdle C.A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The two discrete GnRH-induced calcium signals are subject to differential isolation or modulation by various pharmacological tools. An earlier study demonstrated that in the absence of extracellular calcium, GnRH-stimulated MAPK activity was significantly reduced, while globally increasing intracellular calcium with a calcium ionophore had little or no effect on stimulation of MAPKs in the absence of GnRH (11Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These results led the authors to conclude that calcium is necessary but not sufficient for stimulation of MAPK activity in αT3-1 cells. In a separate study, Cesnjaj et al. (15Cesnjaj M. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) reported that increased intracellular calcium appears to be sufficient to induce increased mRNA for the MAPK substrates c-Fos and c-Jun, while removal of extracellular calcium significantly enhanced GnRH-induced increases in message for these IEGs in αT3-1 cells. This would suggest that there may be differential effects of localized calcium on mRNA for specific GnRH-regulated target genes. Further, a recent study suggested that specific fluctuations in cell calcium may be important in the regulation of α-subunit gene transcription (18Holstock J.G. Aylwin S.J. Burrin J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1308-1317PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which calcium may influence GnRH-stimulated α-subunit production was not resolved. While these studies have provided intriguing information about the importance of calcium at various points in the GnRH signaling pathway, the nature of the specific roles of spatial and temporal calcium signals in regulation of GnRH-stimulated MAPK activity, IEG induction, and α-subunit gene transcription remains unclear. Clearly, a careful examination of the requirement for discrete calcium pools in the signaling pathways linking the GnRH receptor to increased MAPK activity and subsequent induction of c-Fos and c-Jun protein amounts is warranted to enhance our understanding of the role of calcium in GnRH-R-linked signaling pathways leading to regulation of gene expression. We have developed a multidisciplinary approach that enables us to investigate the potential interactions between calcium influx through VGCCs or IP3-released calcium and GnRH-stimulated MAP kinase signaling pathways and immediate early gene induction. We find that a differential sensitivity to calcium exists for GnRH induction of the MAP kinases ERK and JNK and the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun. The results of studies presented here indicate that a specific signal involving calcium influx through L-type VGCCs is required for GnRH-induced activation of ERK and subsequent c-Fos induction, while fluctuations in IP3-released calcium do not appear to be involved. In addition, we report that specific activation of L-type VGCCs with Bay-K 8644 is sufficient stimulus for activation of the ERK pathway. However, increasing cytoplasmic calcium with elevated potassium or thapsigargin does not induce ERK phosphorylation. By combining pharmacological and fluorescence techniques, we are able to characterize the type of calcium signal required for activation of ERK. Further, our data suggest that the effect of calcium is located downstream of PKC and upstream of Raf kinase in the signaling pathway linking the GnRH receptor to ERK activation. αT3-1 cells, an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line of the gonadotrope lineage, were cultured in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence prior to lysis. For kinase assays and immunoblot studies, cells were serum-starved for 2 h before receiving hormone. Some experiments were carried out using modified physiological saline solutions. The standard solution used contained 127 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. For some experiments, barium or magnesium ions were substituted for calcium. For potassium depolarization experiments, the potassium concentration was increased to 35 mm, while the sodium concentration was decreased proportionally to maintain the osmolarity of the solution. The ionic concentrations of calcium chloride (1.8 mm) and potassium chloride (5 mm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium are the same as those present in the standard physiological saline solution. The GnRH agonist buserelin ([d-SER(tBU)6,Pro9-ethylamide]GnRH) was applied to the cells at 10 nm for various lengths of time. Drugs (nifedipine, Bay-K 8644, PD98059, PMA, H-89, staurosporine, GF 109203X, thapsigargin, Rp-cAMPS) were prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO, acetone, or ethanol and applied to the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were never exposed to >0.1% Me2SO, acetone, or ethanol, and these concentrations of vehicle had no effect on responses of αT3-1 cells. Pituitary cells for primary cultures were taken from the anterior pituitary of 6–8-week-old male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation in accordance with Cornell University Animal Care guidelines. Pituitaries were placed in filter-sterilized dissociation media consisting of 137 mmNaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm KCl, 2 mmglucose, pH 7.3. The pituitaries were sliced into small fragments and digested with collagenase type II (1 mg/ml) and hyaluronidase type V (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 degrees. Following digestion, cells were triturated, collected, and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. This procedure was repeated three times, and cells were collected following each trituration. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes and maintained in culture for 48 h prior to treatment with hormone. For immunoprecipitations and Western blotting, cells were treated with drugs for specified time periods and then washed with ice-cold buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were collected and cleared by centrifugation. For Western blotting, proteins were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinyldiene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. Polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and phosphospecific (New England BioLabs) antibodies to ERKs were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immunostained proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminesence reagents (NEN Life Science Products). c-Fos and c-Jun antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The c-Fos antibody is specific to p62 c-Fos and, according to the manufacturer, is not cross-reactive with other Fos family members. Polyvinyldiene difluoride membranes were stripped by soaking for 30 min at 55 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. JNK was immunoprecipitated by adding JNK-1 antibody (0.5 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 25 μl of protein G- and A-agarose beads to clarified cell lysates. Samples were gently rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer; twice in 1 ml of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and once in 0.5 ml of kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 20 μmATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained the agarose beads suspended in kinase buffer, [γ-32P]ATP, and substrate GST-ATF2 (for JNK assay) or GST-Elk 1 (for ERK assay). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with frequent mixing. Cells used for Raf immunoprecipitations were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate for approximately 3 h at 4 C. Raf was immunoprecipitated from clarified lysates by adding 2 μg of Raf-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of protein G- and A-agarose beads and rocking at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed twice in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, three times in 1 ml of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 wash buffer, and once in 0.5 ml of Raf kinase buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 7 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15 μm ATP. Samples were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with frequent mixing. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained the agarose beads suspended in Raf kinase buffer, [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of myelin basic protein. Following JNK, ERK, or Raf kinase assays, the reactions were stopped with the addition of SDS loading buffer, and then samples were boiled for 2 min, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. All of the experiments presented were conducted at least three times with equivalent results. The expression vector for Gal4 DNA binding domain-Elk 1 transactivation domain and the luciferase reporter containing five Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream of the E1B TATA box and luciferase coding sequences have been previously described (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids used in transfection studies were prepared by centrifugation through cesium chloride using standard methods. Prior to all studies, cells were split to fresh media and cultured to approximately 60–70% confluence. All transient transfection studies were conducted as described previously (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for transient transfection studies, cells were transfected by electroporation using a single electrical pulse at 220 V and 950 microfarads. Some transfected cells either received the specific MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (50 μm), or the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (1 μm), approximately 8 h following electroporation. Inhibitors were added again approximately 16 h following electroporation. Cells were collected by scraping 6 h following the final administration of inhibitors and lysed by three freeze thaw cycles, and luciferase activity was determined as described (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). αT3-1 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in the standard physiological saline solution (see above) at a density of 106 cells/ml. Cells were loaded with 2 μmindo-1/AM (purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After loading, cells were washed and used within 2 h. 3-ml aliquots of cell suspension were placed in acrylic cuvettes and maintained at 37 °C with constant stirring. For some experiments, an initial volume of 2.2 ml of cells/cuvette was used, and a base-line fluorescence signal was established prior to the addition of 800 μl of control solution or an isotonic potassium chloride solution. For cuvettes receiving the potassium chloride solution, the final potassium concentration was 35 mm. Indo-1/AM fluorescence at 405 nm was monitored for measurement of free ionized calcium with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Indo-1/AM was excited at 355 nm. All of the experiments presented were conducted at least three times with equivalent results. Stimulation of αT3-1 cells with the GnRH agonist buserelin results in IP3-mediated mobilization of intracellular calcium as well as calcium entry through L-type and T-type VGCCs in the plasma membrane (1Hille B. Tse A. Tse F.W. Bosma M.M. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 75-95PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, αT3-1 cells exhibit a biphasic calcium response following buserelin application. Imaging experiments have demonstrated that the calcium response consists of an extracellular calcium-independent IP3-mediated spike followed by a sustained plateau phase that is dependent upon extracellular calcium (2McArdle C.A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An examination of the effects of buserelin on cytosolic calcium in the absence or presence of nifedipine confirms that the plateau phase is abolished in the nifedipine-treated cells while the spike phase remains (Fig. 1 A). These initial studies verified the efficacy of nifedipine and enabled us to be confident in our subsequent pharmacological approach. Experiments were performed to examine the role of calcium influx through VGCCs in buserelin-stimulated activation of two members of the MAPK family, ERK and JNK. αT3-1 cells pretreated with control vehicle (0.1% acetone) or the specific L-type calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine (1 μm), were exposed to buserelin for 15 or 30 min (Fig. 1 B). Cell lysates were examined by Western blotting for the absence or presence of the dual phosphorylated (activated) form of ERK. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with antibody for total ERK protein to confirm equivalent sample loading. JNK activity was measured by kinase assay using the same cell lysates. Buserelin caused a time-dependent increase in ERK activation and JNK activity in control cells. Cells that had been pretreated with nifedipine exhibited buserelin-induced JNK activity similar to that observed in control cells; however, the ability of buserelin to induce ERK was greatly reduced. The inability of buserelin to activate ERK in the nifedipine-treated cells suggests that calcium entry through L-type channels plays a role in the signaling pathway coupling the GnRH receptor to ERK. These results were repeated with fidelity in rat pituitary cells dispersed in primary culture (Fig.1 C), suggesting that the use of the αT3-1 model is appropriate for studies examining the effect of different calcium signals on MAPK pathways. Since gonadotropes represent only 5% of the cells in the anterior pituitary, use of αT3-1 cells was critical for implementation of a comprehensive biochemical and biophysical characterization of the role of select calcium pools on GnRH signaling pathways. It has been reported that stimulation of αT3-1 cells with GnRH results in increased mRNA for the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun (14Roberson M.S. Zhang T. Li H.L. Mulvaney J.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine for effects of VGCC calcium on downstream targets of GnRH-induced MAPKs, αT3-1 lysates were examined for amounts of c-Fos and c-Jun protein following 1 or 2 h of hormone stimulation in the absence or presence of nifedipine. Buserelin-induced increases in c-Fos protein were reduced in the nifedipine-treated cells, while c-Jun protein amounts and phosphorylation, as measured by retarded electrophoretic mobility shift, were similar in control and nifedipine-treated cells (Fig.1 D). The ability of nifedipine to block buserelin-stimulated ERK activation suggests that calcium influx through VGCCs is a necessary component of this signaling pathway. To further confirm a role for extracellular calcium, αT3-1 cells were placed in a calcium-free extracellular solution in which the calcium ions had been replaced by magnesium or barium ions to maintain isosmotic conditions immediately prior to stimulation with hormone. The ability of buserelin to activate ERK was completely abolished in the solutions that had magnesium or barium substituted for calcium (Fig.2 A). It has been shown previously that αT3-1 cells have both L-type and T-type VGCCs (1Hille B. Tse A. Tse F.W. Bosma M.M. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 75-95PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm a specific role of L-type channels, a series of experiments was completed to examine the effects of non-L-type calcium influx by administration of nickel, a specific blocker of T-type calcium channels (19Tsien R.W. Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Bley K.R. Fox A.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 431-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Buserelin activation of ERK in cells that had been treated with nickel was similar to ERK activation observed in control cells (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that buserelin-induced ERK activation specifically required calcium entry through L-type channels. To examine the requirement for calcium influx through VGCCs in the signaling pathway coupling the GnRH receptor to ERK activation in more detail, αT3-1 cells were stimulated with the L-type VGCC agonist, Bay-K 8644. Initial studies examining indo-1/AM fluorescence indicated that a prolonged increase in cytoplasmic calcium is observed following treatment of αT3-1 cells with Bay-K 8644 (Fig.3 A). Cells exposed to Bay-K 8644 exhibited an increase in ERK activation similar to that seen when cells were treated for the same time periods with buserelin (Fig.3 B). Bay-K 8644 did not induce activation of JNK. When αT3-1 lysates were examined for increases in c-Fos and c-Jun protein amounts, it was observed that Bay-K 8644 treatment resulted in an induction of c-Fos protein similar to that seen in buserelin-treated cells, while there was no apparent influence on c-Jun protein amounts or activation state (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that calcium influx through L-type VGCCs is a sufficient stimulus for activation of ERK and subsequent c-Fos induction. This calcium signal was not an appropriate stimulus for activation of JNK or induction and activation of c-Jun protein. Removal of extracellular calcium or blockade of L-type channels precludes ERK activation by buserelin, while stimulation of L-type calcium channels with Bay-K 8644 is a sufficient signal for stimulation of the ERK pathway. If calcium influx through the plasma membrane serves to generally increase cytoplasmic levels of calcium such that the ERK cascade is activated or facilitated, it is expected that alternative methods of stimulating an increase in cytoplasmic calcium would be sufficient to activate ERK. Membrane depolarization with elevated KCl has been shown to increase cytosolic calcium by activating VGCCs in αT3-1 cells and has been shown to be a sufficient stimulus for ERK activation and Fos induction in other cell types (2McArdle C.A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,20Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 75-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). To examine whether depolarization of αT3-1 cells increased intracellular calcium, indo-1/AM-loaded cells were treated with either an isotonic elevated potassium solution or control solution. Cells treated with elevated potassium were exposed to a final potassium concentration of 35 mm. After an initial decrease in the base-line fluorescence that was the result of a dilution artifact, cells exposed to 35 mm potassium exhibited a sustained increase in fluorescence that was terminated upon the addition of nifedipine (Fig. 4 A). This prolonged signal is thought to be due to calcium entry through VGCCs activated by membrane depolarization. In a similar series of experiments where cells received the same volume of control solution, there was a drop in base-line fluorescence and no observed increase in calcium signal (Fig. 4 B). Cells receiving control solution responded to Bay-K 8644 with a prolonged increase in fluorescence (Fig.4 B). When cells in 35 mm potassium were treated with nifedipine and then buserelin, a transient increase in fluorescence was observed (Fig. 4 C). This is probably due to a buserelin-induced release of calcium from internal stores. Voltage-stimulated activation of VGCCs by depolarization of αT3-1 cells with 35 mm KCl produced a very minimal ERK activation (Fig. 4 D). These data indicate that a sustained influx of calcium through depolarization-activated VGCCs is not a sufficient signal for ERK activation. Further, despite similarities in the apparent magnitude and duration, the calcium signal resulting from VGCCs that are opened solely by membrane depolarization differs in some way from that resulting from channel activation with buserelin or Bay-K 8644 in regard to the necessary stimulus for activation of the ERK cascade.

https://openalex.org/W2018054062,"The epithelial isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE3, associates with at least two related regulatory factors called NHERF1/EBP50 and NHERF2/TKA-1/E3KARP. These factors in addition interact with the cytoskeletal protein ezrin, which in turn binds to actin. The possible linkage of NHE3 with the cytoskeleton prompted us to test the effect of actin-modifying agents on NHE3 activity. Cytochalasins B and D and latrunculin B, which interfere with actin polymerization, induced a profound inhibition of NHE3 activity. The effect was isoform-specific inasmuch as the “housekeeping” exchanger NHE1 was virtually unaffected. Cytoskeletal disorganization was associated with a subcellular redistribution of NHE3, which accumulated at sites where actin aggregated, suggesting a physical interaction of exchangers with the cytoskeleton. An interaction was further suggested by the co-sedimentation of a detergent-insoluble fraction of NHE3 with the actin cytoskeleton. Inhibition of transport was not due to diminution in the number of transporters at the plasmalemma. Functional analyses of NHE1/NHE3 chimeras revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3 conferred sensitivity to cytochalasin B. Progressive carboxyl-terminal and internal deletions of the cytoplasmic region of NHE3 indicated that the region between residues 650 and 684 is critical for this response. This region overlaps with the domain reported to interact with NHERF and also contains a putative ezrin-binding site; hence, it likely plays a role in interactions with the cytoskeleton.

The NHE family consists of six known isoforms, all of which are integral membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains and a large cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Some of these, including NHE1 and NHE6, are ubiquitous and are thought to fulfill housekeeping functions such as the regulation of cytosolic pH (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

By contrast, other isoforms are expressed selectively in defined cell types and are therefore believed to perform more specialized functions. These include NHE3, which is confined to the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells of the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and gallbladder. This isoform plays a central role in the (re)absorption of Na+ and HCO3− across the epithelial layer and is therefore subjected to exquisite regulation. NHE3 activity is modulated by changes in blood pressure and osmolarity and is responsive to hormones that elevate intracellular second messengers, such as cAMP and diacylglycerol (3Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchanger 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein hemagglutinin NHE regulatory factor phosphate-buffered saline cytosolic pH protein kinase A and C, respectively Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of NHE3 activity. Electron microscopy and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy observations (4Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

This distribution can be recapitulated when NHE3 is heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It has therefore been postulated that, as in the case of other regulated transporters, modulation of the rate of transport could be accomplished by altering the distribution of NHE3 between endomembranes and the surface membrane (6Zhang Y. Mircheff A.K. Hensley C.B. Magyar C.E. Warnock D.G. Chambrey R. Yip K.P. Marsh D.J. Holstein Rathlou N.H. McDough A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1004-F1014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, inhibition of exocytosis by wortmannin was found to be associated with a drastic decrease in NHE3 activity at the plasmalemma (7Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Regulation of NHE3 can also be exerted by stimulation of protein kinases, most notably protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), which induce a significant inhibition of the exchanger (8Kandasamy R.A., Yu, F.H.

Regarding the mechanism of action of PKA, there is evidence that direct phosphorylation of the exchanger is involved (8Kandasamy R.A., Yu, F.H. Harris R. Boucher A. Hanrahan J.W. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

However, other studies have also invoked the participation of ancillary proteins that are seemingly required for the PKA-mediated inhibition of NHE3 (13Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These proteins, called NHERF1/EBP50 and NHERF2/TKA-1/E3KARP, bind directly to the exchanger (15Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and are postulated to be substrates of PKA (16Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), although evidence for the latter is controversial. Interestingly, NHERF1/EBP50 was shown independently to bind ezrin, a cytoskeletal protein that is abundant at the apical membrane of epithelia (18Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Ezrin itself is capable of binding filamentous actin, serving as a bridge between membrane-associated proteins and the cytoskeleton. These observations raise the possibility that the activity of NHE3 may be controlled in some manner by its state of association with the actin cytoskeleton. The purpose of the present experiments was to assess whether the state of actin polymerization and/or its association with the membrane affects the rate of transport mediated by NHE3. To study the function of NHE3 in isolation, i.e. uncontaminated by other isoforms that can co-exist in native epithelial systems (19Noel J. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 929-939PubMed Google Scholar), we utilized antiport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells that were heterologously transfected with NHE3. This paradigm also enabled us to analyze and relate the structure and function of NHE3 by transfection of chimeric or truncated mutants of the exchanger. Our results indicate that NHE3 can associate with the cytoskeleton and that its exchange activity is profoundly affected by disruption of the F-actin network. Cytochalasins B and D, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, iodoacetamide, ando-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Fast OPD) were purchased from Sigma. Nigericin, the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), Oregon green phalloidin, and jasplakinolide were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).

All other chemicals were purchased from BDH Inc. (St. Laurent, Quebec). A Chinese hamster ovary cell line (AP-1 cells) that was functionally selected for its lack of endogenous NHE activity following chemical mutagenesis (20Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected with plasmids containing the wild type NHE1 and NHE3 and mutant NHE3 cDNA constructs. Two full-length NHE3 constructs used in this study were tagged with an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope YPYDVPDYAS as described previously (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K.

Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first construct contains a single HA epitope appended to the extreme cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of NHE3 and is termed NHE3′-HA. The second construct contains a triple HA epitope inserted into the first extracellular loop of NHE3 between amino acids Arg38 and Phe39 and is named NHE3′-38HA3. The functional properties of both full-length HA-tagged NHE3 constructs were indistinguishable from untagged NHE3 (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P.

To analyze the structural basis of the actions of actin-modifying agents on NHE3 activity, a series of NHE1 and NHE3 chimeras and NHE3 deletion mutants were used. Two chimeras have previously been described. One was constructed from the transmembrane domain (residues 1–504) of NHE1 and the cytosolic tail (residues 456–831) of NHE3 and is designated NHE1/3, whereas the second, reciprocal chimera, named NHE3/1, has the transmembrane domain of NHE3 (residues 1–455) and the cytosolic tail of NHE1 (residues 505–820) (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The third chimera, called NHE3/1/3, is composed mainly of NHE3, but amino acids 650–716 in the cytoplasmic tail were removed and substituted with the corresponding residues (666–749) of NHE1 by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The NHE3 deletion mutants were created by progressively truncating the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal tail at positions 684 (NHE3Δ684) and 638 (NHE3Δ638) as described previously (21Cabado A.G., Yu, F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, an internal deletion of residues 650–716 of NHE3 was engineered and named NHE3Δ650–716. All chimeras and deletion mutants were sequenced in the carboxyl-terminal region to ensure the fidelity of the constructions. All NHE cDNA constructs were transfected into AP-1 cells by the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation technique of Chen and Okayama (22Chen C.A. Okayama H. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and stable clones were selected by the H+ suicide method of Pouysségur et al. (23Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Clonal populations were maintained by routine H+ suicide challenge. NHE activity was assessed as the rate of Na+-induced recovery of cytosolic pH (pHi) following an acid load imposed by preloading with NH4Cl, as described previously (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on coverslips were loaded with 2 μg/ml acetoxymethyl ester precursor of BCECF at 37 °C for 10 min, washed, and placed in Leiden CoverSlip holders. The cytosol was acidified by incubating the cells with an isotonic solution containing 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min, followed by rapid washing with an isotonic Na+-free solution. The cells were then bathed with isotonic Na+-rich medium to induce Na+-dependent recovery of pHi. The fluorescence of BCECF was measured and calibrated as described (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cytoskeleton-associated NHE3′-HA was extracted from transfected AP-1 cells cultured in 6-well plates (35 mm) according to the method of Goldman and Abramson (24Goldman J.E. Abramson B. Brain Res. 1990; 528: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 15 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 175,000 × g at 4 °C for 75 min. The resulting pellets were solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Blots were blocked with 0.2% gelatin and exposed to the primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HA antibody; 1:10,000 dilution). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was applied (1:5000), and immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). AP-1 cells stably expressing NHE3′-HA were plated onto glass coverslips and grown to ≈70% confluence. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were washed 3–4 times with PBS and incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min. The coverslips were washed again and, where indicated, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 5% donkey serum in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with mouse anti-HA antibody (1:1000) dilution for 1 h. After this period, the coverslips were washed 4–5 times with PBS and then incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h. The coverslips were washed 3–5 times over 15 min with PBS and mounted onto glass slides with DAKO fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA). To quantify the amount of surface NHE3, we developed a modified enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (7Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). AP-1 cells stably expressing the externally tagged NHE3′-38HA3 were plated onto 12-well plates and grown to ∼70% confluence. Next, they were incubated with the anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis. After washing the cells 6 times with PBS/α-minimal essential medium (9:1 v/v) to remove excess unbound antibody, they were fixed for 10 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were washed 3–4 times with PBS and incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min. Cells were next blocked with 5% donkey serum in PBS for 20 min and then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:1000) for 1 h. The cells were washed 6 times with PBS and then incubated with 1 ml of Fast OPD reagent for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 250 μl of 3 mHCl. The supernatant was collected, and absorbance was measured at 492 nm (A 492) using a U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). In the range studied,A 492 varied linearly with the amount of peroxidase bound. Cytochalasins are fungal metabolites that induce gradual depolymerization of actin filaments by binding to their fast-growing barbed ends (25MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). They are membrane-permeant and can therefore be used to induce filament disruption in intact cells. We initially used cytochalasin B to investigate the relationship between NHE3 and the actin cytoskeleton. AP-1 cells stably expressing rat NHE3′-HA were incubated with or without 10 μm cytochalasin B for 30 min. Na+/H+ exchange activity was subsequently assessed fluorimetrically as the rate of Na+-induced H+ (equivalent) extrusion. As reported earlier (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), untreated cells expressing NHE3′-HA recovered rapidly from an acid load upon addition of Na+ (Fig.1 A). Pretreatment with cytochalasin B induced a profound inhibition of NHE3′-HA activity (Fig.1 A). Cells expressing the externally tagged NHE3′-38HA3 construct showed a similar inhibition of activity after pretreatment with cytochalasin B (data not shown), implying that epitope tagging of the carboxyl terminus was not responsible for imparting cytochalasin sensitivity to NHE3. In addition to its cytoskeletal effects, cytochalasin B is an effective inhibitor of glucose uptake. Because NHE activity is sensitive to the intracellular concentration of ATP (26Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was conceivable that the observed inhibition of exchange was secondary to metabolic depletion of the cells. To evaluate this possibility we used cytochalasin D, which is a similarly effective cytoskeletal-disrupting agent as cytochalasin B yet has no effect on glucose transport. Pretreatment with 10 μm cytochalasin D produced an inhibition of NHE3 that was indistinguishable from that induced by the B analog (not illustrated), ruling out indirect effects of metabolic depletion. Moreover, direct measurements of cellular ATP content using luciferase revealed that cytochalasin B did not effect depletion; under the conditions used in Fig. 1, the ATP content in cytochalasin-treated cells was 103 ± 6.8% of control (mean ± S.E. of 3 determinations). The effect of cytochalasin B was NHE isoform-specific. Unlike NHE3, the pHi recovery induced by addition of Na+ to acid-loaded NHE1-HA cells was essentially unaffected by pretreatment with cytochalasin B (Fig. 1 B). As both NHE1 and NHE3 are sensitive to intracellular ATP (26Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this observation confirms that the effect of cytochalasin B on the latter is not the result of metabolic depletion. It is unlikely that cytochalasin inhibits transport by directly binding to NHE3. This tentative conclusion is supported by the finding that inhibition required several minutes to develop. As shown in Fig.2 A, maximal inhibition by 10 μm cytochalasin B was attained only after 10 min. The time course of inhibition parallels the effect of cytochalasin on F-actin. As illustrated in Fig.3 F, cells treated for 10 min underwent a massive disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. The well defined stress fibers and actin accumulations near focal adhesions seen in control cells were no longer apparent after cytochalasin treatment. Instead, small punctate and large amorphous accumulations of F-actin were present throughout the cells.Figure 3Effect of actin disruption on the subcellular distribution of NHE3. NHE3′-HA cells were either untreated (A and E) or treated with either 10 μm cytochalasin B (Cyt-B; panels Band D) or 10 μm latrunculin B (Lat-B) for 30 min (C and G) or with 1 μm jasplakinolide (JAS; panels Dand H) for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were then briefly washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking, they were stained with primary mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody to visualize NHE3′-HA (A–D) and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin to detect F-actin (E–H). Images are representative of at least three experiments of each type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that disruption of the actin microfilament network was indeed responsible for the inhibition of NHE3, we examined the effects of latrunculin B. This compound is chemically unrelated to the cytochalasins and acts by forming complexes with monomeric actin, thus reducing the pool available for polymerization (27Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 G, treatment with latrunculin B altered the morphology of the cells and produced a drastic disruption of the actin network. Actin appeared concentrated near the cell borders. The effects of latrunculin B on F-actin were paralleled by inhibition of NHE3 (Fig. 2 B), which resembled that produced by cytochalasins. These observations support the notion that optimal NHE3 activity requires the integrity of the cellular F-actin network. Because decreasing F-actin inhibited NHE3, we wondered whether the opposite effect would be observed by increasing the F-actin content of the cells. This was accomplished using jasplakinolide, a cell-permeable monocyclic peptide, which binds and stabilizes F-actin (28Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of jasplakinolide to F-actin was indicated by the marked overall decrease in staining by phalloidin (Fig. 3 H), which binds to the same site on F-actin as jasplakinolide (28Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2We attempted to visualize actin by immunostaining. However, jasplakinolide was found to also mask the epitopes recognized by the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to actin that we tested. We were therefore unable to visualize actin in jasplakinolide-treated cells. Elevated F-actin content in jasplakinolide-treated cells was also suggested by the increase in the fraction of Triton-insoluble actin in cells treated with the cyclic peptide (see Fig. 5 and discussion below). As shown in Fig. 2 B, jasplakinolide partially inhibited the activity of NHE3. This finding implies that NHE3 activity is not a simple function of the cellular F-actin content and suggests that an intact F-actin network is required for optimal NHE3 function. The preceding data suggest that NHE3 may interact physically with the actin cytoskeleton. If this were the case, redistribution of the exchangers might be expected upon disruption of the actin filament network. To analyze this possibility, we compared the distribution of NHE3 before and after treatment with agents that influence actin polymerization. To visualize NHE3, cells transfected with epitope-tagged antiporters (NHE3′-HA) were used. Typical results are illustrated in Fig. 3. As described earlier (5D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) only a fraction of the cellular NHE3 resides at the plasma membrane; a sizable fraction is distributed in a punctate pattern that corresponds to sorting and recycling endosomes. NHE3 redistributes upon addition of cytochalasin B or latrunculin B, accumulating at or near the edges of the cell (Fig.3, B and C). The sites of accumulation coincide with areas of actin aggregation (see the arrows in Fig. 3,B, C, F, and G), suggesting an interaction between NHE3 and the cytoskeleton. Jasplakinolide also altered the distribution of NHE3, but it was difficult to discern whether this was caused primarily by the shape change induced by the actin stabilizer (Fig. 3, D and H). Co-localization of NHE3 with actin in jasplakinolide-treated cells could not be analyzed due to competition of the compound with phalloidin.2 The preceding results, obtained with cells expressing NHE3 epitope tagged at the carboxyl terminus and stained after permeabilization, cannot resolve whether disruption of the actin filament network redistributes NHE3 that is located intracellularly or at the plasmalemma. More importantly, such experiments cannot discern whether the inhibition of transport is associated with a reduction in the density of cell surface NHE3. To selectively visualize the surface exchangers, we used externally tagged NHE3 and immunostained without permeabilization. Typical results are illustrated in Fig.4. The distribution of NHE3 at the surface of control cells is rather homogeneous, with faint punctation over a diffuse background (Fig. 4 A). Cytochalasin B induced a redistribution of the surface exchangers, promoting their clustering (Fig. 4 B) in areas underlied by aggregates of actin (not shown). Similar observations were made in cells treated with latrunculin (not illustrated). Jasplakinolide promoted the formation of smaller NHE3 clusters at the surface of the cells (Fig.4 C). There was no striking difference in the overall amount of surface staining of control or cytochalasin- or jasplakinolide-treated cells. However, visual quantitation of plasmalemmal exchangers is limited by possible differences in focal plain and by heterogeneity in the population, which introduces considerable variance when comparing small numbers of cells by microscopy. To quantify the effects of the actin modifiers on the surface density of NHE3, we used a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, where the number of exchangers was measured by binding anti-HA a"
https://openalex.org/W2095138871,"CD52 is an unusually short, bipolar glycopeptide bearing a highly charged N-linked carbohydrate moiety and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor. It is exclusively expressed on lymphocytes and in the male genital tract where it is shed into the seminal plasma and inserts into the sperm membrane. The sperm surface molecule has potential significance as a target for antibodies that inhibit sperm function and gamete interaction. Western blot analyses suggested cell type-specific modifications of the antigen. It was purified from seminal plasma and a detailed structural analysis performed. The majority of anchor structures in male genital tract CD52 showed 2-inositol palmitoylation, rendering molecules insensitive toward phospholipase C, and asn-1-alkyl-2-lyso-glycerol structure in place of the diacylated anchor described by Treumann et al.(Treumann, A., Lifely, M. R., Schneider, P., and Ferguson, M. A. (1995) J. Biol.

A substantial proportion carried varying numbers of lactosamine repeats of which nearly 30% were branched. Different from lymphocytes, 10–15% of allN-glycans of the male genital tract antigen also contained peripheral fucose.

This resulted in the identification of the aromatic amino acids Trp167, Phe433, and Phe436 in transmembrane domains IV and VI of the H1 receptor as probable interaction points for the trans-aromatic ring of the H1 antagonists. Subsequently, a specific interaction of carboxylate moieties of two therapeutically important, zwitterionic H1 antagonists with Lys200 in transmembrane domain V was predicted. A Lys200 → Ala mutation results in a 50- (acrivastine) to 8-fold (d-cetirizine) loss of affinity of these zwitterionic antagonists. In contrast, the affinities of structural analogs of acrivastine and cetirizine lacking the carboxylate group, triprolidine and meclozine, respectively, are unaffected by the Lys200 → Ala mutation. These data strongly suggest that Lys200, unique for the H1receptor, acts as a specific anchor point for these “second generation” H1 antagonists. We combined in a previously derived three-dimensional model of the histamine H1 receptor (Ter Laak, A. M., Timmerman, H., Leurs, H., Nederkoorn, P. H. J., Smit, M. J., and Donne-Op den Kelder, G. M. (1995) J. Comp. Aid. Mol. Design. 9, 319–330) a pharmacophore for the H1 antagonist binding site (Ter Laak, A. M., Venhorst, J., Timmerman, H., and Donné-Op de Kelder, G. M. (1994) J. Med.

These data strongly suggest that Lys200, unique for the H1receptor, acts as a specific anchor point for these “second generation” H1 antagonists. Since the initial discovery of the role of histamine in allergic conditions (1Dale H.H. Laidlaw P.P. J. Physiol. 1910; 41: 318-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) serious efforts have been made to develop drugs that inhibit the actions of histamine. Already in 1933, Fourneau and Bovet (2Fourneau E. Bovet D. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. 1933; 46: 178-191Google Scholar) reported the first “antihistamine” piperoxan. Following this finding many potent H1 antagonists that can be considered as variations of diaryl-substituted ethylamines (e.g.diphenhydramine and mepyramine) have been developed (for review see Ref. 3Zhang M.Q. Leurs R. Timmerman H. Wolff M.E. Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery: Therapeutic Agents. 5th Ed. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 495-559Google Scholar). These “first generation” H1 antagonists are quite effective in humans in allergic rhinitis and urticaria, but because of central nervous system penetration and central H1 receptor blockade their clinical use is hampered by sedative side effects (3Zhang M.Q.

A “second generation” of nonsedative H1 antagonists (e.g. astemizole, acrivastine, cetirizine, loratidine, and terfenadine) has recently been developed (for review see Ref. 3Zhang M.Q. Leurs R. Timmerman H. Wolff M.E. Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery: Therapeutic Agents. 5th Ed. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 495-559Google Scholar). Their altered pharmacokinetics result in good clinical effectiveness combined with a strongly reduced sedative potential (3Zhang M.Q. Leurs R. Timmerman H. Wolff M.E.

Timmerman H. Wolff M.E. Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery: Therapeutic Agents. 5th Ed. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 495-559Google Scholar). With the availability of the genetic information of the histamine H1 receptor (6Leurs R. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 413-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), the rationalization of drug-protein interaction has become a major challenge for this therapeutically important class of drugs. Like all aminergic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein coupled receptorBRbacteriorhodopsinTMtransmembrane domain1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein coupled receptorBRbacteriorhodopsinTMtransmembrane domain the H1receptor contains an aspartate residue (Asp116) in transmembrane domain (TM) III (6Leurs R. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 413-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), that is involved in the binding of the protonated amine function found in both agonists and antagonists structures (7Moguilevsky N.

Mizuguchi H. Kagamiyama H. Fujimoto K. Fukui H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have furthermore shown that the imidazole ring of histamine is accommodated by Lys200 and Asn207 in TM V (9Leurs R. Smit M.J. Tensen C.P. Ter Laak A.M. Timmerman H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Leurs R. Smit M.J. Meeder R. Terlaak A.M. Timmerman H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In view of the low sequence similarity between GPCRs and bacteriorhodopsin (BR) much controversy exists on the validity of models derived for GPCRs based on the homology with BR (11Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 7-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Pardo L. Ballesteros J.A. Osman R. Weinstein H. Proc.

Nature. 1997; 89: 203-206Crossref Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite the speculative nature of BR-derived GPCR models they have been quite helpful in understanding and predicting drug-receptor interactions for a variety of receptors (seee.g. Refs. 14Zhao M.M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wieland K. Zuurmond H.M. Krasel C. Ijzerman A.P. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previously, we also developed a three-dimensional computer model of the histamine H1receptor based on the homology with BR, incorporating the results obtained from mutagenesis studies on the agonist binding site (17Ter Laak A.M. Timmerman H. Leurs H. Nederkoorn P.H.J. Smit M.J. Donne-Op den Kelder G.M. J. Comp. Aid. Mol. Design. 1995; 9: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study this computer model of the H1 receptor was combined with a pharmacophoric model of the H1antagonistic binding site (18Ter Laak A.M. Venhorst J. Timmerman H. Donné-Op de Kelder G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 38: 3351-3360Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This ligand-based model for the H1 antagonistic binding site is based upon an interaction of the protonated amine function of various first generation, semi-rigid H1 antagonists with an aspartate residue (Asp116 in the guinea pig H1 receptor) (18Ter Laak A.M. Venhorst J. Timmerman H. Donné-Op de Kelder G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 38: 3351-3360Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and precisely positions the cis- and trans-aromatic rings of the H1 antagonists relative to the Cα and Cβ carbon atoms of this aspartate residue. Combining the three-dimensional receptor model and the ligand-based pharmacophoric model of the H1 antagonist binding site resulted in the prediction of interactions of aromatic amino acids in TM IV and VI with the H1 antagonists. Subsequently, we experimentally confirmed the involvement of these predicted amino acids in the binding of the H1 antagonist [3 H]mepyramine by site-directed mutagenesis. Moreover, on the basis of the three-dimensional model of the antagonist-receptor complex, a specific interaction of carboxylate moieties of therapeutically important, second generation zwitterionic H1 antagonists (acrivastine and cetirizine) with Lys200 in TM V was predicted and experimentally verified.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsBovine serum albumin, DEAE-dextran, polyethyleneimine, and triprolidine hydrochloride were obtained from Sigma. The mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from International Biotechnology Inc. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit-anti-mouse secondary antibody was supplied by Dakopatts AB (Stockholm, Sweden). [3 H]Mepyramine (28 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Design. 1995; 9: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), using the rigid H1 antagonist pharmacophoric model of Ter Laaket al. (18Ter Laak A.M. Venhorst J. Timmerman H. Donné-Op de Kelder G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 38: 3351-3360Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This model describes the three-dimensional topology of the cis- and trans-aromatic rings of cyproheptadine with respect to the positions of the Cαand Cβ carbon atoms of an putative Asp residue from the receptor (see Fig. 1 A). The Cα and Cβ carbon atoms of the pharmacophore replaced the corresponding atoms of Asp116 in the receptor model. Rotation was carried out along the Cα-Cβbond until cyproheptadine was positioned in the receptor in an energetically favorable orientation. The structure of the zwitterionic compounds acrivastine and d-cetirizine were built and optimized with Chem-X and subsequently docked into the H1 receptor model onto the cyproheptadine template as described previously (18Ter Laak A.M. Venhorst J. Timmerman H. Donné-Op de Kelder G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 38: 3351-3360Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequently, all freely rotatable bonds in Lys200 and in the side chains of the zwitterionic H1 antagonist were taken into account in an extensive conformational analysis (MacroModel/AMBER force field (19Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3585) Google Scholar)).Site-directed MutagenesisThe guinea pig H1receptor cDNA was subcloned in the pALTER vector (Promega), and point mutations were introduced according to the manufacturer's protocol. The wild type and mutant receptors were epitope-tagged with an N-terminal FLAG peptide (DYKDDDD) after modification of the cDNA sequence with polymerase chain reaction. In our initial binding studies (see Fig. 2) nontagged receptors were used. The cDNA sequences were verified using the dideoxy chain termination method with the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Figure 2Effects of the mutation of aromatic amino acids in TM IV and VI on the binding of the H1 antagonist [3 H]mepyramine to wild type, Phe435 → Ala, Trp174 → Ala, Trp167 → Ala, Phe436 → Ala, Trp161 → Ala, and Phe433 → Ala H1 receptor after transient expression in COS-7 cells.

Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3, containing the wild type or mutant H1 receptor cDNA, using DEAE-dextran (COS-7 cells) or calcium phosphate (HEK-293 cells).Histamine H1 Receptor Binding StudiesTransfected cells were harvested after 48 h, homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Na2/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and used for radioligand binding studies. Cell homogenates (40–50 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in 50 mm Na2/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in 400 μl with the indicated concentrations of [3 H]mepyramine. The nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 μm mianserin. In displacement studies, cell homogenates were incubated with 1 nm[3 H]mepyramine and increasing concentrations of competing ligands. The incubations were stopped by rapid dilution with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Na2/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The bound radioactivity was separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters that had been treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed twice with 3 ml of buffer, and radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The binding data were evaluated by a nonlinear, least squares curve fitting procedure. Protein levels were determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal.

Cells were stimulated for 1 h at 37 °C with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 20 mmLiCl, and histamine. The incubation was stopped by aspiration of the culture medium and the addition of cold CHCl3/methanol (1:2 v/v). After extraction with water, [3 H]inositol phosphates were isolated by anion exchange chromatography (21Godfrey P. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach.

Antigen detection was performed as described (22Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Alewijnse A.E. Punin M. van den Nieuwenhof I. Blauw J. van Minnen J. Leurs R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(18Ter Laak A.M. Venhorst J. Timmerman H. Donné-Op de Kelder G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 38: 3351-3360Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) represents low energy conformations of several potent and rigid H1 antagonists (cyproheptadine, phenindamine, triprolidine, epinastine, mequitazine, and mianserine) and is able to discriminate between the stereochemically differentcis- and trans-aromatic rings of these H1 antagonists (Fig.1 A). To predict amino acid residues involved in the ligand-binding site of these H1antagonists the cyproheptadine pharmacophore was docked into the previously derived model of the H1 receptor. After rotation over the Cα-Cβ bond of Asp116 and energy optimizations, a single energetically favorable orientation was found for the H1 antagonist. In this orientation the aromatic rings of the H1 antagonist were located in the receptor-binding pocket between the TMs III, IV, V, and VI (Fig.1 B). The aromatic rings of cyproheptadine were surrounded by several aromatic amino acids. In the H1 receptor model, thecis-ring of cyproheptadine is located within 5 Å of a tryptophane in TM IV (Trp161), whereas thetrans-aromatic ring is close to two phenylalanines in TM VI (Phe433 and Phe436) and Trp167 in TM IV (Fig. 1 B). All these predicted residues are conserved in all the reported H1 receptor sequences (23Fukui H. Fujimoto K. Mizuguchi H. Sakamoto K. Horio Y. Takai S. Yamada K. Ito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the derived model Phe435 points into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig. 1 B), and Trp174 is located just outside TM IV.The mutant receptors were expressed transiently in COS-7 cells and analyzed by [3 H]mepyramine saturation binding studies. Expression of the wild type H1 receptor in COS-7 cells resulted in a high affinity binding site for [3 H]mepyramine (K D = 0.7 ± 0.1 nm, mean ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig.2). Mutation of the tryptophane residues Trp161, Trp167, and Trp174 in TM IV to alanine residues resulted in distinct effects on the [3 H]mepyramine binding to the mutant receptors (Fig. 2). The introduction of the Trp174 → Ala mutation did not reduce the affinity of [3 H]mepyramine (Fig. 2;K D = 3.6 ± 0.6 nm, mean ± S.E., n = 3) dramatically. In contrast, for the Trp167 Ala receptor the affinity for the H1antagonist was reduced more than 10-fold (Fig. 2; K D> 15 nm, n = 3), whereas cells expressing the Trp161 → Ala receptor did not show binding of [3 H]mepyramine (Fig. 2) significantly higher than binding to mock-transfected COS-7 cells (15–50 fmol/mg protein; data not shown). Similar findings were obtained with the three Phe-Ala mutations in TM VI. The Phe435 Ala receptor mutant still bound [3 H]mepyramine with high affinity (Fig. 2;K D = 1.3 ± 0.2 nm, mean ± S.E., n = 3), whereas for the other two mutants a reduced (Phe436 → Ala receptor, K D > 15 nm, n = 3) or totally impaired (Phe433 → Ala receptor) [3 H]mepyramine binding was observed (Fig. 2).To verify protein expression of the two receptor mutants that did not show detectable [3 H]mepyramine binding (Trp161 → Ala and Phe433 → Ala), a FLAG epitope was introduced at the N terminus of the wild type and mutant H1 receptor proteins. Using confocal laser microscopy we identified specific, anti-FLAG immunofluorescence in the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells expressing the epitope-tagged wild type and the Phe433 → Ala H1 receptor (Fig.3). For the Trp161 → Ala H1 receptor, the anti-FLAG immunofluorescence was mainly found inside the cell, indicating perturbed receptor expression.Figure 3Localization of epitope-tagged wild type (WT) and mutant H1 receptors, transiently expressed in COS-7 cells.

To investigate the role of Trp161, Trp167, Phe433, and Phe436 in more detail, we changed the tryptophane residues in TM IV to methionine and phenylalanine (Trp161 → Met, Trp161 → Phe, Trp167 → Met, and Trp167 → Phe) and the phenylalanine residues in TM 6 to methionine (Phe433 → Met and Phe436 → Met). The mutant receptors were epitope-tagged, expressed in COS-7 cells, and evaluated for [3 H]mepyramine binding. In contrast to the Trp161 → Ala receptor mutant, the Trp161 → Met and Trp161 → Phe receptor mutants bound [3 H]mepyramine with high affinity (TableI). Yet the number of binding sites for the Trp161 → Phe receptor mutant was considerably lower compared with the wild type and the Trp161 → Met receptor mutant (Table I). As found for the Trp167 → Ala receptor mutant, mutation of Trp167 to Met or Phe resulted in strongly reduced affinity for [3 H]mepyramine (Table I). In contrast, mutating Phe433 and Phe436 to Met allowed [3 H]mepyramine binding with high affinity (TableI).Table IEffects of point mutations in TM 1V and V1 of the histamine H1 receptor on ligand binding and signal transductionReceptorK D[3 H]mepyramineH1 receptor densityK i histamineEC50histamineBasal stimulationnmpmol/mg proteinμmμmfoldWild type0.7 ± 0.19.5 ± 1.276 ± 190.04 ± 0.025.9 ± 0.4Trp161 → Ala0aPositive anti-FLAG immunofluorescence signals only inside the cell.NDND0.9 ± 0.1Trp161 → Met1.6 ± 0.218.6 ± 1.8124 ± 80.08 ± 0.066.5 ± 0.5Trp161 → Phe1.6 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.270 ± 60.07 ± 0.021.5 ± 0.1Trp167 → Ala>15NDNDND1.2 ± 0.3Trp167 → Met>15NDNDND1.5 ± 0.2Trp167 → Phe>15NDND217 ± 1383.0 ± 0.2Trp174 → Ala3.6 ± 0.61.1 ± 0.4NDNDNDPhe433 → Ala0bPositive anti-FLAG immunofluorescence signals in the membrane.ND0.06 ± 0.026.0 ± 0.8Phe433 → Met5.4 ± 0.417.2 ± 0.2208 ± 130.4 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.1Phe435 → Ala1.3 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.3NDNDNDPhe436 → Ala>15NDND210 ± 1364.7 ± 0.5Phe436 → Met3.5 ± 0.312.8 ± 4.933 ± 366.3 ± 2.26.8 ± 1.0Receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells or HEK-293 cells and used 48 h after transfection for radioligand binding studies and the accumulation of [3 H]inositol phosphates, respectively.

Because of the lack of saturable [3 H]mepyramine binding, the agonist affinity could not be determined for the other mutants.Histamine-induced [3 H]Inositol Phosphate Accumulation after Stimulation of Wild Type and Mutant H1ReceptorsTo test the functionality of the mutant receptors, we initially performed [3 H]inositol phosphate accumulation experiments in transfected COS-7 cells. However, in mock-transfected COS-7 cells histamine increased basal [3 H]inositol phosphate accumulation, suggesting the presence of an endogenously expressed H1receptor. 2K. Wieland, H. Timmerman, and R. Leurs, unpublished observations. In mock-transfected HEK-293 cells histamine did not stimulate the [3 H]inositol phosphate accumulation (Fig.4), whereas after overexpression of the epitope-tagged wild type H1 receptor protein (7.1 ± 1.0 pmol/mg protein, mean ± S.E., n = 3) histamine (100 μm) stimulated the [3 H]inositol phosphate accumulation 5.9 ± 0.4-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3) over basal levels (Fig. 4). Evaluation of the various receptor mutants showed that the Trp161 → Met, Phe433 → Ala, Phe433 → Met, Phe436 → Ala, and Phe436 → Met mutant receptors stimulated the [3 H]inositol phosphate accumulation as the wild type H1 receptor (Fig. 4). Similar EC50 values for histamine were observed for the wild type receptor and the Trp161 → Met, Trp161 → Phe, and Phe433 → Ala receptors, whereas the Phe433→ Met, Phe436 → Ala, and Phe436 → Met mutant receptors were stimulated less effectively by histamine (TableI). The expression levels of the mutant receptors in HEK-293 cells ranged from 2.4 (Phe436 → Ala) to 10.6 pmol/mg protein (Trp161 → Met). For the Phe433 → Ala mutant no radioligand binding was found. As expected by the perturbed membrane expression, the Trp161 → Ala receptor mutant did not respond to histamine (Fig. 4). As found for the expression in COS-7 cells, the Trp161 → Phe was expressed at relatively low levels in HEK-293 cells (0.3 ± 0.1 pmol/mg protein, means ± S.E., n = 3). Despite its low expression level a significant stimulation (Fig. 4) of the mutant receptor by histamine was observed with comparable potency as the wild type receptor (TableI). For the various mutations of Trp167 only the Trp167 → Phe mutation resulted in a mutant receptor that could be activated by histamine, although with a very low efficacy (Fig. 4 and Table I). Because of the lack of saturable binding in the [3 H]mepyramine binding studies, the expression levels of these mutant receptors could not be estimated.Figure 4Basal (open bars) and histamine (100 μm) (closed bars) induced production of [3 H]inositol phosphates by wild type and mutant H1 receptors expressed in [3 H]inositol prelabeled HEK-293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2102545348,"We have isolated the cDNAs encoding human and mouse homologues of a yeast protein, termed peroxisomal membrane protein 20 (PMP20). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human (HsPMP20) and mouse (MmPMP20) PMP20 proteins revealed a high degree of identity (93%), whereas resemblance to the yeast Candida boidinii PMP20A and PMP20B (CbPMP20A and CbPMP20B) was less (30% identity). Both HsPMP20 and MmPMP20 lack transmembrane regions, as do CbPMP20A and CbPMP20B. HsPMP20 mRNA expression was low in human fetal tissues, especially in the brain. In adult tissues, HsPMP20 mRNA was expressed in the majority of tissues tested. HsPMP20 and MmPMP20 contained the C-terminal tripeptide sequence Ser-Gln-Leu (SQL), which is similar to the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 utilized for protein import into peroxisomes. HsPMP20 bound directly to the human peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptor, HsPEX5. Mutagenesis analysis showed that the C-terminal tripeptide sequence, SQL, of HsPMP20 is necessary for its binding to HsPEX5. Subcellular fractionation of HeLa cells, expressing epitope-tagged PMP20, revealed that HsPMP20 is localized in the cytoplasm and in a particulate fraction containing peroxisomes. Double-staining immunofluorescence studies showed colocalization of HsPMP20 and thiolase, a bona fide peroxisomal protein. The amino acid sequence alignment of HsPMP20, MmPMP20, CbPMP20A, and CbPMP20B displayed high similarity to thiol-specific antioxidant proteins. HsPMP20 exerted an inhibitory effect on the inactivation of glutamine synthetase in the thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system but not in the nonthiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system, suggesting that HsPMP20 possesses thiol-specific antioxidant activity. In addition, HsPMP20 removed hydrogen peroxide by its thiol-peroxidase activity. These results indicate that HsPMP20 is imported into the peroxisomal matrix via PEX5p and may work to protect peroxisomal proteins against oxidative stress. Because some portion of PMP20 might also be present in the cytosol, HsPMP20 may also have a protective effect in the cytoplasm.

Peroxisomes, also called microbodies, are single-membrane-bound organelles present in all mammalian cells with the exception of erythrocytes and are also found in plants, yeast, and most other eukaryotic cells. The peroxisome contains nearly 50 enzymes, many participating in various metabolic pathways (1Tolbert N.E. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Human peroxisomal enzymes are involved in numerous metabolic processes including β-oxidation of long and very long chain fatty acids, several steps in the synthesis of ether lipid, bile acids, and cholesterol, oxidation ofd-amino acids, and α-oxidation (2Van den Bosch H.

Biophys. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Peroxisomes also contain catalase, which plays a central role in eliminating the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by peroxisomal oxidases. “Newly synthesized” peroxisomal matrix proteins contain a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS), 1The abbreviations used are: PTSperoxisomal targeting signalPMPperoxisomal membrane proteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionESTexpressed sequence tagGSTglutathioneS-transferaseTSAthiol-specific antioxidantDTTdithiothreitolMCOmetal-catalyzed oxidationHsHomo sapiensMmMus musculusCbC. boidiniiScS. cerevisiaebpbase pair(s)HAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTKthymidine kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorNRP/Bnuclear matrix protein BPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1The abbreviations used are: PTSperoxisomal targeting signalPMPperoxisomal membrane proteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionESTexpressed sequence tagGSTglutathioneS-transferaseTSAthiol-specific antioxidantDTTdithiothreitolMCOmetal-catalyzed oxidationHsHomo sapiensMmMus musculusCbC. boidiniiScS. cerevisiaebpbase pair(s)HAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTKthymidine kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorNRP/Bnuclear matrix protein BPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis either PTS1 (4Gould S.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PTS1 sequence is a C-terminal tripeptide, Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL) or a variant (4Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Shneider M. Howell S.H. Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. Distel B. Tabak H. Subramani S.

However, either sequence is sufficient for peroxisomal targeting and is used by evolutionarily diverse organisms (8Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Yeast peroxisome biogenetic mutants (pex mutants) have been used to identify over 20 genes (PEX) and their protein products (peroxins) that are required for peroxisomal protein import and biogenesis (8Subramani S.

Among these are the yeast PMP20 proteins. A data base search revealed that Candida boidinii PMP20 and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterpart contained the PTS1 sequences, Ala-Lys-Leu (AKL) and Ala-His-Leu (AHL), respectively. In addition, secondary structure analysis of all yeast PMP20 proteins reported suggests that there are no obvious membrane-spanning regions as previously reported for CbPMP20A and CbPMP20B (14Garrard L.J.

In the present study, we have cloned two mammalian PMP20 cDNAs, determined the subcellular location of the PMP20 protein in mammals, and discovered a potential function for this class of proteins. When a nonredundant data base of human expressed sequence tag (EST) entries in GenBankTM was screened for human cDNAs similar to the CbPMP20A sequence, no significant matches were identified. However, a number of sequences (e.g. EST179427, EST185495, and EST186754) displayed some similarity to the coding region of the CbPMP20A sequence. Using the EST179427 sequence, we designed primers and amplified the putative sequence by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using as the template DNA from a human hippocampus cDNA library in the λZAPII vector (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The PCR fragment was sequenced to confirm identity (99%) with the EST179427 sequence. The PCR fragment was radiolabeled using an [α-32 P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Using this probe, the human hippocampus cDNA library was screened by hybridization. Positive clones were isolated, plaque-purified, excised, subcloned in pBluescript-SK (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), and sequenced on both strands. Using the same probe, a mouse brain cDNA library in the λgt11 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was also screened, and positive clones were sequenced. Primers for PCR and sequencing were purchased from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Sequence alignment was performed by DNASTAR (Madison, WI). Blots containing poly(A+) RNA from various human fetal and adult tissues were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A gene-specific probe was generated by restriction digestion of the human PMP20 (HsPMP20) cDNA by PstI (nucleotides 218–683). This 460-bp fragment was radiolabeled to a specific activity of 108–109 cpm/μg and was used as a probe for all Northern blots. The blots were hybridized with the probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, each blot was probed for β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The DNA corresponding to the HA tag sequences (30 bp) and the coding region of human PMP20 cDNA (486 bp) were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to yield pcDNA3-HA-HsPMP20. We subcloned the PMP20 cDNA into the pTK-Hyg vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and fused it to the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, to generate the plasmid pTK-GFP-HsPMP20-Hyg. The human PEX5(HsPEX5) cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (pcDNA3-HsPEX5). The vector sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Anti-rat peroxisomal thiolase (24Antonenkov V.D.

Bovine anti-catalase and mouse monoclonal anti-catalase were obtained commercially (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Polyclonal rabbit, monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody, anti-epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor antibody, and normal mouse IgG were obtained from a commercial vendor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-GST antibody was obtained from Sigma. Anti-nuclear matrix protein B (NRP/B) antibody was generated as described previously (26Kim T.A. Lim J. Ota S. Raja S. Rogers R. Rivnay B. Avraham H. Avraham S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Transfection of expression vectors into HeLa or COS-7 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were assayed 48 h after each transfection. Transfected COS-7 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin. After protein normalization using the Bio-Rad protein assay, lysates (500 μg/sample) were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, anti-PEX5 antibodies, anti-GST antibody, or normal mouse IgG. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF-Plus membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). Bound proteins were immunoblotted with either anti-HA antibody or with anti-HsPEX5, as described (25Fransen M. Brees C. Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Baes M. Mannaerts G.P. van Veldhoven P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7731-7736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. To construct wild-type human PMP20 protein (PMP20-WT) fused with GST at the N terminus, the coding region of HsPMP20 cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-ATG GCC CCA ATC AAG GTG GGA-3′, 5′-GCC TCA GAG CTG TGA GAT GAT-3′ with the attached restriction enzyme sites,BamHI and XhoI, respectively. The DNA (∼500 bp) fragment obtained from the PCR was gel-purified, digested, and ligated into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Constructs of mutant PMP20 proteins fused with GST where the PMP20 C-terminal tripeptide sequence SQL was either replaced with SKL (HsPMP20Q161K) or deleted (HsPMP20ΔSQL) were generated using the following reverse primers: 5′-GCC TCA GAG CTT TGA GAT-3′ or 5′-TCA GAT ATT GGG TGC CAG GCT-3′, respectively, in conjunction with the forward primer mentioned above. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were produced via isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) induction, and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HsPMP20 was cleaved from the GST using thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For precipitation of GST fusion proteins, COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-HsPEX5 were lysed, and 10 μg of various GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PEX5 or anti-GST antibodies. For Far Western analysis, purified HsPMP20, GST fusion proteins containing HsPMP20-WT and HsPMP20ΔSQL, or GST alone were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Far Western blotting, using biotinylated HsPEX5 (25Fransen M.

The subcellular location of HsPMP20 was determined by cell fractionation (27Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Itoh Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-HA-HsPMP20 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in a hypotonic solution, passed through a 30-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 600 × gfor 10 min to collect crude nuclei. These nuclei were further purified and used as the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect the heavy membrane fraction (mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes). The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, and the pellet and supernatant were used as the light membrane fraction (plasma membrane and microsomes) and cytoplasmic fraction, respectively. HeLa cells were standardized to represent an equal number of cells in each fraction and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-PEX5, anti-HA, anti-catalase, anti-peroxisomal thiolase, anti-EGF receptor, and anti-NRP/B antibodies. Immunofluorescence labeling was performed as described previously (26Kim T.A. Lim J. Ota S. Raja S. Rogers R. Rivnay B. Avraham H. Avraham S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3-HA-HsPMP20 or with pTK-GFP-HsPMP20-Hyg were grown in chamber slides (Lab-Tec, Naperville, IL). Adherent cells were fixed with neutral buffered 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Double-label immunofluorescent staining was performed using mouse anti-HA antibody followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) to decorate PMP20 in the HeLa cells. Peroxisomes were decorated with rabbit anti-thiolase antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit Texas Red IgG (Vector Labs). Immunostained preparations were examined using a Leica TCSNT confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Inc., Exton, PA) fitted with air-cooled Argon and Krypton lasers. Fields of view were selected and brought into view under bright-field imaging conditions. Confocal micrographs of emission spectra (530 ± 15 nm and >590 nm) were recorded under dual-channel fluorescence imaging mode using excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm. Images were collected from a 100× oil objective lens with 0.02 micron pixel size. Micrographs were examined using ImageSpace software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The antioxidant activity of HsPMP20 was determined by monitoring the ability of the protein to inhibit the inactivation of glutamine synthetase (Sigma) by a thiol-catalyzed MCO system as described previously (28Kim K.

The assay was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 5 μg of glutamine synthetase, 3 μm FeCl3, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and either 1 mm EDTA or 0–0.18 mg/ml HsPMP20 protein. For the nonthiol MCO system, DTT was replaced with 10 mm ascorbic acid. Following incubation at 30 °C for the indicated periods, the remaining activity of glutamine synthetase was measured by adding 5 μl of the reaction mixture to 2 ml of γ-glutamyltransferase assay mixture as described (28Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of HsPMP20 was assayed as described previously (30Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding 10 mmH2O2 to a 100-μl reaction containing 0.25 mm DTT, 0.15 mg/ml HsPMP20, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) at 37 °C. The concentration of the H2O2 remaining at the indicated time points was measured by the thiocyanate method as described previously (30Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because mammalian cDNA for PMP20 had not been described, we used the EST179427 sequence to probe a human hippocampus cDNA library and obtained four clones ranging in length from 0.45 to 1 kilobase pair. The longest cDNA (approximately 850 bp without the poly(A) stretch) encodes a protein consisting of 162 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 20 kDa (Fig.1 A). The sequence is likely to represent the full-length cDNA, because no cDNAs with a longer 5′-flanking region could be isolated. The codon at base pairs 226–228, along with the flanking nucleotides, correspond to the consensus sequence for an optimal translation initiation site (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar, 32Elgersma Y. van den Berg A. van Roermund C.W. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mouse PMP20 (MmPMP20) cDNA was cloned from a mouse brain library using the HsPMP20 cDNA as a probe. HsPMP20 and MmPMP20 share 88% nucleotide identity and 93% amino acid identity, and both have coding regions of 162 amino acids. The C-terminal tripeptide sequence of both HsPMP20 and MmPMP20 was Ser-Gln-Leu (SQL). A search using the HsPMP20 polypeptide against GenBankTM via the BLAST 2.0 and FASTA programs detected a similarity with yeast PMP20 proteins, CbPMP20A, CbPMP20B, and ScPMP20. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of HsPMP20 with ScPMP20 and CbPMP20A revealed 67 and 65% similarity, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The overall amino acid sequence identities between HsPMP20 and ScPMP20 or CbPMP20A were 27 and 35%, respectively (Fig. 1 B). These proteins are of similar length and are more similar to each other than to any other known proteins. Based on this sequence similarity, it is most likely that HsPMP20, MmPMP20, ScPMP20, and CbPMP20A are homologous. Analysis of HsPMP20 and MmPMP20 using the Prosite data base revealed no glycosylation sites or predicted transmembrane regions. To analyze the mRNA expression levels of HsPMP20 in various human tissues, Northern blot analysis was performed. The expression level in adult tissues was higher than that in fetal tissues (Fig.2, B and C). The sizes of the bands in fetal and adult tissues were similar to that of the cDNA from the library. HsPMP20 mRNA expression was abundant in adult heart, brain, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney, whereas expression in spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood was relatively low. Rehybridization of the same blots with β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes showed that similar amounts of the RNA samples were present in each lane (Fig. 2,lower panels). Cell fractionation of HeLa cells, expressing an HA-tagged PMP20, revealed that HsPMP20 protein localizes in a fraction enriched in mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, and in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.3). As expected, HsPEX5 was located mainly in the cytoplasmic fractions and partly in the heavy membrane fraction (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells expressing GFP-HsPMP20 (data not shown). Antibodies to peroxisomal catalase and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were used as controls. Both markers were localized in the heavy membrane fraction (Fig. 3) and were also faintly detected in the cytosolic fractions, consistent with their known ability to leak out from peroxisomes during tissue homogenization (11Wiemer E.A.C. Nuttley W.M. Bertolaet B.L. Li X. Francke U. Wheelock M.J. Anne U.K. Johnson K.R. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As expected, the EGF receptor and NRP/B nuclear matrix protein were mainly localized in the light membrane and nuclear fractions, respectively (Fig. 3). Double-staining immunofluorescence studies using HeLa cells that were transfected with either pcDNA3-HA-HsPMP20 or pTK-GFP-HsPMP20-Hyg revealed HA-HsPMP20 in punctate structures (Fig.4, B and C), and there was very strong colocalization of HsPMP20 with thiolase (Fig. 4,G and I), as well as with catalase (data not shown). Thus, these results support the conclusion of the biochemical analysis (Fig. 3) and show that the epitope-tagged HsPMP20 colocalizes with genuine peroxisomal matrix proteins. The PTS1 sequence is known to be SKL or a variant (4Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Shneider M. Howell S.H. Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. Distel B. Tabak H. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal tripeptide sequence of HsPMP20 was similar to SKL, the ability of HsPMP20 to bind to the human PTS1 receptor, HsPEX5, was examined. HsPMP20 fused at its N terminus with an HA epitope (HA-HsPMP20) was expressed together with HsPEX5 in COS-7 cells upon transient transfection. Cells co-transfected with the control vector (pcDNA3-HA) or pcDNA3-HA-HsPMP20 together with pcDNA3-HsPEX5 were lysed and immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, rabbit anti-PEX5 antibodies, or control antibodies. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. When both HsPMP20 and HsPEX5 were expressed, anti-HA antibodies co-immunoprecipitated HsPEX5 (Fig.5 A). In addition, anti-PEX5 polyclonal antibodies co-immunoprecipitated HA-HsPMP20 (Fig.5 B). These results indicate that HsPMP20 and HsPEX5 proteins interact in cells. To examine whether HsPMP20 and HsPEX5 can directly bind to one another, Far Western blotting was employed. Purified HsPMP20, bovine serum albumin, and GST fusion proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Far Western analysis (Fig.6 A, upper panel). The biotinylated HsPEX5 protein could bind to both HsPMP20 (Fig.6 A, lower panel, lane 1) and HsPMP20 fused at the N terminus with GST (Fig. 6 A, lower panel, lane 3). The biotinylated HsPEX5 protein was not able to bind to the GST fusion protein lacking the C-terminal tripeptide (HsPMP20ΔSQL) (Fig. 6 A, lower panel,lane 4) or to GST alone (Fig. 6 A, lower panel, lane 5). To determine the importance of the SQL motif, COS-7 cells transfected with HsPEX5 cDNA were lysed and precipitated with various GST fusion proteins. Co-precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HsPEX5 antibodies. GST fusion proteins containing the wild-type and the mutant HsPMP20, whose C-terminal tripeptide SQL was replaced with SKL (PMP20Q161K), also precipitated HsPEX5 (Fig. 6 B,upper panel). PMP20ΔSQL or GST alone failed to precipitate HsPEX5. The amount of GST fusion proteins used for the assay was similar (Fig. 6 B, lower panel). These results indicate that HsPEX5 binds directly to the SQL sequence at the free C terminus of HsPMP20 in the same manner as HsPEX5 binds to the typical PTS1 sequence. In the Prodom data base (Prodom release 36), three yeast PMP20 proteins, CbPMP20A, CbPMP20B, and ScPMP20, are reported to contain the structural domain termed Prodom domain 210. The yeast PMP20 proteins share this domain with 72 other proteins, most of which are antioxidant proteins. Of the antioxidant proteins containing the domain 210, yeast PMP20 proteins showed a higher homology to thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins. Alignment analysis performed by DNASTAR showed that the amino acid sequence of domain 210 in HsPMP20 and in other TSA proteins was 56% identical and 76% similar. MmPMP20 also showed a high homology to these TSA proteins. Therefore, the thiol-specific antioxidant activity of HsPMP20 was investigated. Antioxidant activity of HsPMP20 was analyzed by monitoring the ability of the protein to inhibit the inactivation of glutamine synthetase using an MCO system. HsPMP20 exerted, in a dose-dependent manner, an inhibitory effect on the inactivation of glutamine synthetase using a thiol-MCO system (DTT/Fe3+/O2) (Fig.7 A) but not using a nonthiol MCO system (ascorbate/Fe3+/O2) (Fig.7 B), suggesting that HsPMP20 does carry TSA activity. Furthermore, the protective activities of catalase and HsPMP20 on the inactivation of glutamine synthetase in the DTT/Fe3+/O2 system were compared. Catalase and HsPMP20 exerted protective effects in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 C). Both proteins could completely inhibit the inactivation of glutamine synthetase, and the concentration of proteins required to preserve 50% of the glutamine synthetase activity was 8 μg/ml for catalase and 40 μg/ml for HsPMP20. HsPMP20 removed H2O2 in the presence of DTT, suggesting that HsPMP20 acts as a TSA protein (Fig. 7 D). We have isolated two mammalian cDNAs encoding PMP20 and characterized the activity of the human protein. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of human and mouse PMP20s revealed 93% homology, indicating that PMP20s are highly conserved between these species, whereas their similarity to yeast PMP20 proteins was relatively limited. Human PMP20 mRNA was found in all human adult tissues examined. Interestingly, the expression of human PMP20 mRNA was very low in fetal brain, and increased post-natally in the adult brain. Cell fractionation experiments reveal that HsPMP20 protein is present in the heavy membrane fraction corresponding to mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, as well as in the cytoplasmic fraction. In these experiments, several control proteins such as HsPEX5, catalase, thiolase, EGF receptor, and NRP/B showed the expected associations with various subcellular fractions. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the colocalization of HsPMP20 with thiolase and catalase. We could not analyze the endogenous HsPMP20 localization, because we could not generate specific antibodies for HsPMP20. HsPMP20 was colocalized with thiolase and catalase, both markers for peroxisomal staining. It could be that the cytosolic localization observed is partly due to overexpression of the epitope-tagged HsPMP20. Consistent with the localization of HsPMP20 to the peroxisomal matrix, this protein has a functional C-terminal PTS1 sequence, SQL. When HA-HsPMP20 and HsPEX5 were co-expressed, anti-HA monoclonal antibodies co-immunoprecipitated HsPEX5. In addition, anti-PEX5 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated HA-HsPMP20. Furthermore, Far Western analysis revealed that HsPEX5 protein could bind to both the purified HsPMP20 and GST-HsPMP20 but not to GST-HsPMP20ΔSQL. In addition, both GST-HsPMP20 and GST-HsPMP20Q161K could precipitate HsPEX5, and the amount of HsPEX5 bound to their C-terminal tripeptides, SQL and SKL, was similar. The mutant HsPMP20, lacking the C-terminal tripeptide, could not bind to HsPEX5. These results indicate that HsPMP20 and HsPEX5 can directly bind to each other in mammalian cells and that the tripeptide sequence SQL of HsPMP20 is solely required for binding to HsPEX5, the PTS1 receptor. This interaction between the PTS1 sequence of HsPMP20 and HsPEX5 would explain how HsPMP20 is targeted to peroxisomes. In view of the variants of the PTS1 sequence that function as PTSs, the ability of SQL to interact with HsPEX5 is not really surprising (33Sheikh F.G. Pahan K. Khan M. Barbosa E. Singh I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the yeast PMP20 proteins and numerous AhpC/TSA family proteins share the Prodom domain 210 with various antioxidant proteins, especially with the TSA from various eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The amino acid alignment of the putative domain 210 of HsPMP20 exhibited homology to proteins of the AhpC/TSA family (56% identical, 76% similar), as do CbPMP20A, CbPMP20B, and ScPMP20. MmPMP20 also showed a homology to these thiol-specific antioxidant proteins. HsPMP20 exhibited antioxidant activity in the thiol-MCO system but not in the nonthiol MCO system, suggesting that HsPMP20 carries TSA activity. Requirement of a thiol-reducing equivalent in the antioxidant activity suggests that HsPMP20 might function as an antioxidant enzyme containing functional cysteines. Peroxisomes contain several oxidases that use oxygen as an electron acceptor to oxidize organic substrates in the process of forming H2O2. Because peroxisomes lack an electron transport chain, electrons released during the oxidation of fatty acids are used to form H2O2, which is highly toxic to the cell. H2O2 is efficiently converted to H2O within the peroxisomes by catalase. Abnormality in catalase import into peroxisomes is reported to lead to a severe neurological disorder. Like catalase, TSA owes its protective action to the removal of H2O2 (29Netto L.E. Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both catalase and HsPMP20 exerted a protective effect, in a dose-dependent manner, in the thiol-MCO system where the H2O2generated inactivates glutamine synthetase. In addition, we have shown that HsPMP20 removes H2O2 by its thiol-peroxidase activity in the presence of DTT. Therefore, we propose that HsPMP20 is a novel member of the AhpC/TSA family and is present in the peroxisomal matrix and possibly in the cytoplasm. HsPMP20 might play a role as a protector against oxidative stress in peroxisomes, as well as assist in the function of peroxisomal enzymes within the peroxisome. The source of thiols in peroxisomes, which are required for the TSA activity of HsPMP20, is still unknown. Further experiments should reveal the function of HsPMP20 as an antioxidant protein in peroxisomes. We thank L. Amery (Leuven), L.

The open reading frame carried by the Pfmap-2 cDNA encodes a 508-amino acid polypeptide of 59.2 kDa with maximal homology to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) from various organisms. The purified recombinant enzyme displayed functional characteristics of MAPKs such as (i) ability to undergo autophosphorylation, (ii) ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein, a classical MAPK substrate, (iii) regulation of kinase activity by a MAPK-specific phosphatase, and (iv) ability to be activated by component(s) present in cell extracts. Mutational analysis of the recombinant protein allowed the identification of residues that are important for enzymatic activity. Northern blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays indicated that Pfmap-2 is expressed specifically in gametocytes, the form that is responsible for transmission of the parasite to the mosquito vector. Gametocyte extracts activated recombinant Pfmap-2 more efficiently than extracts from asexual parasites, which is consistent with this stage specificity. Despite its overall high level of homology to MAPKs, Pfmap-2 presents the peculiarity of not possessing the conserved threonine-X-tyrosine activation motif usually found in enzymes of this family; instead, it has a threonine-serine-histidine at the same location. This atypical feature formed the basis for a detailed analysis of the primary structure of MAPKs, allowing us to define an operational MAPK signature, which is shared by Pfmap-2. The fact that no MAPK from vertebrates diverge in the activation motif suggests that the fine mechanisms of Pfmap-2 regulation may offer an opportunity for antimalarial drug targeting.

The spread of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the lethal form of human malaria, represents one of the most pressing public health problems in many parts of the world (1World Health OrganizationWeekly Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 269PubMed Google Scholar, 2White N.J. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Parasites that are resistant to anti-malarials are selected under drug pressure in treated patients, develop into male and female gametocytes that are infective to the mosquito vector, and hence can be transmitted to new human hosts. One possible way to limit the spread of P. falciparumresistance might consist in interfering with sexual development of the parasite, thereby preventing transmission. A rational approach to this goal requires a detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of Plasmodium sexual development.After invasion of a red blood cell, a merozoite can either embark on a new cycle of asexual multiplication leading to the formation of a schizont ultimately releasing 8–32 new merozoites or undergo sexual differentiation (gametocytogenesis), a process characterized by cell cycle arrest, a shift in the transcriptional repertoire, and morphological changes (reviewed in Refs. 3Alano P. Carter R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 429-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Sinden R. Butcher G.A. Billker O. Fleck S.L. Adv. Parasitol. 1996; 38: 53-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature gametocytes maintain their cell cycle arrested while in the blood of the human host, but this block is relieved immediately after the cell has been ingested by the mosquito; signals for gametocyte activation include a temperature drop and a molecule that is found in the mosquito midgut (5Billker O.

Activation of male gametocytes (exflagellation) results in the formation of eight flagellated gametes per gametocyte, whereas female gametocytes undergo further development into gametes without cell division. Fertilization in the mosquito midgut ensues, which is the first step in a succession of developmental events leading to the accumulation of sporozoites in the salivary gland of the mosquito (reviewed in Ref. 4Sinden R. Butcher G.A. Billker O. Fleck S.L. Adv. Parasitol. 1996; 38: 53-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).With the purpose of understanding the regulation of P. falciparum sexual development, we became interested in those intracellular signaling pathways that have been shown in other eukaryotes to be responsible for the transduction of extracellular stimuli to the nucleus and regulate cell proliferation and/or differentiation accordingly. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellularly regulated kinasesMEKMAP/ERK kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferaseMBPmyelin basic proteinbpbase pairDAPI4′,6-diaminido-2-phenylindolekbkilobase pairORFopen reading frameCDKcyclin-dependent kinase1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellularly regulated kinasesMEKMAP/ERK kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferaseMBPmyelin basic proteinbpbase pairDAPI4′,6-diaminido-2-phenylindolekbkilobase pairORFopen reading frameCDKcyclin-dependent kinase also called ERKs for extracellularly regulated kinases) form a group of serine/threonine protein kinases that play important roles in signal transduction pathways regulating adaptative response to a wide range of stimuli. Several pathways involving different MAP kinases coexist in the cell. These enzymes are activated by upstream kinases called MEK (MAP/ERK kinase), which phosphorylate threonine and tyrosine residues in a TXY motif that is conserved in MAPKs. The Xresidue varies between subgroups of the MAP kinase superfamily; in the p44/p42 (ERK1/ERK2) MAP kinase group the activation site is TEY; in the “p38/HOG1” group it is TGY, and in the “stress-activated protein kinase/Jun kinase” group it is TPY (Table I). Activation of MAPKs can readily be reversed through the action of MAPK-specific phosphatases, which makes this signaling system finely tunable (reviewed in Ref.6Cobb M. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab MAPKs function near the downstream end of well defined kinase cascades that respond to a variety of external stimuli, such as hormone treatment or osmotic pressure changes. An example that is particularly relevant to our studies is that of the differentiation pathway activated by the mating pheromone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The signal triggered by a pheromone-receptor interaction at the cell surface is transmitted to the MAPKs Fus3 and KSS1. Once activated, these MAPKs phosphorylate (and thereby activate) Ste12, a transcription factor specific for sexual stage-specific genes. Another substrate for these enzymes is an inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1. Therefore, MAPKs are central players in the mating-type differentiation in yeast (reviewed in Refs.7Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar and 8Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Inouye C.J. Thorner J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 363-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In another example, MAPK activation in PC12 cells may lead either to increased proliferation or to terminal neuronal differentiation, depending on the nature of the stimulus received by the cell (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar).It is likely that MAP kinase pathways, which are conserved in all eukaryotes studied so far, are involved in the regulation of the complex life cycle of Plasmodium. Indeed, we and others (10Doerig C.M. Parzy D. Langsley G. Horrocks P. Carter R. Doerig C.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 177: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Lin D.T. Goldman N.D. Syin C.

Microbiol. 1997; 23: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have described Pfmap-1, a MAPK homologue from this organism. Pfmap-1 is expressed in both asexuals and gametocytes, but its function in parasite development has not yet been determined. Here, we report the identification of Pfmap-2, a second putative MAPK homologue ofP. falciparum. Despite strong structural (including the presence of a MAPK signature motif), biochemical, and functional evidence that Pfmap-2 is a member of the MAPK family, the conserved MAPK activation site TXY is unexpectedly substituted in this enzyme by a TSH (threonine-serine-histidine) motif.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular CloningPolymerase chain reactions (PCR) with degenerate oligonucleotides were performed as described previously (13Doerig C.D. Doerig C.M. Horrocks P. Carlton J. Sultan A. Arnot D. Carter R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using the primers WTWTGYGAYTTYGGWGT (corresponding to the peptide (I/L)CDFGV) and CKYTCWGGWGCCATRTA (corresponding to the peptide YMAPER). The 170-base pair PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Inc. sequencer. The cloned product was used to probe a gametocyte cDNA library (a gift from D. Kaslow, National Institutes of Health) constructed in the plasmid vector pcDNA2, using standard protocols (14Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.50Google Scholar). Six colonies gave a signal out of 30000 clones, one of which (clone C1) contained the full-length Pfmap-2 open reading frame.Parasite CulturesP. falciparum clone 3D7 was grown in human erythrocytes as described previously (13Doerig C.D. Doerig C.M. Horrocks P. Carlton J. Sultan A. Arnot D. Carter R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except that the culture medium contained 0.5% Albumax instead of human serum. Gametocytes were obtained according to the protocol of Carter et al. (15Carter R. Ranford-Cartwright L. Alano P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 67-88PubMed Google Scholar).Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis and Northern Blot Analysis3D7 chromosomes were subjected to pulsed field electrophoresis using the CHEF system as described previously (13Doerig C.D. Doerig C.M. Horrocks P. Carlton J. Sultan A. Arnot D. Carter R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and transferred to a C-extra nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was extracted from parasites as described previously (13Doerig C.D. Doerig C.M. Horrocks P. Carlton J. Sultan A. Arnot D. Carter R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde using standard protocols (14Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.50Google Scholar), and blotted onto a C-extra nitrocellulose filter. Hybridizations were performed as described previously (13Doerig C.D. Doerig C.M. Horrocks P. Carlton J. Sultan A. Arnot D. Carter R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), using PCR fragments labeled with32 P by random priming.ImmunofluorescenceA Pfmap-2 antiserum was prepared by Covalab (University of Lyon-Sud, France). A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized with two peptides derived from the Pfmap-2 amino acid sequence (CFPLSPDHNSKK, residues 349–360, and KLNIHQKSFYNM, residues 498–508) coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein. As the titer obtained 3 months after immunization was not satisfactory, the same rabbit was reimmunized with the same peptides coupled to bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin, which allowed an increase in the titer against the peptides. The antiserum was used in immunofluorescence assays, in which smears from mixed (asexual plus sexual stages) cultures were air-dried, fixed in acetone, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to incubation with the antiserum diluted 125× in PBS. This was followed by several washes in PBS and incubation with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) (1:200 in PBS) in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml of the DNA-staining reagent DAPI (4′,6-diaminido-2-phenylindole).GST-Pfmap-2 Expression Plasmid and Site-directed MutagenesisThe Pfmap-2 open reading frame was amplified from the C1 cDNA clone using oligonucleotides carrying sites forBglII (forward primer, GCAAGATCTTAATGACTTCTATAAAAGAGTC) or EcoRI (reverse primer, GCAGAATTCGCTTACATATTGTAGAAACT) at their 5′ end; the ATG codon used as the 5′ boundary of the amplified fragment is that at position 174–176 (see below and Fig. 1). The PCR product was inserted into the pGEX-3X plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at theBamHI and EcoRI sites. The resulting GST-Pfmap-2 construct was sequenced to verify that no mutations had been introduced during amplification of the insert. Plasmids encoding various mutants of GST-Pfmap-2 (threonine > alanine at residue 290, serine > alanine at residue 291, or histidine > lysine at residue 292) were obtained by site-specific mutagenesis using the overlap extension PCR technique (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kb BamHI-SalI cDNA fragment of Pfmap-2 containing the mutation was amplified and used to replace the corresponding region of wild-type Pfmap-2, yielding the plasmids encoding GST-Pfmap-2T290A, GST-Pfmap-2S291A, and GST-Pfmap-2H292K. The entire Pfmap-2 coding region of these plasmids was verified by sequencing prior to expression.Expression and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsExpression of GST, GST-Pfmap-2, GST-Pfmap-2 mutants, and GST-ERK2 (bacteria kindly provided by M. Cobb) was induced inEscherichia coli (strain DH5α) with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C overnight. Cells were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold sonication buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton, 1 mmEDTA, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme) containing proteases inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). After incubation for 10 min on ice, the suspension was sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was applied to a 1-ml column of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The resin was washed four times with sonication buffer, and bound proteins were eluted twice with 15 mm glutathione in elution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 75 mm NaCl) and concentrated on Centricon tubes. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots of purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining.GST-HVH2 (plasmid kindly provided by K. Guan) was produced in E. coli as described previously (17Guan K.L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).Kinase AssaysKinase activity was measured using MBP or histone H1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as substrates. The assays were performed in a standard reaction (30 μl) containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32 P]ATP, and 5 μg of substrate per reaction). Reactions were initiated by addition of 1 μg of the recombinant protein kinase, proceeded for 45 min at 30 °C, and were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, boiled for 3 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and submitted to autoradiography. Autophosphorylation of recombinant protein kinases was assayed in the same conditions but without exogenous protein substrate. Data quantification was obtained by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms, or by phosphorimaging.In experiments aimed at determining the effect of HVH2 phosphatase treatment on kinase activity, 1 μg of GST-Pfmap-2 and GST-ERK2 were pretreated 15 min with 1 μg of GST-HVH2 at 30 °C in presence of [γ-32 P]ATP with or without phosphatases inhibitors. The kinase reaction was continued after addition of the substrate of the kinase (MBP) for a further 30 min, and the products were analyzed as described above.Activation of Pfmap-2 by P. falciparum ExtractsAfter lysis of erythrocyte membranes with 0.15% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, the pellet of parasites was resuspended in cold lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 15 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 mm glycerophosphate, and 100 μm ATP), homogenized, and briefly sonicated at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein content of extracts from asexual parasites or gametocytes was estimated by the Bio-Rad dye reagent and verified on a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Similar amounts of protein from both types of lysates were incubated with beads linked to GST-Pfmap-2 for 45 min at 4 °C; glutathione-agarose beads were used as negative controls. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer B (buffer A with 150 mm NaCl, 0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors) and once with kinase buffer. The washes were followed by a kinase assay with MBP and radiolabeled ATP, as described above.RESULTSIsolation of a P. falciparum Gene Encoding a Protein Related to MAP KinasesHaving previously characterized Pfmap-1, a putativeP. falciparum MAP kinase homologue, we subsequently intended to identify P. falciparum genes belonging to the MEK (MAP/ERK kinase) family, in order to reconstitute part of the phosphorylation cascade in which Pfmap-1 functions. To this end we performed low stringency PCR reactions using as a template P. falciparum (clone 3D7) genomic DNA and as primers degenerate oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to two conserved regions of MEKs (namely LCDFGV and YMAPER) separated by approximately 30 amino acid residues. Instead of the 130-bp PCR product that was expected from the amplification of a putative MEK gene homologue, we repeatedly obtained a 170-bp fragment. Sequencing of this PCR product demonstrated that it had been amplified from a protein kinase gene, albeit not of the MEK family; to our surprise, BLASTp analysis suggested that the amplified 170-bp fragment was instead related to the MAP kinase family. The fragment was used as a probe to screen cDNA libraries prepared from gametocytes or asexual parasites (gifts from D. Kaslow, National Institutes of Health, and A. Craig, Oxford, respectively). This allowed the isolation of a 1.9-kb clone (hereafter called clone C1) from the gametocyte cDNA library.The clone C1 insert is 1940 bp long and contains an uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) of 508 amino acids, encoding a putative polypeptide of 59.2 kDa (Fig. 1). The first ATG lies at position 67–69 and is preceded by two in-frame stop codons at positions 1–3 and 55–57. A second ATG is found at position 174–176. The same situation, where two ATGs separated by a sequence with one or more homopolymeric stretch(es) of adenosine residues are found near the amino terminus, exists in Pfmap-1. In both cases, which of the two ATGs is used as the translation start site remains to be determined experimentally. A stop codon occurs at position 1590–1592, followed by a region rich in A or T homopolymeric stretches and AT repeats that are characteristic of non-coding regions in the P. falciparumgenome. The polypeptide encoded by the C1 ORF is a serine-threonine protein kinase, as demonstrated by the following: (i) the two motifs (IGRGSYGYV, amino acids 112–120, and IIHRDLKPANCLL, amino acids 228–240) whose presence on the same protein is considered as diagnostic for classification in this group of enzymes (18Bairoch A. Nature. 1988; 331: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and (ii) the fact that all 15 amino acids that are nearly invariant in serine-threonine protein kinases (19Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar) are also present (Fig.2). TFASTA and BLASTp analyses performed with the entire sequence confirmed the BLASTp results obtained with the 170-bp original PCR product, as all high score entries corresponded to MAP kinases from different organisms; the highest homology was to members of the ERK1/ERK2 subfamily. Furthermore, the sequence contains the so-called MAPK-"

Asthma now affects one-fifth of the population, yet treatment of exacerbations is unsatisfactory, and the pathogenesis is unclear. Intraepithelial lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration and activation are strongly implicated, but the mechanisms regulating these processes are unknown. We hypothesized that lower airway epithelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) may be important in intraepithelial inflammation and that expression would be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and rhinovirus infection. We investigated respiratory epithelial cell VCAM-1 expression and its regulation to identify new targets for treatment of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. We observed constitutive respiratory epithelial cell VCAM-1 expression and that rhinovirus infection, but no other pro-inflammatory stimuli tested increased VCAM-1 cell surface expression in respiratory epithelial cell lines and primary bronchial epithelial cells. We then observed rhinovirus induction of VCAM-1 mRNA expression, promoter activity, and mRNA transcription. Rhinovirus induction of VCAM-1 promoter activity was critically dependent on up-regulation of proteins binding to the −254/−251 and −239/−236 GATA-binding sites and to the −72/−63 and −57/−48 NF-κB-binding sites in the VCAM-1 promoter.

We investigate respiratory epithelial VCAM-1 expression and its modulation by rhinovirus infection and pro-inflammatory stimuli. Having found that rhinovirus infection, but not other pro-inflammatory stimuli, induced VCAM-1 up-regulation in various human respiratory epithelial cell types, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms of rhinovirus induction of VCAM-1 expression to identify potential targets for modulation of rhinovirus-induced VCAM-1 in the therapy of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. Ohio HeLa cells were obtained from the Medical Research Council Common Cold Unit (Salisbury, UK), and A549 cells, a type II respiratory cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 16HBE cells, a differentiated SV-40 transformed bronchial epithelial cell line (43Cozens A.L.

These cells are >95% cytokeratin 18 immunoreactive epithelial cells as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Rhinoviruses type 16, 9 (major group), and 2 (minor group) were obtained from the Medical Research Council Common Cold Unit.

For selected experiments, inactivated rhinovirus type 16 was used, as described previously (28Johnston S.L. Papi A. Bates P.J. Mastronarde J.G. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J.

Inactivation/exclusion of the virus was achieved by (i) precoating the virus with its receptor (ICAM-1), (ii) UV light, or (iii) rhinovirus removal from inocula, by ultrafiltration through 30-kDa cut-off membranes (Amikon, London, UK). For each method, confirmation of inactivation was carried out by microtiter plate assay as described above. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the level of expression of VCAM-1 on the surface of resting and stimulated respiratory epithelial cells. 1 × 105 A549 or 16HBE cells were cultured in 24-well plates. Control medium or one of the following stimuli was added when cells were confluent: rhinovirus type 16 at MOI of 1; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml); lipopolysaccharide (100 mg/ml); IFN-γ (100 units/ml); TNFα (200 units/ml); IFN-γ plus TNFα; IFN-γ plus TNFα and IL-1β (10 units/ml). Incubation continued for various time points between 1 and 72 h. Dose response studies were carried out by using 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 MOI, and cells were harvested at 8 h. Similarly, the effect of inactivated virus was studied at 8 h. HBEC (2 × 105) were grown in 12-well plates and infected when confluent for 8 h. At desired time points, cells were harvested, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antihuman VCAM-1 (CD 106) antibody or isotype-specific control antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL), and analyzed for fluorescence by single color flow cytometry as described previously (44Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Mean fluorescence intensity was measured and normalized as percentage of noninfected control values, after subtraction of background staining. 5 × 106 A549 cells were cultured in 100-mm plates until confluent, and medium alone or rhinovirus type 16 were added for various times between 1 and 24 h. At desired times total RNA was isolated, and 1 μg of reverse transcribed P1 (24 ng/ml) was used as specific primer (46Meagher L. Mahiouz D. Sugars K. Burrows N. Norris P. Yarwood H. Becker-Andre M.

Cycling conditions were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 25 cycles. Inner primers P3 (TCCTGCTCCGAAAATCCTGTG and P4 (ATTCCACTTCCTTTCTGCTTCTTCC) were used for a nested amplification, annealing temperature 69 °C. Final PCR products (10 μl) were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose gel, stained in ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light. mRNA for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT, primers P1hk GCTGCGTGCTCATCCGAAAG and P2hkCCTTAAGCGAGGTCAGCTCC) was evaluated in each sample as housekeeping gene control. Densitometry was performed to express VCAM-1 mRNA relative to APRT mRNA. These methods were shown to give linear quantification of input mRNA by dilutional analysis in preliminary experiments (data not shown) and have previously been shown to give good quantification of mRNA in other systems (44Papi A.

For each sample total RNA was extracted from 107 nuclei, before and after in vitro transcription, in the presence or in the absence of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin (1 mg/ml). VCAM-1 RT-PCR was thereafter performed for each different condition to detect in vitro transcribed products.

The CAT activity was expressed as a percentage of chloramphenicol converted to acetyl chloramphenicol after resolution by thin layer chromatography and scintillation counting. Preparation of nuclear extracts. Confluent A549 were exposed to rhinovirus 16 for various time points (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min), and nuclear extracts were obtained by a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (49Dignam J.D.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild type and mutated sequences of the VCAM-1 promoter NF-κB- and GATA-binding sequences were obtained commercially (Oswell DNA Service, Southampton, UK). For control experiments double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild type sequences of the ICAM-1 promoter SP-1-binding sequence were used (Oswell DNA Service).

Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were autoradiographed at −70 °C overnight. Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and comparison between groups was performed by analysis of variance for multiple comparisons, and by paired Student'st test for individual comparisons. All experiments were carried out at least three times. VCAM-1 was constitutively present on both respiratory epithelial cell lines and primary bronchial epithelial cells, with mean fluorescence intensities of 30.2 ± 8.4, 26.3 ± 7.1, and 22.6 ± 4.5 for 16HBE, A549, and HBEC, respectively, after subtraction of background staining. A representative example of 16HBE basal VCAM-1 expression is shown in Fig. 1. Consistent with these findings, VCAM-1 mRNA was clearly detectable in the respiratory epithelial cells under basal conditions when the PCR cycle number was increased to 30, in both first round and nested amplifications (data not shown). VCAM-1 expression on 16HBE and A459 cells was measured before and after incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide, IFN-γ, TNFα, IFN-γ and TNFα combined, and the combination of IFN-γ, TNFα, and IL-1β for 8 and 24 h. None of these potent proinflammatory stimuli either alone or in combination were found to up-regulate VCAM-1 expression on 16HBE cells (data not shown). In contrast to the other stimuli tested, rhinovirus infection induced a significant up-regulation of VCAM-1 expression in 16HBE, A549, and primary HBEC cells. Dose response studies were performed in A549 and 16HBE cells infected with rhinovirus 16 to determine whether the induction of VCAM-1 occurred in a dose response manner. Cell surface VCAM-1 expression was examined 8 h after infection on the basis of preliminary studies. Enhanced expression of VCAM-1 relative to uninfected cells was observed in both cell lines, starting from 0.5 TCID50/cell and being maximal at 1–2 TCID50/cell (Fig. 2, upper panel). Based on these dose response data, a MOI of 1 was utilized in all subsequent studies. To evaluate the temporal kinetics of VCAM-1 induction by rhinovirus infection in both cell lines, surface VCAM-1 expression was studied at 0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h post rhinovirus 16 infection. Similar results were observed in A549 and 16HBE cells, with a significant increase within 4 h, a maximal effect between 8–24 h, and a still detectable up-regulation at 72 h (Fig.3, lower panel). In view of the time course results, 8 and 24 h infection were respectively chosen for A549 and 16HBE cells to investigate the receptor specificity and virus specificity of the up-regulation. To investigate whether the findings in cells lines were applicable to primary bronchial epithelium, similar studies were performed with HBEC. A 50% up-regulation of VCAM-1 surface expression was observed on HBEC cells in response to 8 h of rhinovirus 16 infection at a MOI of 1 (data not shown). Because the virus inoculum was a crude preparation, experiments were carried out to confirm that the induction of VCAM-1 surface expression was the result of virus-specific effects.

The mammalian MAT II isozyme consists of catalytic α2 and regulatory β subunits. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction and kinetic behavior of the human MAT II subunit proteins in mammalian cells. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pTargeT vector harboring full-length cDNA that encodes for the MAT II α2 or β subunits. Expression of the His-tagged recombinant α2 (rα2) subunit in COS-1 cells markedly increased MAT II activity and resulted in a shift in theK m for l-methionine (l-Met) from 15 μm (endogenous MAT II) to 75 μm(rα2), and with the apparent existence of two kinetic forms of MAT in the transfected COS-1 cell extracts. By contrast, expression of the recombinant β (rβ) subunit had no effect on theK m for l-Met of the endogenous MAT II, while it did cause an increase in both the V maxand the specific activity of endogenous MAT. Co-expression of both rα2 and rβ subunits resulted in a significant increase of MAT specific activity with the appearance of a single kinetic form of MAT (K m = 20 μm). The recombinant MAT II α2 and rβ subunit associated spontaneously either in cell-free system or in COS-1 cells co-expressing both subunits. Analysis of nickel-agarose-purified His-tagged rα2 subunit from COS-1 cell extracts showed that the β subunit co-purified with the α2 subunit. Furthermore, the α2 and β subunits co-migrated in native polyacrylamide gels. Together, the data provide evidence for α2 and β MAT subunit association. In addition, the β subunit regulated MAT II activity by reducing its K m for l-Met and by rendering the enzyme more susceptible to feedback inhibition by AdoMet. We believe that the previously described differential expression of MAT II β subunit may be an important mechanism by which MAT activity can be modulated to provide different levels of AdoMet that may be required at different stages of cell growth and differentiation.

Mammalian MAT exists in multiple forms that differ in their physical and kinetic properties among distinct species and even among different tissues of the same species. In mammals there are three forms, designated MAT I, II, and III, that differ in their tissue distribution and kinetic properties (7Hoffman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Mingorance J. Duran C. Pajares M.A. Adv. Exp. Med.

MAT I and III are referred to as the hepatic forms because their expression is confined to the liver. By contrast, MAT II is found in all mammalian tissues that have been examined to date, including erythrocytes, lymphocytes, brain, kidney, testis, and liver (10Okada G. Teraoka H. Tsukada K.

On the other hand MAT II from leukemic T cells or from activated human lymphocytes is a hetero-oligomer that consists of α2 (53 kDa), α′2 (51 kDa) and β (38 kDa) subunits (13Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α2 and α′2 are the catalytic subunits, whereas β appeared to have a regulatory function (23De La Rosa J.

Halim, A. Geller, and M. Kotb, submitted for publication. The α2 and α′2 subunits are immunologically cross-reactive and essentially identical to each other but are quite different from the β subunit. The α2 subunit, which appears to be post-translationally processed to yield α′2(13Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is encoded by the MAT2A gene, which is homologous but different from MAT1A gene (11Kotb M. Mudd S.H. Mato J.M. Geller A.M.

Previous studies had shown that physiological activation of human lymphocytes induces down-regulation of the β subunit with coincidental alterations in MAT II kinetic properties (25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this differential expression of the β subunit may be an important physiological mechanism by which MAT II activity can be modulated. To test this hypothesis, we cloned and expressed both the rα2 (24De La Rosa J. Ostrowski J. Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. Kotb M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Valentine M. Geller A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21860-21868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and rβ subunits2 of human MAT II in COS-1 cells, where mammalian post-translational events may affect subunit association and/or enzyme activity. In this study, we provide evidence for the association of MAT II α2 and β subunits with consequent changes in enzyme kinetic and regulatory properties. We believe that this is an important mechanism by which AdoMet levels are controlled during cell growth and differentiation. The COS-1 cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts, ATCC CRL 1650) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 10 mml-glutamine (Cellgro). The full-length cDNA encoding human lymphocyte (HuLy) MAT II α2 protein (24De La Rosa J. Ostrowski J. Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. Kotb M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Valentine M. Geller A.M. J. Biol.

The HuLy MAT II β cDNA was cloned into the same expression vector without the polyhistidine or the enterokinase site.2 The cloned cDNAs encoding either the rα2 or the rβ subunits were transferred from the pQE30 vector to the mammalian expression pTargeT vector (Promega) to generate pTargeT/MAT2A and pTargeT/MAT2B, respectively. Briefly, primers were designed to amplify the full-length cDNA encoding either the α2 or the β subunits from the pQE30 vector. Amplification was done using Taq polymerase (Promega) andpfu (Stratagene) in the ratio of 5:1, and the amplified product containing an A-overhang was separated on 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE, purified, ligated into the mammalian expression vector, pTargeT, and used to transform Escherichia coli strain JM109 competent cells by heat shock. Positive colonies were selected and subcultured, and the plasmid DNA was purified (Qiagen). The purified plasmid DNA was tested for the presence of the cloned inserts of the correct size and orientation by both PCR and EcoRI restriction site analysis. DNA from six colonies containing the proper insert in the right direction were subjected to manual sequencing of the entire cDNA in both directions using DNA cycle sequencing reagents (Promega), and the sequence was compared with the previously confirmed cDNA sequence for the α2 (24De La Rosa J. Ostrowski J. Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. Kotb M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Valentine M. Geller A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21860-21868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or for the β subunit sequence2 to ensure that no mutations were introduced during amplification. One representative clone for either the α2 or the β subunit insert was grown for large scale preparation of vector (Qiagen). Transfection of COS-1 cells with pTargeT/MAT2A or pTargeT/MAT2B was done using the cationic lipid reagent, Transfast (Promega). Preliminary experiments were carried out to optimize the transfection conditions. Typically, 1.5 × 106 cells were plated in a 100-mm dish 1 day prior to transfection. For each plate, 15 μg of vector DNA was mixed with Transfast at a ratio of 1:1 and incubated in a protein-free medium for 2 h. For cells co-transfected with both α2 and β vectors, 12 μg of DNA from each was used. For each experiment, one untransfected plate served as a normal control, and a second plate was transfected with the pTargeT vector only (mock-transfected cells). After 48 h, cells were harvested by trypsinization with a solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution (from Cellgro), and the trypsinization was stopped by the addition of media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The harvested cells were washed three times in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution, counted, and then resuspended in 1× extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 IU/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 30 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Cells were lysed by three cycles of quick freezing and thawing, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. If not immediately used, the cell extracts were stored at −80 °C. Protein assays were performed using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Extracts from normal, mock-transfected, and α2- or β-transfected COS-1 cells were prepared as described above, and 40 μg of protein from each cell extract were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) after 1:1 dilution in 2× sample loading buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) and boiling in a water bath for 5 min. For 17 × 17-cm gel size, electrophoresis was started at 100 V, and after the tracking dye left the stacking gel the current was kept constant at 30 mA for the remainder of the run. The gel was electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at 400 mA. After blocking overnight in 6% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, the blot was sequentially incubated with primary rabbit anti-α2 or anti-β antibodies prepared as described previously (27De La Rosa J. Kotb M. Kredich N.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 28Kotb M. Geller A.M. Markham G.D. Kredich N.M. De La Rosa J. Beachey E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)2 followed by a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). The signal was initiated by the chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected using X-Omat film from Kodak. Molecular weight markers and recombinant MAT II (rMAT II) subunit proteins purified for E. coli extracts were used to determine the migration of expressed α2 and β subunits. MAT activity in cell extracts was assayed as described previously (13Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 5 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT in 50 mm TES buffer, pH 7.4). The concentration of l-Met was varied between 2 and 80 μm using 14C-l-Met (57.9 mCi/mmol) to a concentration of up to 20 μm and supplementary with cold l-Met for higher concentrations. Enzyme velocity is expressed as units/ml or units/mg protein, where 1 unit is defined as the formation of 1 nmol of AdoMet in 1 h. Calculation of K m and V maxwas also done using the PSI-plot software (Poly Software International) and the Marquardt algorithm. Experiments were designed to determine whether the expressed α2 and β subunits of MAT II associate and if their association alters the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Two methods were used to detect subunit association. Cell extracts were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1.5 m Tris, pH 8.8, under native conditions (without SDS). After blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane, the blots were probed with anti-α2 antibodies, stripped, and then reprobed with anti-β antibodies. Overlapping signals were taken as an evidence for co-migration of both subunits. The association between the His-tagged α2 subunit and the nontagged β subunit was analyzed by affinity purification on nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen). In a 15-ml tube, 2 ml of the 50% nickel-agarose slurry was spun down at 1000 rpm for 2 min, and then the pellet was equilibrated with a buffer containing 300 mmNaCl and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8. Cellular extract containing about 10 mg of proteins was added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, with mixing on a vertical rotator. The equilibrated gel was poured into the column and allowed to settle. The column was washed several times with 5 ml of equilibration buffer until the absorbance at 280 mm of the go-through material was undetectable. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of 300 mm imidazole, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and lyophilized. The lyophilized proteins were reconstituted in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, and the protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma). Proteins (2 μg each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Experiments were designed to test the effect of β subunit on the feedback inhibition of MAT II (α2 subunit) by AdoMet. However, due to association of rα2 with endogenous β, as well as the association of the rβ with the endogenous α2 protein, it was necessary to purify the subunits away from each other and to test them separately and in combination for kinetic properties and inhibition by AdoMet. Protein extracts from COS-1 cells co-expressing α2 and β subunits was fractionated on nickel-agarose column (Qiagen) as described above. The purified proteins were loaded onto a preparative 7.5% SDS-PAGE and after the separation was complete, and the protein bands were visualized by impregnation in cold 300 mm KCl. The α2 or β bands were excised, and proteins were electroeluted from the gel separately into Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8, and dialyzed against 10 mmammonium bicarbonate and then lyophilized. The lyophilized subunits were reconstituted, and the MAT assay was performed at 20 μml-Met (as mentioned above) for α2 subunit alone or α2 plus β subunits (combined at a molar ratio of 1:1) in the absence or in the presence of 25–50 μm AdoMet. COS-1 cells were transfected with pTargeT/MAT2A plasmid DNA. Protein extracts from untransfected, mock-transfected, and MAT2A-transfected cells were analyzed by Western blots. In untransfected and mock-transfected cells, small amounts of endogenous α2, α2′, and β subunits were detected (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2); however, cells transfected with pTargeT/MAT2A expressed abundant amounts of the rα2 protein, which migrated with a higher molecular weight due to the additional N-terminal polyhistidine tag and the enterokinase site (Fig. 1, lane 3). To study the effect of overexpression of rα2 on MAT kinetics, extracts from untransfected and transfected cells were assayed for MAT activity at different concentrations of l-Met ranging from 2 to 80 μm. Transfection with pTargeT/MAT2A caused a 2–3-fold increase in MAT specific activity compared with untransfected cells (50 versus 20 units/mg of protein). In addition, expression of the rα2 affected the enzymeK m for l-Met. MAT II in untransfected and mock-transfected cells had K m of 15 and 16 μm, respectively (Fig. 2,A and B), which are within the range found in resting human lymphocytes (23De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10699-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in cells expressing high levels of rMAT II α2 protein, two kinetic forms withK m for l-Met of 17 and 75 μm could be discerned (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Effect of overexpression of MAT II α2 on the enzyme kinetics in COS-1 cells. Cellular protein extracts from untransfected, mock-transfected or pTargeT/MAT II2A-transfected COS-1 cells were assayed for MAT activity as described under “Materials and Methods,” at different concentrations of l-Met. A Lineweaver-Burk plot (1/v versus 1/[l-Met]) was generated. A, normal cells; B, mock-transfected cells; C, α2cDNA-transfected cells. Enzyme velocity is expressed as units/ml or units/mg of protein, where 1 unit is defined as the formation of 1 nmol of AdoMet in 1 h. Calculation of K m andV max was also done using the PSI-plot software (Poly Software International) and the Marquardt algorithmView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) COS-1 cells were transfected with pTargeT/MAT2Bplasmid DNA, and the protein extracts from untransfected or transfected cells were analyzed by Western blots. Cells transfected with pTargeT/MAT2B expressed higher amounts of the rβ protein compared with untransfected cells (Fig.3, inset). Expression of MAT II β protein did not significantly affect the kinetic behavior of MAT II in normal cells (Fig. 3) inasmuch as the K m forl-Met was 20 μm; however, expression of rβ caused an increase in V max and a ∼2-fold increase in the MAT specific activity at different concentrations ofl-Met (35 versus 20 units/mg of protein). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pTargeT/MAT2A and pTargeT/MAT2B plasmid DNA, and the protein extracts from untransfected and transfected cells were analyzed by Western blots. As shown in Fig.4, the cells that were co-transfected with both vectors expressed abundant amounts of the rα2and rβ proteins compared with untransfected or mock-transfected cells. The association between the α2 and β subunits was assessed by different means. First, extracts from COS-1 cells co-transfected with vectors encoding α2 and β subunits were subjected to PAGE gel separation under native conditions and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane that was sequentially probed with antibodies to rα2 followed by antibodies to the β subunit, with stripping in between the probing. Both antibodies recognized the same bands on the transblot (Fig.5), and this indicated the co-migration of both subunits under native conditions. Second, we took advantage of the selective His tag on the rα2 subunit but not on the β subunit and used nickel-agarose to affinity-purify the α2 subunit from extracts of COS-1 cells co-expressing rα2 and rβ subunits to test whether the β subunit associates with the α2 subunit. As shown in Fig.6 A, analysis of the protein purified on nickel-agarose columns by SDS-PAGE showed that the rβ subunit co-purified with the rα2 subunit. Interestingly, when extracts from cells, which were individually expressing rα2 or rβ proteins, were simply mixed in a protein ratio of 1:1, the α2 and β subunits also associated and co-purified on the nickel-agarose column (Fig. 6 B), thereby indicating the spontaneous association of these proteins. Together, the data provide evidence that the rα2 subunit associates with the β subunit of MAT II. Interestingly, some of the native α2 and α2′ subunits were also captured by the His-tagged rα2 protein, suggesting heterologous oligomerization of α2 and α2′ subunits with each other as well as with the β subunit. MAT activity was assayed in extracts of COS-1 cells expressing rα2 only or co-expressing both rα2 and rβ subunits. MAT activity was increased by approximately 5-fold in the co-transfected cells as compared with untransfected or mock-transfected cells (Fig.7). Further, co-expression of rβ subunit caused an increase in MAT activity over that found in cells transfected with rα2 alone. The K m forl-Met in extracts from COS-1 cells co-expressing both subunits indicated the presence of a single kinetic form of MAT II withK m of 20 μm (data not shown). Next we investigated whether the β subunit alters the feedback inhibition of MAT II by the product, AdoMet. The activity of the purified rα with and without rβ was tested in the absence or in the presence of AdoMet. To rule out the possible association of either rα2 or rβ subunits with the endogenous MAT II subunits, we performed nickel-agarose column purification of extracts from COS-1 cells co-transfected with both subunits, separated the products on SDS-PAGE, excised the α2 and β bands from the gel, electroeluted the protein, and purified each subunit separately. The purified subunits were mixed in equimolar ratios, and assayed for MAT activity in the presence and in the absence of AdoMet. While the addition of the β subunit significantly increased the catalytic activity of rα2 by almost 2-fold, the presence of the β subunit rendered the enzyme more susceptible to AdoMet inhibition, with more than a 2-fold increase in the inhibitory effect of AdoMet seen when α2 and β were combined (Fig.8). The essential role of AdoMet in cellular metabolism is underscored by the fact that it participates in as many reactions as ATP and regulates the function of many key molecules and pathways (2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1984; 56: 251-282PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Mato J.M.

Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It follows that understanding the regulation of synthesis of this pivotal compound is important. AdoMet is synthesized by MAT, which in mammalian cells exists as at least two isozymes; MAT I/III are confined to hepatic tissue, and MAT II is found in all tissues (3Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). An emerging theme in the regulation of MAT activity in mammalian cells is that the differential oligomerization of the enzyme subunits can profoundly alter the enzyme physical properties, activity, and kinetic regulation. For example, the α1 catalytic subunit of the hepatic form of MAT exists either as a dimer (MAT III) or a tetramer (MAT I). This difference in oligomeric forms results in profound changes in the hydrophobic properties of the enzyme; MAT I is nonhydrophobic, whereas MAT III is strongly hydrophobic (7Hoffman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MAT I is inhibited, while MAT III is activated by AdoMet, and the K m for l-Met for these two forms is 3–14 μm and 100–200 μm, respectively (16Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol.

Unlike the hepatic forms of MAT, MAT II, which is present in all mammalian tissues, consists of nonidentical subunits α2and β (13Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that the α2 subunit is catalytic and suggested that the β subunit has regulatory properties (13Kotb M.

In this study, we provide evidence that the α2 and β subunits of MAT II associate spontaneously and that this association alters the kinetic properties of the enzyme. nickel-agarose capture purification of the His-tagged rα2 subunit from COS-1 cells co-expressing rα2 and rβ showed that the β subunit co-purified with the α2 subunit. Interestingly, rα2 oligomerized also with the endogenous α2 and α2′ subunits, suggesting heterologous oligomerization of α2, α2′, and β subunits of MAT II. The consequence of the differential oligomerization remains under investigation, but it is noteworthy that in cells expressing abundant amounts of rα2 and low levels of endogenous β subunit, we could detect two kinetic forms of MAT II with K m values for l-Met of 17 and 75 μm. By contrast, in cells co-expressing rα2 and rβ, only one kinetic form of MAT II was detected with a K m for l-Met of 20 μm. We believe that the lower K m form represents oligomers of α2/α2′ and β, and the higher K m form found in cells overexpressing rα2 protein represents homo-oligomeric α2subunits, which are in great excess of the endogenous β subunit. This conclusion is consistent with our previous findings that theK m for rα2 is 80 μm(24De La Rosa J. Ostrowski J. Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. Kotb M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Valentine M. Geller A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21860-21868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)2 and that in physiologically stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where the expression of the β subunit is down-regulated and only the α2 subunit is expressed, theK m for l-Met shifts from 20 μm to 55–67 μm (25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Together, the data provide evidence that the MAT II β subunit associates with the α2 subunit and lowers theK m for l-Met. The association between the α2 and β subunit does not appear to require metabolically active cells, since it occurs spontaneously when purified rα2 and rβ protein were mixed; however, the molar ratio of each subunit in the holoenzyme remains to be determined. We hypothesize, based on our data, that α2 can exist as homo-oligomers (dimers or tetramers) or as α2/β hetero-oligomers. The relative ratio of either form would depend on the relative molar concentration of α2 to β subunits, which as we had previously reported can vary at different stages of lymphocyte activation (25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We believe that this may be an important mechanism by which MAT II can change its kinetic properties to synthesize different amounts of AdoMet, because in addition to its effect on lowering the K m for l-Met, the β subunit renders the enzyme more sensitive to AdoMet feedback inhibition. The findings in this study provide a possible explanation for our recent observation that down-regulation of β subunit expression in activated lymphocytes results in 5-fold higher AdoMet levels in these cells (25LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16040-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these physiologically stimulated cells, the β subunit disappears after 72 h, and the α2/α2′ subunits retain MAT activity with a K m forl-Met of 55–67 μm and are at least 2-fold more resistant to AdoMet feedback inhibition. As a result, there is an accumulation of higher amounts of intracellular AdoMet, reaching up to 100 μm compared with resting lymphocyte levels of 20 μm. Although we have not fully deciphered the physiologic importance of this observation, it is interesting to note that certain methyltransferases, including specific DNA methyltransferases that have a relatively high K m for AdoMet (26Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Friedrich T. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17333-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) may be more active at the concentration attained in cells expressing only MAT II α2 subunits. In conclusion, the data reported here show that the association of MAT II α2 and β subunits alters the kinetic and regulatory properties of the enzyme. We believe that this mode of regulation is important for adjusting the levels of AdoMet to meet the cellular requirements at different stages of differentiation and that this may be needed to regulate the expression of certain genes and/or the function of gene products."

In the nucleus, prelamin A is processed to lamin A by endoproteolytic removal of the final 18 amino acids, including the farnesylated cysteine residue. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we isolated a novel human protein, Narf, that binds the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A. Narf has limited homology to iron-only bacterial hydrogenases and eukaryotic proteins of unknown function. Narf is encoded by a 2-kilobase mRNA expressed in all human cell lines and tissues examined. The protein is detected in the nuclear fraction of HeLa cell lysates on Western blots and can be extracted from nuclear envelopes with 0.5 m NaCl. When a FLAG epitope-tagged Narf is expressed in HeLa cells, it is exclusively nuclear and partially co-localizes with the nuclear lamina. The farnesylation status of prelamin A determines its ability to bind to Narf. Inhibition of farnesyltransferase and mutation or deletion of the CaaXmotif from the prelamin A tail domain inhibits Narf binding in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays.

The prenyl-dependent binding of Narf to prelamin A is an important first step in understanding the functional significance of the lamin A precursor. Several proteins have been found to be prenylated and methylated at their carboxyl-terminal ends (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar, 2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). Prenylation is a post-translational modification directed by one of three motifs. The Rab family of Ras-like GTPases are geranylgeranylated on the cysteine residues of CC or CXC motifs, where C is a cysteine andX is any amino acid. The final cysteine of the CXC motif is also carboxymethylated. Other prenylated proteins have a CaaX motif, where C is a cysteine, a is any aliphatic amino acid, and X is an amino acid that specifies whether a farnesyl (in which case X is a serine, alanine, methionine, or glutamine) or a geranylgeranyl (in which caseX is a leucine) group will be covalently attached. Following the attachment of the isoprenoid group, the final -aaX amino acids are cleaved, and the cysteine residue is methylated. Prenylation was initially believed to be important only for membrane attachment, but the 15-carbon farnesyl moiety alone does not stably anchor proteins to membranes (3Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 4Butrynski J.E. Jones T.L.Z. Backlund Jr P.S. Spiegel A.M.

Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The only nuclear proteins known to be prenylated in mammalian cells are prelamin A and B-type lamins. Both are farnesylated and carboxymethylated, but prelamin A is further processed by endoproteolysis to mature lamin A, which lacks the final 18 amino acids, including the modified cysteine residue (7Weber K. Plessmann U. Traub P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Beck L.A. Hosick T.J. Sinensky M. J.

Prenylated prelamin A containing a mutation that prevents its endoproteolytic processing can still be incorporated into the nuclear lamina (11Hennekes H. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unprenylated prelamin A accumulates within the nucleus with some incorporation into the nuclear lamina in cells where farnesyl synthesis has been blocked (9Lutz R.J. Trujillo M.A. Denham K.S. Wenger L. Sinensky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Sasseville A.M.J. Raymond Y. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 273-285PubMed Google Scholar). Once farnesyl synthesis is restored, prelamin A is rapidly farnesylated and cleaved into its mature form. Recently, the prelamin A endoprotease activity was characterized from HeLa cell nuclear extracts (13Kilic F. Dalton M.B. Burrell S.K. Mayer J.P. Patterson S.D. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5298-5304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For proteolysis to occur, prelamin A must be farnesylated and methylated, and the lack of either modification prevents maturation to lamin A. The specific protein or proteins involved in this endoproteolysis are not yet isolated. Furthermore, the cellular role of the prenylated prelamin A precursor is unknown. As a first step toward understanding its function, we searched for proteins that interacted with prelamin A. We now report the discovery of a novel protein that binds the farnesylated prelamin A carboxyl-terminal domain (preAct). 1The abbreviations used are: preActprelamin A carboxyl-terminal tail domainAct C → Sprelamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif cysteine is replaced with a serine residueActΔCaaXlamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif is deletedActmature lamin A tail domainBctlamin B1 tail domainCctlamin C tail domainPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferase5′-RACE5′-rapid amplification of cDNA endsPBSphosphate-buffered salineORFopen reading frameFe-S clusteriron-sulfur clusterCFcytoplasmic fractionSWsalt-washed nuclear supernatant fractionNSsalt-washed nuclear envelope fractionGDIRab GDP-dissociation inhibitor1The abbreviations used are: preActprelamin A carboxyl-terminal tail domainAct C → Sprelamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif cysteine is replaced with a serine residueActΔCaaXlamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif is deletedActmature lamin A tail domainBctlamin B1 tail domainCctlamin C tail domainPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferase5′-RACE5′-rapid amplification of cDNA endsPBSphosphate-buffered salineORFopen reading frameFe-S clusteriron-sulfur clusterCFcytoplasmic fractionSWsalt-washed nuclear supernatant fractionNSsalt-washed nuclear envelope fractionGDIRab GDP-dissociation inhibitor We have named this protein the nuclear prelamin A recognition factor, or Narf. prelamin A carboxyl-terminal tail domain prelamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif cysteine is replaced with a serine residue lamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif is deleted mature lamin A tail domain lamin B1 tail domain lamin C tail domain polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends phosphate-buffered saline open reading frame iron-sulfur cluster cytoplasmic fraction salt-washed nuclear supernatant fraction salt-washed nuclear envelope fraction Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor prelamin A carboxyl-terminal tail domain prelamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif cysteine is replaced with a serine residue lamin A tail domain mutant where the CaaX motif is deleted mature lamin A tail domain lamin B1 tail domain lamin C tail domain polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends phosphate-buffered saline open reading frame iron-sulfur cluster cytoplasmic fraction salt-washed nuclear supernatant fraction salt-washed nuclear envelope fraction Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor preAct contains amino acids 389–664 of prelamin A, which includes the CaaX motif (14Fisher D.Z. Chaudhary N. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6450-6454Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Act C → S has amino acid 661 changed from a cysteine to a serine residue. ActΔCaaX contains amino acids 389–660 with an artificial stop codon inserted after the amino acid 660 codon in the corresponding cDNA sequence. Act contains amino acids 389–646, and the carboxyl-terminal tail domain of lamin C (Cct) contains amino acids 389–572, which includes the 6 amino acids distinct from lamin A that arise from alternative mRNA splicing (15Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal tail domain of lamin B1 (Bct) contains amino acids 391–586 (16Pollard K.M. Chan E.K. Grant B.J. Sullivan K.F. Tan E.M. Glass C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All cDNAs corresponding to lamin tail domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers containing specific restriction endonuclease sites. The cDNA sequence coding for Act C → S was generated using a PCR primer where the cysteine codon TGC was replaced by the serine codon AGC. PCR products were either digested with the desired restriction endonucleases or subcloned into the TA overhang vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and subsequently digested. Amplified cDNAs were purified on agarose gels and ligated into their respective plasmids using standard methods. The cDNA sequences corresponding to the A-type lamin tail domains were cloned into pGBT9 (CLONTECH) in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain cDNA sequence using EcoRI andBamHI restriction sites, and the constructs were used in yeast two-hybrid assays. These cDNAs were also cloned into pGAD424 (CLONTECH) using SmaI andBamHI restriction sites and then further subcloned after digestion with SmaI and SalI into pBFT4 (a gift from Dr. J. Licht, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York) in frame with the FLAG epitope tag coding sequence. Bct cDNA was cloned into pGBT9 in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain cDNA sequence usingBamHI and SalI restriction sites and subcloned into pBFT4 in frame with the FLAG epitope tag by digesting pCR2.1-Bct with SmaI and EcoRI. Narf cDNA was amplified by PCR from a clone in pGADGH (CLONTECH) using a sense primer corresponding to untranslated cDNA sequences −63 nucleotides from the putative ATG translational start site and a M13+ antisense primer corresponding to sequences in pGADGH downstream of the polyadenylation signal. This PCR product was digested with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into pBFT4 in frame with the FLAG epitope tag coding sequence. FLAG-Narf cDNA was subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) cDNA sequence or into the mammalian expression vector pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by digesting pBFT4-Narf withBamHI and XhoI or with XbaI andXhoI, respectively. All constructs were sequenced at the Columbia University Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility. All plasmid DNA for bacterial and yeast transformations or tissue culture cell transfections was purified using the Wizard Plus Maxiprep Kit (Promega). The yeast two-hybrid screen (17Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH Protocol Handbook no. PT3024-1) except that yeast transformations were carried out as described (18Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 cells were co-transformed with pGBT9-preAct as bait and a HeLa cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) as “prey.” Five independent library constructs formed blue colonies and were isolated after screening 5 × 105 yeast colonies. Each positive Narf clone was sequenced at the Columbia University Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility using 16 different primers spaced 100–200 base pairs apart, which yielded complete and overlapping sequences of both strands of Narf cDNA. BLAST, GAP, and Pileup sequence analyses were performed using the NCI-Frederick Biomedical Supercomputing Center's facilities (Frederick, MD). All alignments were created using the Pileup program with default settings (gap creation penalty = 8; gap extension penalty = 2). Percentages of identical or similar amino acids were determined by GAP aligning protein sequences to the deduced amino acid sequence of Narf using the settings described above. Figures were created using MacBoxshade, version 2, downloaded from the Internet. The following amino acid groups were considered similar: aliphatic hydrophobic, A/I/L/M/V; aromatic hydrophobic, F/Y; basic, K/H/R; acidic, D/E; aliphatic alcoholic, S/T; and polar amides, N/Q. 5′-RACE (19Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar) reactions were performed on the longest Narf construct according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, HeLa cell mRNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) as described by the manufacturer. An antisense sequencing primer within the first 750 base pairs of Narf cDNA was used to amplify a single strand of antisense cDNA from this HeLa cell mRNA. After degrading the mRNA, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was used to ligate dCTP to the 3′-end of this single-stranded cDNA. Anchoring primers recognizing the poly(dC) stretch and a nested antisense sequencing primer were used to PCR-amplify the cDNA, which was then cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced as described above using T7 and M13− primers. Three initial antisense primers were used, and each yielded the same 5′ cDNA sequence. Human cancer cell line and human tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH. Probes were made from linear cDNA fragments of Narf, lamin B1, actin, or a shared domain of lamins A and C using the Random Priming System Kit (New England Biolabs) as specified by the manufacturer. Probes were labeled with [α-32 P]deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (NEN Life Science Products; 10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol). Blotting and washing of membranes were performed using standard methods, and blots were exposed to Kodak XAR x-ray film with intensifying screens at −70 °C for varying times. HeLa cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine (Media-Tech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pelleted cells were resuspended in 4 pellet volumes of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), allowed to swell on ice for 5 min, and sheared by 5–7 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Plasma membrane breakage was checked using an Olympus CK tissue culture inverted microscope. Lysed cells were underlaid with hypotonic lysis buffer containing 30% sucrose and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and clarified from nuclear or whole cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. This cytoplasmic fraction was removed from the pellet and set aside. The sucrose pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in 1 pellet volume of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and digested with 1 μg/ml DNase I and 10 μg/ml RNase A at room temperature for 15 min. Nuclei in all subsequent steps were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 s. Nuclear envelopes were washed three times with 1 pellet volume of nuclear extraction buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and supernatants were saved and combined. Nuclear envelope pellets were then washed and resuspended in 1 pellet volume of nuclear extraction buffer and sonicated briefly with a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) to suspend the nuclear envelopes. Protein concentrations of each cellular fraction were estimated by dot blotting samples onto nitrocellulose strips and staining with Ponceau S (Sigma). Each fraction was diluted to approximately the same concentration in SDS sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2.1% SDS, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −20 °C. Proteins in fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-blot Cell. Gels were Coomassie Blue-stained and destained using standard methods and dried onto Bio-Design Gel-Wrap using a Bio-Rad model 583 Gel Dryer. Escherichia coli strain DH5α bacteria were transformed with pGEX-4T-1 or pGEX-Narf and grown overnight. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 into fresh Luria broth and grown for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Fisher) to a final concentration of 0.5–1.0 mm and growing the bacteria for an additional 6–18 h. Bacterial lysates were prepared, and GST or GST-Narf fusion proteins were batch-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis, fusion proteins were eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. For binding assays, GST or GST-Narf remained attached to the beads and was stored at 4 °C and used within 24 h. GST-Narf fusion protein was purified as described above and lyophilized for injection into two rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory). Rabbits were boosted using approximately 150 μg of GST-Narf in SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices. Anti-Narf polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.17-18.18Google Scholar) except that nitrocellulose strips were processed as described below and antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, 1 mm EGTA for 20 s. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and blotted onto Nitrobind nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations) using a Bio-Rad Trans-blot SD Semi-dry Transfer Cell. Efficiency of transfer was checked by staining Western blots with Ponceau S. Blots were incubated in blocking solution (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dried nonfat milk) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were diluted into fresh blocking solution and incubated with the blots for 1 h at room temperature. Rabbit sera with polyclonal antibodies against lamins A and C or lamin B1 (21Cance W.G. Chaudhary N. Worman H.J. Blobel G. Cordon-Cardo C. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 1992; 11: 233-246Google Scholar) were diluted 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively. Preimmune and anti-Narf rabbit sera were diluted 1:500. Affinity-purified anti-Narf antibodies were diluted 1:20. Blots were washed for 2 × 10 min with blocking solution and for 10 min with PBS-T (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and subsequently incubated for 45–60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:5000 in PBS-T. Unbound antibody was removed by washing once with PBS-T for 15 min and then 4 × 5 min. Bound antibody was detected using ECL Western blotting detecting reagents, and blots were exposed for varying times to Hyperfilm ECL chemiluminescent film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). S. cerevisiaeY187 cells were used for yeast two-hybrid liquid β-galactosidase assays according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH Protocol Handbook PT3024-1). Yeast colonies were co-transformed with pGBT9 constructs containing cDNAs for preAct, Act C → S, ActΔCaaX, Act, Bct, Cct, and the pGADGH-Narf construct described above. Yeast cell homogenates were incubated witho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) overnight. The reaction was then stopped, and the optical density (λ = 600) was measured on a Beckman DU-6 spectrophotometer. Cultures from six yeast colonies were assayed for each data point, and statistical significance was calculated using a paired two-sample of the means t test. All lamin tail domain cDNAs were transcribed into mRNA using the RiboMAX T7 Large Scale Production System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Both [3 H]mevalonolactone- and [35 S]methionine-labeled proteins were synthesized using the Promega Nuclease Treated Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System. For proteins labeled with [35 S]methionine, approximately 2 μg of mRNA was translated in the presence of 40 μCi ofl-[35 S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products; 10 mCi/ml, 1175 Ci/mmol) and varying amounts of FPT-II (Calbiochem) in a 50-μl reaction volume at 30 °C for 90 min. Immediately following translation, 5 μl of the reaction suspensions were put into SDS sample buffer and stored at −20 °C. Two 20-μl aliquots of each reaction were incubated with 50 μl of either GST (approximately 10 μg) or GST-Narf (5–10 μg) fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described above. Binding assay samples were brought up to a total volume of 300 μl with PBS and rotated at 4 °C for 90 min. Beads were pelleted and washed three times with 300 μl of PBS. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, stored at −20 °C, and electrophoresed on 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed in 5% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR x-ray film overnight at −70 °C. For proteins labeled with [3 H]mevalonolactone, each 25-μl translation reaction contained 1 μg of mRNA, 35 μCi of RS-[5-3 H]mevalonolactone (NEN Life Science Products; 1 mCi/ml, 24 Ci/mmol) and varying amounts of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FPT-II. The ethanol solvent for RS-[5-3 H]mevalonolactone was removed using a Speed-vac (Savant Instruments) at room temperature, and the dried [3 H]mevalonolactone was immediately resuspended in thein vitro translation reaction mix. Translation took place at 30 °C for 90 min and was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. All translated proteins were electrophoresed on 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed with isopropyl alcohol/water/acetic acid (25:65:10) for 30 min, impregnated with the Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL chemiluminescent film overnight at −70 °C. For comparison of binding affinities, autoradiographs were scanned with an Epson Expression 636 scanner, and mean densities of each band were calculated with NIH Image, version 1.61, which was downloaded from the National Institutes of Health on the World Wide Web. Total reaction values were calculated by multiplying the mean density of each translation reaction band by 4. This value reflects the total amount of labeled protein added to each binding assay tube. Bound protein values measure the amounts of labeled protein that specifically associated with GST-Narf and were calculated by subtracting the mean density of GST-bound bands from the mean density of GST-Narf-bound bands. Ratios of bound/total reaction were calculated by dividing the bound protein values by the total reaction values for each sample. HeLa cells were transfected using the Electroporator II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence, harvested by trypsin digestion, and resuspended to a density of 12–16 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum orl-glutamine (Life Technologies). Each transfection reaction contained 250 μl of cells and 20 μg of pSVK3-FLAG-Narf in a 0.1-cm electroporation cuvette. Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min, electrically shocked, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Transfected cells were diluted into fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin and grown on Nunc Lab-Tek two-chamber slides for 24 h. Tissue culture medium was changed, and cells were grown for an additional 48 h prior to fixation and immunofluorescence staining. Transfected HeLa cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min, and permeablized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed for 3 × 3 min with solution A (PBS-T, 2% normal goat serum (Sigma)). Primary antibodies were diluted into solution B (PBS-T, 10% normal goat serum), and cells were incubated with the antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Transfected cells expressing the FLAG-tagged Narf were detected using the mouse M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:200. Rabbit anti-lamins A and C or anti-lamin B1 sera were diluted 1:100 and 1:200, respectively. Following incubation with the primary antibodies, cells were washed 4 × 3 min with solution A. The secondary antibodies were lissamine rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), and both were diluted 1:100 in solution B. Cells were incubated with the antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and then washed for 4 × 3 min with solution A and 3 × 10 min with PBS and allowed to air-dry. Coverslips were mounted over the adherent cells using the Slowfade Light Antifade Kit, Component A (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and sealed with clear nail polish. Slides were examined immediately or stored at −20 °C. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss CSM410 confocal laser scanning system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software on a Macintosh G3 computer. Unless otherwise indicated, routine chemicals were obtained either from Fisher or Sigma. Enzymes for DNA cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs. We screened a HeLa cell cDNA library using preAct as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Of approximately 5 × 105 colonies screened, five grew on selective medium and showed β-galactosidase activity on a colony filter lift assay. When the “prey” library plasmids from these colonies were isolated and sequenced, three were found to encode the same protein, and the corresponding cDNAs differed slightly from each other only in 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. The longest cDNA clone was 1560 base pairs and was completely sequenced in both directions. Using a 5′-RACE reaction, we obtained an additional 28 base pairs of upstream sequence, yielding a complete cDNA of 1588 base pairs (Fig.1). Comparison of this clone with the human EST data base did not find any ESTs with additional upstream sequences, further suggesting that we had the full-length cDNA sequence. We named the gene product of this cDNA clone Narf, fornuclear prelamin Arecognitionfactor. The assigned initiation codon appears to be the actual start codon, yielding a 456-amino acid protein with an expected molecular mass of 51,156 Da and a theoretical pI of 6.63. The stop codon occurs at base pair 1369 and is followed approximately 90 base pairs downstream by a polyadenylation signal, which is located 26 base pairs before the polyadenylate tail. When the cDNA is translated into a protein sequence, Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis showed that Narf is not an integral membrane protein (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of Narf was analyzed using a BLAST search. While no known proteins from higher eukaryotes were found to be Narf orthologs, bacterial iron-only hydrogenases and translated open reading frames (ORFs) from eukaryotic genomic DNA sequences showed some identity. The three bacterial hydrogenases with the most overall similarity to Narf are shown in Fig.2 A. Over the entire length of the protein, the D chain from the Desulfovibrio fructosovorans NADP-reducing hydrogenase (HydD in Fig.2 A) is 29% identical and 38% similar. Hydrogenase-1 fromClostridium acetobutylicum (HydA in Fig.2 A) is 30% identical and 38% similar to Narf, while the periplasmic iron hydrogenase-1 from Clostridium pasteurianum(Phf1 in Fig. 2 A) is 31% identical and 39% similar. Recently, the latter hydrogenase was crystallized, and its structure was analyzed (22Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Iron-only hydrogenases catalyze the formation of H2 by combining protons and electrons (23Adams M.W. Stiefel E.I. Science. 1998; 282: 1842-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Oncogenic Ras induces the transcription activity of NF-κB that confers cell survival. Oncogenic Ras also down-modulates the expression of Par-4, a transcriptional repressor protein, that is essential but not sufficient on its own to induce apoptosis. Here we show that reintroduction of Par-4 by transient transfection leads to apoptosis in cells expressing oncogenic Ras but not in those that lack oncogenic Ras expression. Par-4 abrogates oncogenic Ras-inducible NF-κB transcription activity but does not interfere with cytoplasmic activation, or the DNA binding activity, of NF-κB. Because abrogation of NF-κB transcription activity is sufficient to cause apoptosis in cells expressing oncogenic Ras, our findings identify Par-4 as a novel example of a pro-apoptotic protein that selectively inhibits oncogenic Ras-dependent NF-κB function at the transcription level and suggest a mechanism by which Par-4 expression may selectively induce apoptosis in oncogenic Ras-expressing cells.

In fact, ras is the most commonly occurring oncogene in about 30% of human cancers (7Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 8Park M. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Oncogenes. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1998: 205-228Google Scholar). The oncogenic effects of Ras are mediated by activation of the downstream serine/threonine kinase Raf. Mutant forms of Ras that are unable to bind to Raf but that can bind to other Ras targets are incompetent for transformation indicating that the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase pathway is critical for transformation and malignant progression (9Vojtek A.B.

The most common form of NF-κB is a heterodimer consisting of p50 and RelA/p65 protein subunits (14Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Treatment with cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, or ionizing radiation activates a second messenger cascade that causes phosphorylation of IκBα (14Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). This modification event is required for the dissociation, and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation, of IκBα (14Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). RelA contains a nuclear localization signaling sequence that is exposed upon dissociation of IκBα, thereby allowing translocation of the heterodimer to the nucleus, where it executes its transcription regulatory functions (14Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NF-κB transcription activity can be induced by oncogenic Ras or -Raf, and this induction of activity is not preceded by cytoplasmic activation of NF-κB or an increase in the amount of nuclear NF-κB bound to its target response site in the DNA (12Finco T.S.

In the course of studies performed to determine the effect of oncogenes on Par-4 expression, we found that oncogenic Ras, -Raf, or -Src cause down-regulation of Par-4 in immortalized fibroblasts. 1Qiu, S. G., Krishnan, S., and Rangnekar, V. M. (1999) Oncogene, in press.Similarly, regulated induction of oncogenic Ras causes down-regulation of Par-4 in NIH 3T3/iRas fibroblast cells.1 Stable expression of Par-4 in NIH 3T3/iRas transfectants inhibits cellular transformation by oncogenic Ras indicating that Par-4 is a negative regulator that has to be down-regulated for cellular transformation.1 These stable NIH 3T3/iRas/Par-4 transfectants show neither inhibition of NF-κB transcription activity nor apoptosis when oncogenic Ras is induced. However, in parallel transient transfection studies, we noted that Par-4 acts to inhibit the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Because inhibition of NF-κB by ectopic IκBα-SR is sufficient to induce apoptosis in NIH 3T3/iRas cells when oncogenic Ras is induced (13Mayo M.W. Wang C.-Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we sought to examine whether transient expression of Par-4, which results in inhibition of oncogenic Ras-inducible NF-κB activation, also causes apoptosis in the absence of another death signal. We present here evidence that oncogenic Ras-expressing cells but not those that lack oncogenic Ras expression show apoptosis when transfected with a Par-4 expression plasmid or an adenoviral construct. Thus, unlike Par-4 stable transfectants that neither show inhibition of NF-κB transcription activity nor undergo apoptosis when oncogenic Ras is induced, transient expression of Par-4 in cells containing oncogenic Ras is sufficient to inhibit NF-κB transcription activity and to induce apoptosis.

First, the EcoRI fragment of Par-4 cDNA from pCB6+/Par-4 was subcloned into theEcoRI site of ptet-lox shuttle vector (a derivative of pCMV-Ad5 that contains the tetracycline operator). The adeno-Par-4 virus was then prepared by using the Ψ5 adenovirus and the ptet-lox-Par-4 shuttle construct in CRE8 cells, which are human embryonic kidney 293 cells containing the cre recombinase gene (33Hardy S.

Similarly, the control adeno-green fluorescent protein virus was made after incorporating the cDNA for green fluorescent protein into the ptet-lox shuttle vector. High titers of the adenoviral constructs were prepared in 293 cells as described (33Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J.

The luc activity in each reaction was normalized with respect to the corresponding β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luc activity or response. Cells were infected with adenoviral-Par-4 and helper adenovirus or with helper adenovirus alone for control, or transfected with pCB6+/Par-4 or pCB6+ control plasmid, and subjected to Annexin V staining (with ApoAlert Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate from CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescent labeling of membrane phosphatidylserine was visualized by using a fluorescent microscope. Our recent studies1 have shown that Par-4 is down-regulated by oncogenic Ras, and stable expression of ectopic Par-4 abrogates the ability of oncogenic Ras to form foci in monolayer cultures. To identify the molecular targets of Par-4 in the signal transduction pathway evoked by oncogenic Ras, we tested the effect of Par-4 on NF-κB activation that is considered an important mediator of focus formation and cell survival functions of oncogenic Ras (12Finco T.S.

The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and processed for luc activity. Oncogenic Ras but not vector caused strong up-regulation of NF-κB transcription activity (Fig. 1 A). Par-4 inhibited oncogenic Ras-inducible expression of NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). Oncogenic Ras did not induce luc activity from the empty luc construct that lacked the NF-κB-binding site (data not shown). Because Raf mediates the oncogenic action of Ras, we next determined whether activated Raf induced NF-κB transcription activity and whether this pathway was susceptible to Par-4 action. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with the NF-κB-luc reporter and with activated Raf and Par-4, vector alone, or activated Raf and vector, and β-galactosidase plasmid to normalize the transfection efficiency. As seen in Fig. 1 B, activated Raf but not the control vector caused an induction of luc activity. Cotransfection with Par-4 abrogated activated Raf-inducible expression of luc activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the expression of β-galactosidase from the CMV-β-galactosidase construct was unaffected by Par-4 cotransfection (Fig. 1 C), indicating that Par-4 did not cause generalized inhibition of gene expression in the transfectants. Also, to ascertain that the above effects of Par-4 were not restricted to cells transiently transfected with oncogenic Ras or activated Raf, we performed experiments in NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing oncogenic Ras or activated Raf. The cells were cotransfected with vector or pCB6+/Par-4, NF-κB-luc reporter, and β-galactosidase plasmid, and then luc or β-galactosidase activity was determined. NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing oncogenic Ras or activated Raf showed strong induction of luc activity from the NF-κB-luc reporter construct relative to parent cells, and Par-4 but not vector cotransfection resulted in >90% inhibition of the luc activity (data similar to those in Fig. 1 and hence not shown). These findings suggest that Par-4 blocks Ras- and Raf-inducible signals that trigger NF-κB transcription activity. Because activated Raf enhanced NF-κB transcription activity, we determined whether activated Raf caused enhanced degradation of IκBα. Parent NIH 3T3 cells or NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing activated Raf were left untreated or treated with TNF-α for various intervals of time, and whole-cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis for IκBα expression. Treatment with TNF-α, which causes activation of NF-κB by phosphorylation, dissociation, and degradation of its inhibitory partner IκBα in the cytoplasm, served as a positive control. As seen in Fig. 2, although the IκBα basal levels in cells expressing activated Raf were higher relative to those in parent NIH 3T3 cells, and the kinetics of degradation of IκBα seen at 10 or 20 min treatment with TNF-α were somewhat different in the parent cells and in those expressing activated Raf, the loss of IκBα protein expression with activated Raf was comparable to that in the parent cells. Because the above experiments were performed with cells stably expressing activated Raf, we also performed experiments with NIH 3T3 cells that were transiently transfected with activated Raf or vector for control and examined the effect on IκBα degradation. These studies indicated that transiently transfected activated Raf does not cause degradation of IκBα (data not shown). These findings suggested that activated Raf, which strongly induces the transcription activity of NF-κB, does not contribute to the degradation of IκBα. To determine whether activated Raf caused increased NF-κB binding to DNA and whether inhibition of NF-κB transcription activity by Par-4 was a reflection of inhibition of NF-κB binding to DNA, we performed EMSAs. Nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells or NIH 3T3/Raf cells that were exposed to TNF-α for 1 h or left untreated and subjected to EMSA by using a radiolabeled probe prepared from the NF-κB binding sequence. As seen in Fig.3, treatment of NIH 3T3 or NIH 3T3/Raf cells with TNF-α caused increased binding of NF-κB to DNA as judged by the increased intensity of the bound complex. By contrast, activated Raf itself did not increase the binding of NF-κB to DNA (Fig. 3). The supershift reactions with the various antibodies indicated that p65 but not Par-4 or Egr-1 was present in the bound complex (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that activated Raf does not increase NF-κB binding to DNA over basal levels in NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, because activated Raf does not increase NF-κB binding to DNA, Par-4 is not expected to inhibit activated Raf-induced NF-κB transcription activity by blocking NF-κB binding to DNA. Similarly, oncogenic Ras did not increase IκB degradation or NF-κB binding to DNA (data not shown), consistent with the fact that oncogenic Ras induces NF-κB transcription activity via its downstream mediator Raf. To determine whether Par-4 blocked the activation of NF-κB transcription activity, NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with Gal4-RelA and Gal4-luc in the presence or absence of oncogenic Ras, activated Raf, or Par-4 expression constructs. Gal4-luc cotransfection with vector or with Gal4-TDM (which contained the DNA binding sequence but lacked the transactivation sequence of Gal4; data not shown) was used for controls. The Gal4-RelA fusion protein contained the DNA binding sequence but lacked the transactivation sequence of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor and contained the transactivation sequence but lacked the DNA binding sequence of RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB. The rationale here was that because binding to the Gal4 reporter was solely mediated by the Gal4 component and transactivation was solely mediated by the RelA component of the Gal4-RelA fusion protein, the effect of oncogenic Ras, activated Raf, or Par-4 on the ability of RelA to cause transcriptional activation could be directly assessed by using this reporter-driver system. The transient cotransfection experiments indicated that the Gal4-luc reporter showed a low basal level expression with Gal4-RelA or vector (Fig.4). Oncogenic Ras (Fig. 4 A) or activated Raf (Fig. 4 B) enhanced the ability of Gal4-RelA to cause expression of the Gal4-luc reporter. Par-4 did not affect the basal level of reporter expression by Gal4-RelA but blocked the ability of oncogenic Ras or activated Raf to induce the Gal4-RelA-mediated luc expression (Fig. 4, A and B). We also tested the effect of Par-4 on activation of Elk transcription activity by oncogenic Ras or activated Raf. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with Gal4-Elk and Gal4-luc reporter in the presence of vector and constructs expressing oncogenic Ras, activated Raf, or Par-4. As seen in Fig. 4 C, both oncogenic Ras and activated Raf induced Gal4-luc reporter expression by Gal4-Elk, and Par-4 did not abrogate this induction. These findings suggest that Par-4 specifically blocks the oncogenic Ras- or activated Raf-inducible transcription activity of nuclear NF-κB. Our previous studies performed with Par-4-stable transfectants suggested that Par-4 was necessary for stimulus-dependent apoptosis but not sufficient on its own to induce apoptosis (22Sells S.F. Han S.-S. Muthukkumar S. Maddiwar N. Johnstone R. Boghaert E. Gillis D. Liu G. Nair P. Monnig S. Collini P. Mattson M.P. Sukhatme V.P. Zimmer S.G. Wood D.P. McRoberts J.W. Shi Y. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3823-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, because the stable transfectants express a maximum of about 4-fold higher Par-4 relative to basal levels and are resistant to direct apoptosis by Par-4, we considered testing the effect of transient transfection of cells that express oncogenic Ras with Par-4 constructs. These experiments were primarily motivated by the observations described above suggesting that transient transfection of Par-4 caused inhibition of NF-κB transcription activity, and the fact that inhibition of oncogenic Ras inducible NF-κB activity by IκBα in the NIH 3T3 cell background has been unequivocally shown to be sufficient for induction of apoptosis (13Mayo M.W.

These experiments used NIH 3T3/iRas cells that were transiently transfected with either vector or the pCB6+/Par-4 expression construct and then grown in the presence or absence of IPTG to induce oncogenic Ras for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h, and apoptosis was quantified by Annexin V staining. As seen in Fig.5 A, transient transfection with pCB6+/Par-4 led to an 8–10-fold increase in Par-4 expression in cells grown in the presence or absence of IPTG over basal levels in cells transfected with vector. Immunocytochemical analysis for Par-4 expression indicated that about 40% of the cells were transfected with the Par-4 expression construct (data not shown). Annexin V staining indicated that all transfectants grown in the presence or absence of IPTG showed less than 5% apoptotic cells at 24 or"
https://openalex.org/W2162060803,"In Escherichia coli, signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent targeting of inner membrane proteins has been described. In vitrocross-linking studies have demonstrated that short nascent chains exposing a highly hydrophobic targeting signal interact with the SRP. This SRP, assisted by its receptor, FtsY, mediates the transfer to a common translocation site in the inner membrane that contains SecA, SecG, and SecY. Here we describe a further in vitroreconstitution of SRP-mediated membrane insertion in which purified ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complexes are targeted to the purified SecYEG complex contained in proteoliposomes in a process that requires the SRP-receptor FtsY and GTP. We found that in this system SecA and ATP are dispensable for both the transfer of the nascent inner membrane protein FtsQ to SecY and its stable membrane insertion. Release of the SRP from nascent FtsQ also occurred in the absence of SecYEG complex indicating a functional interaction of FtsY with lipids. These data suggest that SRP/FtsY and SecB/SecA constitute distinct targeting routes.

These data suggest that SRP/FtsY and SecB/SecA constitute distinct targeting routes. Going across or integrating into the inner membrane presents two different challenges to proteins synthesized in the cytosol of a prokaryotic cell, and this is reflected by the existence of two main targeting routes. The SecB pathway is specialized for the targeting of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins. SecB is a cytosolic chaperone that binds to the mature region of a subset of preproteins (1Kumamoto C.A. Francetic O. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SecB-preprotein complex is targeted to SecA, which is bound with high affinity to the membrane-embedded SecYEG complex (for review, see Ref.2Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

This pathway resembles SRP-mediated targeting of proteins to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes (for review, see Ref. 8Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic SRP interacts with nascent membrane and secreted proteins and targets them to the SRP receptor SRα at the ER membrane. The eukaryotic SRP is a complex consisting of six proteins arranged on an RNA scaffold, the 7 S RNA. Escherichia coli contains a smaller SRP composed of the P48 protein and the 4.5 S RNA, which are homologous to the eukaryotic SRP54 and the 7 S RNA, respectively (for review, see Refs. 9Luirink J. Dobberstein B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 10Wolin S.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, an SRα homologue has been identified in E. coli, designated FtsY (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J.

Both P48 and FtsY (and their eukaryotic counterparts) are GTPases, and GTP binding and hydrolysis regulate the targeting cycle in a mechanism that has not yet been fully defined (12Miller J.D.

Short nascent inner membrane proteins synthesized in a membrane-free E. coli cell extract were shown to interact with the SRP via their amino-terminal hydrophobic targeting signal (6Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G.

The SRP receptor FtsY, GTP, and inverted E. coli inner membrane vesicles were shown to be required for release of the SRP from the nascent chain (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Upon release of the SRP at the membrane, the nascent chain inserts into the membrane in the vicinity of the translocase components SecA, SecY, and SecG (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems that the SecB- and SRP-targeting pathways converge at a common membrane translocation complex. The exact composition of the translocase that is reached by the different routes may differ and has not yet been determined. Of particular interest is the cross-linking of SRP-targeted precursors to SecA, which functions as the molecular motor for translocation in the SecB pathway (2Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In an attempt to further define the minimal requirements for SRP-mediated targeting and membrane insertion, we have used proteoliposomes instead of inner membrane vesicles in our targeting assay. Short nascent chains of the inner membrane protein FtsQ were efficiently targeted to the E. coli SecYEG complex reconstituted in E. coli phospholipids. Hence, SecA seems dispensable for SRP-mediated protein targeting to the E. coli translocase. Before stable membrane insertion, the SRP was efficiently released from the nascent chains by FtsY in a GTP-dependent reaction. Protein-free liposomes also induced significant FtsY-mediated release of the SRP from the nascent chains indicating that the interaction of FtsY with lipids is sufficient to induce a conformational change in the SRP that lowers its affinity for the nascent chains. Restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Megashortscript T7 transcription kit was from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). [35 S]Methionine and protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was from Pierce.E. coli total phospholipid extract was from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Pelham, AL). Aurintricarboxylic acid was from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Nucleotides and all other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. Strain MC4100 was used to obtain translation lysate and inverted membrane vesicles (INVs) (15De Vrije T. Tommassen J. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Strain Top10F′ was used as host for plasmid pC4Meth108FtsQ (6Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the OmpT and OmpP protease-deficient strain SF100 was used as expression host for plasmid pET349 to allow the overexpression of SecYEG (16van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). pC4Meth108FtsQ plasmid was linearized withHindIII and transcribed using T7 polymerase. The resulting truncated mRNAs were translated for 20 min at 25 °C in an S-135E. coli in vitro translation system to produce ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) (6Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After 3 min of incubation, aurintricarboxylic acid (1 mm) was added to inhibit further initiation of translation resulting in homogeneous nascent chain length. Translation was stopped by adding 3 mmchloramphenicol. To allow SRP-RNC (SRNC) complex formation, 260 nm reconstituted SRP was added to the translation reaction (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A.

After 5 min of incubation at 25 °C, samples were chilled on ice, and the resulting SRNC complexes were purified from the translation mixture by centrifugation through a high salt sucrose cushion (17High S. Flint N. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and resuspended in RN buffer (100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9). The E. coli SecYEG complex that carries a hexahistidine tag at the amino terminus of SecY was purified and reconstituted in acetone/ether-washed E. coliphospholipids as described (16van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Standard proteoliposomes were obtained by the reconstitution of 200 μl of SecYEG (50 μg/ml) in 40 μl of lipids (20 mg/ml). Proteoliposomes used in the experiment described in Fig. 3 were prepared using different amounts of 0.2 mg/ml SecYEG (0–50 μl) diluted in a total volume of 200 μl of purification buffer (1.25% (w/v octylglucoside, 0.3 mg/ml phospholipids, 40% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 mm KCl in Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). These amounts of SecYEG were reconstituted with 40 μl of phospholipids, yielding (v/v) ratios of 0–1.25. Before use, proteoliposomes were sonicated 3 times for 10 s; E. coli SecA was purified as described (18Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Targeting reactions were done as described previously by incubating purified SRNCs together with 1 mm FtsY, 50 μm GTP, 50 μm ATP, and either INVs (1.25 mg/ml protein) or proteoliposomes for 5 min at 25 °C (7Valent Q.A.

Modifications to this standard reaction protocol are described in the figure legends. Cross-linking was induced with 1 mm DSS for 10 min at 25 °C and quenched at 4 °C by adding one-tenth volume of quenching buffer (1 m glycine, 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5). To separate integral membrane from soluble and peripheral cross-linked complexes, samples were treated with 0.18 m Na2CO3, pH 11.3, for 15 min on ice. The membrane fractions containing integral membrane proteins were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (10 min, 110,000 × g) and resuspended in RN buffer. Supernatant fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed with cold acetone, and resuspended in RN buffer. Samples were immunoprecipitated as described (19Luirink J. High S. Wood H. Giner A. Tollervey D. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1992; 359: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or mixed directly with 2× SDS-gel loading buffer before gel electrophoresis. Anti-SecA serum was added to protein A-Sepharose slurry and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation the Sepharose was washed twice with incubation buffer (30 mm Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCL pH 7.5) and once with lysate buffer (10 mm triethylammonium, 10 mmMg(OAc)2, 22 mmN(CH3)4Ac). To prepare a control lysate, protein A-Sepharose was prepared in the same way except that no anti-SecA serum was added. Both Sepharose preparations were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in MC4100 translation lysate. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the Sepharose beads were spun down and the supernatants recovered. Supernatant corresponding to the incubation with anti-SecA-loaded Sepharose was referred to as SecA− lysate, and supernatant corresponding to the incubation with Sepharose only was referred to as SecA+ lysate. Both lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-SecA serum to verify the extent of depletion. Samples were analyzed on 12, 15, or 4–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by phosphor imaging using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 473 and quantified using the Imagequant software from Molecular Dynamics. FtsQ is a type II E. coli inner membrane protein, which was used as a model protein for SRP-mediated targeting throughout this study. An in vitroSRP-dependent targeting assay was developed in which short FtsQ RNCs were efficiently targeted to the translocase contained in purified INVs. Interaction of the labeled nascent chain with SecY and SecA was demonstrated by formation of covalent bonds using the bifunctional cross-linker reagent DSS (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this study we further investigated this SRP-dependent targeting process. To define the essential membrane components required for targeting and membrane insertion, proteoliposomes composed of E. coliphospholipids and purified SecYEG complex were used instead of INVs. Short (108-mer) FtsQ nascent chains were produced in vitrousing a membrane-free E. coli translation lysate. Under these conditions the endogenous SRP contained in the lysate is titrated out by the preponderance of exposed hydrophobic targeting signals. SRP loading efficiency was increased by adding reconstituted E. coli SRP after the translation reaction (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The resulting SRP-RNCs complexes (SRNCs) were purified through a high salt sucrose cushion and incubated in the presence of FtsY, the E. colihomologue of the eukaryotic SRP receptor SRα (9Luirink J. Dobberstein B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and GTP, which were shown to be essential for their proper targeting to the membranes and for efficient release of the SRP from the nascent chain (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As accepting membranes, we compared INVs and proteoliposomes. Each reaction contained equal amounts of SecY as judged by quantitative immunoblotting (data not shown). After the targeting reaction cross-linking of 108FtsQ was induced using the membrane-permeable bifunctional cross-linker DSS and the membranes were extracted with Na2CO3 to separate membrane integral from soluble and membrane peripheral cross-linked complexes. Either with INVs or with proteoliposomes, a 108FtsQ cross-linking adduct appeared at about 50 kDa in the Na2CO3pellet (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and5, respectively). This complex represents a membrane integral complex of the radiolabeled 108FtsQ and SecY, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 11). The SecY adduct, which originates from the proteoliposomes, migrates slightly slower than the SecY from the INVs due to the histidine extension that is attached to the purified SecY used to reconstitute the SecYEG complex in the proteoliposomes (16van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, 108FtsQ was also found to be cross-linked to the other membrane integral components of the translocase, SecE and SecG (Fig. 1, lanes 8 and 9 for INVs, lanes 12 and 13for proteoliposomes). High molecular weight (∼69 kDa) cross-linked complexes in the Na2CO3 pellet of both INVs and proteoliposomes were also immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against SecE (Fig. 1, lanes 8 and 12) and SecG (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 13). These complexes probably represent trimeric structures consisting of 108FtsQ, SecY, and either SecE or SecG (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As previously reported (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), cross-linking to SecA (∼120 kDa product) is detected in the Na2CO3 pellet samples when INVs are used in the targeting reaction (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and7). A cross-linking adduct of ∼220 kDa is also immunoprecipitated from the Na2CO3 pellet with anti-SecA serum and might correspond to cross-linked SecA dimer (Fig.1, lanes 3 and 7). Upon immunoprecipitation a weak SecA adduct is also detected in the Na2CO3pellet from proteoliposomes (Fig. 1, lane 10). Because the proteoliposomes do not contain any SecA initially, we assume that some SecA contained in the translation lysate is co-purified with the SRNCs and is incorporated into the proteoliposomes during the targeting reaction. This point will be addressed in the last paragraph under “Results.” In the Na2CO3 supernatant from the INVs adducts to the SRP component P48 and trigger factor were detected (Fig. 1,lanes 15, 19, and 20) as observed before (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Trigger factor may act as a general folding catalyst via its prolyl isomerase activity and was shown to interact with all nascent chains regardless of their hydrophobicity (6Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, hardly any P48 adduct could be detected in the Na2CO3 supernatant when proteoliposomes were used as target membranes, whereas cross-linking to trigger factor was relatively efficient (Fig. 1, lanes 17, 22, and23). This suggests an efficient release of the SRP from the FtsQ RNCs followed by an efficient targeting to the translocase as indicated by the strong cross-linking signal to SecY in the Na2CO3 pellet samples. From these data we conclude that proteoliposomes composed of E. coli phospholipids and purified SecYEG complex support the transfer of 108FtsQ in a reconstituted SRP-mediated targeting assay from the SRP to the translocase. Compared with targeting reactions that contain INVs, the release of the SRP and the association with the translocase is even more efficient when proteoliposomes are used. SRP-mediated targeting of nascent FtsQ to SecY in the INVs requires FtsY and GTP or its nonhydrolyzable analogue GMP-PNP (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We investigated whether release of the SRP from nascent FtsQ and association with SecY in the proteoliposomes occurs via the same mechanism by studying its dependence on FtsY and nucleotides in the targeting assay described above. As shown in Fig.2, the release of the SRP and the association with SecY did not occur in the absence of FtsY (Fig. 2,lanes 9, 10, and 11). Proteoliposomes in combination with FtsY were essential for the release of the SRP (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). GTP or GMP-PNP (lanes 5 and 7) but not AMP-PNP or GDP (lanes 6 and 8) supported the transfer reaction. Consistently, mutant FtsY, FtsY A449 (13Kusters R. Lentzen G. Eppens E. van Geel A. van der Weijden C.C. Wintermeyer W. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that is unable to bind GTP, was not functional in the targeting assay (data not shown). Based on these results, we conclude that targeting of nascent FtsQ to proteoliposomes mechanistically resembles the targeting to INVs and thus provides a valid and attractive model for detailed studies on the mechanism of nascent chain transfer and membrane insertion. In vivo, FtsY is equally distributed between the cytosol and inner membrane (11Luirink J. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We have obtained evidence that FtsY has affinity for lipids (20de Leeuw E. Poland D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2E. de. Leeuw, K. te Kaat, C. Moser, G. Menestrina, R. Demel, B. de Kruijff, J. Luirink, and I. Sinning, manuscript submitted. To study the influence of the protein:lipid ratio on the efficiency of nascent chain transfer, proteoliposomes of different composition were prepared and tested in our targeting assay in the presence of FtsY and GMP-PNP. The efficiency of 108FtsQ targeting was monitored by quantifying the P48 cross-linking adducts in the Na2CO3 supernatant and the SecY cross-linking adducts in the Na2CO3 pellets (Fig. 3). As expected, the strongest cross-linking to P48 was observed when membranes were omitted in the targeting reaction and this signal was taken as 100%. Different proteoliposomes were made by mixing a fixed amount of E. coli phospholipids with increasing amounts of purified SecYEG complex. The targeting efficiency correlated with the SecYEG concentration in the lipid bilayer (Fig. 3). Proteoliposomes containing a SecYEG:lipid ratio of 1.25 resulted in the most efficient targeting as indicated by the weakest cross-linking to P48 and the strongest cross-linking to SecY. Surprisingly, when liposomes that do not contain any SecYEG complex were used in the targeting reaction a significant SRP release was observed (∼53%, Fig. 3). This release was completely dependent on the addition of both FtsY and GTP or GMP-PNP (not shown). Apparently, the interaction of FtsY with the lipids is sufficient to induce significant GTP-dependent release of the SRP from the nascent chain. However, this SRP release is not followed by effective membrane insertion of the 108FtsQ as judged by Na2CO3 extraction (data not shown). Apparently, the SecYEG complex is necessary and sufficient to obtain a stable integration into the lipid bilayer. SecA is a peripheral translocase component that plays a key role in the post-translational translocation process by functioning as a receptor for precursor proteins and as an ATP-driven molecular motor (2Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In a previous study (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that 108FtsQ RNCs targeted to INVs were in close contact not only to the “core” translocase component SecY but also to SecA (see also Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 6). It remained unclear whether SecA plays an active role in the observed SRP-mediated targeting and membrane insertion of 108FtsQ or whether the SecA cross-linking adducts were obtained just because SecA is located in the vicinity of the nascent chain as a structural subunit of theE. coli translocase (2Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). If this last hypothesis is correct, SecA should be dispensable in the SRP-dependent targeting reaction. This could be tested by using SecYEG proteoliposomes as SecA-free target membranes. However, as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 10) weak cross-linking of SecA to 108FtsQ was observed in the Na2CO3 pellet of proteoliposomes. Apparently, SecA is co-purified with the SRNC preparation and can be incorporated into proteoliposomes during the targeting reaction. The affinity of SecA for SecY and for acidic phospholipids might underlie this transfer of SecA from the SRNCs to the proteoliposomes (2Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We estimated by Western blotting that about 0.3% of the SecA present in the translation lysate co-purifies with the SRNCs upon sedimentation of the ribosomes through a high salt sucrose cushion (data not shown). Two observations suggest that it is most likely that SecA is co-purified via its general affinity for ribosomes (21Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rather than via a direct interaction with the FtsQ nascent chains. First, SecA was never found cross-linked to nascent FtsQ or any other nascent polypeptide in the absence of membranes even when added in excess (6Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Second, when translation reactions were either not supplemented with any mRNA or supplemented with truncated mRNA encoding nascent chains of a cytosolic protein, the same amount of SecA was co-purified with the ribosomal fraction (data not shown). To remove this residual SecA, we immunodepleted the translation lysate using anti-SecA serum (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). After this procedure no SecA could be detected by immunoblotting in the translation lysate (SecA− lysate) compared with a mock treated lysate (SecA+ lysate) (data not shown). Both lysates remained active for translation. 108FtsQ RNCs were produced using either SecA− or SecA+ lysate and loaded with reconstituted SRP. After purification the two kinds of SRNCs were used in different targeting reactions to which purified SecA was added (0, 0.1, and 0.5 μm, final concentrations). Interaction with proteoliposomes was assessed by DSS-induced cross-linking to SecY (Fig.4, A–C) and by quantification of the resistance of the RNCs to Na2CO3 extraction (Fig. 4 D). When a SecA− lysate was used for translation and when no additional SecA was added to the targeting reaction, cross-linking to SecY was observed (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) and the 108FtsQ was inserted into the membrane in a Na2CO3 resistant conformation (Fig.4 D). Thus, the FtsQ RNCs are able to reach the translocase and become inserted into the membrane in the absence of SecA. Upon addition of SecA to the targeting reaction cross-linking to SecY in the Na2CO3 pellet was slightly reduced irrespective of the translation lysate used, whereas SecA cross-linking adducts (**) appeared (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–6and Fig. 4 B). Part of the SecA adducts were extracted by Na2CO3 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–12). For both translation lysates, addition of purified SecA to the targeting reaction slightly reduced the Na2CO3 resistance of the targeted RNCs (Fig.4 D) consistent with the decrease in cross-linking to SecY. To confirm that the different cross-linking adducts observed were indeed related to either SecA or to SecY, immunoprecipitations were carried out after cross-linking. The SecA+ lysate was used to generate the RNCs, and 0.5 μm SecA was added to the targeting reaction. In the Na2CO3 pellet sample the 50-kDa product (*) was indeed immunoprecipitated with anti-SecY serum (Fig. 4 C, lane 3). Both the major 120-kDa cross-linking adducts (**) and minor 220-kDa products present in the Na2CO3 pellet and supernatant were immunoprecipitated with the anti-SecA serum (Fig.4 C, lane 2). We assume that the ∼220-kDa product corresponds to cross-linked complexes between the RNCs and the dimeric form of SecA. The SecA related adducts of ∼150 and ∼45 kDa ( ) in the Na2CO3 pellet are most likely proteolytic fragments of the SecA dimer and monomer cross-linking products. From these data, we conclude that SecA is not required for efficient targeting and initial membrane insertion of FtsQ nascent chainsin vitro. Furthermore, at high SecA concentrations there is a weak competition effect between SecA and SecY for the binding of RNCs delivered to the membrane via the SRP pathway. This competition seems to reduce the 108FtsQ insertion into the membrane. We have further developed our homologous in vitrotargeting assay that supports SRP-mediated targeting and membrane insertion of nascent E. coli inner membrane proteins (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The assay now contains purified 108FtsQ RNCs saturated with SRP, FtsY, GTP, and proteoliposomes that consist of purified E. coliphospholipids and the core translocon complex SecYEG. In this system, the SRP was released from the nascent chain in a GTP-dependent reaction, associated with SecY and acquired a Na2CO3-resistant conformation in the proteoliposomes as efficiently as in crude INVs. Thus, we have defined the minimal requirements for an efficient in vitroSRP-dependent targeting to the core components of theE. coli translocon. Preliminary experiments on the topology of targeted 108FtsQ in both INVs and proteoliposomes using cysteine replacement coupled to chemical labeling, suggest that it has the same topology as the native protein (data not shown). No additional proteinaceous membrane factors are required in these early steps of the targeting process. Notably, the SecDF/YajC subcomplex is dispensable, and may therefore be specifically devoted for the translocation or the membrane insertion of preproteins delivered via the SecB-dependent pathway (2Driessen A.J.M. Fekkes P. van der Wolk J.P.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Apparently, for the initial insertion of the inner membrane protein FtsQ, SecA, and ATP are not required. However, as judged by protein cross-linking, SecA was in close proximity to nascent FtsQ targeted to INVs (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or when proteoliposomes were supplemented with SecA (this study). Probably, SecA is juxtaposed to the nascent chain due to its affinity for SecY (22Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) rather than playing a crucial role in the initial insertion process or in the transfer of the nascent chain to SecY. As suggested by this study, when present in excess, SecA actually interfered with the transfer to SecY. Interestingly, a point mutation in SecY has been reported that specifically impaired the integration of integral membrane proteins but not the secretion of SecB-targeted precursors. In this conditional strain, expression of SecA was up-regulated (24Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SecA may be involved at a later stage in the insertion of inner membrane proteins especially when large periplasmic domains are translocated. The role of SecA in the complete assembly of inner membrane proteins is difficult to study in vivo and may differ for different substrate proteins (25Werner P.K. Saier Jr., M.H. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24523-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bassilana M. Gwizdek C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5202-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It should be noted that full-length FtsQ did not integrate into SecYEG proteoliposomes either in the presence or absence of SecA (data not shown) suggesting that additional components are required for complete in vitro reconstitution of inner membrane protein biogenesis. Interestingly, liposomes that consist solely of E. coliphospholipids are still able to support the FtsY-mediated release of the SRP from the nascent chain, albeit less efficiently than SecYEG containing proteoliposomes. We have previously demonstrated that FtsY is able to associate with RNC-SRP complexes in the absence of GTP and membranes (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). INVs and GTP-binding but not hydrolysis were required to dissociate the SRP from the nascent chain (7Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Apparently, FtsY pilots the targeting complex to the lipids without the requirement of any specific membrane receptor. This might cause a conformational change that is transferred to P48 in the SRP thus increasing the affinity of both P48 and FtsY for GTP. By analogy with the eukaryotic SRP cycle, binding of GTP to P48 may reduce its affinity for the nascent chain (28Connolly T. Gilmore R. Cell. 1989; 57: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 29Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Cell. 1997; 89: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The nascent chain that is released at the membrane does not insert stably into the lipid bilayer in an alkali resistant conformation but requires the SecYEG complex to acquire a stable membrane association. FtsY is located in part in the cytosol and in part in the cytoplasmic membrane (11Luirink J. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is a highly charged protein that does not contain any predicted membrane spanning segments and its mechanism of association with the membrane is obscure (20de Leeuw E. Poland D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study indicate that in contrast to its mammalian counterpart SRα, FtsY can function in the release of the SRP in the absence of a dedicated membrane anchoring protein. This might explain the ability of FtsY to cooperate with E. coli SRP in the targeting of proteins to microsomal membranes in a heterologous in vitro targeting assay (30Powers T. Walter P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4880-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion, we have recently observed that FtsY interacts with lipids using a phospholipid monolayer technique.2 Through its affinity for lipids, FtsY may increase the effective concentration of SRNCs at the membrane (30Powers T. Walter P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4880-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Still, proteoliposomes function more efficiently in the release of the SRP, which may be related to additional targeting functions of the ribosome and SRP. It is well established that eukaryotic ribosomes have affinity for Sec61p, the protein conducting channel in the ER membrane (31Kalies K.U. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Alternatively FtsY, in addition to its association with lipids, may interact directly with the SecYEG complex. However, an association of this kind could not be detected by cross-linking, immunoprecipitation or co-purification approaches. 3E. de Leeuw and J. Luirink, unpublished results. The reconstituted targeting system described in this study will be invaluable for a detailed analysis of the consecutive steps during SRP-mediated protein targeting and membrane insertion, allowing the intermolecular interactions, dynamics, and energy requirements of this process to be studied. The assay will also provide a means to identify soluble and membrane components specifically devoted to the proper assembly and folding of inner membrane proteins. Ultimately, this approach should lead to the full reconstitution of inner membrane protein biosynthesis. The purified SecYEG complex was kindly provided by C. van der Does. We thank, S. High and N. Harms for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2028658891,"The hormone receptor-like protein Gpr1p physically interacts with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Plc1p) and with the Galpha protein Gpa2p, as shown by two-hybrid assays and co-immune precipitation of epitope-tagged proteins. Plc1p binds to Gpr1p in either the presence or absence of Gpa2, whereas the Gpr1p/Gpa2p association depends on the presence of Plc1p. Genetic interactions between the null mutations plc1Delta, gpr1Delta, gpa2Delta, and ras2Delta suggest that Plc1p acts together with Gpr1p and Gpa2p in a growth control pathway operating in parallel to the Ras2p function. Diploid cells lacking Gpr1p, Plc1p, or Gpa2p fail to form pseudohyphae upon nitrogen depletion, and the filamentation defect of gpr1Delta and plc1Delta strains is rescued by activating a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via STE11-4 or by activating a cAMP pathway via overexpressed Tpk2p. Plc1p is also required for efficient expression of the FG(TyA)::lacZ reporter gene under nitrogen depletion. In conclusion, we have identified two physically interacting proteins, Gpr1p and Plc1p, as novel components of a nitrogen signaling pathway controlling the developmental switch from yeast-like to pseudohyphal growth. Our data suggest that phospholipase C modulates the interaction of the putative nutrient sensor Gpr1p with the Galpha protein Gpa2p as a downstream effector of filamentation control."

Factor VIII is an essential plasma protein that, when deficient or defective, results in hemophilia A. The activated form of factor VIII, factor VIIIa, functions as a protein cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa to form an anionic phospholipid-dependent complex referred to as the intrinsic factor Xase. This complex efficiently converts zymogen factor X to the serine protease, factor Xa (for review see Ref. 1Lollar P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 386: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The role of the phospholipid surface is primarily to reduce the K m for substrate, whereas the cofactor, factor VIIIa, increases the k catfor this reaction by several orders of magnitude (2van Dieijen G.

A significant fraction (∼20%) of individuals with hemophilia A who are treated with either purified plasma-derived or recombinant factor VIII develop an immune response to factor VIII (11Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies typically appear in situations where large deletions or inversions in the factor VIII gene are present (12Tuddenham E.G. Schwaab R. Seehafer J. Millar D.S. Gitschier J. Higuchi M.

In rare instances individuals with normal factor VIII develop autoantibodies (13Feinstein D.L. Rapaport S.I. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1972; 1: 75-92PubMed Google Scholar). The domain specificity of inhibitor antibodies obtained from hemophiliacs or individuals with autoantibodies identify the A2 and C2 domains as containing reactive sites in nearly 70% of inhibitor plasmas tested (14Scandella D. Mattingly M. Prescott R. Blood. 1993; 82: 1767-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-C2 inhibitors act by preventing the interaction of factor VIII with phospholipid surfaces (15Scandella D.

Our results show that those antibodies possessing specificity to the 484–508 epitope inhibit the interaction of A2 with factor IXa, thus abrogating the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity. These results identify the molecular basis for inhibition of factor VIII activity by this class of inhibitors. Recombinant factor VIII preparations (Kogenate®) were a gift from James Brown (Bayer Corp.). Purified recombinant factor VIII was also a generous gift from Debra Pittman (Genetics Institute). The murine monoclonal antibody R8B12, which reacts with the C-terminal region of the factor VIII A2 domain (19Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol.

Peptide concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid composition analysis. Phospholipid vesicles containing PSPCPE (20% PS, 40% PC, and 40% PE) were prepared using octyl glucoside as described previously (20Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A.

The reagents α-thrombin, factor IXaβ, factor X, and factor Xa (Enzyme Research Labs), Fl-FFR-factor IXa (Molecular Innovations), hirudin and phospholipids (Sigma), and the chromogenic substrate S-2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-glycyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide-dihydrochloride, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were purchased from the indicated vendors. Inhibitor IgG and Fab fragments were prepared from patient plasma samples as described (21Lazarchick J. Hoyer L.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Inhibitors were titered using the Bethesda assay (22Kasper C.K. Aledort L.M. Counts R.B. Edson J.R. Fratantoni J. Green D. Hampton J.W. Hilgartner M.W., J., L. Levine P.H. McMillan C.W. Pool J.W.

The Kogenate® concentrate was fractionated to separate factor VIII from albumin following S-Sepharose chromatography (23Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol.

Dimer preparations were depleted of trace levels of A2 subunit using mAb R8B12 coupled to Affi-Gel (4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some instances, proteins were concentrated using a MicroCon concentrator (Millipore, 10-kDa cut-off). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (26Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A2 subunit was reacted with factor IXa in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween (Buffer A) in the presence of 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 μm PSPCPE vesicles. For reactions containing anti-A2 antibodies, A2 subunit was incubated with the indicated concentrations of the antibody for approximately 1 h before adding it to the factor Xa generation reaction. Time course reactions were initiated with the addition of factor X (300 nm). Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess the initial rates of product formation and were added to tubes containing EDTA (80 mm final concentration) to stop the reaction. The rates of factor Xa generation were determined by adding the chromogenic substrate S-2765 (0.46 mm final concentration). Reactions were read at 405 nm using a V max microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made using a SPEX Fluorolog 212 spectrometer operated in the L format. The excitation wavelength was 495 nm (5 nm band pass), and the emission wavelength was 520 nm (14.4 nm band pass). Reactions (0.2 ml) were carried out at room temperature in Buffer A containing 30 nm Fl-FFR-factor IXa, 50 μm PSPCPE vesicles, and the indicated concentrations of factor VIIIa subunits and factor X in a quartz micro cell. A2 subunit was preincubated with antibody as described above. Anisotropy measurements were made by manually rotating the polarizers and monitoring the fluorescence for 5 s at each position. Fluorescence intensity determinations (3Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were made at each position, and the average value was obtained. Blank readings for the buffer containing phospholipid were subtracted from all determinations. Statistical analysis of the data employed a two-sidedt test tested at 95% confidence (α = 0.05). Two monoclonal antibodies specific for distinct regions in the A2 subunit were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X. mAb R8B12, a high affinity antibody used for immunopurification of factor VIII or A2 subunit (4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recognizes a C-terminal region of A2 contained within residues 563–740 (19Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titration of A2 subunit with this antibody prior to reaction of A2 in the factor Xa generating assay yielded ∼20% inhibition of A2-dependent factor X conversion at saturating levels of antibody (Fig. 1). Conversely, mAb 413, another high affinity antibody that recognizes an epitope contained within A2 subunit residues 484–509, yielded complete inhibition of the reaction. IC50 values for either antibody were similar (∼40 nm) and were consistent with a high affinity interaction. However, the disparate extents of inhibition suggested that the site recognized by mAb 413 was critical for the interaction of A2 subunit with factor IXa, which results in the enhancement of k cat. Because the epitope recognized by mAb 413 (residues 484–509) cross-reacts with antibodies obtained from patients possessing factor VIII inhibitors, the above experiment suggested that a possible mechanism for these anti-A2 inhibitors is perturbation of the interaction of the A2 subunit of factor VIIIa with factor IXa. To test this hypothesis, a panel of inhibitor antibodies showing specificity for the A2 domain (based upon inhibitor neutralization data (27Prescott R. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Scharrer I. Nilsson I.M. Humphries J.E. Hurst D. Bray G. Scandella D. Blood. 1997; 89: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was employed to assess the effects of these reagents on the A2-dependent enhancement of factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X. The antibodies used possessed inhibitor titers ranging from 4 to 2755 Bethesda units/mg. Titration of A2 with each antibody was performed prior to addition into the factor Xa generation assay. Subsequent rates of factor Xa generation are shown in Fig.2. All inhibitor antibodies tested resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in rate of substrate conversion. IC50 values correlated inversely with the inhibitor titer (Table I). Two groupings of inhibitor response were observed. Antibodies possessing titers of >1000 Bethesda units/mg yielded IC50 values in the 100 nm range, whereas antibodies possessing titers ranging from ∼1 to ∼10 Bethesda units/mg showed significantly weaker affinities as indicated by IC50 values ranging from >1 to ∼10 μm. These results indicate that anti-A2 subunit specific inhibitors alter the interaction between this factor VIIIa subunit and factor IXa and suggest that inhibitor potency is determined by affinity for the A2 subunit.Table ICorrelation of IC50 values with inhibitor titer for anti-A2 inhibitorsInhibitorIC50aValues were determined from the data shown in Figure2.Titer% Neutralization by A2bValues are from Ref. 27.μmBethesda units/mgCC0.06275567FM0.11160681RJ1.58>95WD3.54.256EM116.2>95a Values were determined from the data shown in Figure2.b Values are from Ref. 27Prescott R.

Open table in a new tab In another experiment we examined the inhibitor activity of one of the more potent inhibitors, CC, with a Fab fragment derived from this IgG. The rationale for this experiment was to gain insights into inhibitor mechanism. Inhibition observed by the IgG may be steric, whereas inhibition observed with the smaller Fab fragment is consistent with blocking of a specific interactive site. The results of this analysis are also shown in Fig. 2 and indicate essentially identical inhibitory activity of the IgG and Fab fragment. This finding suggested that the A2 sequence recognized by the CC antibody may be interactive with factor IXa. In an earlier report (9Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we showed that A2 subunit resulted in a modest increase in the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXa. Furthermore, the presence of factor X markedly increased the increment for the A2-dependent increase in anisotropy. This parameter was used as an indicator for the effects of anti-A2 antibody on the interaction between A2 subunit and factor IXa. Consistent with our earlier observation, anisotropy increases (Δr) of 0.013 and 0.036 were determined for the A2-dependent effect in the absence and presence of factor X, respectively (Table II). These values were somewhat lower than those determined previously and likely resulted from the presence of nonsaturating concentrations of A2 subunit. While statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in anisotropy values obtained for factor IX plus or minus A2 in the absence of factor X (p = 0.098), the inclusion of factor X magnified the A2-dependent effect so as to yield significance between values obtained in the absence and presence of A2 subunit (p = 0.002). A2 subunit was reacted with a molar excess of either mAb 413 or human inhibitor CC (IgG and Fab forms) prior to fluorescence analysis. In each situation, the antibody appeared to essentially eliminate the A2-dependent increase in fluorescence anisotropy. The Δr values, in the absence and presence of factor X, respectively, were 0.005 and 0.007 for mAb 413, 0.003 and 0.014 for CC IgG, and 0.001 and 0.003 for CC Fab. Statistical analysis performed for reactions run in the presence of factor X showed no significant difference between the reaction containing factor IXa alone and reactions containing factor IXa plus A2 subunit run in the presence of mAb 413 (p = 0.34), CC IgG (p = 0.087), and CC Fab (p = 0.71). These results were consistent with each antibody abrogating the interaction of A2 subunit with factor IXa.Table IIFluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXaSampleaReactions were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” and contained Fl-FFR-FIXa (30 nm), PSPCPE (50 μm), and where indicated A2 subunit (300 nm), A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (150 nm), factor X (400 nm), and/or anti-A2 antibodies (500 nm).AnisotropybValues represent the mean ± S.D. for the number of determinations indicated in parentheses.−Factor X+Factor XFl-FFR-FIXa alone0.207 ± 0.007 (3)0.229 ± 0.014 (6)+ A20.220 ± 0.012 (6)0.265 ± 0.008 (3)+ A2 + Ab 4130.212 ± 0.002 (6)0.236 ± 0.007 (6)+ A2 + CC IgG0.210 ± 0.004 (4)0.243 ± 0.005 (3)+ A2 + CC Fab0.208 ± 0.006 (6)0.232 ± 0.013 (6)+ A1/A3-C1-C20.248 ± 0.011 (5)0.267 ± 0.004 (4)+ A1/A3-C1-C2 + A20.289 ± 0.003 (3)0.320 ± 0.013 (3)+ A1/A3-C1-C2 + A2 + Ab 4130.265 ± 0.008 (3)0.279 ± 0.004 (3)a Reactions were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” and contained Fl-FFR-FIXa (30 nm), PSPCPE (50 μm), and where indicated A2 subunit (300 nm), A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (150 nm), factor X (400 nm), and/or anti-A2 antibodies (500 nm).b Values represent the mean ± S.D. for the number of determinations indicated in parentheses. Open table in a new tab mAb 413 was used to further determine the effect of antibody on the contribution made by A2 subunit to Fl-FFR-factor IXa anisotropy in the presence of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. This analysis was restricted to the use of the 413 antibody because the human inhibitors show partial reactivity to factor VIIIa subunits other than A2 subunit (27Prescott R. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Scharrer I. Nilsson I.M. Humphries J.E. Hurst D. Bray G. Scandella D. Blood. 1997; 89: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer incrementally increases the fluorescence anisotropy of factor IXa in both the absence and presence of factor X ( Refs. 28O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27087-27092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholarand 29Regan L.M. O'Brien L.M. Beattie T.L. Sudhakar K. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3982-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and Table II). Inclusion of the A2 subunit to reconstitute factor VIIIa results in maximal increases in anisotropy, with Δr values of 0.041 and 0.053 in the absence and presence of factor X, respectively. Similar to the results obtained using the isolated A2 subunit, preincubation of the A2 subunit with mAb 413 prior to its addition to the A1/A3-C1-C2 markedly reduced the A2-dependent effects observed in the absence (Δr = 0.017; p = 0.041) and presence (Δr = 0.012; p = 0.0043) of factor X. The anisotropy values obtained approached those determined in the absence of A2 subunit, consistent with the antibody abrogating the contribution of A2 subunit to the factor VIIIa-like effect on the factor IXa active site. Taken together, these results suggest that anti-A2 antibodies that bind to the mAb 413 epitope specifically block the interactions of factor IXa with A2 subunit, either alone or when complexed in factor VIIIa. To further determine the role for the A2 subunit sequence 484–509 in the interaction with factor IXa, a synthetic peptide to this region was examined for its effect on the stimulation of factor IXa activity observed in the presence of A2 subunit (Fig. 3). In this experiment, the A2-containing reaction mixture was titrated with peptide prior to the addition of factors IXa and X. Subsequent determination of rates of factor Xa generation showed that the peptide inhibited the conversion of substrate in a dose-dependent manner. The extent of inhibition for a given peptide concentration was dependent upon the concentration of A2 subunit present. A comparison of two A2 subunit concentrations (70 and 200 nm) yielded IC50values of ∼90 and ∼180 μm, respectively. This result suggested that peptide directly competes with A2 subunit in binding factor IXa. Peptide-dependent inhibition did not result from inhibition of the factor IXa-factor X interaction because similar levels of inhibition were observed independent of factor X concentration (data not shown). Furthermore, two peptides that flank the 484–509 sequence (466–477 and 518–527) failed to significantly inhibit the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity over the same concentration range. Taken together, these results suggest that the sequence 484–509 contributes to the interaction between A2 subunit and factor IXa. The A2 subunit is essential for factor VIIIa activity. Functional assays have indicated that factor VIIIa can be reconstituted from A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit to yield material of similar specific activity to factor VIIIa obtained following activation of the intact cofactor (4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Fluorescence studies have shown that whereas the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit individually increase the anisotropy of a fluorophore-labeled factor IXa active site, the synergy of all three subunits is required to yield a factor VIIIa-like effect (28O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27087-27092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,29Regan L.M. O'Brien L.M. Beattie T.L. Sudhakar K. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3982-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The recent observation that isolated the A2 subunit directly increases k cat for factor Xa generation (9Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) provides a unique functional assay to dissect the mechanisms of A2 domain-specific factor VIII inhibitors in the absence of other factor VIIIa subunits. The results from this study define a primary mechanism for inhibitor antibodies as perturbing/blocking the interaction of A2 subunit with factor IXa. The basis for this observation is (i) complete inhibition of the “cofactor” activity associated with the isolated A2 subunit and (ii) abrogation of A2-dependent increases in fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXa with either isolated A2 or the A2 subunit-dependent increment of factor VIIIa. The association of factor VIIIa and factor IXa is complex and not fully understood. At least two subunits of the factor VIIIa heterotrimer have been implicated as possessing factor IXa interactive sites. The factor VIII light chain-derived A3-C1-C2 subunit likely possesses a high affinity site for factor IXa. The free light chain of factor VIII shows similar affinity for factor IXa (K d ∼14 nm) (30Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as is observed for factor VIIIa (K d ∼2–20 nm) (31Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that little if any of the binding energy for the interaction is contributed by the factor VIII heavy chain-derived subunits, A1 and A2. This interactive site was localized to the A3 domain following studies using inhibition by a monoclonal antibody with an epitope in residues 1778–1840 (30Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was further localized to within residues 1811–1818 based upon inhibition studies employing synthetic peptides (8Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that several inhibitors specific for the factor VIII light chain-derived contiguous acidic region-A3-C1 domains compete for factor IXa binding to factor VIII (33Zhong D. Saenko E.L. Felch M. Scandella D. Blood. 1998; 92: 136-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these molecules block the high affinity interaction of enzyme with cofactor. Based upon the identification of an activated protein C cleavage site at Arg-562 in the A2 subunit (19Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the capacity for factor IXa to selectively protect from cleavage at this site (34Regan L.M. Lamphear B.J. Huggins C.F. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9445-9452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a factor IXa interactive site in the A2 subunit was postulated. Synthetic peptides spanning residues 558–565 noncompetitively inhibited factor Xase activity (10Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the hemophilia A data base (35Kemball-Cook G. Tuddenham E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) revealed cross-reactive material-positive (CRM+) hemophilia resulting from mis-sense mutations at several factor VIII residues within this region. These mutations appear to alter the interaction of the A2 subunit in factor VIIIa with factor IXa (36Amano K. Sarkar R. Pemberton S. Kemball-Cook G. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 538-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the sequence spanning residues 558–565 in the A2 subunit represents a critical site for interaction between cofactor and enzyme. Inhibitor alloantibodies generated in response to therapeutic infusions of factor VIII and mAb 413 bind an epitope within residues 484–508 of the factor VIII A2 domain (18Healey J.F. Lubin I.M.

Because of this cross-reactivity, mAb 413 has been used to model mechanisms of inhibition by this class of molecules. Based on kinetic data showing that mAb 413 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of factor Xase and on steady-state fluorescence analyses, Lollar et al. (17Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) concluded that the anti-A2 antibodies inhibit factor VIIIa by blocking conversion of the intrinsic factor Xase/factor X complex to the transition state rather than by blocking formation of the enzyme/substrate complex. Anisotropy studies presented in that report showed little or no change in the factor VIIIa-dependent anisotropy of fluorescein-labeled factor IXa in response to mAb 413. However, a major decrease in anisotropy (Δr ∼0.05) was observed in the presence of factor X when the antibody was bound to factor VIIIa. Similarly, we observed an equivalent decrease in anisotropy for A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer plus A2 subunit in the presence of factor X (r = 0.320) when mAb 413 was bound to A2 (r = 0.279). The latter value is significantly greater than that for factor IXa plus factor X (r = 0.229), indicating a contribution of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer to the orientation of active site with substrate that is independent of the A2 subunit. However, in the presence of isolated A2 subunit, there is a large incremental increase in anisotropy in the presence of factor X compared with the absence of substrate (Ref. 9Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and this study). Thus, one explanation for the results obtained by Lollar and co-workers (17Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) is that mAb 413 eliminates the A2-dependent contribution to anisotropy observed in the presence of factor VIIIa. Results from the present study implicate residues 484–509 as contributing to the interaction of A2 subunit with factor IXa. Complete inhibition observed for both CC IgG and the derived Fab fragment support the importance of this epitope in the intermolecular interaction. Conversely, mAb R8B12, which recognizes a C-terminal epitope, yielded only modest (∼20%) inhibition of A2-dependent activity. This loss of activity may reflect partial steric interference in forming the A2 subunit-factor IXa complex. Inhibition studies using the 484–509 peptide yield IC50 values (∼100–200 μm) similar to theK I determined for the 558–565 peptide (∼100 μm) (10Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both regions may contribute to an extended factor IXa-interactive surface on the A2 subunit. This notion is supported by the homology model of the factor VIII A domains (37Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which shows both of the above sequences to be in close spatial proximity and on the same face of the A2 domain. In summary, inhibitor antibodies that cross-react with the epitope of mAb 413 appear to inhibit the interactions of A2 subunit with factor IXa, which contributes to the factor VIIIa-dependentk cat effect. This conclusion is based in part upon a factor Xa generation assay in which the A2 subunit is the sole factor VIIIa component present. Furthermore, use of this assay offers a means for direct identification of functionally active, anti-A2 inhibitor molecules.

A point mutation in the structural gene for a tRNA may be expected to influence protein synthesis either quantitatively or qualitatively. A strong reduction in mitochondrial protein synthesis, in particular in the proteins with a high lysine content, has been reported in the case of the 8344 mutation in the tRNALysgene of myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF). This reduction is thought to be caused by the premature termination of mitochondrial translation on lysine codons and the subsequent formation of truncated polypeptides (7Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein synthesis has also been found decreased in the case of the 3243 mutation associated with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (8Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 9King M.P. Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Therefore, the general view has emerged that mutations in tRNA genes cause mitochondrial dysfunction by lowering mitochondrial protein synthesis and, as a consequence, the amount of mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain enzymes. Indeed, mitochondrial respiration is severely reduced in these cases (7Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 9King M.P. Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, the large variation in clinical phenotypes that associate with tRNA mutations is difficult to explain solely by the lowered respiration rate. MIDD accounts for 1–2% of the diabetic population in Europe and Japan and is clinically characterized by an early middle age onset of diabetes and sensorineural hearing loss, progressive insulin secretory defect, absence of islet cell antibodies, and absence of obesity (10Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Mori Y. Tobe K. Sakuta R. Suzuki Y. Tanabe Y. Sakura H. Awata T. Goto Y. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar,11Maassen J.A. Kadowaki T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As a first step in understanding the molecular mechanisms caused by the 3243 mutation, we have established mitochondrial transformants (cybrids) carrying either the wild-type adenine or the mutant-type guanine at position 3243 but having otherwise identical mitochondrial DNA sequences (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Care was taken to ensure that all cell lines contained high and comparable mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. The mutant-type cells displayed a severe reduction of cellular respiration and respiratory chain activity, which has provided proof for the pathogenicity of the 3243 mutation in MIDD (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present work, the analysis of these cybrids has been extended toward mitochondrial tRNA and protein metabolism in order to understand better the molecular mechanisms leading from the 3243 mutation to impaired respiration and MIDD. The mitochondrial transformants (cybrids) used in this study had been generated earlier by the transfer of mitochondria from two genetically unrelated diabetes patients (V and A) into mitochondrial DNA-less Bρ°-3 cells (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Patient V displays the phenotype of maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. Patient A suffers from Alport-like syndrome, which is characterized by progressive kidney disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and maternal inheritance (13Jansen J.J. Maassen J.A. van der Woude F.J. Lemmink H.A. van den Ouweland J.M. 't Hart L.M. Smeets H.J. Bruijn J.A. Lemkes H.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1118-1124PubMed Google Scholar). Diabetes also develops after transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy with steroids but is overshadowed by the kidney disease. Therefore, MIDD and Alport-like syndrome have in common maternal inheritance, sensorineural deafness, and diabetes, with renal failure as a prominent characteristic for Alport-like syndrome. From both donors we obtained fully wild-type cybrids (W6 and W7 from patient V; W20 from patient A) as well as mutant-type cybrids (M48 and M50 from patient V; M12, M26, and M30 from patient A) (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cybrids, 143B osteosarcoma cells and Bρ°-3 cells were all cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose and 110 μg/ml pyruvate (DMEM) supplemented with 50 μg/ml uridine and 10% fetal bovine serum (complete DMEM). For long-term culturing (maximum ∼3 months), the cybrids were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% dialysed fetal calf serum to preserve a high level of mitochondrial DNA. The mitochondrial DNA copy numbers of the cybrids used were all comparable with that of 143B cells. Cybrid cells were never cultured for longer than about 3 months. After this period a fresh vial of cells from the stock, stored in liquid nitrogen, was used. The rate of oxygen consumption by ∼5 × 106 exponentially growing cells in 2 ml of complete DMEM but without glucose was measured at 37 °C using a Clark-type electrode as described (14King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg), isolated from exponentially growing cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), was subjected to electrophoresis through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes and hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 32P-labeled probes specific for the tRNALeu(UUR) gene (nucleotides 3245–3861) or the tRNAPhe gene (nucleotides 245–706), and washed with several changes of 1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42 °C (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). tRNA bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using PhosphorImager detection and ImageQuant analysis. The degree of in vivo aminoacylation of tRNAs was determined by high-resolution electrophoresis and subsequent Northern analysis as described (17Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent deacylation of tRNA during isolation, RNA was isolated under acidic conditions by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) but using 0.15 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, instead of pH 7 buffers throughout. The final RNA preparation was dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. [35S]Methionine incorporation into mitochondrially encoded proteins was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels essentially as described (18Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼5 × 105 exponentially growing cells in a 3.4-cm dish were washed twice with methionine-free DMEM and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Promix (a 2:1 mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 10 μCi/μl, 1,000 Ci/mmol) in 0.75 ml of methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialysed fetal bovine serum and emetine (100 μg/ml), which was added 15 min before the addition of label. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and finally dissolved in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples (40 μg) were analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Mitochondrial translation products were assigned according to Chomyn et al. (18Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). In the case of [3H]leucine incorporation, [35S]methionine was replaced byl-[4,5-3H]leucine (10 μCi/0.75 ml on a 3.4-cm dish; 68 Ci/mmol) in leucine-free complete DMEM. After the specified incubation period, the ∼5 × 105 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. 100-μl aliquots were immediately withdrawn in duplicate, added to 100 μl of cold 20% trichloroacetic acid, and heated for 10 min at 90 °C. The precipitate was collected on a glass fiber filter, washed, and counted as described (19Janssen G.M.C. Maassen J.A. Möller W. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 51-68Google Scholar). The significance of the differences between wild-type and mutant-type incorporation was estimated by linear regression analysis using SPSS 7.0 software (Chicago). The protein degradation rate of individual mitochondrial proteins was estimated from pulse-chase experiments (20Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For pulse values, ∼5 × 105 cells (pretreated with chloramphenicol) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with Promix and the reversible cytoplasmic protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (200 μg/ml) instead of emetine and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. For chase values, the pulsed cells were washed with complete DMEM instead of phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently cultured for 48 h in complete DMEM with two daily changes of medium. The decay rate constant, λ, was calculated from λ = −(2.3 log(n/n 0))/t, where t = 2880 min and n 0 andn denote the amount of 35S in an individual protein band following pulse and chase, respectively. Autoradiograms were digitalized and processed using a GDS8000 gel analysis system (Ultra Violet Products, Lambridge) for that purpose. Statistical analysis of the decay data was performed using Student's ttest (SPSS version 7.0). Western blotting was performed essentially as described (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular protein was separated on a 15% SDS gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). Subsequently, the proteins were specifically visualized using monoclonal antibodies against cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II, and IV (Molecular Probes) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Bitotech). Immunoprecipitates (22Kessler S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) were prepared by a 16-h incubation at 0 °C of mitochondria-enriched fractions (35 μg) (20Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with monoclonal antibody (2 μg) and protein G-Sepharose (10 μl) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The beads were washed twice with the same buffer and twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and were then suspended in SDS sample buffer. The composition of the eluted proteins was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Stable mitochondrial transformants containing wild-type or mutant-type mitochondrial DNA have been generated and characterized earlier (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cybrids were cultured on selective media to obtain and preserve high and comparable mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. Mutant-type cybrids displayed an ∼5-fold reduced rate of respiration (Fig.1) and a 79–98% reduction of individual respiratory chain enzymes (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that the level of tRNALeu(UUR) in the mutant-type cells was reduced to ∼25% of the level found in wild-type cybrids or the parental 143B cells, whereas the amount of tRNAPhe remained constant within this set of cybrids (Fig.2 A). The relative ratio of tRNALeu(UUR) to tRNAPhe was estimated to be 0.19 ± 0.05 for the mutant-type and 0.80 ± 0.12 for the wild-type cybrids. Furthermore, there was no change observed in the level of mature ND1, 12 S, and 16 S rRNA transcripts. “RNA19” however, which represents an unspliced transcript encompassing 16 S rRNA, tRNALeu(UUR), and the ND1 mRNA, was increased in the mutant-type cells (not shown) comparable with the results previously described for the MELAS 3243 cybrids (9King M.P. Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 3243 mutation also affects the degree of aminoacylation of tRNALeu(UUR), we examined the ratio of mitochondrial leucyl-tRNALeu(UUR) and non-acylated tRNALeu(UUR) in wild-type versusmutant-type cybrids. RNA was isolated under acidic conditions to prevent deacylation and analyzed on an acidic urea gel followed by Northern blotting (17Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because aminoacylation results in a lowered mobility of most tRNAs, this method allows the resolution and quantitation of both forms. The in vivo degree of aminoacylation of tRNALeu(UUR) was found to be reduced from ∼75% leucylation in wild-type cells to ∼40% in all of the mutant-type cybrids (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, tRNALys showed a more constant level of ∼80% aminoacylation in both types of cells. Therefore, when taking into account the reduced steady state level of tRNALeu(UUR), the amount of aminoacylated leucyl-tRNALeu(UUR) available for mitochondrial protein synthesis is very low in mutant-type cells and is estimated to be ∼15% of the wild-type level. Because all mitochondrial mRNAs contain a number of UUR codons, it may be expected that a low level of leucyl-tRNALeu(UUR) would reduce the rate of mitochondrial translation, at least when leucyl-tRNALeu(UUR) is a limiting factor for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Therefore, we estimated the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis by measuring the incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein in the presence of the cytoplasmic protein synthesis inhibitor, emetine. Unexpectedly, we did not observe a severe decrease in the rate of [35S]methionine incorporation into mitochondrially encoded proteins (Fig. 3, left panel). Rather, the overall rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis of most of the mutant-type cybrids (4 of 5) was very comparable with that of the wild-type cybrids. The MERRF cybrid, which was included as a control, did show a sharp decrease in mitochondrial translation (Fig. 3 , right panel) (7Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We did not find in our cybrids a correlation between labeling intensity of a particular protein and the number of UUR codons in its respective mRNA (cf. Ref. 7Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the synthesis of ATPase subunits, especially ATPase 8, was strongly enhanced in mutant-type cybrids (Fig.3, left panel). Furthermore, mutant cells displayed four additional, but weakly 35S-labeled protein bands (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 3, left panel), which may represent degradation products of the mutant mitochondrial proteins. The cybrids originating from the MIDD patient were indistinguishable from that of the patient with Alport-like syndrome, with the exception of M12, which showed a ∼50% reduction of protein synthesis rate. Because the rate of translation does not seem to be seriously diminished in most cybrids, the 3243 mutation may possibly affect the accuracy of mitochondrial protein synthesis by inducing the incorporation of amino acids other than leucine at UUR codons. Therefore, we measured the rate of [3H]leucine incorporation into mitochondrial protein as a first estimate of the degree of misincorporation at UUR codons of the mitochondrial mRNAs. [3H]Leucine incorporation was measured at various cell densities because we have noticed that the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis depends on cell density, probably reflecting a gradual shutdown of protein synthesis as soon as the cells become more confluent. Because the mitochondrial genome contains two leucyl-tRNA genes with UUR as the minor codon for leucine (89 UUR codons versus 553 for CUN), the maximal difference between wild-type and mutant-type cybrids is expected to be in the order 15–20%, at least when complete misincorporation occurs at UUR codons. [3H]Leucine incorporation was indeed slightly (∼15%), but significantly (p < 0.01) lower in mutant-typeversus wild-type cells at all of the cell densities analyzed (Fig. 4). Therefore, the misincorporation of amino acids at UUR codons seems indicated. The rate of mitochondrial protein degradation was estimated from pulse-chase experiments (20Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After pretreatment with chloramphenicol to stabilize the mitochondrial proteins after removal of the drug (20Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cybrids were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine in the presence of the reversible cytoplasmic protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The decay of 35S during the 48-h period following labeling was subsequently determined for individual protein bands. The stability of mitochondrially encoded proteins was found to be slightly but significantly (p < 0.01) lower in the mutantversus wild-type cybrids (Fig.5). Furthermore, the decay rates of individual mitochondrial proteins are in a remarkably close range, suggesting that mitochondrial protein turnover be coordinately regulated. Western blot analysis revealed a decreased steady state level of the mitochondrially encoded proteins cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II, whereas that of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV and elongation factor EF-Tu were both found to be comparable in mutantversus wild-type cybrids (Fig.6). As may be expected, the mitochondrially encoded proteins were not present in the mitochondrial DNA-less Bρ°-3 cells. Thus, the specific reduction of mitochondrially encoded proteins seems to reflect the increased rate of protein degradation. The total gene content of the mitochondrion, 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA, and 13 protein-coding genes, is completely involved in the synthesis of components for oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, any mutation in mitochondrial DNA may be expected to affect mitochondrial respiration in the first instance. Indeed, in the case of most pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations, respiration is reduced in near-homoplasmic mutant cells, independent of the nature of mitochondrial DNA mutation. The clinical phenotype related to these mutations, however, varies strongly. For instance, MERRF, which is caused by a mutation in the tRNALys gene, is a severe neuromuscular disease with a low life expectancy, whereas MIDD with the tRNALeu mutation presents as a milder disorder. Furthermore, the same mitochondrial DNA mutation can even produce distinct clinical phenotypes in different individuals (6Grossman L.I. Shoubridge E.A. Bioassays. 1996; 18: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The latter is especially evident for the 3243 mutation in the tRNALeu gene, which may lead to MIDD, Alport-like syndrome, MELAS, or chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This difference in pathogenesis may best be explained by assuming the involvement of additional nuclear or mitochondrial factors that determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the 3243 mutation over the different tissues and thereby determine the organ most affected. Because tRNA also seems to be involved in processes other than translation (23Lanker S. Bushman J.L. Hinnebush A.G. Trachsel H. Mueller P.P. Cell. 1992; 70: 647-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it cannot be ruled out that the mutated tRNA gene product exerts its effect instead via other processes. We have generated distinct clonal cell lines carrying the 3243 mutation from patients with MIDD and Alport-like syndrome in a near-homoplasmic form. The mitochondrial genome from the patient with MIDD has been extensively sequenced with the only heteroplasmic nucleotide found at position 3243 (3Van den Ouweland J.M.W. Lemkes H.H.P.J. Ruitenbeek W. Sandkuijl L.A. de Vijlder M.F. Struijvenberg P.A.A. van de Kamp J.J.P. Maassen J.A. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be assumed that upon mitochondria-mediated transformation the only difference between wild-type and mutant-type cybrids is the A-to-G transition at position 3243. Contrary to reports on cybrids from MERRF and MELAS patients (7Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar,8Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 18Chomyn A. Meola G.

A. 1996; 93: 8300-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), our mutant-type cybrids show a serious deficiency in cellular respiration without a strong decrease in the rate of protein synthesis. The same applies for our mutant-type cybrids derived from Alport-like syndrome and also for some of the 3243 cybrids isolated in Dr. H. Jacobs' laboratory (University of Tampere). 2H. Jacobs, personal communication. In this context it should be mentioned that another panel of cybrids with low copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA often displayed a serious decrease of mitochondrial protein synthesis (25van den Ouweland J.M.W. A New Subtype of Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus Is Associated with a Mitochondrial Gene Mutation. Ph.D. thesis. Leiden University, 1994Google Scholar). Therefore, we took great care to ensure that all cell lines contained a high and comparable amount of mitochondrial DNA (12van den Ouweland J.M.W. Maechler P. Wolheim C.B. Attardi G. Maassen J.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because we have generated cybrids with severe mitochondrial dysfunction without a strong decrease in protein synthesis rate, it is evident that a decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis is not a necessary prerequisite for mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, our findings call into doubt the belief that a decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis is a necessary prerequisite for loss of respiration and induction of pathogenesis. Our data suggest rather that the 3243 mutation reduces the stability of the mitochondrially encoded proteins, which may be due to misincorporated amino acids at UUR codons of the mitochondrial mRNAs (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a similar mechanism has been proposed to occur in SV40 transformed B-cells containing ∼70% 3243 mutant mitochondrial DNA (26Flier A. Reichmann H. Seibel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27189-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Finally, it is important to mention that our cybrids did not contain a suppressor mutation in the anti-codon of the tRNALeu(CUN) gene as found recently by Jacobs and co-workers (27El Meziane A. Lehtinen S.K. Hance N. Nijtmans L.G.J. Dunbar D. Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The low level of tRNALeu(UUR) itself may be explained by enhanced susceptibility for degradation as a result of decreased affinity toward its natural partners, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, EF-Tu, or the ribosome. In this context, it has been postulated that a tRNA is never free but is always bound to one of these three partners (28Negrutskii B.S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because RNA19 is elevated, it cannot be ruled out that the synthesis of the mutated tRNALeu(UUR) is impaired at the processing level (29Rossmanith W. Karwan R.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 443: 269-274Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been suggested in MERRF disease that a relative level of ∼40% Lys-tRNALys is sufficiently low to reduce the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins in MERRF cybrids (7Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, with a level of ∼15% Leu-tRNALeu(UUR), we did not find such dramatic behavior, even though the absolute levels of tRNALeu(UUR) and tRNALys are quite comparable in wild-type cells (30King M.P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10228-10237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But how should the low level of leucyl-tRNALeu(UUR) be reconciled with the high rate of protein synthesis? With the assumption of an elongation rate of 20 amino acids/s/ribosome (31Kennel D. Riezman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which corresponds to an average transit time of 50 ms at each codon, the synthesis of a complete protein of 500 amino acids will require 25 s (500 × 50ms). The ∼6-fold decrease in leucyl-tRNALeu(UUR) may diminish the rate of elongation at UUR at most by a factor of 6 but probably by less (32Ogilvie A. Huschka U. Kersten W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 565: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the transit time at UUR will rise to 300 ms at the most. Theoretically, the time to synthesize the complete protein, containing on average 10 UUR codons, would be elevated to (490 × 50 ms) + (10 × 300 ms) = 27.5 s, which corresponds to a 10% reduction of the rate of protein synthesis at the most. The 3243 mutation induces enhanced degradation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Figs. 5 and 6). Although we have not directly shown that the primary sequence of these proteins is different at the UUR-encoded leucine residues in mutant-type cells, two independently obtained results both demonstrate the decreased stability of these proteins, which at least strongly suggests an alteration of their primary structure. The pulse-chase experiments directly revealed an elevated degradation rate (Fig. 5), whereas the same may also be inferred from the low steady state levels (Fig. 6) in the absence of a strong decrease of de novo protein synthesis (Figs. 3, 4, and 6). Direct sequencing of isolated mitochondrial proteins will provide evidence as to whether alterations in the primary structure are indeed involved in the pathogenesis of MIDD.

Attardi (California Institute of Technology) for his kind gift of MERRF cybrids and polyclonal anti-CO II antibody, Dr J.

Walsh P.J. Wright P.A. Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 33-50Google Scholar). CPSase III, found in invertebrates and some fish, differs from CPSase I by the fact that it can utilize glutamine as the nitrogen-donating substrate (6Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. Wright P.A. Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 33-50Google Scholar). In liver of the two species of teleost fishes where expression of ureotelism has been well documented, CPSase III is localized exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix, as occurs in ureotelic terrestrial vertebrates, but in contrast to ureotelic terrestrial vertebrates, GSase is also localized entirely or partially in the mitochondria (7Anderson P.M.

These observations prompted us to examine muscle as a site for urea cycle activity in the tilapia. Lake Magadi tilapia (O. a. grahami) were captured by seine net from Fish Springs Lagoon in Lake Magadi, Kenya in February 1997. Following a 20-min transport time to an on-site laboratory, fish were anesthetized in metomidate, and tissues were rapidly dissected. For studies of urea cycle enzymes, tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, transported to North America in a dry shipper, and kept at −70 °C until use. Extracts for measuring units/gram of tissue of urea cycle enzymes in frozen samples (Table I) were prepared and assayed as described previously (7Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. J. Exp.

Muscle tissue (0.6 g) stored at −80 °C was homogenized with 2.5 ml of 0.1 mHepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 15% glycerol, sonicated, and centrifuged as described previously (13Kong H. Edberg D.D. Salo W.L. Wright P.A. Anderson P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The supernatant was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (0.8 × 25 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer used to prepare extract and eluted at 4 °C in 1.2-ml fractions. The peak of enzyme activity (in three or four fractions) was pooled and used for the kinetic studies. The molecular size of the CPSase was estimated by comparison of the elution volume with the elution volumes of cyanase and alcohol dehydrogenase (molecular weights of 170,000 and 150,000, respectively), which had been added to the extract before placing on the column. Kinetic studies of the CPSase III (Table III) were conducted on enzyme from muscle extracts that had been partially purified as noted above. The reaction mixtures contained 10 mm glutamine or 10 mm NH4Cl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ATP, 5 mm[14 C]HCO3− (1 × 106 cpm), 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, and 0.8 mm AGA where indicated.K m and V max values were determined by measuring rates at different concentrations of ATP (5 mm excess MgCl2), AGA, NH4Cl, or glutamine, respectively, and fitting the data to the Lineweaver-Burk equation for double-reciprocal plots of rate versusconcentration with weighting to the fourth power; correlation coefficients were >0.97.

For sequencing, the protein bands were blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the N-terminal sequence of the tilapia muscle band with the same mobility as rat CPSase I was determined by the Mayo Protein Core Facility (Rochester, MN). The sequence of the CPSase III cDNA was determined following previously described procedures for RNA isolation (from tilapia muscle), cDNA synthesis, analysis and isolation of PCR products, strategy for obtaining CPSase III-specific cDNA segments by PCR using consensus primers and sequence analysis of these segments, the strategy for sequencing the remainder of the CPSase III cDNA by primer walking, and sequence analysis (12Korte J.J.

Numbering of amino acid residues of the deduced CPSase III amino acid sequence begins with the initial methionine residue of the entire translated product,i.e. including the mitochondrial targeting sequence. As shown in Table I, all five urea cycle enzymes are present in both liver and muscle, but except for arginase the levels are higher in muscle; this is particularly true for CPSase III, which appears to be rate-limiting on the basis of maximal activity. The levels of activity in muscle are surprisingly high, comparable with the levels of these enzymes in liver of ureoosmotic elasmobranchs (18Casey C.A. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8449-8453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ureogenic teleost gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) (7Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. J. Exp.

Liver and muscle represent ≈2 and 60% of total mass, respectively, 2P. J. Walsh, unpublished data. so the total units of CPSase III in muscle are ≈130 times that of liver. The rate of urea excretion in tilapia has been reported to be about 0.07 μmol/min/g of fish (3Randall D.J. Wood C.M. Perry S.F. Bergman H. Maloiy G.M.O. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Wood C.M. Perry S.F. Wright P.A. Bergman H.L. Randall D.J. Respir.

Assuming saturating concentrations of substrate for CPSase III, this rate can be readily sustained by the level of either ammonia- or glutamine-dependent CPSase III (≈0.11 μmol/min/g of fish), but the level of CPSase III in liver (<0.001 μmol/min/g of fish) is not nearly sufficient to account for this rate of urea excretion. GSase γ-glutamyltransferase activity is present in liver, but there is very little in muscle where high levels of CPSase III are localized (Table I). In addition, the GSase in liver is localized in the cytosol (Table II), analogous to largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) where the liver mitochondrial glutamine-dependent CPSase III appears to have little or no function (13Kong H. Edberg D.D. Salo W.L. Wright P.A. Anderson P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since GSase biosynthetic activity is ≈5% of the transferase activity (7Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 755-766PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shankar R.A. Anderson P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the biosynthetic GSase activity in liver and muscle together (≈0.02 μmol/min/g of fish) is not sufficient to support urea synthesis if urea-related carbamoyl phosphate formation required glutamine. Based on these results, we examined the properties of tilapia CPSase III to determine its ability to use ammonia directly as nitrogen-donating substrate. The general kinetic properties of the muscle CPSase III are summarized in TableIII. In other type III CPSases: 1) theV max with ammonia as substrate is 10% or less than the V max with glutamine as substrate, 2) AGA under normal assay conditions is required for activity, 3) the binding of glutamine and AGA are synergistic (i.e. as the concentration of one is increased, the K m for the other decreases), and 4) the K m for glutamine is 0.1–0.2 mm (21Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12228-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Casey C.A. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8723-8732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, for the tilapia CPSase III assayed with 20 mm MgATP: 1) theV max with ammonia as substrate is greater than the V max with glutamine, 2) AGA is not required for activity with either ammonia or glutamine as nitrogen-donating substrate and the presence of AGA increasesV max only slightly, 3) AGA does not affect the apparent K m for glutamine (or ammonia), and 4) theK m for glutamine is quite high. Similar results are obtained at 1 mm MgATP, except that theK m for ammonia in the absence of AGA is lower (1.8 mm). The K m values of 2–5 mm for ammonia are comparable with those observed for the ammonia-dependent activity of other type III (21Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12228-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Casey C.A. Anderson P.M. J. Biol.

Marked sigmoid kinetics (nonlinear double-reciprocal plots of rate versus MgATP concentration) are observed when AGA is absent (half-maximal rate obtained at 0.7 mm MgATP), but hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten kinetics (linear double reciprocal plots of rate versus MgATP concentration) with glutamine (K m = 0.2 mm) as substrate or greatly reduced sigmoid kinetics with ammonia (half-maximal rate obtained at 0.2 mm) as substrate are observed when AGA is saturating. Other properties of the tilapia CPSase III include: activities with glutamine and ammonia are not additive as is observed for the ammonia- and glutamine-dependent CPSase activities in liver extracts from an Indian catfish (Heteroptneustes fossilis) (24Saha N. Dkhar J. Ratha B.K. Anderson P.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 116B: 57-63Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which has invited speculation that CPSase I and CPSase III activities may both be present in H. fossilis; like all other CPSases, K+ is required for activity (K m = 0.01 m); pH optimum is 7.8; K m for AGA is <0.01 mm; activity is not inhibited by UTP, a negative allosteric effector for the pyrimidine pathway-related CPSase II (6Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. Wright P.A. Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 33-50Google Scholar); asparagine cannot replace glutamine as substrate. When subjected to gel filtration chromatography, CPSase activity eluted between alcohol dehydrogenase and cyanase, corresponding to a maximum molecular weight of ≈160,000. This estimated value is typical of all type I and type III CPSases (6Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. Wright P.A. Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 33-50Google Scholar) and is in close agreement with the molecular weight of 160,760 calculated from the amino acid sequence (without the mitochondrial leader sequence), indicating that the CPSase III exists as a monomer under the described gel filtration chromatography conditions. The amino acid sequence of the tilapia CPSase III is homologous to other CPSases, e.g. 86, 71, and 50% identity with CPSase III from largemouth bass (13Kong H. Edberg D.D. Salo W.L. Wright P.A. Anderson P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), CPSase I from rat (25Nyunoya H. Broglie K.E. Widgren E.E. Lusty C.J. J. Biol.

The sequence has the same domain structure as other CPSases and the same highly conserved histidine residues that have been shown to have an important mechanistic function (6Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. Wright P.A. Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 33-50Google Scholar). The open reading frame codes for 1,535 amino acid residues, the first 37 of which correspond to an expected mitochondrial signal sequence which, when removed, would yield a mature protein with the N-terminal sequence FSVKTQTAHL; the sequence also has the expected cysteine residues required for activity with glutamine (Cys-298) and binding of AGA (Cys-1352 and Cys-1362) (6Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. Wright P.A. Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 33-50Google Scholar). CPSase III from shark and smallmouth bass have turnover rates of ≈0.2 μmol/min/mg of protein at 26 °C with glutamine as substrate (21Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12228-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Casey C.A. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8723-8732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the turnover rate of the tilapia CPSase III is similar, the presence of 0.2 unit of activity/g of muscle would correspond to ≈1 mg of CPSase/g of muscle, which should be detectable in crude extracts by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, a protein band with the same mobility as rat CPSase I can be readily detected in tilapia, but not in trout, which has very little CPSase III activity (12Korte J.J. Salo W.L. Cabrera V.M. Wright P.A. Felskie A.K. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6270-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The identity of this band as CPSase III was confirmed by showing that the sequence of the first 10 amino acid residues of the protein in this protein band was identical to the N-terminal sequence predicted for the mature protein after removal of the mitochondrial signal sequence as noted above, which also indicates that the enzyme is probably localized in the mitochondria. When aliquots of fractions obtained after gel filtration chromatography were subjected to SDS-PAGE, the intensity of this protein band correlated exactly with the units of CPSase III activity. Quantitation of the intensities of the two bands (rat CPSase I and tilapia CPSase III) indicated that there is at least 0.7 mg of CPSase III/g of tilapia muscle if staining of the tilapia CPSase III is the same as rat CPSase I. As noted in Table II, liver arginase, which catalyzes the last step of the urea cycle pathway and the subcellular localization of which is quite variable in teleosts (2Anderson P.M. Wood C.M.

V., Amsterdam1991: 43-76Google Scholar), appears to be localized predominantly in the cytosol in this tilapia. The level of glutaminase, which is localized in the mitochondria as expected, is significantly higher (≈20 times) than in O. beta, which appears to utilize glutamine as substrate for the liver mitochondrial CPSase III (7Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 755-766PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first report of the presence of all five urea cycle enzymes in muscle of fish or muscle of any species. The high levels of all urea cycle enzymes in tilapia muscle reported here identify muscle as the likely major site for urea formation in this fish. This finding highlights the possible significance of recent reports of low levels of CPSase III and ornithine carbamoyltransferase activities in muscle of several other species of fish (12Korte J.J.

The properties of the tilapia CPSase III differ from other type III CPSases, most notably by the facts that the enzyme has substantial activity in the absence of AGA and that ammonia appears to be as good a nitrogen-donating substrate as glutamine. The latter would be consistent with the very low level of GSase activity in muscle and insufficient levels in liver to provide glutamine for the CPSase III in muscle. Thus, adaptation may also include kinetic changes that favor ammonia as the primary substrate. At the observed urea excretion rate, a 100-g tilapia fish would require ≈25 mg of CPSase III/g of liver if CPSase III was located only in liver. CPSase I in liver of ureotelic mammalian species accounts for ≈25% of the total protein in the mitochondrial matrix and this is equivalent to only 5 mg of CPSase I/g of liver (28Raijman L. Jones M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). If the CPSase III is located in the muscle, however, then the 50 mg CPSase III would be distributed in 60 g of tissue, or about 0.8 mg/g of muscle, close to the value reported here. We speculate that it may be impossible to achieve the observed high rate of urea excretion by packaging the required amount of urea cycle enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix of the small liver in this species. Because these fish require a laterally compressed body plan for efficient swimming, it is unlikely that additional ureogenesis through increased liver mass could be accommodated by the visceral cavity. Thus, it appears that adaptation to ureogenesis in this species includes a change in organ localization of the urea cycle enzymes. We thank S. Powers-Lee for the gift of purified rat CPSase I."

Further investigations revealed that SOCS-3, a growth hormone-inducible negative regulator of cytokine signaling to STAT5b, abolished the STAT5b inhibitory response.

STATs are activated by multiple cytokines and peptide hormones via receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases by a process that involves tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerization of the SH2 domain-containing STAT proteins, followed by STAT translocation to the nucleus, binding to the specific DNA enhancer elements, and activation of target gene expression (1Darnell Jr., J.E.

Two closely related STAT forms, STAT5a and STAT5b, share striking amino acid sequence homology (∼90% identity) and can be activated by the same set of hormones and cytokines, which includes GH, prolactin, interleukins 2, 3, and 5, and erythropoietin (2Davey H.W.

PPARs form high affinity DNA-binding complexes with the heterodimerization partner RXR, which facilitates their binding to specific PPAR response elements upstream of target genes. Mammalian PPARs include three subtypes (α, γ, and δ), which are characterized by unique functions, ligand specificities, and tissue distributions (10Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). A wide variety of structurally distinct PPAR ligands have been identified. These include certain environmental chemicals, fibrate hypolipidemic drugs, fatty acids, and eicosanoids for PPARα; anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 prostaglandin J2 for PPARγ; and the fatty acid-like compound L631033 for PPARδ (11Forman B.M.

This diverse spectrum of PPAR ligands suggests that these receptors mediate a wide variety of biological functions. Although the function of PPARδ is unknown, PPARα and PPARγ regulate diverse biological processes, including lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis (13Gonzalez F.J.

Extensive investigations have advanced our understanding of JAK/STAT and PPAR signaling pathways. However, the extent to which these two pathways interact remains unclear. The observation that hypophysectomy enhances hepatic peroxisome proliferation in female rats (16Sugiyama H. Yamada J. Suga T. Biochem.

GH and prolactin are two major pituitary hormones that directly activate JAK-STAT signaling pathways (18Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J.

GH treatment suppresses expression in rat liver in vivo of certain peroxisome proliferator-inducible liver P450 genes (19Sundseth S.S. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1994; 315: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that activation of STAT5b signaling by either GH or prolactin inhibits, by up to 80%, PPARα-dependent reporter gene transcription stimulated by both endogenous and foreign chemical peroxisome proliferators (22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This inhibition required both GH receptor (GHR) and STAT5b and was not seen with STAT1, a second GH-activated STAT. STAT5b-PPARα complexes could not be detected by anti-STAT5b supershift analysis of PPARα-DNA complexes, suggesting that the mechanism that underlies this inhibitory cross-talk between STAT5b and PPARα is distinct from the cross-talk between STAT5 and glucocorticoid receptor, where protein-protein complexes form (23Cella N.

In the present study, we investigate the mechanism that underlies the inhibitory cross-talk between JAK/STAT and PPAR signaling pathways. We report that GH-activated STAT5b inhibits the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, PPARδ, and T3R in addition to PPARα and that the GH-dependent inhibition of PPARα-stimulated gene transcription is blocked by co-expression of SOCS3, a GH-inducible inhibitor (25Adams T.E.

Renilla luciferase expression plasmid pRL-CMV was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). STAT5a1*6 and STAT5b1*6 cDNAs were excised from the corresponding pMX-puro-STAT5–1*6 plasmids, provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura (University of Tokyo) (38Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L.

The STAT5 reporter plasmid 4X-pT109-Luc, which contains four copies of a STAT5 response element from the rat ntcp gene (39Ganguly T.C. O'Brien M.L. Karpen S.J. Hyde J.F. Suchy F.J. Vore M. J. Clin.

COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of COS-1 cells grown in 48-well tissue culture plates was carried out using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; catalog number 1814443). FuGENE 6 (0.5 μl) was used for each well in 48-well plates. 24 h after addition of the DNA-FuGENE 6 mixture to the cells, the medium was changed to nonserum Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium. PPAR activators (e.g. Wy-14,643 at 1–20 μm) were then added to the culture medium in combination with GH at concentrations specified in the figure legends. Cell were lysed 24 h later, and firefly luciferase andRenilla luciferase activity were measured using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI; catalog number E1910). CAT activity was determined by thin layer chromatographic analysis of the incorporation of [14 C]chloramphenicol (NEN Life Science Products) into acetyl CoA. CAT activity was normalized to the protein concentration of each extract. Transfections were performed using the following amounts of plasmid DNA/well (0.75 cm2) of a 48-well tissue culture plate: 90 ng of pHD(X3)Luc, 5 ng of PPARα, PPARγ, or PPARδ, 5 ng of pM-GAL4BD-hPPARα (1–92) and its corresponding serine to alanine mutants, 50 ng of 4X-pT109-Luc, 50 ng of STAT5b, 2 ng of JAK2, 50 ng of GHR, 200 ng of STAT5b1*6 or STAT5a1*6, 125 ng of SOCS or CIS, 50 ng of RXRα, 5 ng of GAL4-PPARα (167–468), 50 ng of (UAS)5-tk-CAT, 50–100 ng of P300, 10 ng of SRC-1, 1 ng of pRL-CMV, 50 ng of TRβ, and 90 ng of TRE-CAT. EMSA analysis using probes for STAT5 and PPAR DNA binding activity was performed as described previously (22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, whole cell lysates from transfected COS-1 cells were subjected to 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed using STAT5b-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-835), as described elsewhere (22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). GH-activated STAT5b inhibits PPARα-dependent gene transcription by ∼80% when evaluated in a reporter gene trans-activation assay (22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether this inhibition is specific to PPARα, we examined the other two mammalian PPAR forms, PPARγ and PPARδ, as well as T3R, all of which belong to family NR1 of the nuclear receptor superfamily (40Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). GH signaling and PPAR or T3R transcriptional activation pathways were reconstituted in COS-1 cells by co-transfection of key components: GHR, JAK2 kinase, and STAT5b for GH signal transduction; PPARγ or PPARδ and the reporter plasmid pHD(X3)Luc for PPAR signaling; and T3R and the reporter plasmid TRE-CAT for thyroid hormone signaling. The transfected COS-1 cells were stimulated for 24 h with the nuclear receptor form-specific ligands troglitazone (1 μm), L631033 (5 μm) or T3 (74 nm) to activate PPARγ, PPARδ, and T3R, respectively, either in the presence or the absence of GH. Fig.1 shows that activation of PPARγ, PPARδ, and T3R transcriptional activity by the respective ligand of each receptor is substantially decreased in the presence of GH. The extent of STAT5b inhibition of these three nuclear receptors is similar to that seen previously for PPARα (80% inhibition for PPARα (22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) compared with 89, 60, and 73% inhibition for PPARγ, PPARδ, and T3R, respectively). This finding suggests that these nuclear receptors share a common target for STAT5b inhibition. PPAR and other nuclear receptors contain a central DNA-binding domain and a COOH-terminal ligand-binding domain that displays ligand-dependent trans-activation activity, termed AF-2. The hydrophobicity of this region is conserved in all nuclear receptors, and mutational analysis suggests that AF-2 contains an interaction surface for coactivators, such as SRC-1 (41Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT5b exerts its inhibitory effect on nuclear receptor activity by inhibiting the COOH-terminal AF-2 region, we evaluated the effect of STAT5b on the chimeric receptor GAL4-PPARα (167–468), where the COOH-terminal region of mouse PPARα (amino acids 167–468) is fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (33Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Activation of this chimeric receptor by peroxisome proliferators was monitored in transfected COS-1 cells using the reporter gene (UAS)5-tk-CAT, which contains five copies of the DNA response element of GAL4 upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter driving a CAT reporter gene. Stimulation of the cells with the PPARα activator and potent peroxisome proliferator Wy-14,643 strongly activated the GAL4-PPARα chimera; however, GH-activated STAT5b failed to inhibit receptor activity (Fig. 2). Thus, the presence of the COOH-terminal AF-2trans-activation/ligand-binding domain of PPARα is not sufficient for STAT5b to inhibit receptor activity, suggesting that STAT5b does not directly target this region of PPARα. A ligand-independent trans-activation domain, designated AF-1, has recently been identified within the NH2-terminal 92 amino acids (A/B region) of PPARα (29Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether GH-activated STAT5b can inhibit the AF-1 function of PPARα, which was assayed using a fusion construct linking the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the first 92 amino acids of hPPARα, designated GAL4-PPARα (1–92). Fig.3 A shows that the AF-1 region of hPPARα exhibits strong ligand-independent transcriptional activity (vehicle control versus GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone; compare the first two bars), in agreement with recent studies by Meier and co-workers (29Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, GH activation of STAT5b inhibited this trans-activation activity in a dose-dependent manner. The extent of inhibition, ∼80%, is consistent with the extent of STAT5b inhibition of full-length PPARα that we reported previously (22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Serine residues 12 and 21 within the AF-1 region of PPARα have been identified as targets of MAP kinase, and phosphorylation ofboth of these serines is required for insulin stimulation of PPARα activity (29Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To examine whether these serines participate in STAT5b inhibition of the AF-1 activity of PPARα, we tested the corresponding serine to alanine mutants of the GAL4-PPARα (1–92) chimera. Fig. 3 (B and C) show that mutation of these serine residues does not prevent STAT5b inhibition, indicating that the GH-dependent inhibition of the AF-1 activity of PPARα does not involve changes in the phosphorylation of these residues. The observation that GH-activated STAT5b inhibits activation of all three PPAR isoforms as well as T3R suggests that STAT5b may compete with a common regulatory factor of the PPARs, perhaps a nuclear receptor coactivator (42Chen J.D. Li H. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 169-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This possibility is further supported by our identification of PPARα's AF-1 region, which in the case of PPARγ interacts with coactivators (43Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 44Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), as a target of STAT5b. P300 and SRC-1 are widely expressed nuclear receptor coactivators that interact directly with PPARα (45Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). P300 can interact with both the AF-1 and AF-2 regions of PPAR (44Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and can also coactivate STAT5 (46Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether these coactivators become limiting for PPARα transcriptional activity in cells that simultaneously signal via STAT5b, we examined the effects of P300 and SRC overexpression on the STAT5b-dependent inhibition of PPARα activity. Fig. 4 Ashows that cotransfection of P300 or SRC-1 substantially enhances both basal and Wy-14,643-inducible PPARα activity. This confirms that P300 and SRC-1 can both coactivate PPARα and indicates that their endogenous expression levels in transfected COS-1 cells are indeed limiting. Fig. 4 B shows, however, that overexpression of these coactivators does not block the GH-induced inhibition of PPARα activity. Therefore, STAT5b does not inhibit PPARα by competing for the limiting endogenous P300 or SRC-1. Of note, STAT5b expression alone, in the absence of GH treatment, reversed the stimulation of PPARα activity by co-expressed P300 or SRC-1; whereas P300 and SRC-1 alone enhanced Wy-14,643-stimulated PPARα activity by 5- and 8-fold, respectively (Fig. 4 A), these enhancing effects were abolished in cells cotransfected with GHR, JAK2, and STAT5b but not treated with GH (cf. data points on y axis of Fig. 4 B). This result is consistent with the report that P300 directly interacts with the trans-activation domain of STAT5 (46Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may be explained by STAT5b competing with PPARα for the transfected P300 and perhaps also SRC-1. We next investigated whether PPARα DNA binding activity is affected by STAT5b activation. Fig. 5 A shows that Wy-14,643 stimulation of PPARα leads to a 3.3-fold increase in PPARα DNA binding activity, assayed by EMSA using a PPRE probe derived from the rabbit CYP4A6 gene (lane 2 versus lane 1). In the absence of GHR, JAK2, and STAT5b, GH had no effect on Wy-14,643-induced PPARα DNA-binding (Fig. 5 B,lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2). In contrast, under conditions where GHR, JAK2, and STAT5b are cotransfected with PPARα, GH treatment led to a small (∼25%) decrease in the abundance of the PPARα-DNA binding complex (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2). Because the DNA binding activity of PPARα is obligatorily dependent on the presence of its heterodimerization partner RXRα (47Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M.

This effect is prevented by molecules that react directly with peroxynitrite such as dithiothreitol, cysteine, glutathione, methionine, tryptophan, and uric acid but not by scavengers of superoxide (superoxide dismutase), hydroxyl radical (Me2SO, mannitol), and hydrogen peroxide (catalase). Assuming simple competition kinetics between peroxynitrite scavengers and the enzyme, a second-order rate constant of 3.4 × 104m−1s−1 at 25 °C and pH 7.4 was estimated. The peroxynitrite-induced loss of enzyme activity was accompanied by a concentration-dependent oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups. Peroxynitrite-modified tryptophan hydroxylase was resistant to reduction by arsenite, borohydride, and dithiothreitol, suggesting that sulfhydryls were oxidized beyond sulfenic acid. Peroxynitrite also caused the nitration of tyrosyl residues in tryptophan hydroxylase, with a maximal modification of 3.8 tyrosines/monomer. Sodium bicarbonate protected tryptophan hydroxylase from peroxynitrite-induced inactivation and lessened the extent of sulfhydryl oxidation while causing a 2-fold increase in tyrosine nitration. Tetranitromethane, which oxidizes sulfhydryls at pH 6 or 8, but which nitrates tyrosyl residues at pH 8 only, inhibited tryptophan hydroxylase equally at either pH. Acetylation of tyrosyl residues withN-acetylimidazole did not alter tryptophan hydroxylase activity. These data suggest that peroxynitrite inactivates tryptophan hydroxylase via sulfhydryl oxidation.

The physiological roles for serotonin are diverse and include modulation of sleep, thermoregulation, and food intake (1Whitaker-Azmitia P.M. Peroutka S.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 600: 1-715Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). From a clinical perspective, alterations in serotonin function have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicide (2Paul S.M. J. Clin. Psychiat. 1990; 51: 1-70Google Scholar). Alterations in TPH activity produce corresponding changes in the synaptic levels of serotonin (3Gartside S.E. Cowen P.J. Sharp T. Psychopharmacology. 1992; 109: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that TPH can have influences on serotonin neurochemical function that extend well beyond its role in fulfilling the first step in serotonin synthesis from tryptophan. Drugs that cause long term changes in TPH activity could well change serotonin synaptic function to the detriment of normal physiological and behavioral function. For example, the neurotoxic amphetamines methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “Ecstasy”) significantly reduce TPH activity and serotonin levels (4Gibb J.W. Johnson M. Elayan I. Lim H.K. Matsuda L. Hanson G.R. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1997; 173: 128-145PubMed Google Scholar). Long term abuse of these drugs produces behavioral and psychiatric conditions indicative of diminished serotonin function (5McCann U.D. Ridenour A. Shaham Y. Ricaurte G.A.

Because the effects of these drugs include permanent neuronal damage in humans (7McCann U.D. Szabo Z. Scheffel U. Dannals R.F. Ricaurte G.A.

Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in a variety of toxic neuronal effects, including those associated with methamphetamine and MDMA (9Zheng Y. Laverty R.

Apart from exerting direct effects of its own, NO reacts with other radical species such as superoxide to produce the peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−; see Ref. 14Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). This possibility is also relevant to the neurotoxic amphetamines because their damaging effects on neurons can involve the superoxide radical (15Acikgoz O. Gonenc S. Kayatekin B.M. Uysal N.

ONOO− may be more toxic to cells and proteins than either of its precursors NO and superoxide radical, and ONOO− has been implicated in neuronal toxicity (18Reist M. Marshall K.A. Jenner P.

TPH is a member of the monooxygenase superfamily of enzymes that includes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylalanine hydroxylase (26Grennet H.E. Ledley F.D. Reed L.L. Woo S.L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It was shown recently that the dopamine neurotoxin MPTP inactivates TH via an ONOO−-mediated nitration of enzyme tyrosyl residues (27Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R.

We report presently that ONOO− inactivates TPH and causes the nitration of enzyme tyrosyl residues. However, in contradiction to the effect of ONOO− on TH (27Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B.

Both wild-type enzyme and a deletional mutant constituting the catalytic domain of TPH (amino acids 99–444) were expressed in BL-21 (Escherichia coli) cells. The catalytic core of TPH retains the essential catalytic properties of the wild-type enzyme and has proved useful in mechanistic studies of the catalytic properties of the enzyme (13Kuhn D.M.

Cells transformed with the plasmid bearing the TPH cDNA were grown overnight at 37 °C and induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were washed with 10% glycerol and resuspended in 0.1 volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After sonication and centrifugation (40,000 × g) to sediment insoluble material, the supernatants were adsorbed on GSH-agarose for 60 min at 4 °C. Affinity beads with immobilized TPH were washed three times with 50 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, and TPH was removed from the glutathione S-transferase fusion tag by digestion of bead-bound protein with thrombin protease (10 units of protease/mg of protein) at room temperature for 2 h. The cleaved TPH protein was separated from GSH affinity beads by filtration through glass wool. TPH activity was assayed by measuring the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan from tryptophan as described previously (13Kuhn D.M. Arthur Jr., R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Kuhn D.M. Arthur R. States J.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2220-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The levels of protein were measured by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). ONOO− was prepared fresh daily from acidified nitrite and hydrogen peroxide as described by Beckmanet al. (32Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The ONOO− concentration was measured as an increase in absorbance at 302 nm (ε302 = 1700 m−1 cm−1). ONOO− solutions were chromatographed over small columns of granular manganese dioxide to remove hydrogen peroxide contamination. The removal of the peroxide was confirmed by assay of chromatographed ONOO− preparations for hydrogen peroxide by the method of Matsubara et al. (33Matsubara C. Nishikawa Y. Yoshida Y. Takamura K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Enzyme preparations were exposed to ONOO− in the presence of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 100 μm DTPA for 15 min at 25 °C. ONOO− was added to enzyme preparations as a small volume bolus with a Hamilton syringe during vigorous mixing. After exposure to ONOO−, enzyme solutions were diluted 5-fold with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Residual TPH activity was immediately determined. The pH of all enzyme solutions was checked carefully to ensure that the alkaline ONOO− did not cause it to vary above 7.4 during exposure. Agents tested for the ability to protect TPH from the effects ONOO− (see below) were added 5 min prior to ONOO− and remained present throughout exposure. Controls for ONOO− addition to enzyme solutions included 1.2 n NaOH or ONOO−preparations allowed to decompose at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Decomposition of ONOO−was monitored as decreases in absorbance at 302 nm. The reactivity of sulfhydryl groups in TPH was determined by titration with DTNB by the method of Ellman (34Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Riddles et al. (35Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 91: 49-60Crossref Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). TPH was treated with varying concentrations of ONOO− as described above, and after dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, protein (5–7 μm) was denatured with 6 mguanidine HCl and reacted with DTNB (200 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 90 min. The reaction was monitored as an increase in absorbance at 412 nm. The concentration of sulfhydryl groups was calculated using ε412 = 13,700m−1 cm−1 (35Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 91: 49-60Crossref Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). TPH was treated with varying concentrations of ONOO−, and after dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, proteins were exposed to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting to nitrocellulose (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Nitrated tyrosines were detected with the use of a 3-nitrotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution). The presence of nitrotyrosines in TPH was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. As controls, blots of ONOO−-modified TPH were treated with 100 mm dithionite to reduce nitrotyrosines to aminotyrosines (37Ye Y.Z. Strong M. Huang Z.Q. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 201-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or TPH preparations treated with decomposed ONOO− were tested for immunoreactivity with the nitrotyrosine antibody. The extent of tyrosine nitration was also measured spectrophotometrically as increases in absorbance at 430 nm (ε430 = 4400 m−1cm−1) as described by Crow and Ischiropoulos (38Crow J.P. Ischiropoulos H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 185-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TPH was exposed to varying concentrations of tetranitromethane (in ethanol) at either pH 6 or pH 8. TPH was diluted into the appropriate buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer for pH 6 or 8 conditions), and tetranitromethane was added and allowed to react with the protein for 15 min at 30 °C. Enzyme samples were diluted 5-fold with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and assayed for residual activity at pH 7.4 as described. Tetranitromethane-modified tryptophan hydroxylase was also tested for sulfhydryl oxidation or for tyrosine nitration as described above. TPH was treated with dopamine-quinone (39Kuhn D.M. Arthur Jr., R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7111-7117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or NO (11Kuhn D.M. Arthur Jr., R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1071-1077Google Scholar, 12Kuhn D.M. Arthur Jr., R.E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as described previously. In some experiments, the tyrosine-acetylating reagent N-acetylimidazole was tested for effects on TPH activity. The oxidation state of sulfhydryl groups in ONOO−-treated TPH was determined as described by Radiet al. (40Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic core deletion mutant of recombinant TPH was treated with ONOO−, and the results are presented in Fig.1. TPH was tested at concentrations of 0.625, 1.25, 5, and 10 μm over the same concentration range of ONOO−. The data show that TPH is inactivated by ONOO− in a manner that depends on the concentrations of both reactants. The IC50 for inhibition of enzyme activity was approximately 15 or 200 μm ONOO− when the enzyme concentration was 0.625 or 10 μm, respectively. Decomposed ONOO− did not have an effect on TPH activity. Full-length TPH was also tested for its response to ONOO− and did not differ from the catalytic core deletion mutant (data not shown). The main effect of ONOO−concentration was significant for each enzyme concentration (p < 0.01, ANOVA). Because the catalytic core form of TPH retains the essential catalytic properties of native TPH (13Kuhn D.M. Arthur Jr., R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kuhn D.M. Arthur R. States J.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2220-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), all subsequent experiments used this recombinant enzyme preparation. Various reagents were tested for the ability to prevent ONOO−-induced inactivation of TPH, and the results are presented in Table I. It can be seen that reagents that react directly with ONOO−, such as DTT, cysteine, GSH, methionine, tryptophan, and uric acid, provided significant protection of the enzyme from inactivation. The hydroxyl radical scavenger Me2SO, the superoxide radical scavenger superoxide dismutase, and the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase did not protect TPH from ONOO−-induced inactivation (Table I). None of the reagents tested for protection had effects on TPH activity in the absence of ONOO−.Table IProtection of TPH from ONOO−-induced inactivationConditionInitial TPH activity%Control100 ± 4ONOO− (100 μm)34.8 ± 6+ DTT (2 mm)91.0 ± 5aStatistically significant protection against ONOO−-induced inactivation (Student's t test,p < 0.05).+ Cysteine (5 mm)90.0 ± 3aStatistically significant protection against ONOO−-induced inactivation (Student's t test,p < 0.05).+ GSH (1 mm)95.2 ± 3aStatistically significant protection against ONOO−-induced inactivation (Student's t test,p < 0.05).+ Methionine (20 mm)89.7 ± 6aStatistically significant protection against ONOO−-induced inactivation (Student's t test,p < 0.05).+ Tryptophan (5 mm)86.1 ± 5aStatistically significant protection against ONOO−-induced inactivation (Student's t test,p < 0.05).+ Uric acid (1 mm)54.3 ± 2aStatistically significant protection against ONOO−-induced inactivation (Student's t test,p < 0.05).+ Me2SO (50 mm)24.0 ± 4+ SOD (100 units/ml)36.2 ± 5+ Catalase (10 units/ml)30.6 ± 4TPH (1.25 μm) was incubated with ONOO− for 15 min at 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab TPH (1.25 μm) was incubated with ONOO− for 15 min at 25 °C. Agents tested for protection were added 5 min prior to ONOO−. Enzyme samples were diluted 5-fold with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and assayed for residual catalytic activity. None of the reagents tested for protection had an effect on TPH activity in the absence of ONOO−. By modeling simple competition kinetics for the protection of various proteins from ONOO− by different concentrations of GSH and methionine (41Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 354-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TPH was tested for inhibition by ONOO− in the presence of varying concentrations of GSH and methionine, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The present calculations assumed rate constants of k = 740m−1 s−1 for GSH (42Koppenol W.H. Pryor W.A. Moreno J.J. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) andk = 150 m−1 s−1for methionine (43Pryor W.A. Jin X. Squadrito G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11173-11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), at 25 °C and pH 7.4. Increasing concentrations of both GSH and methionine provided increasing levels of protection of TPH from inactivation by ONOO−. It was estimated that the rate constant of the ONOO− reaction with TPH was 3.4 × 104m−1 s−1. TPH (5–7 μm) was treated with the same concentration range of ONOO− shown to inactivate catalytic activity, and the effects on sulfhydryl reactivity were determined by titration with DTBN under denaturing conditions. The data in Fig.3 show that ONOO− caused a concentration-dependent loss of sulfhydryls from TPH that paralleled the loss of catalytic activity. Untreated TPH contained nine titratable sulfhydryl groups per monomer, consistent with predictions from the nucleotide sequence of the catalytic core deletional mutant (44Darmon M.C. Guibert B. Leviel V. Ehret M. Maitre M. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of ONOO− resulted in the progressive loss of reactive sulfhydryl groups such that at a concentration of 0.1 mm ONOO−, the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups was reduced to 2.6 mol/mol TPH subunit. ONOO− concentrations of 200–500 μm caused the complete loss of DTNB-reactive sulfhydryl groups from the treated enzyme and completely inactivated catalytic activity. These results are consistent with ONOO− being a strong sulfhydryl oxidant and confirm that TPH is very sensitive to inactivation by sulfhydryl oxidation (45Kuhn D.M. Ruskin B. Lovenberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4137-4143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidation status of TPH sulfhydryl groups after ONOO− treatment was tested by reacting the modified enzyme with sodium arsenite, sodium borohydride, and DTT. Borohydride and DTT reduce disulfides, and arsenite reduces sulfenic acids to the RSH (40Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Table II show that ONOO−-modified sulfhydryl groups in TPH were resistant to reduction by DTT, borohydride, and arsenite and suggest that ONOO− is oxidizing enzyme sulfhydryl groups beyond sulfenic acid.Table IIReduction of ONOO−-oxidized TPH sulfhydryls with arsenite, borohydride, and DTTConditionControl+ ONOO−sulfhydryls/monomersulfhydryls/monomerNone8.8 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.3NaAsO49.1 ± 0.51.12 ± 0.1NaBH48.9 ± 0.41.34 ± 0.2DTT8.9 ± 0.52.05 ± 0.4TPH (5 μm) was treated with 0.2 mmONOO− in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm DTPA for 15 min at 25 °C. Immediately following ONOO− treatment, TPH was incubated with 37 mm sodium arsenite, 26 mm sodium borohydride, or 10 mm DTT for 45 min at 37 °C as described by Radi et al. (40Radi R. Beckman J.S.

Samples were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min at room temperature and then assayed for sulfhydryl content. Data represent the means ± S.E. for four independent experiments carried out in duplicate. TPH was treated with the same concentration range of ONOO− shown to inactivate catalytic activity (Fig. 1), and the effects on tyrosine nitration are presented in Fig.4. The data show that ONOO−causes a concentration-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration. At a cumulative concentration of 2 mm, ONOO− caused the nitration of approximately 3.8 tyrosyl residues/TPH monomer. The IC50 concentration of ONOO− for inhibition of enzyme activity (15 μm) resulted in the nitration of approximately 0.2 tyrosyl residues/TPH monomer. The concentration of ONOO−that completely inactivated TPH activity (500 μm) caused the nitration of 2 tyrosyl residues/TPH monomer. TPH modified by ONOO− was also examined for nitration by reaction with a monoclonal antibody against 3-nitrotyrosine, and the results are presented in the inset of Fig. 4. The results agree with the spectrophotometric studies and show that nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity was increased in a concentration-dependent manner by ONOO−. Immunoreactivity on blots was restricted to the 40-kDa TPH band. Evidence of higher molecular weight species was not observed, suggesting that the formation of dityrosines in TPH after ONOO− treatment was not occurring. The specificity of the nitrotyrosine antibody was tested by incubating blots of nitrated TPH with dithionite to reduce nitrotyrosines to aminotyrosines prior to antibody addition. As predicted (37Ye Y.Z. Strong M. Huang Z.Q. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 201-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the antibody no longer recognized ONOO−-treated TPH (data not shown). The nitrotyrosine antibody was also unreactive with TPH treated with decomposed ONOO− (data not shown). Agents shown to prevent ONOO−-induced inactivation of enzyme catalytic activity (Table I) were also tested for their effects on tyrosine nitration. It was observed that each protective reagent prevented tyrosine nitration. Finally, Me2SO, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, which did not protect TPH from ONOO−-induced inactivation, were without effect on the ONOO−-induced nitration of tyrosines in TPH (data not shown). Carbon dioxide reacts rapidly with ONOO− to produce the nitrosoperoxocarboxylate (ONOOCO2−) adduct (46Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol.

SIV gp120 and gp32 play an equivalent role to that of gp120 and gp41 in the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), which has a structure and biological properties very similar to SIV (1Bosch M.L.

During the entry of the virus into the target cell, gp120 is known to bind to CD4 that serves as a primary receptor for the virus on a target membrane surface (4Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C.

Members of the chemokine receptor family are also known to be necessary to facilitate the entry of the virus (6Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Brader C.C. Feng Y. Murphy P.M. Berger E.

Thus consistent with this model, direct interactions have been demonstrated between gp120-CD4 complexes and specific chemokine receptors (8Trkola A. Paxton W.A. Monard S.P. Hoxie J.A.

The binding of gp120 to CD4 appears to induce major conformational changes of the gp120 complex that leads to the exposure of the gp32 N-terminal fusogenic domain in the case of SIV or gp41 in the case of HIV (2Kowalski M.

Cell. 1987; 50: 327-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Exposure of this structure therefore, is thought to facilitate the fusion of the juxtaposed viral and plasma membranes and leads to intracellular infection. Membrane fusion, therefore, is one of the key events during viral infection and is thought to facilitate the incorporation of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm of host cell. Many studies using model membranes, such as liposomes and synthetic peptides corresponding to the fusion regions of enveloped virus proteins, have revealed the essential role of the secondary structure and the orientation of the peptides when inserted in a lipid bilayer (for a review see Ref. 10Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The data presently available suggest that the HIV/SIV fusion peptide assumes extended and disordered forms in the non-fusogenic state and transforms into an α-helix as it penetrates into the target cell membrane as a prelude to or actually during the fusion process. There are strong indications that unique oblique orientations of the viral fusion peptides modify the average orientation of phospholipid acyl chains, giving rise either to inverted lipid phases or to intermediates in membrane destabilization and lipid mixing (11Martin I. Schaal H. Scheid A. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 298-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Colotto A. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Sen A. Hui W. Epand R.M.

Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3089-3111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although a lot of information on the correlation of the viral synthetic fusion peptides lytic and fusogenic activity with the peptide secondary structure is available (see e.g. Ref. 10Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), detailed studies on the nature of the sequence of specific interactions of fusion peptides with simple phospholipid membranes are still lacking. Thus information relating to the initial interactions of fusion peptides with membranes may shed more light on the fusion process itself. Many membrane binding assays of viral peptides involve radio derivatives or their conjugation to a chromophoric indicator (15Lüneberg J. Martin I. Nußler F. Ruysschaert J.-M. Herrmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27606-27614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol.

In the former case no kinetic data are accessible, and inevitably, elements of doubt exist in the latter case that such chemical modification may interfere with the interaction of the peptide with the membrane surface. It has been established, however, that localization of fluorescent probes such as fluorescein phosphatidylethanolamine (FPE) at the membrane surface offers the possibility of measuring, in real time, the interactions of peptides or proteins with membranes in a virtually non-invasive manner (18Wall J. Golding C. van Venn M. O'Shea P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Golding C. Senior S. Wilson M.T. O'Shea P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10931-10937Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, we report studies of fusion peptide-membrane interactions approached by a utilization of this novel fluorescence technique. The technique involves labeling membranes with very small amounts (<1 mol%) of FPE which is sensitive to the membrane surface electrostatic potential (ψs). Changes in ψs caused by the net addition or removal of charged species induce a corresponding increase or decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the probe. This simple but highly sensitive technique allows determination of the time evolution of the binding of such peptides to membranes, but additional interactions such as conformational changes of the peptides may also be identified (18Wall J. Golding C. van Venn M. O'Shea P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Golding C. Senior S. Wilson M.T. O'Shea P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10931-10937Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whereas the present study is directed toward simple membrane systems, the additional virtue of the FPE-based technique is that it facilitates almost identical experiments with lymphocytes (20Wall J. Ayoub F. O'Shea P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have shown recently (21Cladera J. O'Shea P. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2434-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) that peptide-membrane interactions can be affected by variations of the membrane dipole potential. This is a relatively recently understood membrane property that is generated by the presence of electrical dipoles on the phospholipid molecules and the presence of orientated water molecules at the membrane-water interface (22Brockman H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Following a dual-wavelength fluorescence method, it has been shown that the potential sensitive dye di-8-ANEPPS can be used to measure changes in the dipole potential produced by dipolar compounds, such as phloretin or ketocholestanol, interacting with the membrane (23Gross E. Bedlack R.S. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 208-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Clarke R.J. Kane D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Clarke R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1327: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and to monitor the peptide membrane interaction and its effect and dependence on the magnitude of the dipole potential (21Cladera J. O'Shea P. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2434-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A number of complications are evident with studies of the free fusion peptides as opposed to whole viral particles. It is known that the SIV fusion peptides, which sequence is highly hydrophobic, are very insoluble in water and not even totally soluble in Me2SO, according the spectroscopic data reported by Martin et al. (26Martin I. Dubois M.C. Defrise-Quertain F. Saermark T. Burny A. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is a situation very different from that of the fusion peptides on the virus, where for example in the case of HIV the fusion peptide constitutes just the N terminus of the gp41 protein, which is attached to the rest of the virus and seems to form trimeric complexes (27Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to try to assess the influence of the aggregation state of the fusion peptide in the Me2SO suspension on the interaction of the peptide with the lipidic membranes and take into account the existence of peptide-peptide interactions in addition to the lipid-peptide interactions. In recent years, the use of the dye thioflavin T (ThT) for the study of the fibrillogenesis process triggered by the β-amyloid peptide of Alzheimer's disease (28Castaño E.M. Prelli F. Wisniewski T. Golabeck A. Kumar R.A. Soto C. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) has opened the possibility of using such dyes to study other aggregation-disaggregation processes. In the present study, membrane systems with well defined lipid compositions were used in an attempt to characterize the sequence of interactions of the membrane binding and insertion of the simian viral fusion peptide. The synthetic peptide corresponding to the 12-residue N-terminal region of SIV- gp32 (NH2-Gly-Val-Phe-Val-Leu-Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-Phe-Leu-Ala) was added to the lipid membrane of specified phospholipid compositions (50 mol % PC and 50 mol % PE), and their interactions were followed using the FPE-, ThT-, and di-8-ANEPPS-based techniques (18Wall J. Golding C. van Venn M. O'Shea P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A number of factors such as peptide concentration and lipid composition, variation of the dipole potential, and peptide aggregation were investigated. The implications of these studies for the biological activity of the immunodeficiency virus are discussed. Egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and thioflavin T (ThT) were purchased from Sigma. FPE was synthesized as described previously according to Wall et al. (18Wall J. Golding C. van Venn M. O'Shea P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 1-(3-Sulfonatopropyl)-4-[β[2-(di-n-octylamino)-6-naphthyl]vinyl] pyridinium betaine (di-8-ANEPPS) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified synthetic peptides prepared with the C terminus in amide form were purchased from Quality Controlled Biochemical, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). Stock solutions of these peptides were made up in Me2SO, typically at a concentration of 4 mg ml−1. Phospholipids dissolved in chloroform, di-8-ANEPPS (when required), and the appropriate additive (6-ketocholestanol or phloretin in methanol) were mixed in a round bottom flask, and the solution was dried under a stream of nitrogen to deposit a thin lipid film on the inside of a glass tube. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by hydrating the dried lipid film with the sucrose buffer (280 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5), then repeatedly freezing and thawing the suspension 5 times, and finally extruding it 10 times through two polycarbonate filters of pore size 0.1 μm (Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, CA) using an extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc., Vancouver, Canada) according to the extrusion procedure of Mayer et al. (29Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). LUVs were labeled exclusively in the outer bilayer leaflet with FPE as described by Wallet al. (18Wall J. Golding C. van Venn M. O'Shea P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, LUVs were incubated with FPE dissolved in ethanol (never more than 0.1% of the total aqueous volume) at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. Any remaining unincorporated FPE was removed by gel filtration on a PD10 Sephadex column equilibrated with the appropriate buffer. Such a procedure leads to the incorporation of 30–50% of the externally added FPE to the preformed LUV. Furthermore, there was no observed transmembrane “flipping” of the FPE, at least over time scales of 1 week, FPE-liposomes were stored at 4 °C until use. Fluorescence time courses were obtained by adding the desired amount of peptide to 2-ml lipid suspensions (200 μm lipid) on an SLM-Aminco model spectrofluorimeter. For FPE experiments excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 490 and 518 nm, respectively. Dual wavelength recordings with the dye di-8-ANEPPS were obtained by exciting the samples at two different wavelength (460 and 520 nm) and measuring their emission intensity ratio, R(460/520), at 580 nm (21Cladera J. O'Shea P. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2434-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Gross E. Bedlack R.S. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 208-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Assessment of peptide aggregation was determined using thioflavin T at a dye concentration of 35 μm in the fluorescence cuvette containing buffer or a membrane suspension (200 μmlipid). Typically, spectroscopic data were downloaded in ASCII file format and analyzed with the aid of commercial data analysis packages such as EasyplotTM by Stuart Karon copyright by Spiral Software & MIT (for Windows NT 32-bit (version 4) published by Cherwell Scientific), e.g. both the FPE and ThT fluorescence time courses were found to be best described by double exponential processes according to Equation 1.observed signal=A1e−k1t+A2e−k2t+offsetEq. 1 where A 1 and A 2are the amplitudes, and k 1 andk 2 are the rate constants of the biexponential process. The contribution of light scattering to the fluorescence signals was corrected by recordings made with vesicles without the respective fluorescence dyes at the same vesicle concentration and subtracting from the traces obtained with the dye present. Lipid mixing was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity change resulting from the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two probes, NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE, inserted into the lipid bilayer as described by Struck et al. (30Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was monitored by using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter with excitation and emission slits at 4 nm. Probes were added to the lipid film, and membrane vesicles were prepared as described above. Liposomes containing both probes at 0.6% (molar ratio) each were mixed with probe-free liposomes at 1/9 molar ratio at a final lipid concentration of 300 μm. The initial fluorescence at the 1/9 (labeled/unlabeled) suspension was taken as 0% fluorescence, and the 100% fluorescence was determined by using an equivalent concentration of vesicles prepared with 0.06% fluorescent phospholipid each. The suspensions were excited at 470 nm, and any NBD fluorescence resulting from FRET was recorded at 530 nm. Phospholipid vesicles (with 15 mol % phloretin or 6-ketocholestanol when required) were prepared as described previously (21Cladera J. O'Shea P. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2434-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), using D2O-based media containing 280 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pD 7.5. 300 μl of liquid suspension containing SIVwt 100 μm (9 μl SIVwt 3.3 mm in Me2SO added to 291 μl of PC/PE vesicles 2 mm) were placed in a SeZn plate (SpectraTech contact sampler, HATR) for attenuated total reflectance (ATR) data acquisition. ATR infrared spectra were acquired on a Nicolet 410 or 710 spectrometer equipped with an MTC detector, working at an instrumental resolution of 2 cm−1. Typically, a total of 1000 scans were averaged at room temperature, apodized with a triangle function, and Fourier-transformed. To obtain the pure spectra of the protein, spectra of the solvent were collected under identical conditions, and subtractions were done with the computer. Residual water vapor bands were also subtracted using a water vapor spectrum. Following the addition of SIVwt to FPE-labeled PC/PE vesicles, a significant increase of the fluorescence occurred, indicating the interaction of the fusion peptide with the membrane surface, as shown in Fig.1. SIVwt was manufactured in its amide form and is composed of uncharged amino acids; the only charge existing at pH 7.5 on the peptide is that arising from the positive N terminus. An increase of the fluorescence of the FPE-labeled vesicles is consistent with the increased electropositive surface potential caused by the binding of the positively charged peptide to the membrane surface. The incremental phase of the trace shown in Fig. 1 was found to fit a double exponential process (Equation 1), and the calculated rate constants are reported in TableI.Table ISummary of the rates of membrane interaction of the SIV peptideRate constants k 1 andk 2 (s−1)FPE measurementsThT measurementsdi-8ANEPPS measurements 0.4/0.04 0.4/0.040.34/0.02Rate constants are derived from fitting of data in Figs. 1 (FPE measurements), 3 (ThT measurements), and 5A (di-8-ANEPPS measurements) to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures” section). Open table in a new tab Rate constants are derived from fitting of data in Figs. 1 (FPE measurements), 3 (ThT measurements), and 5A (di-8-ANEPPS measurements) to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures” section). In contrast with several other peptides we have studied (e.g. Refs. 19Golding C. Senior S. Wilson M.T. O'Shea P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10931-10937Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Cladera J. O'Shea P. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2434-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Wolfe C. Cladera J. O'Shea P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1998; 15: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), no slow fluorescence decrease (following the initial increase) indicating insertion of the positive charge into the membrane was observed for SIVwt. The positively charged N terminus must remain at the membrane surface but does not preclude the possibility of a more remote segment (i.e. with no net charge) of the peptide penetrating the lipidic bilayer as reported for other such amphipathic peptides. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the titration of PC/PE vesicles with the SIVwt peptide. An interesting observation from attempts to determine the dose-response characteristics was the fact that above 30 μm for PC/PE membranes, it was not possible to acquire more experimental points as above such concentrations significant peptide aggregation takes place. The results shown in Fig. 1 clearly indicate that SIVwt interacts with the membrane surface of PC/PE vesicles. The aggregation observed above the critical concentration described directed our attention to the aggregation state of the peptide. SIVwt is highly hydrophobic, relatively insoluble in water, and even forms soluble aggregates in Me2SO (the infrared spectrum indicates β-sheet structure typical of protein aggregates), according to the structural data reported in Martin et al. (26Martin I. Dubois M.C. Defrise-Quertain F. Saermark T. Burny A. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When added to the vesicle suspensions, these peptide aggregates present in the Me2SO solution have to partition between the aqueous medium and the membranes. To try to obtain some information about the evolution of the peptide aggregates when they interact with the membranes we used the fluorescent dye thioflavin T (ThT) as an indicator of soluble and colloidal peptide aggregates. It is worth emphasizing that the addition of Me2SO had virtually no effect on the fluorescence originating from FPE. This indicates that given the nature of Me2SO, there appears to be no significant interaction between the solvent and the various membrane moieties. Thioflavin T has been shown to indicate the presence of β-amyloid peptide aggregates (i.e. so-called fibril formation) (28Castaño E.M. Prelli F. Wisniewski T. Golabeck A. Kumar R.A. Soto C. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The dye appears to intercalate within the β-sheet type secondary structure of the aggregates, and this interaction causes an increase of its fluorescence. Fig. 2 shows how the fluorescence of ThT dissolved in aqueous buffer changed when different amounts of SIVwt were added into the buffer from a Me2SO solution. The addition of the peptide was always followed by a very fast fluorescence increase, the magnitude of which increased with the peptide concentration. This fluorescence increase results from the very fast interaction of ThT with the peptide aggregates. Up to SIVwt 5 μm after the initial increase the fluorescence remains stable. At peptide concentration of 10 μm or higher, however, a fluorescence decrease follows the initial increase. The higher the peptide concentration, the faster the decrease and the noisier became the signal. The noisiest part of the traces corresponds to the formation of huge aggregates which, as was the case for Fig. 1(inset), are clearly visible by the naked eye and are buoyant. In Fig. 3, the ThT fluorescence time evolution when 10 μm SIV was added to a PC/PE vesicle suspension (200 μm lipid) is shown. The most striking feature is that in the presence of vesicles, after the initial fluorescence increase, the fluorescence decays in an exponential fashion, reaches a stable final level without the formation of large aggregates. Some care must be employed, however, for as shown in Fig. 4if the concentration of peptide is increased beyond 30 μm(at a constant lipid concentration) then aggregation dominates the behavior of the peptide.Figure 4A, ATR-FTIR spectrum of SIVwt peptide (100 μm) mixed 50 mol % PC, 50 mol % PE membranes (2 mm lipid). B, ThT fluorescence variation after adding 100 μm SIV wt to a 2 mm lipid, PC/PE vesicle suspension (trace 1), and 10 μm SIVwt to a 200 μm lipid, PC/PE suspension (trace 2). ThT was 35 μm. Temperature was 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ThT fluorescence decay in the presence of membranes was found to fit a double exponential rate equation (Equation 1), as reported in Table I. The two rate constants are found to be very similar to those calculated for the binding of the peptide to the membrane surface (Fig.1 and Table I). It is interesting to note the fact that after the initial fast fluorescence increase the fluorescence decreases to the same level of fluorescence prior to the peptide addition (Fig. 3). Since the ThT fluorescence reflects the degree of aggregation of the peptide, it can be deduced from Fig. 3 that in the presence of PC/PE membranes the peptide dis-aggregates completely. Previous structural studies with SIVwt or similar peptides (HIV fusion peptides) have shown, however, that a significant amount of aggregated β-structure is detected when the peptides are mixed with vesicles (11Martin I. Schaal H. Scheid A. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 298-"

Trypanosomes alternate between the invertebrate vector (Glossina, or tsetse fly) and the mammalian host, and the different life cycle stages are uniquely adapted to survive in each host. In the mammalian bloodstream form of the parasite, 107 identical variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)1 molecules are expressed on the plasma membrane, forming a dense coat. The parasite can survive the immune attack of its host because it undergoes antigenic variation, a process in which its surface coat is replaced by another composed of an antigenically different VSG molecule (1Vickerman K. J. Cell Sci. 1969; 5: 163-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). When the trypanosome is ingested by the tsetse fly and differentiates into a procylic form, the VSG coat is totally replaced by one composed of an array of different proteins, known as procyclins (3Richardson J.P.

Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The Trypanosoma brucei procyclins, present in about 2.2 × 106 copies/cell, have very unusual structures, with the C-terminal domain consisting of amino acid repeats. One set of proteins, the EP isoforms, is predicted to contain between 22–30 Glu-Pro (EP) repeats, whereas the GPEET form, in contrast, has six Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Thr (GPEET) repeats followed by three EP repeats (see Fig. 1 A for a schematic diagram of procyclin structures and Fig. 1 B for their amino acid sequences). Unlike VSG, procyclin is encoded by a small number of different genes, and therefore it has only a limited potential for variation. In the T. brucei 427 strain, the EP isoforms are encoded by the EP1 (4Mowatt M.R. Clayton C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Rudenko G. Le Blancq S.

All procyclin genes are contained in four expression sites (per diploid genome), and each site contains two procyclin genes in a tandem array (see map in Fig. 1 C). Transcription of these genes is polycistronic and can occur simultaneously from two or more expression sites (reviewed in Ref.12Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Butikofer P. Mol. Biochem.

Some EP forms can be N-glycosylated with the products of the EP1 and EP3 genes, but not that of the EP2 gene, containing a site forN-glycan addition (i.e. Asn29; Fig.1 B). GPEET-procyclin also has no N-glycosylation site. The N-glycan is Man5GlcNAc2, and it is unusual in that it does not exhibit microheterogeneity (13Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, all of the procyclin proteins have GPI anchors of unusual structure, characterized by a very large (average of 30 sugar residues), heterogeneous branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine side chain (13Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Ferguson M.A.J. Murray P. Rutherford H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This side chain serves as the sialic acid acceptor for the cell surface trans-sialidase (16Pontes de Carvalho L.C. Tomlinson S. Vandekerckhove F. Bienen E.J. Clarkson A.B. Jiang M.-S. Hart G.W. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Engstler M. Reuter G. Schauer R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The anchors on EP- and GPEET-procyclin are similar or identical in structure (13Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additionally, GPEET-procyclin is modified by phosphorylation on six out of seven threonine residues in the repeat sequence (18Butikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Mehlert A. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Butikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this modification has not been reported for the EP forms. The function of any of the procyclins is still unclear, although recently it was demonstrated that mutant parasites that express no EP isoforms cannot establish heavy infections in tsetse fly midguts (21Ruepp S. Furger A. Kurath U. Renggli C.K. Hemphill A. Brun R. Roditi I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the wild type phenotype was partially rescued after overexpression of either nonglycosylated or glycosylated EP isoforms (21Ruepp S. Furger A. Kurath U. Renggli C.K. Hemphill A. Brun R. Roditi I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both EP- and GPEET-procyclin are co-expressed on the parasite surface, although their ratio varies in different clones. When some of these clones are maintained in culture for several months, there is a shift in expression, from EP- to GPEET-procyclin, ending with cells containing low levels of EP proteins (13Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Butikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In elucidating the function of procyclin molecules, it is of great interest to determine whether all of the different EP-procyclin genes are expressed as proteins and to determine the relative levels of expression. It is also important to establish whether this expression varies with time or under different experimental conditions. Such variation could have considerable biological relevance. For example, a programmed variation of procyclin expression could control the behavior of the parasite in its insect vector. Although the EP and GPEET forms can be detected by monoclonal antibodies (20Butikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to date it has not been possible to analyze or resolve the protein products of the different EP-procyclin genes, because of their very similar amino acid sequences (Fig. 1 B) in addition to the extreme heterogeneity in their GPI anchor. In this paper, we report a complete characterization of the EP-procyclin repertoire by mass spectrometry, revealing most of the species predicted from gene sequences. To apply this technique, it was necessary to remove the GPI anchor by treatment with aqueous hydrofluoric acid (aq.HF), a well characterized method that has a minimal effect on the polypeptide chain and glycosidic bonds. This method was previously used in a mass spectrometric analysis of the phosphorylation of purified GPEET-procyclin (19Mehlert A. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, to fully characterize these molecules it was also essential to develop a new method involving mild acid hydrolysis that selectively cleaves theEP1 and EP3 (but not EP2) gene products at Asp-Pro sequences. Using this methodology, we were able to identify by mass spectrometry all of the procyclin polypeptides present in a T. brucei 427 strain as well as to obtain new information on procyclin expression. Furthermore, for each of the EP isoforms, we determined an accurate molecular mass, the extent of glycosylation, and the exact number of EP repeats. The wild type procyclic T. brucei brucei 427 clone had been stored at New York University in the laboratory of M. G.-S. Lee. This cell line was originally obtained in 1988 by in vitro differentiation of T. b.brucei 118 bloodstream clone 1 (6Rudenko G. Le Blancq S. Smith J. Lee M.G. Rattray A. Van der Ploeg L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The parasites had been cultured as procyclic cells for a total of about 6 weeks (since differentiation) before procyclin was isolated for the experiments described in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5. Ten cloned lines from the original 1988 clone were obtained at New York University by stably transforming the 1988 clone with the same DNA construct (H23H-B7) and using hygromycin as a selectable marker (22Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The H23-H-B7 construct contains thehsp70 intergenic region promoter followed by thehph gene, the βα-tubulin intergenic region, and a targeting sequence derived from the VSG 118 expression site (22Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The transformed parasites were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of trypanosomes not resistant to the drug. Another cloned line (clone 6) was obtained at Johns Hopkins University from the same T. brucei 1988 strain by limiting dilution in conditioned medium. Parasites were grown at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium (23Brun R. Shonenberger M. Acta Tropica. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the experiments shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, the procyclins (including GPEET- and EP forms) were purified from 1011 freeze dried trypanosomes by organic solvent extraction followed by octyl-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (13Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Ferguson M.A.J. Murray P. Rutherford H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Mehlert A. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining, the procyclin-containing fractions from the octyl-Sepharose column showed a major component with a highly polydisperse migration and an apparent molecular mass of ∼45 kDa (not shown). Sugar analysis of a pool of these fractions by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (24Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 349-383Google Scholar) yielded a composition of Man, Gal, GlcNAc, sialic acid, and myo-inositol of 5.2:14.8:27:4.2:1, similar to values reported previously (13Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Ferguson M.A.J. Murray P. Rutherford H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Some preparations also contained a minor component that migrated near 11 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This component was identified as the kinetoplastid membrane protein-11, a protein known to co-purify with procyclin preparations (25Stebeck C.E. Beecroft R.P. Singh B.N. Jardim A. Olafson R.W. Tuckey C. Prenevost K.D. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis revealed this component as a broad peak with an average molecular mass of 11,070 Da (not shown). The mass spectrometry analysis of procyclins from cloned cell lines was performed directly from n-butanol extracts without further purification by octyl-Sepharose chromatography. The mass spectra of these preparations were as clean as those obtained using procyclin purified by the standard chromatographic method (see example in Fig.6). Octyl-Sepharose purified procyclin (1–2 nmol, based on myo-inositol content) or n-butanol extracts from cloned cells were dephosphorylated with 50 μl (or 25 μl in the case of butanol extracts) of cold 48% aq.HF (Aldrich) for 16 h at 0 °C (19Mehlert A. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After hydrolysis, samples were quickly frozen in dry ice/ethanol and dried in the Speed-Vac. Samples were resuspended in 5–10 μl of water and stored at −20 °C. Mass spectra were acquired in a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE mass spectrometer calibrated with insulin, thioredoxin, and apomyoglobin. For the analysis of native procyclin (500 pmol; non-aq.HF-treated), samples were co-crystallized with sinapinic acid. Polypeptides dephosphorylated with aq.HF (50 pmol) provided better spectra using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. All spectra were collected in the negative ion mode. ESI-MS was performed using a Finnigan LCQ atmospheric pressure ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest Corp.). The mass spectrometer was equipped with an X-Y-Z-positioner carriage source (Protana A/S) and a sample loop containing a C18 microtrap cartridge (Michrom BioResources). Samples were resuspended in 50 mmformic acid, loaded onto the C18 microtrap cartridge, and then sprayed into the mass spectrometer through a 50-μm (inner diameter) fused silica needle by eluting with 50% methanol/1% acetic acid at 10 μl/min. Spray voltage was set at 1.75 kV with no sheath or auxiliary gas flow and a capillary temperature of 200 °C. Other voltages were set automatically by tuning on the 881 [M+2H]2+ ion of a renin substrate tetradecapeptide standard (Sigma). Full scan and MS/MS fragmentation data were collected in centroid mode with two microscans during a 500-ms maximum injection time using the default automatic gain control target number of ions. Quadruply charged ions were fragmented with a 40% collision energy and an isolation width of 2.0 atomic mass units. aq.HF-treated procyclin (50 pmol of dephosphorylated polypeptides) was hydrolyzed with 40 mm trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Pierce) at 100 °C for 15 min. After hydrolysis, the samples were chilled in ice water and washed with 50 μl of water to remove residual TFA. For analysis of the EP-procyclin N-terminal sequences by ESI-MS, 4.5 nmol of native procyclin was submitted to TFA hydrolysis as indicated above. The dried protein, in 50 μl of 0.1m ammonium acetate, 5% n-propanol (v/v), was loaded onto a mini-octyl-Sepharose column (∼0.5 ml) previously equilibrated in the same buffer. Whereas the C-terminal fragments as well as the nondegraded protein bound tightly to the hydrophobic resin through their GPI anchors, the hydrophilic N-terminal fragments were collected in the flow-through of the column. The column was washed with 1 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 5% n-propanol (v/v), and the collected material was pooled, dried in the Speed-Vac, and freeze-dried twice to remove residual ammonium acetate. aq.HF-treated procyclin (200 pmol) was deglycosylated with 500 units of peptide N4(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs) in 10 μl of 25 mmsodium phosphate at 37 °C for 2 h. After digestion, 1 μl of the sample was directly mixed with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. For analysis of procyclin N-terminal polypeptides by ESI-MS, the polypeptides obtained after mild acid hydrolysis and octyl-Sepharose chromatography (see above) were incubated with PNGase F as described above except that the buffer was 50 mm sodium phosphate and the digestion conditions were 37 °C for 5 h. Prior to mass spectral analysis, the deglycosylated polypeptides were desalted using a ZipTip (Millipore Corp.) containing C18 silica. Samples were eluted as recommended by the manufacturer, dried in a Speed-Vac, and resuspended in 50 mm formic acid before analysis. Procyclins (450 pmol) were dephosphorylated (or mock treated) with 2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 16 h. After digestion, the samples were dried in the Speed-Vac and incubated with 25 μl of 48% aq.HF at 0 °C for 6 h. An aliquot of the HF-treated sample (45 pmol) was submitted to mild acid hydrolysis as described above and then deglycosylated with 250 units of PNGase F (Biolabs) for 2 h at 37 °C. After each step, 10% of each sample was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. For MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, we first used native procyclin purified by organic solvent extraction and octyl-Sepharose chromatography. The negative ion spectrum revealed a highly heterogeneous group of [M-H]− pseudomolecular ions in the range ofm/z 14,000–20,000 (averagem/z, 17,400), consistent with an average mass of 17.4 kDa (not shown). A comparable spectrum was reported previously for purified GPEET-procyclin, and the extensive heterogeneity observed is mainly due to the polydisperse side chain of the GPI anchor (13Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Mehlert A. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To distinguish the different EP-procyclin species, it was first essential to remove the GPI anchors. We removed the anchors by treatment with cold 48% aq.HF, a reagent that cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the anchor ethanolamine and the GPI glycan core (26Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 27Butikofer P. Boschung M. Menon A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This treatment preserves most polypeptide chains withN-glycan moieties intact and leaves the GPI ethanolamine amide-linked to the C-terminal α-carboxyl. In the case of EP-procyclin, HF also produced minor cleavages in the protein backbone, mainly at the mild acid-sensitive Asp-Pro bonds (see below). The negative ion MALDI mass spectrum of HF-treated procyclins revealed many [M-H]− pseudomolecular ions in the range ofm/z 5,000–12,000 (Fig.2 A). Although the spectrum is complex, nearly all of these species were interpretable in terms of the well characterized procyclin gene sequences andN-glycosylation patterns. TableI lists the masses and assignments of the various species detected. Two ions at m/z 11,531 (ion 1) and 10,430 (ion 3) had molecular masses for two different glycosylated products of the EP1 gene, each also containing one ethanolamine. According to their cDNA sequences and results shown later in this paper, these proteins differ in both the number of EP repeats (30 for ion 1, 25 for ion 3) and in one amino acid at position 24 (4Mowatt M.R. Clayton C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Rudenko G. Le Blancq S. Smith J. Lee M.G. Rattray A. Van der Ploeg L.H. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). We have designated these ions as the products of the EP1-1 and EP1-2genes, respectively. Another major [M-H]− ion atm/z 9,723 (ion 4) matches the calculated mass of the glycosylated product of the EP-procyclin EP3 gene, a protein with 22 EP repeats (5Roditi I. Carrington M. Turner M. Nature. 1987; 325: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Clayton C.E. Fueri J.P. Itzhaki J.E. Bellofatto V. Sherman D.R. Wisdom G.S. Vijayasarathy S. Mowatt M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, no ion corresponding to the product of the EP-procyclin EP2gene (expected mass = 8,571, including one ethanolamine) was observed. However, a tiny peak at m/z 8,344 (ion 10) was tentatively assigned as a product of this gene, but this polypeptide contained only 24 EP repeats instead of the 25 predicted from the published cDNA sequence (10Rudenko G. Bishop D. Gottesdiener K. Van der Ploeg L.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4259-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To distinguish both EP-procyclin species, we have designated them as EP2–1 (containing 25 EP repeats) and EP2–2 (containing 24 EP repeats). As expected, the mass of EP2–2 procyclin (ion 10) predicted that this polypeptide was not N-glycosylated (10Rudenko G. Bishop D. Gottesdiener K. Van der Ploeg L.H.

This enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2, exhibited an absolute dependence upon the presence of Rd. However, Rd was incapable of participating in the pyruvate synthase or CO2 fixation reaction of C. tepidum PFOR, for which two different reduced ferredoxins are employed as electron donors. These results suggest a specific functional role for Rd in pyruvate oxidation and provide the initial indication that the two important physiological reactions catalyzed by PFOR/pyruvate synthase are dependent on different electron carriers in the cell.

Further spectroscopic studies indicated that the CD spectrum of oxidized C. tepidum Rd exhibited a unique absorption maximum at 385 nm and a shoulder at 420 nm. The EPR spectrum of oxidized Rd also exhibited unusual anisotropic resonances at g = 9.675 and g = 4.322, which is composed of a narrow central feature with broader shoulders to high and low field.

PS (Equation 1) is classically thought to also catalyze a pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) reaction, in which pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and CO2, essentially the reverse of the PS reaction (Equation 2).acetyl­CoA+CO2+Fdred→pyruvate+coenzyme A+FdoxEquation 1 pyruvate+coenzyme A+Fd(Fld)ox→acetyl-CoA+CO2+Fd(Fld)redEquation 2 In the PFOR reaction, coenzyme A and thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) are necessary coenzymes, with oxidized Fd or flavodoxin previously shown to be necessary electron acceptors (Equation 2) (8Uyeda K.

PFOR is thus distinct from the well characterized pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex, which catalyzes coenzyme A- and NAD-dependent oxidation of pyruvate (Equation 3) (14Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). PFOR also differs from pyruvate decarboxylase, which catalyzes the ThDP-dependent conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and CO2 (Equation 4) (16Dobritzsch D. Konig S. Schneider G. Lu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20196-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hubner G.

Ishii M. Kodama T. Igarashi Y. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 510-513Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar,12Yoon K.-S. Ishii M. Kodama T. Igarashi Y. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar);however, the reaction was initially discovered in another green sulfur bacterium, C. limicola formathiosulfatophilum (3Evans M.C.W. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 18Evans M.C.W. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 1420-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The PS carboxylation reaction must overcome a large negative potential energy barrier, which is facilitated by the use of Fd, one of the most electronegative electron carriers known in cellular metabolism (19Kyritsis P. Hatzfeld O.M. Link T.A. Moulis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15404-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Gao-Sheridan H.S. Pershad H.R. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5514-5519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, PS catalyzes a carboxylase reaction, which distinguishes it from pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex, pyruvate decarboxylase, and perhaps even some sources of PFOR. During the course of studying the carboxylation enzymes of the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle of C. tepidum, a Rd was isolated and purified to homogeneity from photoautotrophically grown cells. Rd is a small nonheme iron protein and is an important electron transfer component of many bacteria, especially anaerobic organisms. Rd contains a single iron atom coordinated to four cysteine residues in a tetrahedral arrangement (21Sieker L.C. Stenkamp R.E. LeGall L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with the redox-active site located at the surface of the protein, indicating a directed outer sphere electron transfer mechanism. There are many specific examples where Rd has been shown to participate in a variety of metabolic reactions. For example, Rd is proposed to be the primary electron carrier for the acetogenic CO dehydrogenase of several anaerobes (22Ragsdale S.W. Ljungdahl L.G. DerVartanian D.V. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1224-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is an intermediary electron carrier in the NAD(P)H-dependent nitrate reduction system in Clostridium perfringens (23Seki S. Ikeda A. Ishimoto M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 103: 583-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, inPseudomonas oleovorans, a soluble Rd reductase and a membrane-bound ω-hydroxylase are coupled to the hydroxylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons, functionalized hydrocarbons, and various aromatic compounds (24McKenna E.J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3882-3889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lee H.J. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15513-15522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Azotobacter vinelandii (26Chen J.C. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in Rhizobium leguminosarum (27Rey L. Hidalgo E. Palacios J. Ruiz-Argüeso T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the genes coding for proteins with sequences very similar to Rd have recently been recognized as part of hydrogenase gene clusters, which may indicate the involvement of Rd in hydrogen oxidation or reduction (28Fu C. Maier R.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 145: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Rd ofDesulfovibrio gigas has also shown to function as a redox coupling protein between NADH oxidoreductase and Rd oxidoreductase, allowing this organism to increase ATP production via the degradation of internal polyglucose in the presence of oxygen (21Sieker L.C. Stenkamp R.E. LeGall L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Gomes C.M. Silva G. Oliveira S. LeGall J. Liu M.-Y. Xavier A.V. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22502-22508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite these disparate studies, the actual physiological function of Rd is still unclear, especially in organisms that may obtain much of their organic carbon from CO2 assimilation, such as green photosynthetic bacteria (30Woolley K.J. Meyer T.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Lee W.Y. Brune D.C. LoBrutto R. Blankenship R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Rao K.K. Evans M.C. Cammack R. Hall D.O. Thompson C.L. Jackson P.J. Johnson C.E. Biochem.

Certainly, from the foregoing, Rd might have very important catabolic and also anabolic functions in different organisms. In this study, it is demonstrated that Rd fromC. tepidum exhibits unique characteristics; most interestingly, it serves as a high potential electron acceptor forC. tepidum PFOR, resulting in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA + CO2. However, Rd has thus far not been shown to participate in the PS reaction of this protein, suggesting a potential specific physiological role in pyruvate oxidation. C. tepidumstrain TLS was grown photoautotrophically in 20-liter Carboy bottles according to a modification of a method described previously (34Wahlund T.M. Madigan M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2583-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested anaerobically, using continuous centrifugation at 35,000 × g at 4 °C under a flow of nitrogen gas. The harvested cells were washed twice with anaerobic 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The cells were then resuspended in the same buffer (1 g of wet weight cells/4 ml of buffer), after which the cell suspension was disrupted by two passes through a French pressure cell at 10,000 psi under a flow of argon gas. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min); the supernatant fraction was then centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 1.5 h. The supernatant fraction from this step was used for the purification of all soluble proteins, including Rd, two Fds, and PFOR. The high speed precipitate fraction was used for the isolation of membrane-bound reaction center particles. All purification procedures were carried out at room temperature under anaerobic conditions using a Coy anaerobic chamber under an atmosphere of 95% nitrogen and 5% hydrogen. All buffers were repeatedly degassed and flushed with argon and were maintained under a positive pressure of argon; for overnight storage, the buffers were stirred continuously with a magnetic stir bar in the anaerobic chamber. With the exception of the last two chromatographic steps, buffers contained sodium dithionite (1 mm) and dithiothreitol (1 mm) to protect against trace oxygen contamination. Protein purification was performed in the Coy anaerobic chamber using the Biological Autoprogram System from Bio-Rad. The supernatant following ultracentrifugation was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (2.5 × 15 cm), pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium dithionite, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ThDP. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer containing 0.1m NaCl at a flow rate of 7 ml/min. A stepwise gradient method was used that consisted of 600 ml of buffer containing a gradient of 0.1–0.3 m NaCl, 200 ml of 0.3–0.5m NaCl, and 100 ml of 0.5–2.0 m NaCl. PFOR, Rd, and Fds were eluted around 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 m NaCl, respectively, from this first column. The Rd fraction, eluting at approximately 0.32 to 0.34 m NaCl, was diluted 2-fold with nonsalt buffer and then applied onto a Q-Sepharose high performance column (1.6 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with wash buffer. After sample application, the column was washed with wash buffer and then eluted isocratically using buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl, followed by a gradient of buffer containing 0.25–0.4 mNaCl at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The total gradient volume was 180 ml. The Rd-containing fractions from this column were then directly loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (1.0 × 15 cm) pre-equilibrated with 1 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. At this stage, the Rd-containing fraction was concentrated using Utrafree-15, PBCC 5,000 NMWL (Millipore). Then the Rd was loaded onto a Superose-12 column (1.6 × 50 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. PFOR and two different Fds were also purified to homogeneity via several column chromatographic steps under anaerobic conditions. 2K.-S. Yoon and F. R. Tabita, manuscript in preparation. EPR spectra were obtained with a Brüker instruments, Inc. ER 300 spectrometer equipped with ER 035M NMR gaussmeter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. Double integration of the EPR spectra was performed with the ESP 300 Software package from Brüker Instruments. Air-oxidized Rd was injected into quartz EPR tubes and frozen by plunging the tubes into liquid nitrogen. Samples of reduced Rd were prepared under anaerobic conditions with either an enzymatic protocol using the activity of PFOR or by chemical means after the addition of sodium dithionite. The reduced liquid samples were collected directly into EPR tubes and sealed with a rubber stopper; the samples were then frozen at specific times after mixing in a dry ice/acetone bath by plunging the tube into liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were measured at 4.7–20 K using 10 mW of microwave power under liquid helium. CD spectra of oxidized or reduced Rd were measured at room temperature on an AVIV 62DS Spectropolarimeter. CD data were collected at 1-mm intervals using averaging times of 1 s/m, depending on the signal to noise ratio. UV-visible spectra were measured with a Beckman DU®-70 spectrophotometer. The midpoint reduction potential value of the C. tepidum Rd was determined by cyclic voltammetry at a glassy carbon electrode at 25 °C (35Brereton P.S. Verhagen M.F.J.M. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7351-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The scan rate was 20 mV/s over the potential range 0 to −600 mV (versus the Ag/AgCl electrode). All values were referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid analyses of Rd were determined using standard procedures. The purity of Rd was established by SDS-PAGE using a discontinuous Tris-Tricine buffer system (36Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar); samples were heated at 75 °C for 1 h. The apparent molecular weight of Rd was estimated by calibration with a commercial kit of small molecular weight markers from Sigma. Protein concentrations were routinely estimated by established procedures (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The iron content of the protein was determined by the o-phenanthroline procedure (38Lovenberg W. Buchanan B.B. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3899-3913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of Rd was determined by gel filtration using a Superose-12 HR (10/30) column calibrated with β-amylase (M r = 200,000), bovine serum albumin (M r = 67,000), carbonic anhydrase (M r = 29,000), cytochrome c(M r = 12,400), and aprotinin (M r = 6,500). In all cases, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing either 0.1 or 1.0 m NaCl, was used as the eluate buffer. PFOR activity was routinely determined spectrophotometrically by following the pyruvate-dependent reduction of methyl viologen in anaerobic cuvettes under nitrogen gas at 30 °C (12Yoon K.-S. Ishii M. Kodama T. Igarashi Y. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 5 mmpyruvate, 0.5 mm coenzyme A, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ThDP, and 2 mm methyl viologen in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. PFOR activity was expressed as units/mg of protein, where 1 unit is equivalent to the reduction of 1 μmol of methyl viologen per min at 578 nm (ε578 nm = 9.8 mm−1 cm−1). Acetyl-CoA, formed as a result of pyruvate oxidation catalyzed by Rd-dependent PFOR activity, was measured using a coupled assay with malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase (39Pearson D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1965; 13: 545-548Google Scholar). The amount of pyruvate consumed after the PFOR reaction was also determined with a lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay (40LeJohn H.B. Stevenson R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The amounts of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA oxidized and produced, respectively, were standardized using commercial preparations of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, as above. PS activity was determined using a radiometric assay (2Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 28: 170-181Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 3Evans M.C.W. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Reduced Fd and Rd were employed in reaction mixtures to reductively carboxylate acetyl-CoA; isolated spinach chloroplast fragments (41Mill W.R. Joy K.W. Planta. 1980; 148: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) or C. tepidum membrane-bound reaction center particles were used to photoreduce these electron carriers (42Oh-oka H. Kamei S. Matsubara H. Iwaki M. Itoh S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and lactate dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA, NAD, NADH, coenzyme A, and pyruvate were purchased from Sigma. After purification, the Rd preparation was oxidized and pink-red in color; it eluted from DEAE-Sepharose columns at salt concentrations between 0.32 and 0.34m NaCl or about 20–25 mS/cm conductivity. This column effectively separated other important soluble proteins, including PFOR, two Fds, and others. Furthermore, the hydroxyapatite column was crucial to separate rubredoxin from another rubredoxin-like molecule that was found to compromise the spectral and other molecular properties obtained. Rd was reduced and blanched in a reaction mixture containing PFOR; similar results were obtained after incubation with sodium dithionite. When reoxidized in air, the pink-red color returned after a few minutes. The UV-visible absorption spectra of oxidized Rd showed several peaks at 280, 370, 492, 570, and 774 nm (Fig.1 A); at 492 nm, the absorption coefficient was 6.89 mm−1 cm−1, calculated using a molecular weight of 6,500. C. tepidum Rd differed from other bacterial Rds by the presence of at least two absorption bands in the 300–400 nm region, a property that may be unique to only green photosynthetic bacteria (32Rao K.K. Evans M.C. Cammack R. Hall D.O. Thompson C.L. Jackson P.J. Johnson C.E. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Meyer T.E. Sharp J.J. Bartsch R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 234: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TheA 492/A 280 ratio was 0.343. A molecular weight of 6,500 ± 1,000 was obtained from gel filtration experiments in the presence of 1.0 m NaCl. In the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, the molecular weight increased to 13,000 ± 1,000, indicating that the protein exists as a monomer at high ionic strength. The amino acid composition of C. tepidum Rd also yielded an approximate molecular weight of 6,500 (data not shown), which is typical of other Rds (30Woolley K.J. Meyer T.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Lee W.Y. Brune D.C. LoBrutto R. Blankenship R.E. Arch. Biochem.

Academic Press, New York1973: 131-162Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of the purified Rd gave rise to a single protein band (Fig. 1 B), which migrated with the dye front after SDS-PAGE using a discontinuous Tris-Tricine buffer system (36Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). This behavior is typical of acidic proteins such as Rd or Fd even in the presence of 20% acrylamide (46Blake P.R. Park J.-B. Bryant F.O. Aono S. Magnuson J.K. Eccleston E. Howard J.B. Summers M.F. Adams M.W.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10885-10895Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PFOR was shown to have a homodimeric structure comprised of two 125 ± 1 kDa subunits, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C), with a native molecular weight of 250,000 ± 10,000, as determined by gel filtration. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the C. tepidum Rd was determined to be MQKWVCVPCGY-DPAD-, which indicated high similarity with other previously isolated Rds of anaerobic bacteria (30Woolley K.J.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The midpoint reduction potential value of C. tepidum Rd, −87 mV (Fig. 2), is more negative than other sources of Rd (31Lee W.Y. Brune D.C. LoBrutto R. Blankenship R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Meyer T.E. Sharp J.J. Bartsch R.G. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), perhaps indicating that theC. tepidum Rd has more negatively charged amino acids at neutral pH. The reduction potential of Rd from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus is highly temperature-dependent, changing from about 0 mV at 25 °C to about −160 mV at 90 °C at pH 8.0 (47Swartz P.D. Ichiye T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13772-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the in vivo reduction potential of Rd from C. tepidum, with an optimum growth temperature of around 48 °C, must be even more negative than the value determined in vitro (−87 mV at 25 °C).Figure 2Cyclic voltammogram of C. tepidum Rd . Bulk solution voltammetry of 300 μm Rd in 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 at 25 °C; scan rate 20 mV/s. MgCl2 (50 mm) was added to promote and stabilize the response.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The near UV-visible CD spectra of oxidized C. tepidum Rd closely resembled spectra obtained previously (31Lee W.Y. Brune D.C. LoBrutto R. Blankenship R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 45Eaton W.A. Lovenberg W. Lovenberg W. Iron Sulfur Proteins: The Iron-Sulfur Complex in Rubredoxin. Academic Press, New York1973: 131-162Google Scholar, 50Cavagnero S. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9865-9873Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), with the exception of the absorption maximum at 385 nm and the shoulder at 420 nm (Fig.3 A). The optical absorption and CD spectra of reduced and oxidized Rd at wavelengths from 300 to 600 nm arise from optically active charge-transfer transitions in the iron-sulfur chromophore, which are presumably sensitive to changes in conformation. The CD features above 320 nm were lost when the protein was reduced (Fig. 3 A). The far UV-CD spectrum of C. tepidum Rd showed a weak negative band near 225 nm, a strong positive transition between 200 and 215 nm, and also a strong negative band between 185 and 190 nm (Fig. 3 B), which usually signifies an antiparallel β-sheet environment. This property is very similar to Rd from P. furiosus (50Cavagnero S. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9865-9873Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Reduced Rd was produced when air-oxidized Rd was added to a complete PFOR assay system under anaerobic conditions; this occurred in the complete absence of artificial electron acceptors such as methyl viologen. Under these conditions, PFOR apparently uses oxidized Rd as an electron acceptor. This was manifested by a change from the pink-red color observed upon air oxidation and the appearance of a strong EPR signal (Fig. 4 A). Reduced Rd was not EPR-active, as expected (Fig. 4 B). Oxidized Rd fromC. tepidum exhibited a principal resonance at g = ∼4.3, which is composed of a narrow sharp component, at g = 4.322 with broad shoulders to high and low field; in addition, a smaller feature at g = 9.675 was observed. The EPR features at g = ∼4.3 and g = ∼9.7 regions were similar to states previously observed for other Rds (31Lee W.Y. Brune D.C. LoBrutto R. Blankenship R.E. Arch. Biochem.

To provide the structural basis for this estrogen specificity, we mutated amino acid residues that constitute the substrate-binding site of EST. Among these mutants, only Tyr-81 decreased E2 and increased DHEA sulfotransferase activities. Substitution for Tyr-81 by smaller hydrophobic residues increasedK m(E2) for E2 activity, whereas thek cat(E2) remained relatively constant. The Y81L mutant exhibited the same DHEA activity as wild-type hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, for whichK m(DHEA) remained relatively constant, and k cat(DHEA) was markedly increased. The side chain of Tyr-81 is directed at the A-ring of the E2 molecule in the substrate-binding pocket of EST, constituting a steric gate with Phe-142 sandwiching E2 from the opposite side. The present mutagenesis study indicates that the 3β-hydroxyl group of the DHEA molecule is excluded from the catalytic site of EST through steric hindrance of Tyr-81 with the C-19 methyl group of DHEA.

Steroid hormones are sulfated by enzymes called cytosolic sulfotransferases that transfer sulfuryl groups to the substrates from the ubiquitous cofactor 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). 1The abbreviations used are: PAPSphosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfateE2estradiolESTestrogen sulfotransferaseDHEAdehydroepiandrosteroneHSThydroxysteroid sulfotransferaseADandrostenediolPREGpregnenolone Steroid sulfates are stored as inactive hormones that can be reactivated by steroid sulfatases, providing a mechanism for regulating endocrine homeostasis (1Hobkirk R.

Thus, as an alternative to aromatase inhibitors, the steroid sulfation/desulfation system is currently considered as a drug target for hormone-sensitive diseases such as certain types of breast cancer (2Evans T.R.

Steroid sulfotransferases are subgrouped based on their substrate preferences, estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) and hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (HST). Characteristically, EST displays a far greater specificity and efficiency to sulfate E2 than HST does to sulfate DHEA. The underlying structural principle for EST to manifest such high estrogen preferences remains a question of major interest. phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate estradiol estrogen sulfotransferase dehydroepiandrosterone hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase androstenediol pregnenolone In the last 10 years, more than 30 cytosolic sulfotransferase cDNAs have been cloned from bacteria, plant, and mammals including humans (6Weinshilboum R.M.

These structures have revealed the PAPS-binding motif that is conserved in all cytosolic sulfotransferases. The transition state model mimicked by the EST-PAP-vanadate structure suggests that sulfotransferase reaction proceeds in an in-line sulfuryl transfer. This structure-based mechanism is consistent with a Random Bi Bi mechanism proposed previously based on enzyme kinetic analyses (14Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol.

Moreover, these structural motifs and reaction mechanisms are also conserved in a group of Golgi membrane sulfotransferases that sulfate high molecular weight substrates such as carbohydrates, polysaccharides, and proteins (16Kakuta Y.

Thus, EST structures have provided an excellent basis to investigate the underlying principles that determine the substrate specificity of EST and other sulfotransferases. For the present study, we have employed the structural information for EST to select residues for mutagenesis. EST transfers the 5′-sulfate of PAPS to the phenolic hydroxyl at 3-position of E2. The E2 molecule is accommodated horizontally in the cylindrical hydrophobic pocket, in which the hydroxyl group of E2 is inserted deep into the active site, whereas the 17β-hydroxyl group is directed outward near the pocket entrance. Vertical sectioning of the pocket has revealed a gate-like structure that positions the E2 molecule. Key residues in this region were mutated in order to examine whether they act as a gate in determining the substrate specificity of EST. EST and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and used to determine selectively their K m andk cat values using E2, DHEA, and androstenediol as substrates. We herein describe experimental considerations that lead us to propose that tyrosine at position 81 is the key residue that confers substrate specificity of EST for E2 over DHEA. [1,2,6,7-3 H]Dehydroepiandrosterone (60 Ci/mmol), [2,4,6,7-3 H]estradiol (72 Ci/mmol), [7-3 H]pregnenolone (25 Ci/mmol), and [1,2-3 H]androstenediol (42 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. AD was obtained from Steraloids, and E2, DHEA, and PREG were obtained from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis, expression, and purification were performed as described previously (13Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, a QuickChange kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into EST sequence in pGEX-4T3 plasmid by polymerase chain reaction, and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutated enzymes were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase, applied on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequently eluted by thrombin cleavage (Sigma). Sulfotransferase activity was assayed as described previously (10Song W.-C. Moore R. McLachlan J.A. Negishi M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2477-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (200 μl of 100 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 100 μm PAPS) was extracted with 2 volumes of dichloromethane, and an aliquot of the aqueous phase was used for scintillation counting. K m andk cat values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using either a constant amount of radioactive substrate (in total concentrations of 3.5, 7.0, 13.9, 17.8, 25.6, 41.3, 72.5, 135, 260, and 510 nm) or constant ratio of labeled to unlabeled ligand (in total concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8 μm). For cases for which sulfotransferase activity was inhibited by a high concentration of substrate, the data were processed using a model previously published to determineK m and k cat values (15Zhang H. Varmalova O. Vargas F.M. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10888-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using anA 280 nm,1 mg/ml of 1.6 for EST and 2.2 for HST. Apparent molecular masses of 35,000 and 30,000 were used to calculate k cat values for EST and HST, respectively. EST binds the hydrophobic substrate E2 tightly within the van der Waals surface of the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket (12Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fig.1 depicts residues constituting the surface of the substrate pocket. Arg-23, Asn-86, Ser-148, and Met-247 are positioned below the D-ring of the E2 molecule. This group of residues forms the entrance to the pocket, with the side chain of Asn-86 hydrogen-bonded to the 17β-hydroxyl group (section I). On section II, Phe-24, Cys-84, Ile-146, and Tyr-149 reside near the B/C-rings of the E2 molecule, whereas the side chains of Phe-24 and Cys-84 are directed toward the C-18 methyl group. Residues Tyr-81, Phe-142, and Tyr-240 are located around the A-ring of the E2 molecule on section III, with the side chains of Tyr-81 and Phe-142 forming the narrowest channel of the pocket (Fig. 1). Many of these residues were mutated to examine their role in determining the substrate specificity of EST. Mutated ESTs were expressed, purified, and their sulfotransferase activities determined using E2 and DHEA as substrates (Table I). Mutations of residues on section I affected E2 sulfotransferase activity only slightly. Even the N86A mutant that abolishes a hydrogen bond of Asn-86 to the 17β-hydroxyl group essentially retained wild-type EST activity. Mutation of Ser-148 to Ala displayed the most noticeable decrease in activity (5-fold). None of these mutant enzymes increased DHEA sulfotransferase activity. Because of its close proximity to the C-18 methyl group, Phe-24 on section II was mutated to a smaller amino acid Ala, whereas Cys-84 was mutated to a larger amino acid to fill the space between its side chain and the C-18 methyl group. These mutants (F24A, C84F, and C84Y), however, exhibited substrate specificity similar to that of wild-type EST. Mutations of the other residues in section II (Ile-146 and Tyr-149 that sandwich the C-ring from the opposite side of the pocket) displayed as high E2 sulfotransferase activity and as low DHEA sulfotransferase activity as did wild-type EST. The most profound increase of DHEA activity occurred with a Tyr-81 mutant in section III; the Y81A mutant exhibited approximately 8-fold higher DHEA sulfotransferase activity but decreased E2 sulfotransferase activity by 3-fold (Table II). On the other hand, the mutation of Phe-142 to Leu (F142L) decreased E2 activity 30-fold but did not confer activity toward DHEA. In addition, mutations of tyrosine at position 240 did not affect the activities of wild-type EST.Table IInitial screening of substrate-binding residue mutantsE2DHEApmol/min/mgWild typesmEST118 ± 151.3 ± 0.2mHST2 ± 025.5 ± 2.8Section IR23A171 ± 741.2 ± 0.2N86A65 ± 230.6 ± 0.2S148A23 ± 70.1 ± 0.1M247G201 ± 730.1 ± 0.1Section IIF24A200 ± 50.1 ± 0.0C84Y141 ± 320.4 ± 0.1C84F141 ± 320.4 ± 0.1I146A85 ± 420.0 ± 0.0Y149F71 ± 151.7 ± 0.7Section IIIY81A88 ± 358.7 ± 1.9F142A65 ± 60.0 ± 0.0Y240F144 ± 181.0 ± 0.0Sulfotransferase activity was measured as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction mixtures contained an amount of enzymes that did not produce greater than 20% conversion of the substrates (1 μm).

Prefix m indicates mouse enzymes. Sulfotransferase activity was measured as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Since Y81L was the only mutant that significantly increased DHEA sulfotransferase activity, further mutational analysis was conducted with Y81L, Y81F, and Y81A. First, we determined K m andk cat values of wild-type EST for E2 and DHEA sulfotransferase activities (Table II). GeneralK m(E2) andk cat(E2) values were on the order of 10 nm and 10 s−1 × 103/nm, respectively, whereas those for DHEA were the 1 μm and 1 s−1 × 103/nm, respectively. Decreasing the side chain size by substituting Tyr-81 with Phe, Leu, and Ala, respectively, increased the K m(E2) values up to 10-fold. The k cat(E2) values for these mutants, on the other hand, remained relatively constant, although Y81L decreased k cat(E2) about 2.5-fold. Removing the hydroxyl group from Tyr-81 by substituting it with Phe resulted in more than 10-fold higher k cat(DHEA) for EST withK m(DHEA) only 2.5-fold lower. Placing Leu at position 81 (Y81L) resulted in the highk cat(DHEA) andK m(DHEA) values similar to those observed with Y81F. The k cat(DHEA) of Y81A was 35-fold higher than that of wild-type EST, with both having similarK m(DHEA) values. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that as the size of residue 81 becomes smaller, EST acquires higher DHEA and lower E2 sulfotransferase activities. The highest DHEA sulfotransferase activity, however, is achieved with the Y81L mutant. Moreover, k cat is the primary factor for altering DHEA sulfotransferase activity, whereasK m defines mainly E2 sulfotransferase activity. Thek cat(DHEA) andK m(DHEA) values of Y81L were practically identical to those of wild-type HST. As a result, the catalytic power (K m(DHEA)/k cat(DHEA)ratio) of EST to sulfate DHEA can be strengthened to levels equal to that for HST by a single amino acid mutation at position 81. In the x-ray crystal structure of EST complexed with E2 and PAP (12Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), Phe-142 and Tyr-81 form a narrow channel to the substrate pocket that sandwiches the E2 molecule. Although the mutation of Phe-142 to Leu did not increase the DHEA sulfotransferase activity of EST, it decreased profoundly E2 sulfotransferase activity (Table I). To examine further the role of Phe-142 in determining the substrate specificity of EST, we constructed an additional Phe-142 mutant and also a double mutant in which both Tyr-81 and Phe-142 were mutated simultaneously. F142L exhibited a 40-fold higher K m(E2) for E2 sulfotransferase activity than wild-type EST, with the samek cat(E2) value. BothK m(DHEA) andk cat(DHEA) of F142L for DHEA sulfotransferase activity remained at levels similar to those of wild-type EST. Finally, we mutated Phe-142 to Ala (F142A) to make the side chain size smaller. This mutation resulted in a 100-fold decrease of the catalytic power (K m(E2)/k cat(E2)) of EST to sulfate E2, caused primarily by a marked increase ofK m(E2). F142A abolished completely DHEA sulfotransferase activity. As expected, the F142L/Y81L double mutant showed little catalytic power for either E2 or DHEA sulfotransferase activity. In the double mutant, the change in K m for E2 sulfotransferase activity was determined by Leu-142, whereas the alteration of k cat was dictated by Leu-81. Similarly, Leu-81 and Leu-142 defined the k catand K m values for DHEA sulfotransferase activity, respectively. These observations for the F142L/Y81L mutant are consistent with the manner in which K m andk cat were defined in the corresponding single mutants. One of the main structural differences of DHEA from E2 is the presence of the C-19 methyl group. We might infer that the presence of the C-19 methyl group may prevent DHEA from becoming an efficient substrate of EST. For testing this inference, we used steroid androstenediol (AD), which contains the C-19 methyl group as a substrate. AD differs from DHEA by only the hydroxyl group at the C-17 position. As expected, wild-type EST exhibited little ability to sulfate AD, whereas wild-type HST sulfated AD efficiently (Table III). The Y81L mutant of EST exhibited markedly increased AD sulfotransferase activity, with a 4-fold lower K m and a 5-fold higherk cat for AD sulfotransferase activity compared with wild-type EST. Based on thek cat /K m ratio, the Y81L mutation elevated the AD sulfotransferase activity to 30% of the level observed in wild-type HST. The F142L mutant had virtually no AD activity; the K m and k catvalues were practically identical to wild-type EST. In addition to AD, pregnenolone (PREG) was also sulfated by the Y81L mutant but not by the wild-type and F142L enzymes (data not shown). PREG is another steroid having the C-19 methyl group. Thus, these results provided further evidence that EST utilizes steric hindrance by the C-19 methyl group of steroids with Tyr-81 to confer substrate specificity.Table IIIKinetic parameters for androstenediol sulfotransferase activityK m(AD)k cat(AD)k cat(AD)/K m(AD)nms−1 × 103s−1 × 106/nmEST wild3224 ± 10910.9 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.1Y81L868 ± 804.9 ± 1.05.6 ± 0.8F142L2900 ± 2111.8 ± 0.40.6 ± 0.2HST wild191 ± 614.3 ± 1.425.3 ± 14.8 Open table in a new tab Residues Tyr-81 and Phe-142 form a stricture-like gate that dictates the binding of steroids in the substrate pocket of EST. Superposition of DHEA with E2 in the substrate binding pocket shows that the C-19 methyl group of DHEA molecule is within 2.29 Å of C-ε2 of Tyr-81 (Fig.2). Based on a characteristic alteration of K m(E2) with mutagenesis of Tyr-81 and Phe-142, the gate appears to determine the binding affinity for E2 to EST. Placing a smaller residue at position 81 not only decreases E2 sulfotransferase activity but also increases DHEA sulfotransferase activity. Mutation of Phe-142 is more destructive, resulting in a profound decrease of both E2 and DHEA sulfotransferase activities of this enzyme, consistent with the fact that Phe-142 is conserved in all cytosolic sulfotransferases. Thus, the Tyr-81/Phe-142 gate is a structural factor that determines the estrogen specificity of EST. Tyr-81 appears to be the determining factor in the alteration of the substrate specificity of EST to DHEA sulfotransferase activity. In the Tyr-81 mutants, k cat for DHEA sulfotransferase activity was increased markedly compared with wild-type EST. This indicates that the gate can be widened by mutation of Tyr-81, allowing for EST to accommodate DHEA deep into the substrate pocket near the catalytic center. The molecule modeled in the EST pocket shows that the C-19 methyl group makes a clashing contact (2.29 Å) with a carbon atom (C-ε2) of the phenol ring of Tyr-81 but not with the phenolic hydroxyl at the 3-position (3.85 Å). Paradoxically, our present site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr-81 has suggested that the C-19 methyl group may conflict sterically with the phenol group. This apparent paradox might be explained if DHEA does not bind exactly in the same manner as the E2 molecule pictured in Fig. 1 and thus may actually have a steric interaction with the phenol group. Alternatively, the structural orientation of the Phe side chain with respect to the Tyr at this position may differ, thus allowing the Y81F mutant to accommodate DHEA. Nevertheless, it should be reiterated that placing a smaller amino acid at position 81 can widen the Tyr-81/Phe-142 gate, resulting in an increase of DHEA sulfotransferase activity in EST. Steric hindrance by a critical residue has been proposed as an underlying principle that can regulate substrate and/or product specificities of enzymes catalyzing hydrophobic substrates. It is well known that the sizes of these residues alter the P450 specificities (Ref. 19Negishi M. Uno T. Darden T.A. Sueyoshi T. Pedersen L.G. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and references therein). For example, mutation of Phe-209 to Leu converted the substrate specificity of CYP2A5 from coumarin to a larger molecule, testosterone. Placing a large amino acid Phe at position 209 appeared to inhibit binding of testosterone to CYP2A5 (20Lindberg R. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 338: 632-634Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar).

Similarly, Met-418 was a factor for defining the specificity of 15-lipoxygenase activity, and the M418V mutant increased markedly 12-lipoxygenase activity to the level of 15-lipoxygenase activity (22Sloane D.L.

Since kinetic parameters were not determined in those studies, it is not possible to discuss details as to how the mutations regulate the substrate and/or product specificities. To our knowledge, the Tyr-81/Phe-142 gate of EST is the first clear example for the existence of such a gate in a hydrophobic substrate pocket that confers high substrate specificity. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the gate-like structure regulates EST specificity depending on the chemical properties of the substrates. The gate provides EST with a high catalytic power to sulfate E2 by regulating the binding affinity of EST to E2. The gate can be widened through mutagenesis so as to accommodate DHEA deep into the catalytic core, altering EST to an enzyme that sulfates DHEA with a high catalytic efficiency. A gate-like structure in the substrate-binding pocket may be an underlying factor for enzymes catalyzing hydrophobic chemicals and thereby regulating their substrate and/or product specificities."
https://openalex.org/W2021989115,"Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) play an important role in the targeting of newly synthesized soluble acid hydrolases to the lysosome in higher eukaryotic cells. These acid hydrolases carry mannose 6-phosphate recognition markers on theirN-linked oligosaccharides that are recognized by two distinct MPRs: the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the insulin-like growth factor II/cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Although much has been learned about the MPRs, it is unclear how these receptors interact with the highly diverse population of lysosomal enzymes. It is known that the terminal mannose 6-phosphate is essential for receptor binding. However, the results from several studies using synthetic oligosaccharides indicate that the binding site encompasses at least two sugars of the oligosaccharide. We now report the structure of the soluble extracytoplasmic domain of a glycosylation-deficient form of the bovine cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor complexed to pentamannosyl phosphate. This construct consists of the amino-terminal 154 amino acids (excluding the signal sequence) with glutamine substituted for asparagine at positions 31, 57, 68, and 87. The binding site of the receptor encompasses the phosphate group plus three of the five mannose rings of pentamannosyl phosphate. Receptor specificity for mannose arises from protein contacts with the 2-hydroxyl on the terminal mannose ring adjacent to the phosphate group. Glycosidic linkage preference originates from the minimization of unfavorable interactions between the ligand and receptor.

The biogenesis of lysosomes is an essential component of the degradative machinery of the cell and is mediated in part by the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). 1The abbreviations used are: MPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorMan-6-Pmannose 6-phosphateCD-MPRcation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptorP-MPO4-6-mannose1The abbreviations used are: MPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorMan-6-Pmannose 6-phosphateCD-MPRcation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptorP-MPO4-6-mannose Soluble acid hydrolases are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum where they undergo N-glycosylation along with other secreted proteins. However, in the Golgi, these acid hydrolases acquire a recognition marker on their N-linked oligosaccharides, mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P), which serves as a high affinity ligand for the MPRs. The MPR-hydrolase complexes are then transported to a prelysosomal compartment where the acidic pH of the compartment causes the MPR to release the hydrolase. The acid hydrolase is subsequently packaged into lysosomes, whereas the receptor is free to cycle back to the Golgi or move to the plasma membrane (1Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

Recent studies have demonstrated that both MPRs are required for the efficient targeting of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome (4Koster A. Saftig P. Matzner U. von Figura K. Peters C. Pohlmann R.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3430-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the two MPRs are both capable of high affinity binding of phosphomannosyl residues, they exhibit only limited (∼24%) sequence identity between their extracytoplasmic ligand binding regions (6Lobel P.

Over the last 10 years, significant progress has been made in understanding the specificity of carbohydrate recognition by the MPRs. Inhibition studies using chemically synthesized oligomannosides or neoglycoproteins have shown that the presence of Man-6-P at a terminal position represents the major determinant of receptor binding (8Distler J.J.

A similar study using monosaccharides that differed from Man-6-P by a single substituent demonstrated that the phosphate group and the axial 2-hydroxyl of mannose are critical for receptor binding (10Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7970-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical modifications (11Stein M. Meyer H.E. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studies have been conducted to begin to identify the structural determinants of the MPRs that are critical for carbohydrate recognition. An arginine residue has been identified that is conserved in the Man-6-P binding sites of both MPRs and that when changed to either a conservative (Lys) or nonconservative (Ala) amino acid results in the loss of ligand binding activity. We have recently solved the structure of a glycosylation-deficient form of the extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR (Asn81/STOP155) complexed with Man-6-P (1M6P) which has confirmed the importance of this conserved arginine residue and has identified additional residues surrounding the ligand in the binding pocket (7Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite these recent findings, it remains to be determined how the MPRs interact with newly synthesized acid hydrolases, a heterogeneous population of more than 40 enzymes that differ in a number of properties including the extent of phosphorylation of theirN-linked oligosaccharide chains. Although it is clear that the terminal Man-6-P is the major determinant of receptor binding, several studies indicate that the MPRs recognize an extended oligosaccharide structure, which includes the Man-6-Pα1,2Man sequence, to achieve high affinity binding (8Distler J.J.

To further clarify the structural basis by which the MPRs recognize phosphorylated oligosaccharides, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR complexed with pentamannosyl phosphate. All chemicals unless otherwise specified were purchased from Sigma. Phosphomannan from Hansenula holstiiwas the kind gift of Dr. M. E. Slodki of the Northern Regional Research Center (Peoria, IL). Penta-d-mannose 6-monophosphate [α-d-Man6PO4(1,3)-α-d-Man(1,3)-α-d-Man(1,3)-α-d-Man(1,2)-α-d-Man] was prepared from the high molecular weight phosphomannan of H. holstii (Y.2448) as described previously (16Bretthauer R.K. Kaczorowski G.J. Weise M.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The glycosylation-deficient extracytoplasmic domain (Asn81/STOP155) of the bovine CD-MPR was generated as described previously (17Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and expressed in Trichoplusia ni 5B1–4 (High Five) insect cells. Recombinant Asn81/STOP155 was purified to near homogeneity by pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (18Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CD-MPR was extensively dialyzed against buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMnCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.4, to remove the Man-6-P present from the above purification. The protein was then concentrated to ∼1.8 mg/ml prior to incubation overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm pentamannosyl phosphate. Crystallization was carried out at 19 °C by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method (19McPherson A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) by mixing equal volumes (1 μl:1 μl) of the purified bovine CD-MPR (10 mg/ml) with the precipitating solution ((25% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 5000 monomethyl ether (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI), 0.2 mammonium acetate in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer pH 6.5)). The crystal was mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary tube, and diffraction data were collected at 4 °C on an R-axis IIC image plate detector system with a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA with a graphite monochromator. Still photographs indicated that the crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell parametersa = 42.8 Å, b = 79.3 Å,c = 55.6 Å, and β = 100.3 °. Assuming two monomers/asymmetric unit, the calculated Matthews' coefficient is 2.7 Å3/Da (20Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7893) Google Scholar). A single native data set was collected to 1.85 Å resolution at 4 °C. The diffraction data were processed with the DENZO package (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Rotation and translation searches were performed using all diffraction data between 15 and 4 Å resolution. The rotation search produced two peaks that are related by the 2-fold axis of the dimer molecule that corresponds to the noncrystallographic symmetry in the asymmetric unit (Table II). The translation search was carried out using a solution with the highest rotation function value of 6.37. This gave an initial R factor of 34.7%. Ten cycles of rigid body refinement were subsequently carried out treating each monomer (A and B) as a rigid unit. This lowered the R value to 33.0% using 10 to 3 Å resolution data.Table IIMolecular replacement solutionsEulerian anglesRotation functionPatterson correlationθ1θ2θ3degrees95.2072.50137.556.370.347260.5490.00218.876.010.33691.0375.00148.974.970.346Translation functionVector (along crystallographic axes)Peak height/ςÅa = 12.81c = 13.6722.64 Open table in a new tab At this stage, the structure was refined using all data to 1.8 Å resolution using X-PLOR with manual adjustments between refinement cycles on a Silicon Graphics workstation using Turbo graphics software (24Roussel Cambillau Turbo, Version 4.2. Biographics, LCCMB, Marseille, France1994Google Scholar). In general, one round of refinement consisted of Powell positional refinement, simulated annealing from 3000 to 300 K, and a second positional refinement. Temperature factor refinement was also employed in the later cycles. Bulk solvent correction for the reflection data was applied in later cycles of refinement. After each round of refinement, both Fo − Fcand 2Fo − Fc difference Fourier maps were calculated. When attempting to clarify residues 38–43, which were not well defined in the initial electron density map, alanine residues were initially substituted. These residues were changed to the appropriate native residues upon improvement of the electron density maps. The individual mannose rings of pentamannosyl phosphate were added at various stages of refinement based on the clarity of the electron density map. Two N-acetylglucosamine molecules were fitted to each monomer mid-way through the refinement procedure. Finally, water molecules were assigned when densities greater than 3.5 ς and within 3.2 Å of a potential hydrogen-bonding partner were observed in the Fo − Fc electron density map. The bovine CD-MPR consists of a 28-residue amino-terminal signal sequence, a 159-residue extracytoplasmic domain, a single 25-residue transmembrane domain, and a 67-residue carboxyl-terminal domain (25Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1987; 50: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The CD-MPR exists as a dimer (7Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M.

J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In many species the presence of divalent cations, such as Mn+2, enhance the binding affinity of the receptor (10Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S.

We have previously shown that a truncated, glycosylation-deficient form of the bovine CD-MPR (Asn81/STOP155) binds β-glucuronidase with an affinity identical to that of the full-length wild-type receptor (18Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Asn81/STOP155, which consists of residues 1–154 of the mature protein, has four out of its five potentialN-glycosylation sites removed by replacing the asparagine residues at positions 31, 57, 68, and 87 with glutamine and utilizes the remaining N-glycosylation site at position 81 (17Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have determined and refined the structure of Asn81/STOP155 complexed with pentamannosyl phosphate [α-d-Man-6-P-(1,3)-α-d-Man(1,3)-α-d-Man(1,3)-α-d-Man(1,2)-α-d-Man], an oligosaccharide that has been used extensively to purify the MPRs by affinity chromatography (29Hoflack B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12008-12014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the bovine Asn81/STOP155 CD-MPR bound to pentamannosyl phosphate has been refined to 1.85 Å with good geometry. Table I summarizes the data collection and refinement statistics. Analysis of the final structure by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) yielded all nonproline and nonglycine residues in either the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The first residue with visible electron density is Glu3, and the electron density for both peptide chains of the dimer is continuous through the carboxyl-terminal Ser154. Only the twoN-acetylglucosamine residues of the oligosaccharide chain at Asn81 are visible, suggesting that the remainder of the oligosaccharide is flexible. Although the exact structure of this oligosaccharide is not known, removal of the carbohydrate by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H 2N. M. Dahms, unpublished results. demonstrates that the oligosaccharide contains two N-acetylglucosamine and at least four mannose residues. A comparison of the two peptide chains of the dimer reveals that they are virtually identical with a root mean square deviation between backbone atoms of 0.55 Å for the entire polypeptide chain. We have recently reported the structure of the bovine CD-MPR bound to Man-6-P (7Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The overall structure of the CD-MPR bound to pentamannosyl phosphate is very similar to that of the receptor bound to Man-6-P (Fig. 1). The root mean square deviation between the corresponding monomers of the two structures, excluding loop A, is 0.66 Å and demonstrates that the structures are virtually identical. The protein is comprised of an amino-terminal α-helix that leads into a four stranded, antiparallel β-sheet oriented orthogonally over another β-sheet composed of the remaining five β-strands of the protein. The loops between strands 1 and 2 (loop A), 3 and 4 (loop B), and 6 and 7 (loop C) enclose the ligand binding pocket. The six cysteine residues of the molecule are involved in three disulfide bonds (Cys6-Cys52, Cys106-Cys141, and Cys119-Cys153). The most striking difference between these structures lies in loop A (residues 38–43). The previously reported structure utilizing the smaller Man-6-P ligand showed that this region was not well defined, indicating its dynamic nature. In the presence of the larger ligand, loop A adopts a more ordered structure, as demonstrated by its clearly discernable electron density, and is drawn toward the binding pocket by 1–3 Å. The C loop containing residues 102–105, which is located in the region near the phosphate in the binding pocket, has also shifted toward the phosphate group, and the main chain amide group of Asn104 has rotated by approximately 80 ° (ψ= 28 from ψ= -50), thereby altering some of the contacts between ligand and receptor. Previous inhibition studies have indicated that the MPRs recognize at least two mannose residues of the oligosaccharide chain (8Distler J.J. Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21687-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tomoda H. Ohsumi Y. Ichikawa Y. Srivastava O.P. Kishimoto Y. Lee Y.C. Carbohyd. Res. 1991; 213: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To analyze the interaction of the MPRs with an oligosaccharide, we have now solved the structure of the Asn81/STOP155 CD-MPR complexed to pentamannosyl phosphate. Fig. 2depicts the electron density map (2Fo − Fc) of the ligand contoured at 1 ς. The phosphate group and terminal three sugar rings exhibit clearly observable electron density. The electron density of the fourth mannose ring is only partially visible at the 1 ς level. Modeling of a sugar ring into this region results in a slight (0.4, 0.1%) increase in R andR free values upon refinement. This ring also appeared to make no contacts with the polypeptide, and therefore, it was omitted from the final structure. In this structure we show the phosphate moiety is essentially buried in the protein with only 12 Å2 (8%) solvent accessible. The mannose rings become progressively more solvent-accessible as their location is more distal (terminal mannose (I) = 3%, penultimate mannose (II) = 38%, and prepenultimate mannose (III) = 62%) from the phosphate group. The prepenultimate mannose ring extends to the protein surface (Figs.3 and4).Figure 3A, stereo diagram of the ligand binding pocket of CD-MPR complexed to pentamannosyl phosphate.

Molecular surfaces were generated for the terminal three sugar residues of pentamannosyl phosphate (solid yellow) as well as CD-MPR (red mesh). Only surfaces within 1.4 Å of each other are shown.

The interactions between the polypeptide and the terminal phosphomannose moiety are essentially the same in the two structures, except there is a minor difference in the distance between the C-4 hydroxyl of the terminal sugar and the terminal NH of the guanidine group of Arg135. From comparison of the bonding schemes we may conclude that the presence of additional mannose rings does not affect the binding of the terminal residue. However, as discussed above, the presence of the additional rings results in a slight collapse of the binding pocket because of the change in positioning of loops A and C. Loop A is tethered in place by residues Asp43 and Tyr45, which make hydrogen bond contacts with the penultimate sugar ring. The structures of several other mannose binding lectins have been determined in both the presence of a monosaccharide as well as a di- or trisaccharide. Concanavalin A is an extensively studied legume lectin that specifically binds the trimannoside core found in allN-linked glycans. Naismith and Field (31Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) reported the structure of a concanavalin A-trimannoside complex (2.3 Å resolution); when this structure was compared with the structure of concanavalin A complexed to methyl α-mannoside at 2.0 Å resolution (32Naismith J.H. Emmerich C. Habash J. Harrop S.J. Helliwell J.R. Hunter W.N. Raftery J. Kalb-Gilboa J. Yariv J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the root mean square deviation between the two structures for all cα atoms was 0.28 Å (31Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It was observed that residues 118–123 as well as the loops at residues 161 and 204 remained disordered in the presence of the trisaccharide (31Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, none of these regions are involved in binding ligand unlike the case of loop A in the CD-MPR, which becomes more ordered in the presence of an oligosaccharide and does in fact contain residues that interact with the longer ligand. In the case of the legume lectins, isolectin I of Lathyrus ochrus and pea lectin, there is no discernable change in structure upon binding a tri- or disaccharide compared with a monosaccharide (33Bourne Y. Rouge P. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18161-18165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rini J.M. Hardman K.D. Einspahr H. Suddath F.L. Carver J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10126-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, when compared with other mannose binding lectins, the CD-MPR appears to be distinct in that the presence of an oligosaccharide orders the binding site. A bound oligosaccharide may have a greater influence on the binding site structure of CD-MPR compared with other mannose binding lectins because of the depth of the binding pocket. The binding site of CD-MPR penetrates into the molecule, whereas the other mannose binding lectins interact with the oligosaccharide on the surface. In the case ofErythrina corallodendron lectin, only the penultimate sugar makes one direct hydrogen-bond contact with the protein (35Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the structure of isolectin I of L. ochrus, the prepenultimate and penultimate sugars of a trisaccharide do not directly contact the protein. Only the terminal mannose establishes direct hydrogen bonds to this lectin, whereas the remaining sugar interactions are mediated through water molecules (33Bourne Y. Rouge P. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18161-18165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although pea lectin was crystallized in the presence of a trisaccharide, only one sugar moiety exhibits visible electron density (34Rini J.M. Hardman K.D. Einspahr H. Suddath F.L. Carver J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10126-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concanavalin A contacts three sugar residues upon binding, but it does so along the surface of the protein in a shallow groove rather than a cleft (31Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) as do many of the legume isolectin I lectins (36Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The binding site architecture of the CD-MPR appears to be unique among the lectins. The binding site is a deep cleft with the phosphate and terminal mannose positioned against the bottom. The bottom of the cleft is formed by residues Gln66, Arg111, and Tyr143. These residues are located in β-strands 3, 7, and 9, respectively. The sides of the cleft are formed by residues in loops A (Asp43 and Tyr45), B (Gln68), and C (Asp103, Asn104, and His105) in addition to the loop connecting β-strands 8 and 9 (Arg135) (Fig. 3). Our studies show that this binding site configuration allows for protein contacts to be made to three mannose rings. As previously stated, Asn81/STOP155 is a glycosylation-deficient form of the receptor in which Gln68 has replaced the asparagine residue found in the wild-type receptor. It is unclear whether the shorter asparagine side chain at this position in the wild-type CD-MPR will provide this interaction. However,"

Certain tumor types preferentially activate either cdk4 or cdk6, suggesting that these kinases may not be equivalently oncogenic in all cell types. Although it is clear that cdk4 can act as an oncogene at least in part by evading inhibition by p16INK4a, the role of cdk6 in tumorigenesis is less well understood. To investigate the consequences of aberrant expression of cdk6, the requirements for proliferation caused by cdk6 overexpression were studied. cdk6-transfected U2OS cells displayed an accelerated progression through G1 phase that was dependent on kinase activity and that did not correlate with p27 binding. Furthermore, a mutation that prevents cdk6 interaction with INK4 proteins (cdk6R31C) was found to inactivate the proliferative effect of cdk6 and increase cytoplasmic localization, despite the fact that this mutant could phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein in vitro. Together, these data suggest a role for the cdk6 INK4 interaction domain in the generation of functional, nuclear cdk6 complexes and demonstrate the importance of elevated cdk6 kinase activity in G1 acceleration.

In mammalian cells, the regulation of cell division is tightly controlled through a series of checkpoints within the cell cycle, including the restriction point in late G1 phase, a checkpoint that determines commitment to DNA replication. The restriction point may be viewed as the culmination of activation of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, enzymes that govern cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of key regulatory substrates. Specifically, the cyclin D proteins and their associated kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: cdkcyclin-dependent kinaseRbretinoblastomapRbRb proteinHAhemagglutininBrdUrd5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate1The abbreviations used are: cdkcyclin-dependent kinaseRbretinoblastomapRbRb proteinHAhemagglutininBrdUrd5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate 4 and cdk6, function early in G1 phase of the cell cycle to link growth regulatory signals to the control of cell division. Both cdk4 and cdk6 can be activated by all three D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) and are thought to function as positive effectors of G1progression (1Matsushime H. Ewen M. Strom D. Kato J.

Activation of cdk4 and cdk6 allows progression from G1 phase to the start of DNA synthesis in normal eukaryotic cells by phosphorylating and inactivating the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). This initial modification of pRb by cdk4/cdk6-dependent phosphorylation may be followed by further phosphorylation by cyclin E/cdk2 complexes and ultimately relieves repression of E2F-dependent promoters, allowing the transcription of S phase genes and the onset of DNA replication (for review, see Ref. 5Weinberg R.

Kinase activity is regulated by the periodic synthesis and destruction of the cyclin subunits, by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the kinase subunit, and through complex formation with two families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) (6Morgan D. Nature. 1995; 474: 131-134Crossref Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). The CIP/KIP family of inhibitors includes p21, p27, and p57, which associate with several different cyclin/cdk complexes (7El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M.

These proteins may act as stimulators of cdk activity as well as inhibitors because p21 has been shown to both activate and inactivate cyclin/cdk complexes, perhaps dependent on stoichiometry (12Zhang H.

Nature. 1995; 474: 131-134Crossref Scopus (2916) Google Scholar) complexes may be required for the proper formation of these complexes (14Cheng M.G. Olivier P. Diehl J.D. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). In contrast to the CIP/KIP family, the INK family of CKIs (p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) specifically inhibits the activities of cdk4 and cdk6 by binding directly to the kinase subunit, disallowing association with the activating cyclin D subunit (Refs. 15Brotherton D.

Aberrant cell proliferation and tumorigenesis can result from deregulated activity of cdk4 and/or cdk6 with subsequent, inappropriate inactivation of pRb in several tissue types. This increased kinase activity can result from overexpression of the regulatory subunit, cyclin D1, and also from amplification of the kinase-encoding gene. In addition, deletion or inactivation of the gene encoding p16INK4a frequently leads to dysregulated cdk4/cdk6 activity in human tumors, as do mutations in cdk4 that prevent its association with p16INK4a (18Motokura T.

In most cases, tumors containing hyperactivated cdk4 or cdk6 retain intact RB alleles, suggesting that such kinase activations render pRb unable to control proliferation. These findings indicate that deregulated cdk4 and cdk6 activity can substitute for RB mutations and define the “pRb pathway” of genetic events that have the identical phenotypic consequence of pRb inactivation and inappropriate proliferation. A further oncogenic consequence of excess cyclin D/cdk4(6) expression is sequestration of p21 and p27 with consequent elevated activity of cyclin E/cdk2, a function that may be an extension of a physiological role of cyclin D/cdk4 (6Morgan D. Nature. 1995; 474: 131-134Crossref Scopus (2916) Google Scholar) complexes (14Cheng M.G. Olivier P. Diehl J.D. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J.

To better understand the consequences of dysregulated cdk6 expression as is seen in some tumor types (30Timmermann S. Hinds P.W. Munger K. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 361-370PubMed Google Scholar, 31Easton J. Wei T. Lahti J. Kidd V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2624-2632PubMed Google Scholar), we began by studying the requirements for proliferation caused by ectopic cdk6 expression. cdk6-transfected cells demonstrated accelerated transit through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This effect of cdk6 on cell cycle progression was dependent on the INK4 binding domain, because a cdk6 mutant (R31C) unable to associate with INK4 proteins did not show G1 acceleration. In addition, this mutant protein failed to accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear localization and function of cdk6 is dependent on the INK4 interaction domain. Furthermore, catalytic activity of cdk6 was required for G1acceleration in this assay, because a catalytically inactive NFG mutant slowed S phase entry rather than accelerated it, despite an ability to form complexes with cyclin D1 and p27. Thus, cdk6 activity is limiting for G1-to-S phase progression, even in tumor cells such as U2OS, which lacks p16INK4a, strongly supporting a role for cdk6-specific phosphorylation events in G1 progression. The kinase expression plasmids pCMVcdk6 and HA-tagged cdk6, pCMVcdk6HA, pCMVcdk6NFG, the vector pCMVneobam, and the CD20-encoding plasmid pCMVCD20 were kindly provided by Dr. Sander van den Heuvel (32van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). pCMVBamNeo, the vector containing the cDNAs, has been described previously (33Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Wilson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). U2OS cells were transiently transfected with 15 μg of kinase-expressing plasmid plus 5 μg of pCMVCD20 (where appropriate) and sheared herring sperm DNA to a total of 30 μg by calcium phosphate precipitation essentially as described by Chen and Okayama (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). DNA precipitates remained on the cell monolayer for 17 h, and cells were harvested 24 h after removal of DNA precipitates unless otherwise noted. U2OS cells were maintained in 10% fetal calf serum at 5% CO2. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) experiments, transfected U2OS cells were harvested in PBS with 0.1% EDTA at 24 h after removal of DNA precipitates. Cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody to human CD20 (Pharmingen) and ethanol fixed and stained with propidium iodide for DNA content. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry of CD20-positive (FITC-positive) cells using a Coulter cytometer and Multicycle DNA analysis. In FACS studies of nocodazole-treated cells, nocodazole was added at 24 h after removal of DNA precipitates to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml for 18 h. In FACS studies following mitotic shake, mitotic fractions were harvested by gentle pipetting followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm at 25 °C for 5 min. Cells were washed three times with media to remove nocodazole and replated in 10% fetal calf serum media. Cells were harvested at time points indicated and prepared for FACS as described above. In 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation experiments nocodazole was added to 100 ng/ml approximately 5 h after removal of DNA precipitates and remained on cells 18 h. BrdUrd was added to a final concentration of 10 μm at the time points indicated. Coverslips from BrdUrd experiments were fixed in 70% ethanol, 50 mm glycine, pH 2.0, and incubated with BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and polyclonal peptide antibodies to cdk6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-21) for 60 min at 37 °C. Secondary antibodies rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were incubated 30 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount. For time courses, mitotic shake was performed as described above, and coverslips were fixed at the indicated time points. For immunofluorescence without BrdUrd, coverslips were stained in methanol followed by acetone. Immunofluorescence was performed with antibodies indicated above, as well as cdk6 polyclonal sera of Meyerson (4Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) and cdk6 monoclonal sera Ab-3 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) for 60 min at 37 °C. Secondary antibody staining was performed as described above or with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). In relevant cases, cells were counterstained by Hoechst stain. All photography was performed on a Leica microscope with Sony digital imaging. For immunoblot and immunoprecipitation experiments, 1.25 × 106 U2OS cells were transfected as described above, harvested 24 h after removal of DNA precipitates, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in E1A lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Extracts were incubated for 20 min on ice with mixing and clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide denaturing gels, transferred to supported nitrocellulose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and blotted using antisera as noted. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 2 μg of polyclonal cdk6 antisera C-21. Transfected U2OS cells were lysed in E1A lysis buffer as described above, and 200 μg (cyclin D1) or 400 μg (p18, p27) of extract was immunoprecipitated for 60 min at 4 °C with mixing. 35 μl of swollen protein A-Sepharose beads were added for an additional 30 min, washed four times with 1 ml of E1A lysis buffer, and separated on denaturing acrylamide gels. Antibodies used were p18 polyclonal N-20 antibody (1:3000) (Santa Cruz), p27 monoclonal antibody (1:2500) (Transduction Laboratories), and cyclin D1 monoclonal DCS-6 antibody (1:200) (Neomarkers). For kinase assays, SAOS-2 cells at 80% confluency were transfected with 10 μg of pCMVD1 and 10 μg of pCMVcdk6HA or cdk6mutantHA in the pCMV vector by calcium phosphate as described above. DNA precipitates remained on cells for 10 h and were harvested 36 h after removal of DNA precipitates. Cells were harvested in D-IP kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 2.5 mm EGTA; 0.1% Tween 20; 10% glycerol with the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and Pefablock and phosphatase inhibitors sodium orthovanadate (100 μm), sodium flouride (10 mm), and betaglycerophosphate (10 mm)) and incubated on ice for 20 min with gentle mixing. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. 100 μl of 12CA5 antibody was preincubated with 30 μl of swollen protein A-Sepharose beads for at least 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. 100 μg of cell lysate was added for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. Beads were washed three times with D-IP buffer and three times with kinase reaction buffer (250 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions were performed with HA-immunoprecipitated extracts at 37 °C for 30 min in kinase reaction buffer with 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32 P]ATP and 0.5 μg of C-terminal GST-Rb (amino acids 769–921) (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) as substrate. Reactions were stopped by addition of protein sample buffer with 10% betamercaptoethanol and placed on ice. Samples were boiled and separated on 12.5% denaturing acrylamide gel, Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained to ensure equal loading and addition of Rb substrate, and exposed to film overnight. The effect of ectopic expression of cdk6 on cell cycle progression was determined by FACS studies in transfected U2OS cells. These human osteosarcoma cells produce wild-type pRb but lack p16INK4a, a defect that is thought to allow constitutive phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb. In light of this, it was surprising to observe that cells transfected with plasmid encoding cdk6 consistently showed a higher percentage of S phase cells than did vector-transfected cells in the same experiment (Fig.1). To confirm that this increase in DNA content measured by FACS truly reflected an increase in S phase cells, transfected cell cultures were also analyzed using BrdUrd incorporation as a measure of S phase. U2OS cells transfected with pCMVcdk6 or pCMVvector were pulsed with BrdUrd, fixed, and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using both anti-BrdUrd and anti-cdk6 antibodies. Transfected cells were identified as those that demonstrated intense fluorescence with anti-cdk6 antibody and were scored as either BrdUrd-positive or BrdUrd-negative. The results of at least two independent transfections (≥700 kinase-positive cells counted) demonstrated that 34% of vector-transfected cells were BrdUrd-positive, whereas in the same experiment, 50% of cdk6-transfected cells were BrdUrd-positive (Fig. 1 B). These data closely match the results of FACS analysis shown in Fig.1 A and indicate that cells transfected with cdk6 showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of S phase population as compared with vector-transfected cells. The observed increase in S phase cells conferred by cdk6 could result from either an S phase cell cycle block or from decreased transit time through G1 or G2/M. To distinguish between these possibilities, transfected cells were treated with the mitotic inhibitor nocodazole. In the presence of nocodazole, an S phase delay would reduce the number of cells able to enter G2/M. However, if the increased S phase population was due to a shortening of G1 phase (or G2/M phase) cells would arrest in mitosis under nocodazole treatment. At 24 h after removal of DNA precipitates, parallel sets of transfected U2OS cells were either harvested or treated with nocodazole for 18 h. A p16 control for nocodazole arrest demonstrated that p16 transfected cells maintained a G1 phase peak as expected with a G1-arresting inhibitor (Fig. 2 A). In the same experiment, cdk6-transfected cells accumulated in mitosis in the presence of nocodazole, indicating that the S phase increase seen by FACS and BrdUrd incorporation studies (Fig. 1) was not due to a profound S phase delay but was more likely a result of a decreased G1 or G2/M transit time. To determine whether ectopic cdk6 expression decreased G1phase transit time, FACS analysis was performed on synchronized cell populations. Transfected U2OS cells were treated with nocodazole for 18 h followed by shaking and replating in nocodazole-free medium. The cells were harvested at 4 and 8 h after mitotic shake, and DNA profiles of CD20-positive cells were obtained by FACS as shown in Fig.2 B. At 4 h after mitotic shake, cdk6-transfected cells showed a synchronized DNA profile indistinguishable from that of vector transfected cells. Interestingly, at 8 h post-mitotic shake, cdk6-transfected cells showed a shift toward S phase (increased DNA content) as compared with vector-transfected cells. Together, these experiments indicate that cdk6-transfected U2OS cells pass through G1 phase faster than vector-transfected cells, demonstrating a cdk6-dependent acceleration of G1 transit in U2OS cells. Also shown in Fig. 2 Bare DNA profiles of a mutant form of cdk6, cdk6R31C. cdk6R31C contains a mutation of the arginine residue corresponding to Arg-24 in cdk4. Mutation of this residue (Arg-24 to Cys) in cdk4 was identified in a human melanoma and prevents binding to the kinase inhibitor, p16 (24Wolfel J. Hauer M. Schneider J. Serrano M. Wölfel C. Klehmann-Hieb E. De Plaen E. Hankelen T. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cdk6R31C did not demonstrate the shift toward S phase seen with the wild-type cdk6, suggesting a role for the INK4 binding domain in the G1 acceleration function of cdk6. The lack of G1 acceleration exhibited by cdk6R31C could be due to an unexpected loss of catalytic activity or to the disruption of another property of cdk6 required for this G1 acceleration function in U2OS cells. The acceleration of G1 phase caused by ectopic expression of cdk6 could be the result of direct catalytic activity of the introduced kinase subunit phosphorylating substrates such as pRb to shorten G1 phase. Alternatively, excess kinase subunits could titrate inhibitory proteins to allow activation of other cdks and concomitant cell cycle advance. Titration of inhibitory proteins has been observed to occur upon introduction of both functional and nonfunctional kinases in another system, apparently through titration of p21 (28Latham K.M. Eastman S.W. Wong A. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4445-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and cyclin D/cdk4(6) complexes have been suggested to sequester p27 in the absence of anti-mitogenic signals (26Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 27Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine the properties of cdk6 required to accelerate G1 progression in U2OS cells, a series of cdk6 mutants compromised in their ability to bind to INK4 protein (cdk6R31C), hydrolyze ATP (cdk6NFG) (32van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), or both (cdk6R31CNFG) were used in cell cycle analyses. The biochemical characterization of these mutant proteins is presented in Fig. 3. All cdk6 mutants consistently showed approximately equal protein levels in transfected U2OS lysates (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with the predicted result, we found that the R31C mutation prevented interaction with p16INK4a (data not shown) and p18INK4c in transfected U2OS lysates (Fig. 3 B), as has also been observed in breast cancer cell lines (35Lapointe J. Lachance Y. Labrie Y. Labrie C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4586-4589PubMed Google Scholar). The p18INK4c interaction is particularly relevant to U2OS cells because these cells lack p16INK4a yet express detectable levels of p18INK4c bound to cdk6 (data not shown). Disruption of INK4 binding occurred whether the mutation was present alone (cdk6R31C) or in combination (cdk6R31CNFG) with the catalytically inactive mutation (Fig.3 B). Importantly, the R31C mutation does not disrupt the ability of cdk6 to bind cyclin D1 or p27 in immunoprecipitations of transfected U2OS extracts (Fig. 3, C and D). In these experiments, immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with anti-cdk6 antibody to ensure that equivalent levels of cdk6 protein were compared in binding studies, and control immunoblots of the lysates demonstrated that cyclin D1 or p27 levels were equivalent in extract of transfected cells (data not shown). Thus, the cdk6R31C mutation that corresponds to the tumor-derived cdk4R24C mutation (24Wolfel J. Hauer M. Schneider J. Serrano M. Wölfel C. Klehmann-Hieb E. De Plaen E. Hankelen T. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) specifically disrupts cdk6 binding to INK4 proteins without altering interaction with other known cdk6 partners. To ensure that the R31C mutant form of cdk6 retained catalytic activity, the cdk6 mutants were also examined for kinase activity in transfected SAOS-2 cells (used in these assays because they contain low-levels of endogenous cyclin D1 and cdk6 activity). As shown in Fig.3 E, when co-transfected with cyclin D1 and immunoprecipitated with antibody to the HA tag, HAcdk6 phosphorylated the C-terminal GST-Rb substrate. Conversely, cdk6NFG containing the kinase-inactivating mutation showed no kinase activity above vector-transfected background. Significantly, cdk6R31C-transfected extracts reproducibly showed in vitro kinase activity greater than that observed with wild-type cdk6 extracts, as expected for a mutant that can evade the p16INK4a present at high level in SAOS-2 cells. Anti-HA immunoblots of these extracts confirmed that the level of cdk6R31C was at or below the level of wild-type cdk6 protein (not shown). Interestingly, the double mutant cdk6R31CNFG had a slightly elevated activity relative to the inactive NFG mutant. This result suggests that a low level cdk6NFG activity is unmasked in cdk6R31CNFG by the disruption of INK binding. Thus, the cdk6R31C mutation disrupts INK4 protein binding but did not disrupt intrinsic catalytic activity of this cdk6 protein, similar to studies demonstrating retention of kinase activity by the p16INK4a binding-defective mutant of cdk4, cdk4R24C (24Wolfel J. Hauer M. Schneider J. Serrano M. Wölfel C. Klehmann-Hieb E. De Plaen E. Hankelen T. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Importantly, these binding studies and kinase assays also indicate that these mutations are not causing gross structural alterations in the cdk6 protein. These reagents are thus ideal for assessing the potential roles of catalytic activity and INK4 titration in the cdk6-mediated acceleration of G1 phase in transfected U2OS cells. The cdk6 mutants described above were used to further examine cdk6 function in G1 acceleration of U2OS cells. To test the ability of mutant forms of cdk6 to decrease G1 transit time, BrdUrd incorporation was used to measure S phase entry by the cdk6 mutants. In these experiments BrdUrd was added to transfected U2OS cells 4 h after mitotic shake and BrdUrd incorporation was measured at 5, 7, and 10 h after mitotic shake. The results of these experiments in which cumulative BrdUrd incorporation was measured are presented in Fig. 4. These BrdUrd studies indicated that the kinase inactive mutant, cdk6NFG, showed a slower entry into S phase as compared with the vector-transfected control. In fact, cdk6NFG showed a greatly decreased percent of cells in S phase at all time points measured (27% at 10 h). FACS analysis after nocodazole treatment suggested that this decrease in S phase entry was due to a G1 delay because a significant G1fraction persisted in nocodazole-arrested cells (not shown). A similar delay to S phase entry has been observed with cdk4NFG (36Jiang H. Chou H. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, catalytic activity in addition to inhibitor titration appears to be required for the G1 acceleration observed with wild-type cdk6 because cdk6NFG was incapable of increasing the S phase"

In this work we identify by mutagenesis that the acylation sites on PLD1 are cysteine residues 240 and 241, with the cysteine at position 241 accounting for most but not all of the modification. Replacement of both cysteine residues with either serines or alanines resulted in a mutant protein that contained undetectable [3 H]palmitate. In comparison with the wild type protein, the double mutant showed reduced catalytic activity in vivo, whereas its activity in vitro was unchanged. In addition, the localization of the double mutant was altered in comparison with the wild type protein, whereas wild type PLD1 is primarily on intracellular membranes and on punctate structures, the double mutant was on plasma membrane. Because cysteines 240 and 241 lie within a putative pleckstrin homology domain of PLD1, it is likely that fatty acylation on these residues modulates the function of the PLD1 pleckstrin homology domain.

PLD1 hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid and choline. Hydrolysis is stimulated in vivo and in vitro by ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf), Rho, and protein kinase C, and it requires phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (3Singer W.D. Brown H.A.

PLD1 is found primarily on intracellular membranes where it may regulate the formation of transport intermediates (5Ktistakis N.T. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, PLD2, which has identical hydrolytic activity, is not stimulated greatly by any proteins, and it only requires PIP2 for activity. PLD2 is localized primarily on the plasma membrane (1Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The sequence elements which account for the differential localization of the two PLD genes have not been established.It is equally unknown by what mechanism(s) the PLD proteins become membrane bound. They contain neither a transmembrane domain nor a canonical signal sequence for lipid modification, yet, at least for PLD1, more than 90% of the protein is found with the membrane fraction after fractionation.We have reported recently (6Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that PLD1 is fatty acylated as shown by labeling of PLD1-expressing cells with [3 H]palmitate and immunoprecipitation. A catalytically inactive point mutant (S911A) did not show palmitate labeling, and it was partially redistributed to the cytosol. In addition, treatment of PLD1 with hydroxylamine under conditions that remove the palmitate from the protein resulted in inactive protein in vitro. These results led us to propose that fatty acylation of PLD1 may be important both for catalytic activity and for membrane localization. In this work, we have identified by mutagenesis the two cysteine residues on PLD1 that become labeled with palmitate. The catalytic properties and subcellular localization of the double mutant devoid of palmitate point to a role of fatty acylation in intracellular membrane targeting and activity of PLD1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and PLD1 expression plasmids used in this work were as reported previously (6Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, transfection into COS-7 cells, labeling with Tran35 S-label or with [3 H]palmitate, immunoprecipitation and PLD in vitro assay using as a substrate liposomes with [14 C]phosphatidylcholine were exactly as reported before (6Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).To measure PLD1-induced activity in vivo following transfection of COS-7 cells, we modified a protocol reported by Biet al. (7Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected on 6-well plates on day 0. On day 1 in the evening, they were washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and [3 H]palmitate label (1.5 ml/well containing 100 μCi [3 H]palmitate) was added overnight. The label was made by drying completely the palmitate solution (prepared in ethanol) under a stream of nitrogen and then resuspending in dialyzed serum with vortexing for 5 min before adding the appropriate volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to make up the serum amount to 10%. In some experiments, ethanol was added at this stage. On day 2, the label was removed, and fresh medium containing 3% ethanol was added to the plates for 30 min. At the end of 30 min, cellular lipids were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography exactly as described before (7Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Molecular modeling of the putative PLD1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain on known crystal structures of other PH domains was done as follows. The general alignment of Steed et al. (8Steed P.M. Clark K.L. Boyar W.C. Lasala D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was refined using the PFAM pleckstrin homology domain alignment. The invariant tryptophan residue at position 319 of PLD1 and the N′-terminal 50 residues were used to anchor this alignment. Two PH domain sequences from Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and pleckstrin that had associated structural information were compared with PLD1 as being the closest in sequence. Using the INSIGHT/DISCOVER/HOMOLOGY package of programs on an Indigo II computer from Silicon Graphics, a structural model was produced of PLD1 in comparison with BTK with special emphasis on the N′-terminal region that contains the palmitoylated residues of PLD1. This alignment was centered on two regions of conserved sequences (boxed in red in Fig.7), and it suggested that the palmitoylated cysteines of PLD1 were at the center of an inserted loop of variable length in the full PH domain structural model. The program HOMOLOGY was then used to produce a loop of the desired length and amino acid composition between the two anchored N′-terminal regions. On this calculated loop, the palmitate residues were drawn to scale and were added to the appropriate cysteines.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONLabeling of PLD1 with [3 H]palmitate was sensitive to neutral hydroxylamine treatment after electrophoresis, suggesting that the fatty acid is linked to the protein via a thioester bond on a cysteine residue (6Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequence of PLD1 does not contain a readily identifiable palmitoylation site, we decided to mutate sequentially all the cysteine residues to identify the site of fatty acylation. There are twelve cysteine residues on PLD1 dispersed throughout the 1074-amino acid sequence (Fig.1). Interestingly, none fall within the 4 regions that are conserved between mammalian PLDs and PLD enzymes from other species (labeled CRI, CRII, and HKD in Fig. 1). In the first round of mutagenesis, cysteines at positions 79, 240, 403, 650, 787, 876, and 1004 were changed one by one to serines. These mutant proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated following labeling of the cells either with [35 S]methionine or with [3 H]palmitate (Fig.2 A, the C787S mutant not shown). With the exception of the catalytically inactive S911A mutant, which contains no palmitate label as we reported before, all of the other mutants contained palmitate label. We noted however that, whereas the majority of the mutants showed a good correspondence between palmitate and methionine label, the mutant that changes cysteine 240 into serine showed reduced palmitate label (Fig. 2 A). This residue falls within a region of PLD1 that contains two additional cysteines (PGLNCCGQGRACYR, Fig. 1 boxed region) at positions 241 and 247. We hypothesized that palmitoylation on PLD1 may occur on more than one cysteine residues that are in close proximity as is the case for other palmitoylated proteins (9Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and we decided to mutate the additional cysteines in the region either singly or in combination. Analysis of these mutants by parallel [3 H]palmitate- and [35 S]methionine-labeling revealed that the majority of the palmitate label was on cysteine 241 and that the double mutant C240S/C241S contained no palmitate label (Fig. 2 B, results for C247S not shown). In this experiment, we also analyzed for palmitate labeling an additional catalytically inactive mutant (Fig. 2 B, K898R) (10Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The K898R mutant contained less than the wild type but detectable label, indicating that absence of palmitoylation is not a general property of all catalytically inactive mutants of PLD1 (see also below). Because the palmitoylated sites were revealed in this series of experiments as cysteine residues 240 and 241, we chose not to mutate the remaining cysteine residues at positions 310, 851, and 959 of PLD1.Figure 1Distribution of cysteine residues in the sequence of PLD1. PLD1 is 1074-amino acids long, and contains 12 cysteine residues as shown below the main line. Residues that were mutated in this work are indicated with asterisks. Boxed regions on the main line indicate catalytically conserved regions of PLD1 (CRI, HKD, CRII) and a putative pleckstrin homology domain (PH-like). The boxed region above the main line is a blow-up of amino acids 236–249 containing the fatty acylated cysteine residues identified in this work.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Relative palmitoylation of PLD1 and various mutants. COS cells transfected with PLD1 or with the indicated mutants were labeled with Tran35 S-label or with [3 H]palmitate for 2 or 4 h, respectively. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with PLD1 antibodies and resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. All mutants were done in duplicate and in most cases both isolates were analyzed. Notice in panel A the reduced palmitoylation of C240S, and in panel B the reduced palmitoylation of C240S and C241S and the complete absence of palmitoylation for C240S/C241S. These three mutants were analyzed in three different experiments with identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was of interest to determine the properties of the nonpalmitoylated PLD1 mutant in comparison with the wild type protein in terms of cellular localization and activity. When expressed transiently in COS-7 cells, the wild type PLD1 protein is seen by immunofluorescence on perinuclear regions and on numerous punctate structures (Fig.3 A, two top panels). The nonpalmitoylated double mutant showed a very different distribution: it was absent from perinuclear sites and from punctate structures, but it was instead primarily localized to the plasma membrane (Fig.3 A, two bottom panels). Localization of the double mutant was so dominant on the plasma membrane, that it was consistently difficult in the cells expressing it to discern the location of the nucleus. To eliminate the possibility that this altered localization was somehow caused by the presence of the two serines in place of the cysteine residues, we also mutated residues 240 and 241 into alanines. The resulting double mutant (C240A/C241A) was also devoid of palmitate label, and showed identical localization to the C240S/C241S mutant (results not shown). To eliminate the possibility that this very different localization of the palmitate-free double mutants was somehow caused by artifacts of the expression levels and growth conditions, we have examined their distribution in comparison with the wild type protein under a variety of conditions, especially varying the length of transfection and/or the use of serum after the end of transfection. The double mutants were consistently altered in their localization compared with the wild type PLD1 and were in fact always enriched on the plasma membrane (results not shown). We analyzed the distribution of wild type PLD1 and of various mutants by subcellular fractionation (Fig.3 B). Under conditions where the majority of PLD1 was recovered with the membrane fraction, there was a small increase in the proportion of all three mutants (C240S, C241S, C240S/C241S) recovered in the cytosolic pool (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2and 3 with lanes 5, 6, 8,9, 11, and 12). However, all three mutants showed a substantial proportion (65% for the C240S/C241S) still with the membrane fraction. We concluded from these data that fatty acylation of PLD1 contributes very strongly to its localization on intracellular membranes, but it cannot account completely for the localization of PLD1 on membranes in general.Figure 3Distribution of PLD1 and mutants by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation. A, COS cells transfected with wild type PLD1 or with the C240S/C241S mutant were fixed in methanol and stained with antibodies against the C′-terminal region of PLD1. The bar represents 10 μm. B,COS cells transfected with PLD1 or with the indicated mutants were trypsinized and washed before homogenization. A portion of the post-nuclear supernatant (P) was kept, and the remainder was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was designated cytosol (C) and kept, whereas the pellet containing the membrane fraction (M) was resuspended in buffer of equal volume to the supernatant. All three fractions were adjusted to the same concentration of protein and resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, the blots were probed with antibodies against the N′-terminal region of PLD1 and developed by chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We examined the hydrolytic activity of the nonpalmitoylated PLD1 mutants in comparison with the wild type protein both in vivo and in vitro. COS-7 cells contain relatively high endogenous PLD activity, which can interfere with the detection of PLD activity that is specific for transiently expressed proteins. When activity was measured under standard assay conditions following [3 H]palmitate labeling overnight and subsequent challenge with 3% ethanol, there was a 2–3-fold increase in formation of the PLD-specific phosphatidylethanol product between control cells and those overexpressing PLD1 (Fig.4 A, compare lane 3to lane 4). However, if a small amount of ethanol (0.25–0.5%) was deliberately included during palmitate labeling, we observed that a much clearer difference was evident in phosphatidylethanol formation attributable to the presence of transiently expressed PLD1, even in the absence of additional ethanol stimulation at the end of labeling (Fig. 4 A, comparelane 5 to lane 6). In fact, under those conditions of labeling, subsequent challenge with ethanol did not appreciably increase but rather decreased the difference between control samples and those that contained overexpressed PLD1 (Fig.4 A, compare lane 7 to lane 8). We used both conditions to measure PLD1 and mutant activity in vivo. We found that, in comparison with the wild type protein, the C240S/C241S mutant showed activity reduced by 50–80% (Fig.4 B). Its activity however was not totally eliminated, as was the case for both catalytically inactive point mutants (Fig.4 B, samples S911A and K898R). The differences in activity between the various alleles of PLD1 are reproducible (n= 4), and they do not reflect variations in their expression levels (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4Activity of PLD1 and mutants in vivo. A, COS cells transfected with PLD1 or with a control plasmid (−) were labeled for 16 h with [3 H]palmitate in medium containing dialyzed serum with or without 0.25% ethanol as indicated. After labeling, all the samples were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fresh medium with or without 3% ethanol as indicated was added for 30 min. At the end of 30 min, lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography shown here. The position of migration of some standards (PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PA, phosphatidic acid) as well as the expected migration of phosphatidylethanol is shown on the left.B, COS cells transfected with wild type PLD1 (wt) or with the indicated mutants were labeled as in A, and the lipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography shown here.C, duplicate samples of those shown in B were lysed in detergent and the extracts were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of PLD in each sample was determined by immunoblotting using antibodies to the N′-terminal region of PLD1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A different result was obtained when activity was measured in vitro (Fig. 5). We did not detect any differences in basal or in Arf-stimulated activity of the double mutant in comparison with the wild type protein, under conditions in which the S911A point mutant was indeed catalytically inactive (Fig.5 A). The mutant replacing the cysteine residues with alanines was equally active under those conditions (Fig. 5 B, first six lanes). More importantly, the nonpalmitoylated mutant was as sensitive to pretreatment with neutral hydroxylamine as was the wild type protein (Fig. 5 B, last eight lanes). This last result proves that our earlier suggestion, that hydroxylamine eliminates PLD1 activity by removing the palmitate from the protein, was incorrect, despite the fact that reduction in activity and palmitate removal were dependent to the same extent on hydroxylamine concentration and length of treatment (6Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We can only speculate that hydroxylamine may remove another prosthetic group from PLD1 to render the resultant protein catalytically inactive. In this context we note recent work from Dixon and colleagues (11Gottlin E.B. Rudolph A.E. Zhao Y. Matthews H.R. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) showing that the Nuc endonuclease, which belongs to the PLD superfamily, uses a hydroxylamine-sensitive phosphohistidine intermediate for nucleophilic attack during catalysis.Figure 5Activity of PLD1 and mutants in vitro. Following transfection into COS cells, PLD1 or the indicated mutants were immunoprecipitated using antibodies to the N′-terminal region of PLD1. PLD activity of the immunoprecipitates against 14 C-labeled phosphatidylcholine was determined by thin layer chromatography in the presence or absence of recombinant Arf6 or native Arf (mostly Arf1) as indicated. In experiment 4 (panel B) the immunoprecipitated samples were treated with 1m Tris pH 7 or with 1 m hydroxylamine pH 7 as indicated for 45 min at room temperature. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, PLD activity was determined with or without Arf.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In several respects, the nonpalmitoylated PLD1 that was obtained in this work resembles PLD2: it had a plasma membrane localization, and it was not active in vivo (1Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). However two important points suggest that the difference between PLD1 and PLD2 is not simply a reflection of their palmitoylated state: first, the nonpalmitoylated PLD1 had low basal activity and exhibited Arf-dependent stimulation in our assays making it different in properties than PLD2. Second, inspection of the relevant sequences in PLD1 and PLD2 shows that both proteins contain the relevant cysteine residues (Fig.6). We suggest two possibilities based on our data, which may be relevant in explaining the altered properties of PLD1 and PLD2. In terms of in vivo activity, it is possible that the nonpalmitoylated mutant PLD1 by virtue of relocating to the plasma membrane encounters the same inhibitor(s) responsible for maintaining PLD2 inactive (12Sung T.C. Altshuller Y.M. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In terms of localization, it is possible that PLD1 gains access to intracellular membranes by a mechanism not related to palmitoylation and once there it becomes palmitoylated and is maintained intracellularly. This would imply that the enzyme responsible for PLD1 palmitoylation resides on intracellular membranes, in analogy to palmitoylation of other proteins in an early Golgi compartment (13Schlesinger M.J. Veit M. Schmidt M.F.G. Schlesinger M.J. Lipid Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 2-19Google Scholar), and it is consistent with our observations that fragments of PLD1 and the S911A mutant, none of which localizes correctly, do not contain palmitate (6Manifava M.

In contrast, PLD2 may never have access to this intracellular membrane compartment or it may not become palmitoylated (notice the differences in the sequence surrounding the cysteine residues of PLD1 and PLD2 in Fig. 6) and would follow the “default” localization to the plasma membrane. This hypothesis can be tested by examining the palmitoylation state of PLD2.Figure 6Conservation of cysteine residues 240 and 241 between PLD1 and PLD2. The region containing the relevant cysteines from several PLD1 and PLD2 genes is shown. The number on the left refers to the first amino acid of the region shown.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our data on PLD1 showing that absence of palmitoylation results in plasma membrane targeting appear contradictory to this general rule. Although we cannot resolve this discrepancy with certainty, we suggest an explanation based on the region of PLD1 containing the fatty acylation sites. It has been noted by Steed et al. (8Steed P.M. Clark K.L. Boyar W.C. Lasala D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that the region of PLD1 encompassing residues 220 to 330 contains a PH-like domain. One function of PH domains is to mediate, at least in part, binding to specialized regions of plasma membrane rich in phosphoinositides, especially PIP2 and PIP3 (15Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 16Shaw G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The PH domain region of PLD1 was modeled on the known structure of other PH domains, and the palmitate residues (drawn to scale) were added to the structure at cysteine residues 240 and 241 (Fig.7, palmitates in purple). It is apparent from this model that the palmitate groups are on a loop region between two conserved stretches of the PH domain and could potentially interact with the region of the PH domain responsible for binding phosphoinositides (residues colored cyan and magenta in Fig. 7). Whether this interaction would result in positive or negative effects on the lipid binding cannot be ascertained from the structure. Based on our results we would suggest that the palmitates may obscure the lipid binding region of the PH domain, and, upon palmitate removal, the PH domain may be better exposed and bind phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane. The regulated exposure of the PH domain depending on the palmitoylated state of the loop region may constitute a novel mechanism of regulation of PH domains, and, in the case of PLD1, may contribute to the appearance of PLD1 on the plasma membrane upon certain conditions. This hypothesis can be tested by selected mutagenesis of the PLD1 PH domain and by establishing the lipid-binding characteristics of this domain with or without the fatty acid modification.

Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Affinity panning of a bacteriophage peptide display library identified a set of 114 octapeptides, enriched in aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids, which bound to BiP with high affinity (9Blond-Elguindi S.

The binding motif derived in that study could be best described as Hy(Trp/X)HyXHyXHy, where Hy is a large hydrophobic or aromatic acid and X is any amino acid. Binding normally required that a minimum of any two of the Hy positions be occupied. By comparing the abundance of each of the 20 amino acids at each position in the 114 BiP-binding peptides and 114 nonbinding peptides, a BiP Score algorithm was developed (9Blond-Elguindi S.

A computer program that uses this algorithm predicts BiP-binding sites in natural proteins by scoring amino acid sequences with a moving window of seven residues. To each amino acid, an individual score is assigned, and the sum of the seven scores provides a measure for the binding probability of the heptapeptide. When we previously used the BiP Score program to screen for BiP-binding sites within immunoglobulin chains, the first identified substrates for BiP (14Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), we found that the majority of the antibody sequences had a low probability of binding to BiP, and only a small number of potential binding sites were detected (15Knarr G. Gething M-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ability of synthetic heptapeptides corresponding to potential binding sites in immunoglobulin heavy chains to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP identified several authentic BiP-binding sequences. Peptides with scores ranging from +5 to +10 had a probability of 50% for binding to BiP, rising up to 80% for peptides with scores of ≥10. The predictive power for peptides with negative scores that should not bind to BiP is close to 100% (15Knarr G. Gething M-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The binding sequences were distributed within both the VH and CH domains, and the majority involved residues that participate in contact sites between the the heavy and light chains. We therefore suggested that BiP chaperones the folding and assembly of antibody molecules by binding to hydrophobic regions on the surface of the isolated chains that subsequently participate in interchain contacts (15Knarr G.

Gp160 is the precursor of the HIV type 1 envelope glycoprotein, which is composed of two noncovalently linked subunits gp120 and gp41 (29Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While gp120 is responsible for the adsorption of the virus to the CD4 receptor on the surface of the target cell, the gp41 transmembrane protein mediates cell fusion (30Dalgleish A.G. Beverly P.C.L. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar). Following its synthesis and translocation across the ER membrane, the gp160 precursor becomes heavily glycosylated in the ER lumen, where subsequently the formation of disulfide bridges and interaction with BiP takes place (29Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Otteken A. Earl P.L. Moss B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3407-3415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gp160 molecule then folds into a state competent for CD4 binding, dissociates from BiP, and forms oligomers. After entering the Golgi complex, the protein is cleaved by a cellular furin protease into the gp120 and gp41 subunits, which are then transported to the plasma membrane (32Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The half-life of the interaction between BiP and gp160 was determined to be 30 min (31Otteken A. Earl P.L. Moss B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3407-3415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, gp160 sequences that bind BiP and their location within the precursor have not previously been defined. For the expression of BiP in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, a plasmid (pUJ4) containing the cDNA sequence for mature mouse BiP (33Haas I.G. Meo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2250-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was constructed by inserting a polymerase chain reaction fragment lacking the N-terminal signal sequence into a pASK40 vector (34Skerra A. Pfitzinger J. Plückthun A. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis (35Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), an affinity tag of six histidine residues was introduced at the C terminus immediately after the KDEL retention sequence. The identity of the entire BiP construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli B cells (36Donch J. Greenberg J. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transformed with pUJ4. Cells were grown in LB medium at 29 °C, and protein synthesis was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm) at an OD of 0.5. After 2 h of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, cells were lysed, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 400 mm, and the crude extract was cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was then applied to a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). BiP was eluted with 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 300 mm imidazole, 400 mm NaCl and dialyzed against 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm potassium acetate (Buffer L) and applied to a C8 ATP-agarose column (Sigma). After washing the column with buffer L containing 10 mm EDTA, but no MgCl2, BiP was eluted with buffer L supplemented with 0.5 m KCl and 4 mm MgATP. The eluted BiP was finally applied to a Superdex 200-pg gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fractions of pure BiP were concentrated and stored in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol at −70 °C. The ATPase activity of recombinant BiP purified by this procedure could be stimulated up to 2.4-fold by synthetic peptides (see Table I). In this respect, it resembles more closely the recombinant His-tagged BiP prepared by Wei et al. (37Wei J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol.

The standard assay contained 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 500 μm unlabeled ATP, 10 mCi of [α-32 P]ATP, and approximately 4 μg of recombinant BiP in a total volume of 20 μl. The stimulation of the ATPase activity of BiP by peptide was determined in the presence of concentrations of 1 μm to 1 mm of the respective peptide. Following different times of incubation, 3-μl aliquots were removed, and the amounts of ATP and ADP were determined by thin layer chromatography and liquid scintillation counting. Competition binding assays that measure the ability of synthetic peptides to compete the binding of RCMLA to bovine liver BiP, bovine brain Hsc70, or E. coli DnaK were performed as described by Fourie et al. (10Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that bovine BiP was obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., and 50 ng instead of 1 μg of BiP or DnaK were used in each assay. After electrophoretic separation of the free HSP70 proteins from HSP70-RCMLA or HSP70-peptide complexes, Hsc70 was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 as described previously (10Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while BiP and DnaK were visualized by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant murine BiP (39Kozutsumi Y. Normington K. Press E. Slaughter C. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1999; 11: 115-137Google Scholar) or DnaK (StressGen BiotechnologiesCorp.) and detection using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peptides were synthesized using a model 9050 PepSynthesizer (Milligen) and Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids (40Atherton E. Fox H. Logan C.J. Harkiss D. Sheppard R.C. Williams S.B.J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; 13: 537-539Crossref Google Scholar) as described previously (15Knarr G. Gething M-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the BiP Score program (9Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), which has been used successfully previously to predict BiP-binding sites within the sequences of two different antibodies (15Knarr G. Gething M-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), to investigate another naturally occurring substrate of BiP, the HIV-1 envelope protein precursor gp160. Fig. 1 shows the result of the scoring procedure for the sequence of gp160 from the HIV-1 isolate BH10 (41Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K. Starcich B. Josephs S. Doran R.E. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L. Petteway S.R. Lautenberger I.A. Papas T.S. Ghrayeb J. Chang J. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The scores range from −26 to +21, but only 10% of the heptapeptides have scores greater than +6, indicating a 50% probability of binding to BiP. A very limited number of peptides (<4%) have scores greater than +10 and should therefore have a very high probability of binding. A cluster of about 20 peptides with positive scores are located within the N-terminal signal sequence (residues 1–36), which would be removed from the precursor soon after its translocation into the ER lumen. The presence of multiple peptides with high BiP Scores within signal sequences has been noted previously (9Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The other peptides with positive scores are distributed within smaller groups throughout the sequence of gp160. Within the conserved regions of the gp120 portion of the envelope protein (residues 1–517), nine peptides have scores of +10 or higher and were therefore strong candidates for binding to BiP. The constant region C1 contains peptide BH126, which has the most positive score (+21) of the complete gp160 sequence. In comparison, analysis of the sequence of the membrane-associated gp41 subunit (residues 518–862) revealed a higher percentage of possible BiP-binding sequences. Within the ectodomain of gp41 (residues 534–689), 10 peptides have very high scores from +10 up to +18. Interestingly, the hydrophobic fusion peptide, which lies at the N terminus of gp41 (FP, residues 518–533), does not include any predicted binding sites for BiP. This is because it contains a high proportion of small or β-branched hydrophobic residues, such as Ala, Val, and Ile, that are not favored in BiP-binding sequences (9Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Similarly, although the transmembrane domain of gp41 (residues 690–711) has a high hydropathy index (42Modrow S. Hahn B.H. Shaw G.M. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Wolf H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 570-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it too contains a high proportion of hydrophobic residues (Val, Ile) that are not favored in BiP-binding sites and accordingly does not contain high scoring peptides. Potential binding sites within the transmembrane domain would in any case be buried in the lipid bilayer and should not be accessible to BiP in the lumen of the ER. Finally, the cytoplasmic portion of gp41 (residues 712–862) contains a significant proportion of peptides with positive scores, 12 peptides having scores of +10 or greater. These sequences would not be accessible to BiP, but they potentially could be recognized by cytosolic HSP70 family members. To determine if the predicted binding sites interact with BiP, we analyzed the influence on the ATPase activity of recombinant BiP of 22 synthetic heptapeptides corresponding to sequences having scores of +10 or greater, indicating a very high probability of binding. Peptide binding to BiP is indicated by a stimulation of the ATPase activity (7Flynn G.C. Chappel T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The sequences and BiP Scores of these peptides are presented in TableI together with the results of the ATPase stimulation assays. Of the 22 peptides tested, six stimulated the ATPase activity by factors ranging from 2.0 to 2.4, similar to values reported earlier for synthetic peptides derived from viral proteins (7Flynn G.C. Chappel T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar,9Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A further seven peptides reproducibly stimulated the ATPase activity by factors ranging from 1.5 to 1.8. The remaining nine peptides did not stimulate the ATPase activity and therefore do not bind to BiP. The concentration dependence of ATPase stimulation was measured for the peptide BH126. The data shown in Fig. 2yielded a K m value (defined as the concentration of peptide causing half-maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity of BiP) of 28 μm. This value is within the range previously shown for high affinity binding sites (9Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 10Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fourteen of the high scoring gp160 peptides were tested for their ability to compete with the unfolded polypeptide RCMLA for binding to bovine BiP. Each peptide was tested over a range of concentrations (see examples in Fig. 3), and its apparent affinity for BiP (K app) was measured as the concentration yielding 50% competition of RCMLA binding. We used as a positive control the Ig heavy chain peptide HD177, which we had previously shown to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP with a K m of 17 μm (15Knarr G. Gething M-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and to compete with RCMLA to bind BiP with aK app of 15 μm. 2M. Beasley and M.-J. Gething, unpublished results. We observed a significant correlation between theK app obtained for each gp160 peptide and the degree to which it stimulated the ATPase activity of recombinant BiP (Table I). Thus, peptides with stimulation factors of 2-fold or greater had the lowest K app values (50–180 μm), while those with stimulation factors between 1.5 and 1.8 had intermediate K app values (200–500 μm). Peptides with stimulation factors below 1.5 had very high K app values (≫500 mm) or showed no evidence of binding. Confirmed BiP-binding peptides are marked withasterisks in Fig. 1.

This is accompanied by a drastic decrease in the efficacy of continued or repeated stimulation, due to receptor uncoupling from G protein and receptor internalization. Such processing steps have been shown to be absolutely dependent on receptor phosphorylation in the case of theN-formyl peptide receptor (FPR). In this study, we report results that indicate that the mechanisms responsible for desensitization and internalization are distinct. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the serine and threonine residues of the FPR carboxyl terminus, we have characterized regions that differentially regulate these two processes. Whereas substitution of all 11 Ser/Thr residues in the carboxyl terminus prevents both desensitization and internalization, substitution of four Ser/Thr residues between 328–332 blocks desensitization but has no effect on internalization. Similarly, substitution of four Ser/Thr residues between positions 334 and 339 results in a deficit in desensitization but again no decrease in internalization, suggesting that phosphorylation at either site evokes receptor internalization, whereas maximal desensitization requires phosphorylation at both sites. These results also indicate that receptor internalization is not involved in the process of desensitization. Further analysis of the residues between 328–332 revealed that restoration either of Ser328 and Thr329 or of Thr331 and Ser332 was sufficient to restore desensitization, suggesting that phosphorylation within either of these two sites, in addition to sites between residues 334 and 339, is sufficient to produce desensitization. Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanisms involved in FPR processing (uncoupling from G proteins and internalization) are regulated differentially by phosphorylation at distinct sites within the carboxyl terminus of the FPR. The relevance of this paradigm to other G protein-coupled receptors is discussed. Following activation by ligand, most G protein-coupled receptors undergo rapid phosphorylation.

N-formyl peptide receptor N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein Hanks' balanced salt solution m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor G protein-coupled receptor norleucinyl The human N-formyl peptide chemoattractant receptor (FPR)1 is a member of the seven-transmembrane receptor superfamily. Expressed predominantly on leukocytes, the FPR, which binds ligands such asN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), couples to heterotrimeric G proteins, activating numerous effectors including phospholipase C and thereby initiating responses such as chemotaxis, superoxide production, and degranulation (1Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The FPR is one of the better studied of the chemoattractant/chemokine family of receptors, which is responsible, in large part, for control of numerous immune functions (2Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Much interest has recently been devoted to this receptor family following the discovery that a number of chemokine receptors are co-receptors for human immunodeficiency virus (3Choe H. Arch. Pharmacal. Res. 1998; 21: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this family of receptors, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in activating and terminating receptor function. Control and termination of effector functions, through a process termed adaptation, is essential to cellular function and occurs in the continued presence of activating ligand to prevent damage to the host. The mechanisms responsible for these processes, although poorly understood, are believed to consist of two essential components: uncoupling of the receptor from G proteins (desensitization) and removal of the receptor from the cell surface through receptor internalization (4Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Aber M.J. Giros B. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Receptors Channels. 1997; 5: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of the FPR is proposed to play a major role in these processes for this receptor (6Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Members of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases have been shown to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl terminus of the FPR (6Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Substitution of all 11 serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl terminus with alanine and glycine residues produces a receptor incapable of undergoing either functional desensitization (uncoupling from G proteins) or ligand-induced internalization (7Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have recently shown, however, that receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization are not obligatory steps for chemotaxis (8Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Studies with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the 47 amino acid carboxyl terminus of the FPR suggested that phosphorylation of the FPR occurs in a hierarchical manner within a region in which 8 out of 12 continuous residues (between residues 328–339) are either serine or threonine (6Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The presence of acidic amino acids at the beginning and in the middle of this region is consistent with the demonstrated preferential recognition sites for phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (9Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that either or both of the clusters of Ser and Thr residues following an acidic residue may be sites of phosphorylation. Our experimental results indicated that significant phosphorylation occurred within each of these clusters of serine and threonine residues (7Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of phosphorylation at specific sites within the carboxyl terminus are not known. In this study, we have examined a series of FPR mutants with substitutions of carboxyl-terminal serine and threonine residues and determined the role(s) of these residues in receptor desensitization and internalization. The results of our study indicate that FPR desensitization and internalization must occur via distinct mechanisms due to the particular properties of individual phosphorylation-deficient mutants. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that receptor internalization is not required for desensitization to occur, further supporting the idea that these two processes occur via distinct mechanisms. fMLF and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Sigma. N-Formyl-Nleu-Leu-Phe-Nleu-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein and indo-1/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). RPMI 1640 was from Hyclone. The FPR gene was mutagenized as described previously (10Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For transfection into U937 cells, 4 × 106 cells grown in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% fetal bovine serum) were centrifuged and resuspended with 400 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. Linearized DNA (5–20 μg) was added, and the cells were electroporated with a 240-V pulse from a 960-microfarad capacitor (resulting in a pulse time constant of 30–35 ms) and returned to 5 ml of growth medium (11Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For selection, G418 was added to a final active concentration of 1 mg/ml. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2. Cells (5 × 105) were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with Tris-buffered saline, and resuspended to 106 cells/ml in Tris-buffered saline. Binding was carried out in 0.5 ml withN-formyl-Nleu-Leu-Phe-Nleu-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein at 10 nm. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for fluorescent intensity and gated on forward and side scatter to exclude debris and dead cells. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and was almost identical to the level of fluorescence observed with vector-transfected cells. Ligand binding parameters were determined by flow cytometry performed as described above with the following changes. To determine binding parameters (K d and B max) more effectively, the higher affinity ligandN-formyl-Nleu-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein was used at eight concentrations between 10−12 and 3.3 × 10−8m (12Vilven J.C. Domalewski M. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Muthukumaraswamy N. Harris R.B. Freer R.J. Sklar L.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1998; 18: 187-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cell density was decreased to 105/ml to prevent depletion of ligand at low ligand concentrations. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Binding parameters were calculated using the program Prism (Graphpad). AbsoluteB max values were determined by comparing fluorescent intensity with reference beads containing known amounts of fluorescein (Flow Cytometry Standards Corp.). Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS). The cells were incubated with 5 μm indo-1/AM for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle rocking, washed once with HBSS, and resuspended to a concentration of approximately 106 cells/ml in HBSS containing 1.5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0. The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by various concentrations of fMLF was monitored using an SLM 8000 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco) detecting the ratio of fluorescence at 400 and 490 nm, as described (13Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The concentration of intracellular Ca2+ was calculated as described (14Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the wild type FPR and FPR mutants was determined as described (8Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, FPR-transfected U937 cells were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 1 mCi of carrier-free, acid-free [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were loaded for 3 h at 37 °C and then stimulated with 1 μm fMLF for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was added to 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose coated with an anti-FPR antibody and incubated for 1 h while rotating at 4 °C. The beads were serially washed, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and 32P content was determined with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Desensitization of calcium mobilization was determined as follows. Cells (1 × 107) were loaded with indo-1/AM as described above for calcium flux determinations and divided into two parts. One was stimulated with 1 μm fMLF for 10 min, whereas the other was treated with buffer only. The cells were then washed three times with HBSS at room temperature to remove surface-bound fMLF and resuspended for assay of calcium mobilization as described above. The response of the treated and untreated cells to a stimulation with 100 nm fMLF was determined. Desensitization is expressed as the percentage decrease of the response of the treated cells relative to the untreated cells. Receptor internalization was determined as the agonist-dependent loss of FPR from the cell surface (15Prossnitz E.R. Gilbert T.L. Chiang S. Campbell J.J. Qin S. Newman W. Sklar L.A. Ye R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). FPR-transfected U937 cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in HBSS as above. Cells were then stimulated with 1 μm fMLF for 10 min (or the indicated time) at 37 °C and washed three times with HBSS. Remaining cell surface receptors were determined with 10 nm N-formyl-Nleu-Leu-Phe-Nleu-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein. Ligand-stained cells were then analyzed for fluorescent intensity on a FACSCaliber flow cytometer with dead cells excluded by a gate on forward and side scatter. Receptor internalization is expressed as the percentage decrease of the cell surface receptors of the treated cells relative to the untreated cells. G protein-coupled receptors are known to undergo rapid phosphorylation following agonist stimulation. Multiple kinases can be involved in these phosphorylation reactions, including members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, which specifically recognize agonist-activated receptors, and second messenger-activated kinases, such as protein kinase A and C (16Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation by itself does not appear to prevent coupling to G proteins. Desensitization most likely requires the binding of an accessory molecule, such as arrestin, which specifically binds phosphorylated GPCRs and sterically prevents G protein association (17Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Recently, arrestin has also been shown to bind to clathrin, suggesting a mechanism for the concerted desensitization and internalization of GPCRs (18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Whether receptor desensitization and internalization are coupled or independent processes remains largely unknown. In this report, we characterize the ability of a series of mutant forms of the FPR to undergo phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization. The mutant receptors used in this study represent variants of the FPR in which Ser and Thr residues have been replaced by Ala or Gly residues (Fig.1). Mutant ΔST(S3191A,T325G,S328A,T329A, T331A,S332G,T334G, T336G,S338G,T339A,S342G) lacks all eleven potential phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl terminus and has previously been shown not to undergo either ligand-dependent internalization or desensitization. Mutant ΔA (S328A,T329A,T331A,S332G) and mutant ΔB (T334G,T336G,S338G,T339A) represent two clusters of Ser and Thr residues that each follow acidic residues (Glu326 and Asp327 in the case of mutant ΔA and Asp333 in the case of mutant ΔB) and have previously been shown to be deficient in desensitization. Mutants ΔC (S328A,T329A) and ΔD (T331A,S332G) each alter two of the residues altered in mutant ΔA. Last, mutant Δ3 (S3191A,T325G,S342G) replaces the three Ser and Thr not collectively replaced in mutants ΔA and ΔB. Mutant receptors were expressed in the promyelocytic cell line, U937, which, in its undifferentiated state, does not express endogenous FPR but is capable of processing the transfected wild type FPR in terms of phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization (7Prossnitz E.R.

In all cases, greater than 90% of the cells expressed receptor. Quantitative binding analyses using the high affinity FPR ligandN-formyl-Nleu-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein revealed that there were no significant differences in ligand binding affinity between the mutants and the wild type receptor (TableI). Receptor expression levels were found to vary less than 2-fold from the highest (mutant ΔA) to the lowest (mutant ΔST). Receptor-mediated calcium mobilization was also not altered in any of the mutants as compared with the wild type receptor, with an approximately 2-fold range in EC50 values.Table IFormyl peptide binding and calcium mobilization of U937 cells expressing the wild type and mutant FPRsMutantKdaEquilibrium binding constants (K dand B max) were determined on intact cells using the ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the average ± S.E. of three independent experiments.B maxbB max values were determined by comparison with standardized fluorescein-conjugated beads containing known amounts of fluorescein as described under “Experimental Procedures.”EC50cEC50 values for calcium mobilization were determined with indo-1-loaded cells using the ligandN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the average ± S.E. of three or four independent experiments.m×103molecules/cellnmWild type1.1 ± 0.2 × 10−10239 ± 2439 ± 22Mutant ΔST0.9 ± 0.3 × 10−10224 ± 1933 ± 19Mutant ΔA1.8 ± 0.4 × 10−10398 ± 3832 ± 23Mutant ΔB1.4 ± 0.3 × 10−10292 ± 1721 ± 14Mutant ΔC0.9 ± 0.2 × 10−10377 ± 2245 ± 34Mutant ΔD2.9 ± 1.6 × 10−10260 ± 2642 ± 35Mutant Δ31.9 ± 0.9 × 10−10311 ± 2520 ± 13a Equilibrium binding constants (K dand B max) were determined on intact cells using the ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the average ± S.E. of three independent experiments.b B max values were determined by comparison with standardized fluorescein-conjugated beads containing known amounts of fluorescein as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c EC50 values for calcium mobilization were determined with indo-1-loaded cells using the ligandN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the average ± S.E. of three or four independent experiments. Open table in a new tab We next evaluated the ability of the site-directed mutants of the FPR to undergo phosphorylation when treated with agonist. Previous results and those obtained here indicate that the ΔST mutant does not undergo any significant phosphorylation as compared with the wild type FPR (Fig. 3). Mutants ΔA and ΔB each are phosphorylated at a level corresponding to approximately 50% that of the wild type receptor. Mutants ΔC and ΔD show still greater increases in the level of phosphorylation as Ser and Thr residues are restored to the receptor. Mutant Δ3, which contains all eight Ser and Thr residues in the central portion of the FPR carboxyl terminus, displays phosphorylation similar to that of the wild type FPR. These results suggest that receptor phosphorylation is approximately proportional to the content of potentially phorsphorylated residues within the central cluster of eight Ser and Thr residues. FPR desensitization in response to treatment with fMLF was examined next (Fig. 4, upper panel). Cells were first treated for 10 min with a saturating dose of fMLF, washed free of ligand, and then assayed for calcium mobilization. The wild type receptor displays an approximately 80% reduction in peak calcium mobilization to the second challenge of fMLF. On the contrary, mutant ΔST displays only a 20–25% reduction in calcium mobilization under these assay conditions. Mutant ΔA shows a similar deficit to ΔST, whereas mutant ΔB shows a less pronounced effect. This is consistent with our previous finding that mutant ΔB produces an intermediate level of desensitization. However, mutants ΔC, ΔD, and Δ3 demonstrated no defect in their ability to undergo desensitization. The result that mutant Δ3 exhibited no defect in desensitization indicates that phosphorylation solely within the remaining eight Ser and Thr residues defined by mutants ΔA and ΔB is sufficient to elicit desensitization. The much greater deficit observed with mutant ΔA as compared with mutant ΔB indicates that phosphorylation of residues Ser328, Thr329, Thr331, and/or Ser332 plays a critical role in the desensitization process, whereas phosphorylation of residues Thr334, Thr336, Ser338, and/or Thr339 plays a more minor or secondary role. We next examined whether removal of all of the Ser and Thr residues within mutant ΔA was necessary to prevent desensitization. Mutants ΔC and ΔD alter the first and second pair of residues altered in mutant ΔA, respectively. Analysis of these mutants revealed that they desensitized normally, indistinguishably from the wild type receptor. These results indicate that phosphorylation of either site (Ser328/Thr329 or Thr331/Ser332), in conjunction with the sites defined by mutant ΔB, is sufficient to promote desensitization of the receptor, suggesting redundant sites for FPR desensitization. Furthermore, these results suggest that in the wild type receptor, phosphorylation probably occurs at minimally three sites, defined by ΔC, ΔD, and ΔB. Receptor internalization has been suggested to represent a possible mechanism for, or at least a contributing factor to, desensitization. In support of this, the mechanisms responsible for receptor desensitization and internalization appear to be intimately associated due to the pivotal role played by arrestin in both these processes. To examine this relationship in the FPR, we next tested the ability of each mutant to be internalized (Fig. 4, lower panel). In the case of the wild type receptor, approximately 80% of the receptor internalizes in 10 min. The ΔST mutant, on the contrary, demonstrates no internalization, indicating an absolute requirement for phosphorylation in this process. However, unlike the profile seen with desensitization, all partially phosphorylated mutants underwent complete internalization, indistinguishable from that of the wild type receptor. To examine whether determining internalization at a fixed time point might be inadequate to resolve differences in the rates of internalization, we determined the time course of FPR internalization for the wild type and mutant receptors. The results indicate that there are no significant differences in the rates of internalization, with half-times for internalization ranging from 3 to 4 min for all mutants including the wild type FPR (Fig.5). Furthermore, the total levels of internalization are also very similar, varying by no more than 10%. The result that phosphorylation at site B (occurring in mutant ΔA) can support internalization while being inadequate to promote densensitization suggests that distinct mechanisms mediate these two processes. Furthermore, this result demonstrates that FPR internalization cannot be responsible for its desensitization. In this paper, we have determined the ability of mutant forms of the FPR to undergo desensitization and internalization. The surprising result is that preventing phosphorylation at residues 328, 329, 331, and 332 (defined as site A) completely abolishes receptor desensitization but has no effect on receptor internalization. Similar results were observed by preventing phosphorylation at residues 334, 336, 338, and 339 (defined as site B), although the effect on desensitization is not as great. Of further interest is the result that restoration of either residues 328 and 329 or residues 331 and 332 within mutant ΔA is sufficient to restore receptor desensitization. Together, these results suggest that the processes of FPR desensitization and internalization must occur through distinct mechanisms. In support of the conclusion that desensitization and internalization of the FPR occur by distinct mechanisms are results obtained with the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2AChR). This GPCR contains a large third intracellular loop of approximately 180 amino acids, which is known to undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation (19Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the middle portion of this loop are two clusters of Ser and Thr residues very similar to those in the carboxyl terminus of the FPR. Fig.6 shows an alignment of the two sequences. The two clusters are designated site A and site B to represent the NH2- and COOH-terminal cluster, respectively. The alignment demonstrates that there is remarkable homology between these two sites between the FPR and the m2AChR. Within each site, three of the four Ser and Thr residues can be aligned perfectly between the FPR and the m2AChR, with variation in the position of the fourth Ser/Thr residue. Each cluster is immediately preceded by one or two acidic amino acid residues. The presence of N-terminal acidic residues has been shown to be stimulating factor in the activity of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 toward peptide substrates (9Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas the two sites are directly juxtaposed in the case of the FPR, they are separated by 13 amino acids in the case of the m2AChR. Studies by Pals-Rylaarsdam and Hosey (19Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have analyzed the effects of mutations at these homologous sites. Their results demonstrated that mutation of the Ser and Thr residues at site B prevented desensitization, whereas mutation of the Ser and Thr residues at site A desensitized normally. Furthermore, both of these mutants internalized normally. The m2AChR results are similar to ours except for the apparent transposition of sites A and B. In the case of the FPR, mutation of site A prevents desensitization, whereas in the case of the m2AChR, mutation of site B prevents desensitization. Mutation of site B in the FPR produces a modest inhibition of desensitization, indicating that for maximal FPR desensitization, phosphorylation must take place within both sites A and B. With both mutant receptors, phosphorylation at either site is completely sufficient for internalization to occur. These results lead to two important questions. First, what structural and functional similarities are there between the FPR and the m2AChR? Second, what are the mechanisms that distinguish between phosphorylation at sites A and B in these receptors? With regard to the first question, similar clusters of Ser and Thr residues exist in numerous other receptors, including the chemoattractant receptors for C5a (20Boulay F. Mery L. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and interleukin-8 (21Thomas K.M. Taylor L. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14839-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which bear high overall homology to the FPR, as well as receptor subtypes for serotonin (22Hartig P.R. Adham N. Zgombick J. Macchi M. Kao H.T. Schechter L. Branchek T. Weinshank R. Psychopharmacol. Ser. ( NY ). 1993; 10: 15-25PubMed Google Scholar), angiotensin (23Nawata H. Takayanagi R. Ohnaka K. Sakai Y. Imasaki K. Yanase T. Ikuyama S. Tanaka S. Ohe K. Steroids. 1995; 60: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and bombesin (24Battey J.F. Way J.M. Corjay M.H. Shapira H. Kusano K. Harkins R. Wu J.M. Slattery T. Mann E. Feldman R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It is also of interest that the location of the Ser/Thr clusters does not appear to be critical, since they are located either on the third intracellular loop (as in the case of the m2AChR) or the carboxyl-terminal tail (as in the case of most GPCR including the FPR). Many other receptors known to undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation do not possess clusters as distinct as those observed for the FPR and m2AChR. In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor, the mapped phosphorylation sites span a large portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail (25Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the case of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor, phosphorylation of four Ser residues spanning 17 amino acids has been demonstrated (26Lazari M.de F.M. Bertrand J.E. Nakamura K. Liu X. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this latter case mutation of one of these four Ser residues impedes receptor internalization but has no effect on desensitization, whereas mutation of either of two other Ser residues delays the onset of desensitization with a lesser effect on internalization. These results support the conclusion here that distinct mechanisms may be involved in receptor desensitization and internalization of GPCR. With regard to the second question, the mechanisms responsible for receptor desensitization and internalization are only partly understood. In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor, the protein arrestin is known to be crucial in the desensitization and internalization of the receptor. However, in the case of the m2AChR, it appears that arrestin may play a role in desensitization but not internalization (27Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Yet another scenario is described by the rat follitropin receptor, which appears to be phosphorylated on multiple intracellular loops yet can be internalized in a phosphorylation-independent, although arrestin-dependent, pathway (28Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24346-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that G protein activation by the FPR is not necessary to elicit agonist-mediated internalization of the receptor (15Prossnitz E.R. Gilbert T.L. Chiang S. Campbell J.J. Qin S. Newman W. Sklar L.A. Ye R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An FPR mutant, R123G, located in the highly conserved DRY motif at the beginning of the second intracellular loop, is unable to bind or activate G protein yet is competent in undergoing agonist-mediated phosphorylation and internalization, consistent with the requirement for receptor phosphorylation in desensitization and internalization. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the existence of a highly conserved sequence motif, consisting of two clusters of Ser and Thr residues preceded by acidic residues, involved in directing the desensitization and internalization of GPCRs. Phosphorylation of either of these two clusters is sufficient to mediate internalization, whereas disruption of one cluster can completely inhibit desensitization. These distinctions clearly indicate that these two events, which both require receptor phosphorylation, proceed by different mechanisms. The existence of similar sequences in other GPCR suggests that the results described here may be much more widespread throughout the GPCR superfamily."

In the small intestinal epithelium, which consists of spatially separated proliferative and differentiated cell populations located, respectively, in the crypt and on the villus, laminins and laminin-binding integrins are differentially expressed along the crypt-villus axis. One exception to this is the integrin α6β4, which is thought to be ubiquitously expressed by intestinal cells. However, in this study, a re-evaluation of the β4 subunit expression with different antibodies revealed that two forms of β4 exist in the human intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, we show that differentiated enterocytes express a full-length 205-kDa β4A subunit, whereas undifferentiated crypt cells express a novel β4A subunit that does not contain the COOH-terminal segment of the cytoplasmic domain (β4Actd−). This new form was not found to arise from alternative β4 mRNA splicing. Moreover, we found that these two β4A forms can associate into α6β4A complexes; however, the β4Actd− integrin expressed by the undifferentiated crypt cells is not functional for adhesion to laminin-5. Hence, these studies identify a novel α6β4Actd− integrin expressed in undifferentiated intestinal crypt cells that is functionally distinct.

Epithelial cells are characterized by special structural features such as polarized morphology, specialized cell-cell contacts, and their attachment to an underlying basement membrane (1Rodirguez-Boulan E. Nelson W. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). This attachment mediates various crucial cell functions including adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. The biological effects of basement membranes are largely mediated by laminins, a growing family of structurally related molecules (2Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M. Deutzmann R. Ekblom P. Engel J. Kleinman H. Martin G.R. Meneguzzi G. Paulsson M. Sanes J. Timpl R. Tryggvason K. Yamada Y. Yurchenco P.D. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 3Wewer U.M.

Sanes J.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Epithelia bind to laminins via various cell membrane receptors, many of which are members of the integrin superfamily (5Ruoslahti E. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Some integrins, such as α2β1 and α3β1, are considered quite promiscuous (12Wayner E. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and bind various molecules including laminins, while others such as α6β1, α7β1, and α6β4 are specific for laminins (8Mercurio A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Beaulieu J.-F. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 31–4: 1-78Google Scholar). The integrin α6β4 has a number of features which distinguish it structurally and functionally from the other laminin receptors of the β1 family (14Suzuki S. Naitoh Y. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15Hogervost F. Kuikman I. Von dem Borne Kr., A.E.G. Sonnenberg A.

The β4 subunit has an unusually long cytoplasmic domain having no homology with other integrin β subunits. Upon binding to laminin-5, α6β4 becomes concentrated in hemidesmosomes and is associated with intermediate filaments, making it essential for the organization and maintenance of the epithelial structure (17Mainiero F.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). This role was confirmed using transgenic mice in which the β4 subunit had been knocked out (20Dowling J., Yu, Q-C. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 21Van der Neut R. Krimpenfort P. Calafat J. Neissen C.M. Sonnenberg A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), causing the loss of hemidesmosomal structures. Furthermore, mice carrying a targeted deletion of the integrin β4cytoplasmic domain showed defects in both cell adhesion and proliferation (22Murgia C. Blaikie P. Kim N. Dans M. Petrie H.T. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3940-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that β4 coordinates hemidesmosome assembly but may be responsible for additional signals, some of which may be essential for cell survival and cell cycle regulation (22Murgia C.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, upon ligation to laminin-5, α6β4 has been shown to become phosphorylated and to cause recruitment of Shc and Grb2-mSOS, which go on to activate Ras/MAP kinase pathways (17Mainiero F. Pepe A.

The intestinal epithelium, which is in constant and rapid renewal, represents an interesting model for the study of mechanisms involved in the determination of the cell state (25Beaulieu J.-F. Front. Bioscience. 1999; 4: d310-d321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within its functional unit, the crypt-villus axis, are two main distinct cell populations: the proliferative and poorly differentiated crypt cells and the mature enterocytes of the villus (26Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 114-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 27Louvard D. Kedinger M. Hauri H.-P. Ann. Rev.

Processes of epithelial cell growth and functional differentiation need to be tightly regulated along the crypt-villus axis (29Podolsky D.K. Babyatsky M.W. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. 2 nd Ed. JB Lippincott, Philadelphia1995: 546-577Google Scholar, 30Boyle W.J. Brenner D.A. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 1995; 11: 121-127Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Analysis of integrins and basement membrane molecules in the human intestine has revealed particular patterns of expression for many of these molecules, namely those involved in laminin-cell interactions (13Beaulieu J.-F.

Of interest is the reciprocal expression of laminin-1 and laminin-2 that has been found along the crypt-villus axis, with laminin-1 occurring as a villus form and laminin-2 as a crypt form, suggesting a relation between laminin form expression and cell differentiation (31Beaulieu J.-F.

Dyn. 1994; 201: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of these observations was provided by the demonstration that laminin-1, but not laminin-2, can precociously induce differentiation in intestinal cells (33Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.-F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G857-G867PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that laminin-1 is critical in triggering terminal enterocytic differentiation (33Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.-F. Am.

A differential crypt-villus pattern of expression for laminin-binding integrins was also reported in the intestinal epithelium. The distribution of α2β1 was mainly restricted to the crypt while α3β1 was found predominantly in the villus (35Beaulieu J.-F. J.

More recently, α7Bβ1, a specific laminin receptor largely involved in muscle development in response to laminin (37Vachon P.H. Xu H. Liu L. Loechel F. Hayashi Y. Arahata K. Reed J.C. Wewer U.M.

It was found to be located at the crypt-villus junction in the intact intestine while its expression was transiently up-regulated in differentiating enterocytes (38Basora N. Vachon P.H.

In contrast, the integrin α6β4 has been reported to be present at the base of intestinal epithelial cells all along the crypt-villus axis suggesting that this laminin receptor is ubiquitously expressed by intestinal cells (31Beaulieu J.-F.

In this study, the expression of the β4 subunit in intestinal cells was re-evaluated on the basis of the observation that antibodies directed to the COOH-terminal segment of the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule (40Giancotti F.G. Stepp M.A. Suzuki S. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) detected the β4 subunit only in the villus cells of the intact small intestine, suggesting that two distinct forms of β4 may exist in the intestinal epithelium. To further investigate this, we used two well characterized intestinal cell models which allow to some extent the recapitulation of the crypt-villus axis in vitro: the crypt-like HIEC cells, which are proliferative and undifferentiated (41Perreault N. Beaulieu J.-F. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the Caco-2/15 cells which have the ability to differentiate into fully functional villus-like enterocytes (42Beaulieu J.-F.

Physiol. 1996; 166: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our data show that differentiated enterocytes express a full-length 205-kDa β4A subunit while undifferentiated crypt cells express a novel β4A subunit which does not contain the COOH-terminal segment of the cytoplasmic domain (β4Actd−). Moreover, we found that these two β4A variants form α6β4A complexes that are functionally distinct with regard to adhesion activity, the α6β4Actd− receptor expressed on undifferentiated crypt cells being inactive as opposed to the fully functional α6β4A integrin expressed on differentiated villus cells. Specimens of adult small intestine (jejunum) were obtained from non-diseased parts of resected segments. Only specimens obtained rapidly were used; the overall period required before freezing the tissue after surgery never exceeded 60 min. The project was in accordance with the protocol approved by the Institutional Human Research Review Committee for the use of human material. The human colon carcinoma Caco-2/15 cell line, a stable clone of the parent Caco-2 cell line (HBT 37; ATCC, Rockville, MD) has been characterized elsewhere (42Beaulieu J.-F. Quaroni A. Biochem.

These cells are unique in that upon reaching confluence they spontaneously undergo a gradual enterocytic differentiation process, similar to that observed in the epithelium of the intact fetal small and large intestine (42Beaulieu J.-F.

Another anti-β4 antiserum (AB1922; Chemicon International, Mississauga, Ontario) directed toward the last 20 amino acids of the COOH-terminal domain of the β4 subunit was also used for immunolocalization studies. Purified laminin-5 was a generous gift from Dr. R. Burgeson (Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Charlestown, MA). The preparation and Optimum Cutting Temperature embedding compound (Tissue Tek, Miles laboratories, Elkhart, IN) embedding of tissue samples for cryosections was performed as described previously (35Beaulieu J.-F.

Frozen sections 3-μm thick were cut on a Jung Frigocut 2800N cryostat (Leica Canada, St. Laurent, Québec), spread on silane-coated glass slides, and air-dried 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections were fixed in methanol or ethanol (10 min, −20 °C) before immunostaining, as described elsewhere (31Beaulieu J.-F. Vachon P.H.

Cells were washed twice in PBS and harvested in 1 × solubilization buffer (2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 5 min, cleared by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 5 min), and aliquoted for storage at −80 °C. Separated proteins (100 μg/lane) were transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario) and blocked in PBS containing 10% powdered skim milk, then incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies (anti-β4c, 1/500) diluted in the blocking solution. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used according to the manufacturers instructions. Cells were metabolically labeled using Promix [35 S]methionine and cystine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 100 μCi/ml for HIEC and 200 μCi/ml for Caco-2/15 for the indicated times as described previously (50Beaulieu J.-F. Nichols B. Quaroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20000-20011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For certain points, cells were labeled as described above and after the labeling period the radioactive medium was removed, cells were washed once with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and chased with 10 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 × methionine and 10 × cystine for the indicated times. Cells were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin) for 20 min on ice, then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g. Samples were pre-cleared using 100 μl of heparin-agarose (Bio-Rad) followed by 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.) each for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were added to the samples and incubated for 15 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Radioactive samples were analyzed under nonreduced conditions by SDS-PAGE, the gels were fixed (10% acetic acid, 45% methanol, 45% deionized water) for 1 h and soaked for 15 min in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried and exposed using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from cell lines or tissue homogenates using TriZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.). The integrity of the RNA was verified by ethidium bromide staining and the quantities were determined spectrophotometrically. Reverse transcriptase Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to 5 μg of total RNA, as described elsewhere (51Beaulieu J.-F.

The integrin β4 subunit was amplified using five different sets of primers. B1/B2: B1 (5′-GAATTCGTTCTACGCTCTCC-3′) and B2 (5′-GAATTCTGAGAGATGTGGGC-3′) amplify a band of 369 bp which spans the region 4182 to 4551 of β4A (14Suzuki S. Naitoh Y. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). B3/B4: B3 (5′-CCCGGGGATATCGTCGGCTAC-3′) and B4 (5′-CCCGGGGCTGTCTCCATCCAC-3′) amplify a band of 83 bp (52Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) spanning the region of 4921 to 5004 bp of β4A; B5/B6: B5 (5′-GAATTCTTCCTAGTGGATGG-3′) and B6 (5′-GAATTCCTAGTGGGACAT-3′) amplify a band of 186 bp spanning the region of 5235 to 5421 of β4A; B7/B8: B7 (5′-TCTCCGATGACACTGAGCAC-3′) and B8 (5′-GTAGCCGACGATATCCCCAT-3′) amplify a band of 718 bp spanning the region of 4220–4938 of β4A; B9/B10: B9 (5′-CCCATGAAGAAAGTGCTGGT-3′) and B10 (5′-TCCATCCTGGGACTCTATGG-3′) amplify a band of 1202 bp spanning the region of 3931 to 5133 of β4A. Single-stranded cDNA was amplified in PCR buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing 0.25 μm of both sense and antisense primers for 30 cycles of denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), annealing (1 min at 55 °C for B1/B2, B7/B8, and B9/B10, 65 °C for B3/B4, and 51 °C for B5/B6 and B3/B6), and extension (1 min at 72 °C) in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermal cycler model 480) in the presence of 250 μm dNTPs and 2.5 units of Taq (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Conditions for S14 amplification and sequence analysis of the β4 B3/B6 PCR products were described elsewhere (38Basora N. Vachon P.H. Herring-Gillam F.E. Perreault N. Beaulieu J.-F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1510-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The β4 B9/B10 1202-bp PCR product was digested with SmaI andSacII prior to cloning in pBluescript for sequence analysis. The adhesion of HIEC and Caco-2/15 cells on laminin-5 was carried out in 96-well plates based on a procedure described previously (53Niessen C.M. Hogervost F. Jaspers L.H. DeMelker A.A. Delwel G.O. Hulsman E.H.M. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin, 1%, was used to set background binding. Purified laminin-5 was used at 10 μg/ml. The wells were coated for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently blocked with 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells harvested using 10 mm EDTA, washed twice, and 5 × 104 cells were plated per well for 30 min. Unbound cells were removed by gently washing twice with PBS and bound cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, colored with a 1% crystal violet solution, and solubilized using 2% SDS. The plates were read at 595 nm with a Microplate Reader (model 3550, Bio-Rad). For inhibition studies, neutralizing antibodies were added to cells before plating and incubated for 30 min, each at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. As shown previously with the 3E1 antibody (31Beaulieu J.-F. Vachon P.H. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Perreault N. Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.-F. Anat. Rec. 1995; 242: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and confirmed herein by using 439-9B, another antibody directed to the extracellular domain of the molecule, the β4 subunit was found to be expressed in significant amounts at the base of all epithelial cells in both crypt and villus (Fig.1 A). The use of another antibody, the anti-β4c, raised against the last 31 amino acids of the COOH-terminal of the β4 subunit, produced a distinct pattern of expression by strongly labeling the basal surface of villus cells but not the crypts (Fig. 1 B). The specificity of the staining pattern of the anti-β4c antibody was confirmed with AB1922, another antibody directed against the last 22 amino acids of the COOH-terminal of the β4subunit (Fig. 1 C). This observation suggests that at least two immunologically distinct forms of β4 exist in the intestinal epithelium and that they are associated with different cell populations along the crypt-villus axis. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the expression of the β4 subunit in undifferentiated (HIEC) and differentiated (Caco-2/15) cells. Western blot analysis of cell lysates using anti-β4c (Fig.2 A) detected the β4 subunit in Caco-2/15 (lane 2) cells but not in HIEC cells (lane 1). However, RT-PCR amplification using two different sets of primers, located in the region encoding for the cytoplasmic domain of β4, revealed that both cell models express the β4 transcript (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2and 4). The B1/B2 primer set spans the region which is alternatively spliced to produce isoforms β4A, β4B, or β4C (15Hogervost F. Kuikman I. Von dem Borne Kr., A.E.G. Sonnenberg A.

This set of primers amplifies a band of 369 bp which corresponds to β4A, indicating that this is the major β4isoform in both cell lines. The primer set B3/B4 has been used previously to identify the β4D isoform which contains a 21-bp deletion (52Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amplification of a single band of 83 bp with this set of primers in HIEC and Caco-2/15 cells indicated that neither cell line expresses this isoform. The differential expression of β4 subunits between differentiated and undifferentiated intestinal cells was further investigated by immunoprecipitation using the 3E1 antibody, fol"
https://openalex.org/W2065559987,"TGN38 is a type I integral membrane protein that constitutively cycles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and plasma membrane. The cytosolic domain of TGN38 interacts with AP2 clathrin adaptor complexes via the tyrosine-containing motif (-SDYQRL-) to direct internalization from the plasma membrane. This motif has previously been shown to direct both internalization and subsequent TGN targeting of TGN38. We have used the cytosolic domain of TGN38 in a two-hybrid screen, and we have identified the brain-specific F-actin binding protein neurabin-I as a TGN38-binding protein. We demonstrate a direct interaction between TGN38 and the ubiquitous homologue of neurabin-I, neurabin-II (also called spinophilin). We have used a combination of yeast two-hybrid and in vitro protein interaction assays to show that this interaction is dependent on the serine (but not tyrosine) residue of the known TGN38 trafficking motif. We show that TGN38 interacts with the coiled coil region of neurabinin vitro and binds preferentially with the dimeric form of neurabin. TGN38 and neurabin also interact in vivo as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation from stably transfected PC12 cells.

Many membrane proteins undergo complex trafficking itineraries within eukaryotic cells, cycling between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane during such processes as nutrient uptake, biosynthetic protein sorting, intracellular signaling, and cell movement. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to identify the individual components of these processes.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but cDNA clones encoding p62 and this small GTPase have yet to be isolated. Other protein complexes that function at a post-TGN level have also been identified. A considerable amount of data has been gathered regarding the role of a number of vacuolar protein sorting mutants in yeast. This work has led to the identification of a complex of proteins, conserved in higher eukaryotes, that is involved in endosome to Golgi transport (15Seaman M.N. Marcusson E.G. Cereghino J.L. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Many individual components of trafficking pathways have also been identified from yeast two-hybrid screens using integral membrane protein cytosolic domains as bait. Examples include the identification of TIP47, which binds a specific motif within the cytosolic domain of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor directing traffic from endosomes to the TGN (17Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and P-CIP-1 (18Chen L. Johnson R.C. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33524-33532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which mediates the endosomal trafficking of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase. The endoprotease furin has also been successfully used to identify novel components of the post-TGN sorting machinery. Two-hybrid screens of cDNA libraries using the cytosolic domain of furin as bait led to the identification of both PACS-1 (19Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and the actin-binding protein ABP-280 (20Liu G. Thomas L. Warren R.A. Enns C.A. Cunningham C. Hartwig J.H. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1719-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as molecules involved in trafficking of furin. We chose to use the cytosolic domain of TGN38 to screen a two-hybrid library to identify interacting proteins, particularly those that may be involved in post-TGN membrane traffic. By using this approach we have identified a direct interaction between TGN38 and the brain-specific F-actin binding protein neurabin-I. We show that TGN38 also interacts directly with the ubiquitously expressed isoform of neurabin-I, neurabin-II (also known as spinophilin). These interactions are highly specific to TGN38 and can be abolished by a point mutation of a serine residue within the cytosolic domain of TGN38. TGN38 preferentially binds to the dimeric form of neurabin-I in vitro. The two proteins can also be coimmunoprecipitated from PC12 cells stably transfected with expression constructs encoding GFP-tagged neurabin-I or -II. These data suggest that neurabin provides a direct link between TGN38-containing membranes and the actin cytoskeleton. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The entire 33-amino acid cytosolic domain of TGN38 was cloned into the two-hybrid bait vector pBTM116 (21Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) to generate pBTM-TGN38 (12Stephens D.J. Crump C.M. Clarke A.R. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14104-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This plasmid was then transformed into yeast strain L40 (21Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) as described previously (12Stephens D.J. Crump C.M. Clarke A.R. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14104-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 5-ml overnight culture of yeast containing the pBTM-TGN38 plasmid was grown in synthetic medium, Yc (1.2 g·liter−1 yeast nitrogen base without (NH4)2SO4, 5 g·liter−1 (NH4)2SO4, 10 g·liter−1 succinic acid, 6 g·liter−1 NaOH, 2% glucose) supplemented with 0.1 g·liter−1 adenine, arginine, cysteine, threonine, and leucine and 0.05 g·liter−1 aspartate, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, tyrosine, and valine (i.e.lacking tryptophan, uracil, histidine, and lysine). This was then used to inoculate a 100-ml culture of the same medium that was then grown overnight and used to inoculate a 1000-ml culture of YPAD (YEPD (20 g·liter−1 peptone, 10 g·liter−1 yeast extract, pH 5.8, 2% glucose) with 40 μg·ml−1 adenine) that had been prewarmed to 30 °C. Cells were grown for 3 h, pelleted, washed in 500 ml of 1× TE (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), and finally resuspended in 20 ml of 0.5× TE (5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 100 mm lithium acetate. To this, 1.0 ml of 10 mg·ml−1 denatured and sheared salmon sperm DNA was added with 0.5 mg of library plasmid DNA (a rat brain cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Jeremy Henley, University of Bristol) consisting of both random-primed and oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from RNA of 100 pooled rat brains from 10- to 12-week-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley males, representing approximately 2,000,000 independent clones (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, UK)). After mixing, 140 ml of 1× TE containing 100 mm lithium acetate and 40% polyethylene glycol 3350 were added. This was thoroughly mixed and placed at 30 °C for 30 min, transferred to a sterile 2-liter beaker, and 17.6 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide added. This was then heat-shocked for 6 min at 42 °C with occasional mixing. Cells were then washed in a further 500 ml of 1× TE and resuspended in 1000 ml of YEPD. After a 1-h incubation at 30 °C with gentle mixing, the cells were washed in synthetic medium (Yc), lacking leucine, tryptophan, lysine, and uracil, before incubating overnight in 100 ml of the same. Cells were finally washed twice in 1× TE and resuspended in 10 ml of 1× TE before plating on selection medium (Yc containing 20 g·liter−1 agar, lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, lysine, and uracil). The entire transformation was split evenly between eight 22 × 22-cm square Petri dishes. Aliquots were also plated to determine transformation efficiency onto plates lacking leucine, lysine, tryptophan, and uracil. After 8 days growth at 30 °C, colonies were picked to duplicate plates with or without histidine and assayed as described in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, UK). Colonies that were scored double-positive for both histidine selection and β-galactosidase were amplified in liquid culture, plasmid DNA-extracted, and library plasmids isolated by transformation into HB101 Escherichia coli. Plasmids were isolated by miniprep purification (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and isolated library plasmids retransformed to L40 with the negative control plasmid, pLexA-Lamin. Those which were negative for interaction with lamin were analyzed as follows. Plasmids were sequenced using vector-specific primers (insert-screening amplimers, CLONTECH) using the DNA sequencing service within the Department of Biochemistry, University of Bristol. DNA sequences were used to search the non-redundant GenBankTM data base using the BLAST search algorithm available over the Internet from the European Bioinformatics Institute. Plasmids containing full-length cDNAs of neurabin-I and neurabin-II were obtained from Professor Yoshimi Takai (ERATO Biotimer Project, Kobe, Japan) and Professor Paul Greengard (The Rockefeller University, New York). The PstI fragment of neurabin-I containing the majority of the coiled coil domain (amino acids 719–1023) was subcloned to pRSETc (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) and expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein inE. coli strain BLRDE3 (Novagen, Cambridge, UK) according to recommended protocols (Invitrogen). A fragment of neurabin-II (BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing amino acids 543–814) containing the majority of neurabin-II coiled coil regions was similarly expressed. A neurabin-II construct equivalent to the neurabin-I clone identified in the library screen (amino acids 483–817) was generated by PCR and cloned into pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Recombinant TGN38 cytosolic domain fusion proteins were generated as described previously (12Stephens D.J. Crump C.M. Clarke A.R. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14104-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other TGN38 constructs used in this study have also been previously described (12Stephens D.J.

J. 1998; 335: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other two-hybrid constructs were generated by PCR according to standard protocols. The full coding sequence of neurabin-I was amplified by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) according to standard protocols. The BglII restriction fragment of neurabin-II (amino acids 1–801, lacking the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of neurabin-II) was subcloned to pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH) generating an in-frame fusion with enhanced GFP (it was not found possible to amplify the full coding region of neurabin-II by PCR, presumably due to the high GC content of the 5′ end of the cDNA). Histidine-tagged and GST-tagged recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in BLRDE3E. coli (Novagen) and purified according to standard protocols using Talon resin (CLONTECH) or glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma), respectively. Surface plasmon resonance analyses were performed on a BIAcore 1000 biosensor using phosphate-buffered saline as running buffer. Manufacturer's recommended immobilization protocols for histidine-tagged and GST-tagged fusion proteins were followed. Data were aligned using BIAcore evaluation software and prepared for publication using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Reading, UK). Purified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged neurabin-I (coiled coil region) was separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), and blocked overnight in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 with 10% dried skimmed milk (blocking buffer). The blot was then incubated with 50 μg·ml−1 Trx-TGN38 (a thioredoxin fusion of the entire cytosolic domain of TGN38, Ref. 12Stephens D.J. Crump C.M. Clarke A.R. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14104-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), washed (3 × 10 min) in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of an anti-thioredoxin polyclonal antibody (raised in rabbit using purified recombinant thioredoxin as immunogen, Ref. 23Crump C.M.

The blot was washed again and incubated with a 1:10000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Western blotting Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PC12 cells (Ref. 24Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar; a kind gift of Dr. Frank Gunn-Moore, University of Bristol) were cultured on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies Inc.) according to standard protocols. Stable cell lines were selected using 400 μg·ml−1 G418 (Life Technologies Inc.) and maintained in 200 μg·ml−1 G418. For all cell imaging applications, cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips. Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to established protocols (described in Ref. 25Roquemore E.P. Banting G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2125-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-TGN38, clone 2F7.1 (26Horn M. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), anti- mannosidase-II (clone 53FC3, see Refs.27Baron M.D. Garoff H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were detected by incubation with 1:1000 dilutions of either Alexa-488- or Alexa-594-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Cambridge, UK). Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was kindly provided by Professor Jeremy Tavaré (University of Bristol). Stably transfected PC12 cells expressing GFP-neurabin-II were grown to approximately 70% confluence in T75 culture flasks, lysed in RIPA-containing protease inhibitors as described previously (25Roquemore E.P. Banting G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2125-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) supplemented with 20 μg·ml−1 latrunculin B (Calbiochem). Cleared supernatants were incubated with 2 μl each of polyclonal anti-TGN38 antibodies, 1918 and G29 (29Wilde A. Reaves B. Banting G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), or 4 μl of G29 preimmune serum, prebound to Gammabind (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 2 h mixing at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed six times (5 min each) in RIPA supplemented with protease inhibitors as for cell lysis. After boiling in SDS sample buffer, samples were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 1:2000 anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH). Blots were developed as described above. Binding was competed by including 30 or 100 μmTrx-TGN38 (a fusion protein including the entire cytosolic domain of TGN38 (12Stephens D.J. Crump C.M. Clarke A.R. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14104-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) as indicated. The entire cytosolic domain of TGN38 was used as bait in a screen of 6.5 × 106 clones of a rat brain cDNA library. This represented greater than 3-fold redundancy since the library contained 2 × 106 independent clones (see “Experimental Procedures”). 64 clones that showed positive interaction with TGN38 by both histidine autotrophy and expression of β-galactosidase activity were isolated. Of these 64 clones, three represented a partial clone of the F-actin binding protein, neurabin-I (30Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These clones (numbers 11, 17, and 118) were identical, showing 100% identity to amino acids 488–1095 of the published sequence of neurabin-I. This region of sequence includes the PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of neurabin-I as well as the entire carboxyl-terminal coiled coil region but is missing the amino-terminal actin binding domain. PDZ domains are known to interact with the extreme cytosolic domain of transmembrane receptors (31Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, a PDZ domain containing construct of neurabin-I (amino acids 488–718) showed no interaction with the cytosolic domain of TGN38 in our two-hybrid system, leading us to the conclusion that the PDZ domain of neurabin-I does not bind to TGN38. We also tested the ability of the full coding region of neurabin-I to interact with TGN38. Upon prolonged incubation in either growth or β-galactosidase assays, an interaction could be detected; the data showed that this interaction was significantly lower in affinity to that of the partial clone isolated from the library screen. We went on to characterize this interaction in more detail, screening library clone 118 against a number of TGN38 cytosolic domain constructs as well as a number of other receptor cytosolic domain constructs (all cloned as bait in pBTM116). Fig. 1 shows that as well as a strong positive interaction with the wild-type cytosolic domain of TGN38 (Fig. 1 , B1), clone 118 showed a positive interaction with TGN38 in which the last four amino acids (NLKL) had been deleted (Fig. 1, E1). This further suggests that the interaction is not mediated through the PDZ domain of neurabin-I, since PDZ domains are believed to bind to the terminal residues of membrane protein cytosolic domains (31Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Neurabin-I was found to interact with a TGN38 construct in which the critical tyrosine residue of the internalization motif was mutated to alanine (Y333A). Mutation of serine 331 of TGN38 to alanine (S331A, Fig. 1, C1) completely abolished binding of neurabin-I (clone 118, Fig. 1, D1), an effect also seen for the interaction between TGN38 and the μ2 subunit of the AP2 clathrin adaptor (12Stephens D.J. Crump C.M. Clarke A.R. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14104-14109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that neurabin and μ2 may have distinct but overlapping binding sites on the TGN38 cytosolic domain. The S331A mutant protein is functionally expressed in this system, since it interacts with another clone we have isolated in a different library screen. 2C. M. Crump, D. J. Stephens, and G. Banting, unpublished observations. In addition we also see no interaction between TGN38 and neurabin-I in assays using TGN38 constructs in which serine 331 is mutated to aspartate (not shown). The specificity of interaction between TGN38 and neurabin-I is further demonstrated by the lack of detectable interaction in the two-hybrid system of clone 118 with the cytosolic domains of CD63, TrkB, Lgp120, Simian immunodeficiency virus envelope, or the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (Fig. 1, row 2). A diagrammatic representation of the TGN38-neurabin interaction is shown in Fig. 2. Given the recent characterization of neurabin-II (spinophilin, Refs. 32Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar and 33Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the ubiquitous homologue of neurabin-I, we decided to investigate the interaction of neurabin-II with TGN38. Owing to the weakly observed signal for interaction of TGN38 with the full coding sequence of neurabin-I in the two-hybrid system (which we also observed for neurabin-II (not shown)), we generated a neurabin-II clone that precisely corresponded to the neurabin-I clone isolated from the library screen (neurabin-II amino acids 483–817) and tested this truncated neurabin-II construct for interaction with the same panel of receptor cytosolic domain constructs described above. The results are shown in Fig. 1 (rows 3 and 4). Exactly the same pattern of interactions is observed for neurabin-II as was seen for neurabin-I. Whereas wild-type TGN38 interacts with neurabin-II (Fig. 1,B3), mutation of serine 331 to alanine abolishes this interaction (Fig. 1, D3). Mutation of tyrosine 333 to alanine or removal of the last four amino acids of TGN38 has no effect on this interaction (Fig. 1, C3and E3). Similarly we detect no binding of neurabin-II to any of the other receptor cytosolic domains tested (Fig. 1, row 4). Since TGN38 is ubiquitously expressed (4Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), it is of great significance that an interaction with neurabin-II is detected as this is also expressed in all tissues examined (32Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 33Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To confirm that the interaction between TGN38 and neurabin is direct, we generated recombinant fusion proteins incorporating the cytosolic domain of TGN38 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion and the coiled coil domain of neurabins-I and -II as hexahistidine-tagged fusions. We reasoned from the two-hybrid data that the coiled coil domains of the neurabins were the most likely to interact with TGN38. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed to measure the interactions in real time. Fig. 3 A shows the results of an experiment in which the neurabin-I fusion was immobilized onto a charged Ni2+-NTA biosensor chip (0–60 s) followed by direct injection of either purified GST (gray circles) or a GST-TGN38 fusion (black circles). The data show that a robust binding of the GST-TGN38 fusion is detected with no detectable binding of GST alone. These data confirm the interaction between TGN38 and neurabin-I identified from the two-hybrid screen. As with our two-hybrid data, we went on to measure binding of the coiled coil domain of neurabin-II to the cytosolic domain of TGN38. In this experiment, represented in Fig. 3 B, we immobilized a GST-TGN38 fusion to the biosensor chip surface and flowed purified fusions of either neurabin-I (gray circles) or neurabin-II (black circles) coiled coil regions (amino acids 719–1023 and 543–814, respectively) across (note that this is the reciprocal of the previous experiment). As is evident from Fig. 3 B, we detect almost identical binding of these fusions to TGN38, whereas we detect no binding to negative control surfaces (coated with GST alone, data not shown). As a further control experiment, we attempted to measure binding of tropomyosin to the GST-TGN38 fusion. Tropomyosin contains significant regions of predicted coiled coil structure (34Whitby F.G. Kent H. Stewart F. Stewart M. Xie X. Hatch V. Cohen C. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) similar to those of neurabin-I and -II used in these experiments. The recent identification of tropomyosin isoforms on Golgi membranes (35Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) makes this a particularly suitable negative control for these TGN38 interaction assays. However, we detected no interaction of TGN38 with tropomyosin by surface plasmon resonance (not shown). We were also able to confirm the specificity of these interactions by generating fusion proteins in which the tyrosine 333 or serine 331 residues"

Changes in substrate availability or in the level of expression of proteins essential for AA metabolism (5-LO and/or 5-LO activating protein) have been correlated with the modulation of LT synthetic capacity (9Pueringer R.J.

However, changes in these variables do not account for all observed changes in LT synthetic capacity (15Suzuki K. Yamamoto T. Sato A. Murayama T. Amitani R. Yamamoto K. Kuze F. Am. J. Resp. Cell.

Evidence is accumulating that, even in resting or unstimulated cells, the subcellular distribution of 5-LO is dynamic and may influence LT synthetic capacity. In resting cells, the subcellular distribution of 5-LO is cell type-dependent; 5-LO is predominantly cytoplasmic in peripheral blood neutrophils (18Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these subcellular distributions are not necessarily fixed. For example, differentiation of monocytes to alveolar macrophages (22Covin R.B. Brock T.G. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L303-L310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but not peritoneal macrophages (3Peters-Golden M. McNish R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), is associated with nuclear accumulation of 5-LO. Conversely, removal of macrophages from the alveolar milieu results in subsequent accumulation of 5-LO to the cytoplasm (22Covin R.B. Brock T.G. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L303-L310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that factors in the alveolus drive nuclear import of 5-LO. Furthermore, adherence or recruitment of peripheral blood neutrophils (23Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or eosinophils (24Brock T.G. Anderson J.A. Fries F.P. Peters-Golden M. Sporn P.H.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1669-1676PubMed Google Scholar) induces nuclear import of 5-LO from the cytoplasm. In each case, a change in the subcellular distribution of 5-LO is associated with a change in LT synthetic capacity. All transport into the nucleus occurs through the nuclear pore complex (25Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26Schlenstedt G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The nuclear pore allows small molecules (<45 kDa) to diffuse freely into and out of the nucleus (25Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26Schlenstedt G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Targeting of larger proteins to the nucleus usually requires the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (25Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). NLSs are defined as sequences sufficient and necessary for nuclear import of their respective proteins. Two major types of NLSs are recognized: 1) a single cluster of basic amino acids exemplified by the SV40 large T antigen NLS; and 2) a bipartite NLS composed of two basic amino acids, a spacer region of 10–12 amino acids, and a basic cluster in which three of five amino acids must be basic as found in nucleoplasmin (27Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 28Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). For NLS-mediated nuclear import to occur, the NLS must be recognized by and associate with specific importins, which allows docking at the nuclear pore and translocation through the pore via an energy-dependent process (25Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26Schlenstedt G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). A recent study of nuclear import of 5-LO failed to identify a classical NLS as responsible for targeting this enzyme to the nucleus (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Rather, that study concluded that an as yet unidentified nonconventional signal located in the amino terminus targets 5-LO to the nucleus. In the current study, we have addressed this same question and have reached a completely different conclusion. Our studies have identified a basic region in the carboxyl terminus that resembles a classical bipartite NLS, have demonstrated that specific basic residues within this region are necessary for targeting 5-LO to the nucleus, and have provided evidence that the amino terminus is not sufficient to direct nuclear import. RAW 264.7 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown under 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transient transfectants were evaluated microscopically, live or after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, 16–24 h after transfection. The 5-LO cDNA (30Dixon R.A.F. Jones R.E. Diehl R.E. Bennett C.D. Kargman S. Rouzer C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. M. Abramovitz (Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research, Pointe Claire-Dorval, Quebec, Canada). To construct a plasmid that would express 5-LO, a 2.2-kb fragment containing the 5-LO cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). To construct a plasmid that would express 5-LO fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), a 2.2-kb fragment containing the 5-LO cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). pEGFP-C1 allows fusion of a sequence of interest to the carboxyl terminus of EGFP. All pEGFP-C1 constructs resulted in in-frame fusions, as determined by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Sequencing Core, University of Michigan). For simplicity, EGFP will be referred to as GFP. GFP/5LO-N was constructed by deleting the 0.5-kb BamHI fragment, encoding amino acids 563–673, from GFP/5LO. GFP/5LO-C was constructed by subcloning the 1.2-kb SmaI-SalI fragment of GFP/5LO, encoding amino acids 332–673, into pEGFP-C1. GFP/5LO (1–80) was constructed by deleting the 2.0-kb KpnI fragment, encoding amino acids 81–673, from GFP/5LO. To construct GFP/SV40-NLS, the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CCTCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAAGGTAGGCC-3′ and 5′-TACCTTTCTCTTCTTTTTTGGAGGAGCT-3′, encoding the SV40 NLS (KKKRK) (31Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), were annealed and ligated to the SacI andApaI sites of pEGFP-C1. To construct GFP/BR3, the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTCGCAAGAACCTCGAGGCCATTGTCAGCGTGATTGCTGAGCGCAACAAGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTTCTTCTTGTTGCGCTCAGCAATCACGCTGACAATGGCCTCGAGGTTCTTGCGA-3′, encoding Arg638–Lys655(RKNLEAIVSVIAERNKKK), were annealed and ligated to the BglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1. Specific amino acids within the putative 5-LO NLS were substituted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by DNA sequence analysis. Briefly, two complementary primers (125 ng each) containing the desired mutation and 50 ng of template in 1× reaction buffer were denatured at 95 °C for 30 s and annealed at 55 °C for 1 min, and DNA synthesis was carried out by Pfu polymerase at 68 °C for 14 min; this cycle was repeated 18 times. The methylated template was removed by incubation with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. Three types of alanine substitutions were constructed: Lys653 and Lys654 were substituted with alanine (R(K/R)NAAK) using 5′-GCGTGATTGCTGAGCGCAACGCGGCGAAGCAGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAGCTGCTTCGCCGCGTTGCGCTCAGCAATCACGC-3′ as mutagenic primers; Arg638 and Lys639 were substituted with alanine (AA…RNKKK) using 5′-GCCATGGCCCGATTCGCCGCGAACCTCGAGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCGAGGTTCGCGGCGAATCGGGCCATGGC-3′ as primers; and Arg651 was substituted with alanine (RK…ANKKK) using 5′GCGTGATTGCTGAGGCGAACGCGGCGAAGCAGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAGCTGCTTCGCCGCGTTCGCCTCAGCAATCACGC-3′ as primers. Plasmids containing combinations of these mutations (AA…RNAAK, AA…ANKKK, RK…ANAAK, and AA…ANAAK) were constructed by carrying out serial mutagenesis reactions. Two types of glutamine substitutions were constructed: Lys653 and Lys654 were substituted with glutamine (RK…RNQQK) using 5′-GCGTGATTGCTGAGCGCAACCAGCAGAAGCAGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGCTGCTTCTGCTGGTTGCGCTCAGCAATCACGC-3′ as mutagenic primers; and Arg651 was substituted with glutamine (RK…QNKKK) using 5′-GCGTGATTGCTGAGCAAAACAAGAAGAAGCAGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGCTGCTTCTTCTTGTTTTGCTCAGCAATCACGC-3′ as mutagenic primers. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Core at the University of Michigan. GFP fluorescence in transfected cells was detected with a Zeiss Aristoplan microscope equipped for epifluorescence using a 495-nm bandpass filter. Indirect immunofluorescent microscopy was carried out as described previously (20Brock T.G. Paine III, R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 30 min, permeabilized in acetone at −20 °C for 3 min, and air-dried. Cells were rehydrated and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing nonimmune goat serum. Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified human leukocyte 5-LO (a generous gift from Dr. J. Evans, Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research) (2Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J.A. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) was prepared in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (titer, 1:200) and applied for 1 h at 37 °C. Mounts were washed, incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma; titer, 1:200), and washed again. Rhodamine fluorescence was visualized as described above using a 585-nm bandpass filter. DNA was stained by diamidino-2-phenylindole and visualized using ultraviolet excitation. Differential interference contrast microscopy was also performed with the Zeiss Aristoplan microscope. Cells were disrupted by sonication (10 bursts at 20% duty cycle) in ice-cold homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, pH 7.4), and protein concentrations were determined by a modified Coomassie dye binding assay (Pierce). Samples containing 20 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with the 5-LO antibody (titer, 1:5000) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (titer, 1:5000) or with a GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH; titer, 1:5000) followed by peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (titer, 1:5000) and treated with the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To stimulate 5-LO activity and translocation, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 10 μm of the calcium ionophore A23187 and 10 μm arachidonic acid. Immunoreactive LTB4 in conditioned media was quantitated by enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), according to the supplier's instructions. We analyzed 5-LO nuclear import in the mouse cell line NIH 3T3 and in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Because 5-LO is predominantly expressed in cells of leukocytic origin, we preferred to analyze 5-LO nuclear import in RAW cells. However, the low transfection efficiency in these cells precluded their use in techniques requiring large numbers of transfectants (e.g. metabolic studies); the higher transfection efficiency of 3T3 cells permitted these analyses. Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed little or no detectable 5-LO expression in untransfected RAW and 3T3 cells (Fig.1 A). However, substantial 5-LO expression was detected in 3T3 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA/5LO, a plasmid that supports constitutive expression of human 5-LO (Fig. 1 A). Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that 5-LO colocalized with DNA and thus was localized predominantly in the nucleus in both 3T3 (Fig. 1 B) and RAW (Fig. 1 C) cells transfected with pcDNA/5LO. Nontransfected cells were evident by their lack of staining for 5-LO and positive staining for DNA. After stimulation of transfected 3T3 cells with the calcium ionophore A23187, appreciable LTB4 synthesis (1356 ± 96 pg/ml,n = 3) was detected by enzyme immunoassay. LT synthesis could not be detected in untransfected 3T3 cells. These data indicate that these cell lines are useful models for the analysis of 5-LO nuclear import. Next, we determined whether a GFP tag would facilitate the study of 5-LO nuclear import. Transiently transfected RAW or 3T3 cells expressing only the ∼27-kDa GFP exhibited fluorescence distributed evenly between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2 A), in agreement with results observed in other cell lines (e.g.Ref. 32Kain S.R. Adams M. Kondepudi A. Yang T.T. Ward W.W. Kitts P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 650-655PubMed Google Scholar). This lack of a gradient in distribution between nucleus and cytoplasm was presumably because of the small size of GFP, which would allow it to move freely through the nuclear pore. To determine the subcellular localization of a GFP/5LO fusion protein, we inserted the full-length human 5-LO cDNA into pEGFP-C1 (fusing the GFP to the carboxyl terminus of 5-LO was not attempted as the carboxyl terminus is known to be necessary for binding the iron in 5-LO). The resulting GFP/5LO construct would express an ∼105-kDa fusion protein, which would be too large to diffuse through the nuclear pore. Upon transient transfection with this construct, a strong intranuclear fluorescence pattern was observed (Fig. 2 B) in both cell lines. Thus, both 5-LO and GFP/5LO accumulate within the nucleus in RAW and 3T3 cells, suggesting the presence of a functional NLS in 5-LO. Upon stimulation with A23187, the GFP/5LO fusion protein translocated to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum in both cell types (Fig.2 C). In addition, significant LTB4 production (3667 ± 1365 pg/ml, n = 4) could be detected in transfected 3T3 cells, but not in untransfected cells, after stimulation with A23187. Thus, the GFP tag does not interfere with subcellular localization, translocation, or catalytic activity of 5-LO. Taken together, these results indicate that the use of a GFP tag is an appropriate approach for analysis of 5-LO nuclear import. As reported previously (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 5-LO contains three regions of basic amino acids that are candidate NLSs (Fig. 3). The first 80 amino acids of 5-LO, which contains the first basic region (BR1), have been reported to be sufficient to target GFP to the nucleus (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, images supporting that conclusion were unconvincing; the nuclei were many times larger than those in any other image, and the staining pattern for both DNA and the GFP/1–80 construct was much more clumped than the patterns of DNA or GFP/5-LO in other images. To re-examine these results, we also constructed GFP/5LO (1–80) in which the first 80 amino acids of 5-LO were fused to GFP. Sequence analysis indicated that this construct placed the 1–80 sequence in frame with GFP (not shown); immunoblot analysis confirmed that the produced protein was of the expected size (∼36 kDa) (Fig. 3). Upon transfection, fluorescence was observed to be evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in both cell types (Fig.3 B) and was distinctly different from the pattern produced by the intact 5-LO protein (Fig. 3 A). This pattern of fluorescence is likely because of the passive diffusion of this ∼36-kDa fusion protein and indicates that the first 80 amino acids of 5-LO are not sufficient to direct nuclear import of GFP in these cell lines. A larger segment of 5-LO, encoding amino acids 1–562 and including both BR1 and BR2, was also fused to GFP (5LO-N, Fig.3 C). This truncated ∼92-kDa protein was completely excluded from the nucleus in both cell types (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the putative BR1 and BR2 were insufficient to drive nuclear import of this size-excluded protein. These results also pointed to a possible role for the carboxyl terminus in nuclear import. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of 5-LO revealed an excellent candidate bipartite NLS at amino acids 638–655 (BR3, Fig.3). This region contains two basic amino acids, an 11-residue spacer region, and a basic cluster in which four of the five amino acids are basic. To determine if the carboxyl terminus of 5-LO could direct nuclear import, we fused the region containing amino acids 332–673 to GFP (GFP/5LO-C; Fig. 3 D). In cells transfected with this construct, which encoded an ∼67-kDa fusion protein, fluorescence was observed to be distributed evenly between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig.3 D). Because this fusion protein is unlikely to freely diffuse through the nuclear pore because of its size, these results suggest that this construct is being targeted, albeit inefficiently, to the nucleus. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that each fusion protein was of the expected size (Fig. 3). Nonspecific bands at approximately 50, 54, 68, and 105 kDa were found in all lanes when this commercial antibody to GFP was used. Many NLSs are able to direct nuclear import of a heterologous protein. GFP alone, again, is a small protein which, like GFP/5LO (1–80), distributed equally between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig.4 A). The fusion of the SV40 large T antigen NLS to GFP, which results in a protein of ∼28 kDa, produced strong intranuclear fluorescence and weak cytoplasmic fluorescence in 3T3 cells (GFP/SV40-NLS, Fig. 4 B) as well as RAW cells (data not shown). These results are in agreement with those observed in other cell lines (e.g. Ref. 29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and reflect that the GFP/SV40 NLS fusion protein is strongly targeted to the nucleus, despite being small enough (∼28 kDa) to move freely through the nuclear pore. To determine if BR3 (amino acids 638–655) alone could direct nuclear import of an unrelated protein, we fused the sequence encoding BR3 to GFP (GFP/BR3). In cells expressing this fusion, slightly more intranuclear fluorescence than cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed (Fig. 4 C). In multiple experiments in both 3T3 cells and RAW cells, nuclear accumulation of GFP/BR3 was greater than GFP alone but less than either GFP/SV40-NLS or GFP/5LO (Fig.4 D). These results suggest that this sequence is able to weakly target a heterologous protein to the nucleus. To determine if the 5-LO BR3 is necessary for nuclear import, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on specific residues of this sequence, changing positively charged arginine and/or lysine residues to alanine, which has a small uncharged side chain. The effects of these mutations were evaluated in the context of the entire GFP/5-LO fusion protein. As described above, the 5-LO BR3 possesses two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer region. Mutagenesis of two basic residues in either the first (AA…RNKKK, Fig.5 A) or second basic cluster (RK…RNAAK, Fig. 5 B) did not disrupt nuclear import in either cell type. Mutations in both basic clusters (AA…RNAAK, Fig.5 C) also did not disrupt nuclear import. However, mutagenesis of a single residue, the arginine at 651 (RK…ANKKK), resulted in an equal distribution of fluorescence between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5 D), suggesting a partial disruption of nuclear import. Combining this single mutation with mutations in the first basic cluster (AA…ANKKK, Fig. 5 E) or the second basic cluster (RK…ANAAK, Fig. 5 F) resulted in an extranuclear pattern of fluorescence, indicating a complete loss of nuclear import. Combining all the mutations in both clusters (AA…ANAAK, Fig. 5 G) also resulted in a failure to import. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that each mutant fusion protein was of comparable size and expression as GFP/5LO (Fig. 5); no breakdown products were found in any sample. These results indicated a critical role for Arg651 in nuclear import. However, the side chain of the substituted amino acid, alanine, differs both in size and charge from that of arginine. To eliminate size differences, Arg651 was also substituted with glutamine. Surprisingly, the R651Q substitution alone was sufficient to completely eliminate nuclear import in 3T3 cells (Fig.6 A). In contrast, substituting Lys653 and Lys654 with glutamine had no effect on nuclear import (Fig. 6 B), as previously reported (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether these NLS mutations resulted in similar localization patterns when expressed in the context of 5-LO alone rather than as a GFP fusion protein, mutant 5-LO constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1. After transfection of 3T3 cells with these pcDNA constructs, immunoblot analysis (Fig.7) confirmed that each construct was of comparable size to pcDNA/5LO (lane A). Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed subcellular distributions identical to those observed with the GFP fusion constructs (Fig. 7). These results showed that GFP did not influence 5-LO subcellular localization, confirmed the central role of Arg651, and supported the additive effects of deletions at basic residues other than Arg651. The nuclear import of 5-LO appears to be a critical regulatory component of its function. The current study identifies a key group of amino acids at positions 638–655 in the human protein, which are essential for nuclear import. Substitution of basic residues within this bipartite NLS completely block nuclear import of 5-LO, and the NLS alone can direct nuclear import of a heterologous protein (GFP) albeit poorly. We further demonstrate that these features are shared by both a myeloid cell line (RAW 264.7 macrophages) and a nonmyeloid cell line (NIH 3T3 cells), which is significant because 5-LO is largely limited in distribution to myeloid cells. This study also presents evidence that alternative candidate NLSs within the amino terminus are not sufficient to direct nuclear import. Together, these results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular regulation of nuclear import of 5-LO. The altered production of LTs can contribute to many inflammatory processes. Recent evidence correlates altered nuclear import of 5-LO with altered leukotriene synthetic capacity (22Covin R.B. Brock T.G. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L303-L310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 1669-1676PubMed Google Scholar). Our site-directed mutagenesis experiments point to Arg651 as being critical for nuclear import of 5-LO with partial or complete loss of import when replaced with alanine or glutamine, respectively. Substitution of basic residues around Arg651 could enhance, but not mimic, this effect. This arginine is conserved across species, including human, rat, mouse, and hamster 5-LO (Fig. 8). These results may have significant clinical implications: they predict a site within the 5-LO gene where a mutation could alter localization of the 5-LO enzyme and, conceivably, alter leukotriene synthetic capacity. Studies are currently underway to determine the effect of these mutations on leukotriene synthetic capacity in relevant cells. Both the bipartite NLS alone as well as the much larger carboxyl terminus of 5-LO could target GFP to the nucleus; the nuclear import of the carboxyl fragment, which should be excluded because of its size, supports the presence of an NLS. However, import was less efficient than that driven by the complete 5-LO protein fused to GFP. The results obtained using these fragments must be interpreted with caution, foremost because fragments may exclude key elements or include conflicting elements. For example, the weakness of import observed with the carboxyl fragment may indicate that a deleted sequence might augment the action of BR3. Similarly, the amino-terminal fragments may fail to be imported either because they lack an NLS or because they contain a dominant nuclear export sequence. These possibilities will require further study. Our findings also indicate that nuclear import of 5-LO is constitutive, but incomplete, in both cell lines, that is, 5-LO accumulates within the nucleus without cell stimulation, but a significant pool of 5-LO remains in the cytoplasm. Such a pattern of distribution may arise simply by protein overexpression to the extent that the capacity for import becomes saturated. Alternatively, the distribution may indicate that import is faster than export or that import is slower than synthesis. In any case, this pattern of a large nuclear pool with a lesser cytoplasmic pool is characteristic of many cell types; it has been reported for primary alveolar macrophages (4Woods J.W. Coffey M.J.

Med. 1997; 186: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and peritoneal macrophages (3Peters-Golden M. McNish R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the nuclear import of 5-LO can be regulated. For many proteins, nuclear import is modulated by phosphorylation (25Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). 5-LO reportedly can be phosphorylated (34Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and a comparison of the 5-LO sequence with a Prosite data base found at least 16 consensus phosphorylation sites scattered through the length of the protein. Phosphorylation at a site distinct from the bipartite NLS site may affect 5-LO localization and may be important in explaining some of the current findings. A previous study (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was the first to examine the molecular regulation of the nuclear import of 5-LO, and those results, combined with the current study, give a more complete picture of our current understanding. The region BR1 (AA 68–73) was analyzed in the previous work (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis of two of four basic residues and found not to be necessary for import. As we have shown for BR3, a more complete mutagenesis study is necessary to ascertain that BR1 is not necessary for import. Chen et al. (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also found the 1–80 fragment was sufficient for import. As noted above, the images presented to support import were unusual; the nuclei were much larger than those presented in any other image, and the clumped patterns of nuclear and GFP fluorescence were also unlike other images. Furthermore, the conclusions from the previous study were based on preparations that were fixed prior to examination. Fixation can result in a disproportionate loss of soluble cytosolic proteins relative to soluble nuclear proteins (23Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and this may have contributed to the impression that the 1–80 fragment had accumulated in the nucleus. Our findings, using live cells, contradict this conclusion, because neither the smaller 1–80 fragment nor the larger amino terminus fragment promoted nuclear import in either cell line; this site apparently requires further study. Previous mutagenesis of region BR2 (AA 128–133) blocked import, suggesting that this element contains an NLS (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in both this study and the previous work (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), fragments that included this region do not direct import of size-excluded proteins, indicating that this region is not sufficient for import. Finally, Chen et al. (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) found that limited mutagenesis of BR3 (AA 638–655) did not block import. We performed the same mutations and obtained the same results. However, our more complete mutational strategy revealed that replacement of Arg651 with alanine diminished nuclear import and that additional replacements of other basic residues augmented this effect. Chen et al. (29Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also reported that fragments that included BR3 were localized to the cytoplasm. However, the only image presented for the short carboxyl terminus (AA 564–673) showed an equal nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution as would be expected for a small protein, although they reported it to be exclusively cytoplasmic. In our hands, larger fragments, which should be size-excluded from the nucleus, are able to enter the nucleus if they contain BR3. However, BR3 is insufficient to drive import comparable to the intact 5-LO protein. Together, these results indicate that, although this basic region may have an essential role in the nuclear import of 5-LO, other parts of the protein must also contribute to the regulation of import. Understanding the molecular determinants regulating the subcellular localization of 5-LO and the consequences of its compartmentalization will be critical to understanding the metabolic function of this important component of the LT synthetic pathway. In addition, because the subcellular distribution of 5-LO may affect LT synthetic capacity, the 5-LO NLS is a potential site for mutations having clinical implications. Finally, the 5-LO protein may modulate cellular functions independent of its catalytic capacity by e.g.protein-protein interactions (35Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Provost P. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential nonmetabolic consequences of nuclear localization of 5-LO will need to be addressed. Stable cell lines overexpressing 5-LO exclusively in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm will be invaluable for dissecting the mechanisms regulating the subcellular distribution of 5-LO and determining its impact on LT synthesis as well as other cellular properties."

For example, while of limited sequence homology, IL13 and IL4 share a signaling receptor, IL13/4 receptor, on a variety of human normal cells. However, a subclass of IL4-independent IL13 receptors is overexpressed on certain transformed cells, including human malignant gliomas. We introduced mutations into human (h) IL13 to determine the site(s) involved in interaction with the shared receptor and/or the glioma-associated receptor. This analysis identified at least three protein regions that are needed for signaling through the shared receptor. These regions were localized to α-helices A, C, and D and were mainly separate from the region(s) needed to interact with the glioma-associated receptor. Glutamic acids at positions 13 and 16 in hIL13 α-helix A, arginine and serine at positions 66 and 69 in helix C, and arginine at position 109 in helix D were found to be important in inducing biological signaling since their specific mutation resulted in loss and/or gain of function phenomena. We demonstrate that the molecular requirements of hIL13 to interact with its respective receptors are generally distinct and can be controlled by mutagenesis of the cytokine.

In addition, a protein has been currently identified that binds hIL13 avidly, with no affinity toward hIL4 (22Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol.

Of importance, no cell signaling function has been assigned to this receptor (22Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol.

Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 591-602PubMed Google Scholar). Since IL13 and IL4 are believed to be structural homologs, primary amino acid sequence alignments between hIL4 and hIL13 were contributive in elucidating components of the shared IL13/4 receptor (1Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P. Miloux B. Minty C. Casellas P. Loison G. Lupker J. Shire D. Ferrara P. Caput D.

By using the alignment data, we have begun rational mutational studies of hIL13 to identify regions of hIL13 needed for its interaction with the components of the shared receptor. We have previously reported a mutant form of hIL13, hIL13.E13K, which not only has an impaired signaling through the shared receptor but also has enhanced avidity toward the IL13 cancer-associated receptor (24Debinski W. Gibo D.M. Obiri N.I. Kealiher A. Puri R.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Position 13 of hIL13 is, according to the sequence alignment data, equivalent to position 9 in hIL4. Suspecting this position in helix A to be a potential functional “hot spot,” a more in-depth mutational study of this site was done by substituting the position 13 glutamic acid of hIL13 with several other amino acids. Table I shows each mutant made and the mutagenic DNA primer used in its synthesis. Additional sites in helix A were also investigated, the 16th- and 17th-position glutamic acids. These sites were of interest since a complete helical turn up from the 13th-position would bring positions 16 and 17 to the same face of the helix. Since in wild-type hIL13, all three positions are glutamic acid, it was plausible that the entire cluster of negative charge might participate in binding to the shared receptor. The third area of hIL13 mutated for study was in the C-helix, such as positions 66 and 69; the sequence alignment suggested this area may be analogous to position 88 in hIL4 (11Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The fourth area mutated was in α-helix D. Arginine at position 109 was changed to aspartic acid, an IL13 mutant homolog to hIL4.R121D (11Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G.

Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All plasmids carrying the genes encoding proteins of interest were under a T7 promoter-based expression system. The plasmids were constructed as described (24Debinski W. Gibo D.M. Obiri N.I. Kealiher A. Puri R.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). BL21(λDE3) Escherichia coli, which carries the T7 RNA polymerase gene in an isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside-inducible form, was used as the host for recombinant protein expression. Production of recombinant proteins driven by T7 RNA polymerase allowed production of milligram quantities of recombinant protein from a 1.0-liter culture induced atA 600 of 2.0. For expression of proteins, competent BL21 cells were transformed with the appropriate plasmids and grown to A 600 equal to 2.0, at which point isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 250 μm. Cells were harvested 90 min later. The inclusion body fraction of the cells was isolated and denatured in 7 m guanidine HCl and then renatured by rapid dilution into buffer, using the disulfide-shuffling method as we have previously described (26Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis, the renatured proteins were purified using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system. Mutations of the hIL13 gene were made by standard polymerase chain reaction protocols (using the mutated oligonucleotides as sense or antisense primers in polymerase chain reaction) or by using a unique site elimination mutagenesis kit, based on the procedure developed by Deng and Nickoloff (27Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Primers used for the mutagenesis are shown in Table I. All mutated plasmids were isolated and sequenced, in house, to verify the correct mutation prior to use. Purity of the isolated recombinant proteins was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under nonreducing conditions. The separated proteins in the gel were stained either with Coomassie Blue for visual inspection or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, the polyvinylidene difluoride with the transferred proteins was incubated in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated for 1 h in 5% milk/PBS containing goat anti-human IL13 antibody (1:1,000 dilution). The antibody was raised against a hIL13-specific peptide located at the carboxyl terminus of hIL13. After incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed three times, 5 min each, with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in 5% milk/PBS containing donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000 dilution). The membrane was washed three times, 5 min each, with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. The immunoreactive proteins were identified on film, using enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Images were digitized using a Hewlett-Packard Scan-Jet 6100C scanner and composited using Microsoft Powerpoint software. CD spectra for the proteins were obtained over the wavelength range of 185–260 nm using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. All measurements were carried at 37 °C, using the same cuvette, the same orientation of the cuvette to the light source, and a 2-mm light path. Proteins (0.1 mg/ml) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then analyzed. For unfolded samples, protein was resuspended in 8 m urea containing 40 mm dithiothreitol (denaturation buffer). Reported spectra were the average of three consecutive runs for each sample. Spectra from appropriate blanks, PBS alone or denaturation buffer, were subtracted from each sample so that the resulting spectra reflected only the CD contribution of the proteins. TF-1 cells (pre-leukemic human B cells, which express the shared IL13/4 receptor) (18Obiri N.I. Leland P. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) were grown in the presence of different concentrations of wild-type interleukins or their mutants in 96-well culture plates. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, the rate of proliferation of the TF-1 cells was determined by a colorimetric MTS [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt]/PMS (phenazine methosulfate) cell proliferation assay. The cell samples were incubated with the dye for 4 h and then their absorbance at 490 nm was recorded for each well using a microplate reader. The wells with cells treated with high concentrations of cycloheximide served as background for the assay. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were seeded onto an eight-chambered slide, 50,000 cells per chamber, and incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow cells to attach. The media were removed and replaced with media containing hIL13 or its mutants (1 μg/ml final concentration). The cells were incubated again overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the media were removed, and the cells were fixed in ethanol and incubated with blocking medium (10% normal rabbit serum in PBS) at room temperature for 20 min. The blocking medium was removed, and goat anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) antibody (1 μg/ml) in 1.5% normal rabbit serum/PBS was added. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then primary antibody was removed and cells rinsed three times, 5 min each, with PBS. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG-Cy3 conjugate (1:150 dilution) in 1.5% normal rabbit serum/PBS for 45 min at room temperature, in the dark. After 45 min, the cells were rinsed three times, 5 min each, with PBS; a coverslip was mounted using aqueous mounting medium, and the fluorescent staining was determined using a rhodamine filter set. Images were obtained from the same experiment without adjusting the microscope between samples on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope and captured digitally using Snappy by Play Inc. Glioblastoma cells (U-251 MG and SNB-19) were plated into 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, hIL13 or its mutants were added to cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. An equal volume of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS was added to cells for assays without blocking ligand. After the hour incubation, increasing concentration of the hIL13 chimeric toxin (hIL13-CTX) (21Debinski W. Miner R. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22428-22433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was added (0.001–10 ng/ml final concentration), and the cells were incubated for 3 days. After 3 days, the number of proliferating cells in each well was determined using the colorimetric MTS/PMS method described above. The wells with cells treated with high concentrations of cycloheximide served as background for the assay. The prokaryotic production of the cytokines or their mutants under control of the T7 promoter was very efficient. After purification, between 0.5 and 1.5 mg of each cytokine or mutant was obtained from a 1-liter culture. When each purified protein was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, a single protein band was observed migrating at approximately 13 kDa (Fig.1, panel A). Visual inspection estimate suggested that all preparations are greater than 95% pure. The corresponding Western blot of the samples indicated that the isolated proteins were immunoreactive hIL13 or mutants thereof, since they reacted specifically with a goat polyclonal anti-hIL13 antibody, which lacks cross-reactivity with any other cytokine (Fig. 1,panel B). The α-helix D mutants hIL13.R109D and hIL13.F113D were immunoreactive toward the same antibody as well (data not shown). Traces of a dimeric form (∼26 kDa) of some of the mutated cytokines were also detected. To determine whether the recombinant interleukins had refolded correctly and that their mutation had not destroyed their general pattern of conformation, circular dichroism (CD) was used to determine the folded structure of the proteins. The secondary structure data from the spectropolarimeter indicated that each protein sample produced a spectrum consistent with an α-helical-enriched protein, having two spectral minima at approximately 208 and 222 nm (Fig.2). Furthermore, the CD spectrum of each mutant could be superimposed on the CD spectrum of the wild-type hIL13, although slight variations in spectra intensity were observed between samples (Fig. 2, panels A–C). hIL13.R109D and hIL13.F113D both produced CD spectra similar to the other mutants (not shown). For comparison, the CD spectrum of unfolded hIL13 was also obtained (Fig.2, panel D). The panel illustrates the collapse of the characteristic α-helical pattern when the protein is unfolded. Since hIL13 does not bind the p140 subunit of the shared IL13/4 receptor complex by itself (17Vita N. Lefort S. Laurent P. Caput D. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3512-3517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), direct binding measurements between hIL13 and p140 subunit cannot be obtained. Therefore, we employed functional assays as a measure of the association of hIL13 with the shared IL13/4 receptor complex. To determine whether the IL13 mutants had an altered association with the shared signaling IL13/4 receptor, their induced TF-1 cell proliferative response was measured. TF-1 cells proliferate in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of hIL13 or hIL4 since they express the shared IL13/4 receptor (11Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Obiri N.I. Leland P. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, wild-type hIL13 consistently produces a maximal proliferative response in TF-1 cells of ∼300% that of the base-line value (Fig.3, panel A). Differences were observed in TF-1 cell proliferation depending on whether the mutants were in the predicted α-helices A, C, or D. The α-helix A mutants showed both an inability as well as a preserved ability to induce proliferation, approaching and even surpassing that caused by wild-type hIL13 (Fig. 3, panels A andB). In accordance with previous data, hIL13.E13K showed a minimal proliferative response over the range tested (Fig. 3,panel B). Similarly, other mutants at position 13 failed to induce a proliferative response compared with native hIL13. These included hIL13.E13I, hIL13.E13S, and hIL13.E13Y (Fig. 3, panel B). Other mutants as this position showed contrasting activities to that of hIL13.E13K. Mutants hIL13.E13D and, unexpectedly, hIL13.E13R both induced a dose-dependent proliferation of TF-1 cells. Their induction of TF-1 cell proliferation followed the same pattern as wild-type hIL13, although hIL13.E13D had lesser effect on proliferation as hIL13.E13R (Fig. 3, panel A). The other two α-helix A mutants were hIL13.E16K and hIL13.E17K, with mutated sites one turn of the α-helix up from position 13. Both induced a dose-dependent response in TF-1 cell stimulation (Fig. 3,panel A). hIL13.E17K-induced effect was comparable to wild-type hIL13; however, hIL13.E16K exhibited a stimulation of TF-1 cell proliferation significantly greater than wild-type hIL13. The α-helix C mutants, hIL13.R66D and hIL13.S69D, both showed a significant impairment to stimulate TF-1 cells, compared with wild-type hIL13 (Fig. 3, panel C), although their action on TF-1 cells can be classified between that caused by mutants shown in Fig. 3,panels A and B. The α-helix D mutants also exhibited contrasting patterns of their action on TF-1 cells. Thus, hIL13.F113D was equivalent to wild-type hIL13 in inducing TF-1 cell proliferation contrary to the hIL13.R109D mutant, which was inactive on these cells (not shown). TF-1 cells have been characterized to possess the shared IL13/4 receptor and induce a detectable biological response to signaling through the receptor (11Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Obiri N.I. Leland P. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J.

Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). However, TF-1 cells are pre-leukemic cells. Therefore, to test further the ability of the hIL13 mutants to interact with the shared hIL13/4 receptor on normal cells, the cytokine-induced expression of VCAM-1 on the surface of HUVEC was assayed. Fig. 4 depicts results from two separate experiments showing the ability of hIL13 or its mutants to induce the expression of VCAM-1 on normal endothelial cells. The expression of VCAM-1 results from the binding and signaling of the cytokine through the shared IL13/4 receptor on the surface of the cells (7Schnyder B. Lugli S. Feng N. Etter H. Lutz R.A. Ryffel B. Sugamura K. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Moser R. Blood. 1996; 87: 4286-4295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells incubated in the absence of hIL13 showed minimal, nonspecific VCAM-1 staining (Fig. 4, panels A andG). In contrast, cells incubated overnight in media containing wild-type hIL13 had a marked increase in VCAM-1 (Fig. 4,panels B and H). The pattern of the staining appeared to be specific for certain areas of the cell surface, compared with the minimal, homogeneous staining of cells that had not been incubated with cytokine (Fig. 4, panels A and G). Cells incubated with mutants hIL13.E13I, hIL13.E13K, and hIL13.E13Y, which are unable to induce TF-1 cell proliferation (Fig. 3), had a diminished VCAM-1 expression compared with wild-type hIL13 (Fig. 4,panels C, D, F, and B, respectively). The residual activity of some solitary mutants may reflect the presence of another site in the interleukin, in α-helix C or D, that is involved in the signaling through the IL13/4 receptor, which is compatible with t"

Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). It activates protein kinase C, which plays a key role in the control of many signal transduction pathways involved in different cellular functions, such as growth, differentiation, and cell transformation (2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar, 3Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Protein kinase C overexpression is associated with increased tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in several experimental models (5Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and its activity is increased in tumors of breast and lung as compared with their normal counterparts (6O'Brian C.A. Vogel V.G. Singletary S.E. Ward N.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3215-3217PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase C by TPA can lead to growth stimulation and cellular transformation (5Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 6O'Brian C.A. Vogel V.G. Singletary S.E. Ward N.E.

Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). TPA could also induce growth arrest and differentiation in certain leukemia cells and cancer cells, which is accompanied by induction of p21WAF1 (9Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. El-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhang W. Grasso L. McClain C.D. Gambel A.M. Cha Y. Travali S. Deisseroth A.B. Mercer W.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 668-674PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that induction of p21WAF1 depends on Raf/ERK signaling and involves transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1 promoter in a p53-independent manner (12Liu Y. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 31-35PubMed Google Scholar). P21WAF1 is believed to inhibit cell cycle progression through its interaction with cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, which are required for various cell cycle transitions (13Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1997; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, 14Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Thus, TPA can either stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation, depending on cell type. All-trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA) and its natural and synthetic derivatives (retinoids) regulate a broad range of biological processes, including growth, differentiation, and development in both normal and neoplastic cells (15Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar, 16Hong W.K. Itri L.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 597-630Google Scholar). The effect of retinoids are mainly mediated by two classes of nuclear receptors, the RA receptors and retinoids X receptors, that are encoded by three distinct genes, (α, β, and γ) and are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily (17Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 18Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X.-k. Pfahl M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 156-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Retinoid receptors modulate the expression of their target genes in response to their natural ligands trans-RA and 9-cis-RA by interacting as either homodimers or heterodimers with RA response elements. A number of RA target genes have been identified and many of them are associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth (17Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 18Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X.-k. Pfahl M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 156-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition to transactivation function, retinoid receptors exert potent trans-repression function, which also plays an important role in mediating the diverse function of retinoids. Retinoid receptors, in response to their ligands, can inhibit the effect of TPA by repressing the transcriptional activity of AP-1 (20Pfahl M. Endocrinol . Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ligand-activated retinoid receptors repress AP-1 activity remains largely unknown, although a direct protein-protein interaction between retinoid receptors and AP-1 (20Pfahl M. Endocrinol . Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and a competition for a common coactivator (21Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar) have been proposed. Nevertheless, the interaction between membrane and retinoid receptor signaling pathways may represent an important mechanism by which retinoids exert their potent anti-neoplastic effect. To further understand the growth regulatory effect of TPA and its interaction with retinoid signaling, we evaluated the interaction of TPA and trans-RA on growth of several human lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that TPA exhibited different effects on growth of these cancer cell lines. TPA induced growth arrest of lung cancer cell lines H460 and H292 through either induction of p21WAF1expression and ERK activity and/or inhibition of Cdk2 expression. In contrast, TPA enhanced proliferation of ZR75-1 breast cancer cells through induction of JNK and AP-1 activity. When the effect oftrans-RA on TPA activity was studied, we observed that it could additively increase the growth inhibitory effect of TPA in lung cancer cells, mainly due to its repression of constitutive AP-1 activity in the cells rather than its modulation of TPA-induced P21WAF1 expression and ERK activity. In contrast,trans-RA abolished the growth-stimulatory effect of TPA by repressing TPA-induced AP-1 activity in a JNK-independent mechanism in breast cancer cells. These results demonstrate that two potent growth regulators, TPA and trans-RA, play a critical role in regulating cancer cell growth and that trans-RA modulates TPA activity through its interaction with TPA-induced JNK/AP1 pathway but not TPA-induced ERK/p21WAF1 pathway. The non-small cell lung cancer cell lines H460 and H292 and breast cancer cell lines ZR75-1 and T47D were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). They were grown in RPMI 1460 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. One day later, the desired volume of TPA was added to the cells to achieve a final concentration of 0.001–10 nm. The effect of 10−6m trans-RA was analyzed alone or in combination with various TPA concentrations. The control cells received vehicle (ethanol). Media and retinoids were changed every 48 h. Viable cell number was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (22Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml PBS and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol and kept in a freezer overnight. Fixed cells were centrifuged, washed once in PBS, and then resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-citrate buffer (192 parts of 0.2 m Na2HPO4and 8 parts of 0.1 m citric acid, pH 7.8) for 30 min at room temperature to wash out any degraded DNA from apoptotic cells. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm, and the cell pellets were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell suspension, protected against light, was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then analyzed using the FACScater-plus Flow cytometer. For Northern blot analysis, total RNAs were prepared by the guanidine hydrochloride/ultracentrifugation method (22Liu Y. Lee M.-O. Wang H.-G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-k. Mol.

About 30 μg total of RNAs from different cell lines were fractionated on 1% agarose gels, transferred to nylon filters, and probed with the32P-labeled probe as described previously (22Liu Y.

Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Aliquots containing 50 μg of proteins were resolved on 12% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection was carried out using anti-p21WAF1 (Santa Cruz), anti-p53 (Oncogene Inc.), and anti-Cdk2 (Santa Cruz) antibodies in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection was performed with an enhanced chemilumienescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used as a control for protein loading. Cells were seeded in six-well plates 2 days prior the analysis to provide ∼80% confluent preparations. After treatment with different agents, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS solution and suspended in lysis buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). The Jun kinase assay was performed according to the method described previously (23Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of whole cell lysate were mixed with 10 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (1–223) (GST-c-Jun) and rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. GST-c-Jun proteins were purified fromEscherichia coli and bound to agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were then washed twice and incubated with 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm ditiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. For ERK assay, 50 μg of whole cell extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK2 antibody, which exhibit cross-reactivity with ERK1 (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then washed and incubated with 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μg/reaction of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) as substrate. Reactions were stopped by adding 15 μl of SDS-loading buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun and MBP proteins were eluted by boiling the samples for 5 min, and resolved on 10% and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. Cells were seeded in six-well culture plates at 5 × 105 cells/well. A modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure was used for transient transfection as described elsewhere (24Zhang X.-k. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 ng of reporter plasmid (−73Col-CAT) (25Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.-k. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar, 26Agadir A. Shealy Y.F. Hill D.L. Zhang X.-k. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3444-3450PubMed Google Scholar) and 250 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH 110, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were mixed with carrier DNA (pBluescript) to 2.5 μg total of DNA/well. The day after transfection (18 h), cells were incubated in a medium containing 0.5% charcoal-treated FCS with trans-RA at the indicated concentrations and/or TPA (100 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h. We investigated the growth inhibitory effect of TPA andtrans-RA on a number of human cancer cell lines, including lung cancer cell lines H460 and H292 and breast cancer cell lines ZR75-1 and T47D. As shown in Fig. 1, TPA inhibited the growth of both lung cancer cell lines by 80% at 1 or 10 nm. TPA, however, did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on growth of ZR75-1 and T47D breast cancer cells over a broad range of concentrations from 0.001 to 10 nm. Interestingly, TPA at 10 nm, enhanced the growth of ZR75-1 cells but not T47D cells. These data demonstrate that the effect of TPA on the growth of cancer cells is cell type-dependent, consistent with previous observations (27L'Allemain G. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nori M. L'Allemain G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Villeval J.L. Pellicci P.G.

In contrast to TPA, trans-RA showed growth inhibition on all cell lines investigated. In lung cancer cells H460 and H292, the percentage of inhibition was about 40 and 20%, respectively, whereas in breast cancer cells ZR75-1 and T47Dtrans-RA showed 60 and 50% inhibition, respectively (Fig.1). When trans-RA was used in combination with TPA, an additive growth inhibitory effect was observed in H460 and H292 cells when low concentrations of TPA (0.01 nm and 0.1 nm) were used. Interestingly, the growth stimulatory effect of TPA on ZR75-1 cells was completely abolished by trans-RA (Fig. 1). Thus, trans-RA could enhance TPA-induced growth inhibition, but antagonizes TPA-induced cell proliferation. To determine how TPA regulates growth of H460, H292, ZR75-1, and T47D cells, we investigated their cell cycle progression in response to TPA. The DNA content analysis showed that H460 and H292 cells underwent a stable G0/G1 arrest following 15 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 2, A andB). The entry of these cells into S phase was suppressed, while G0/G1 population was increased from 52 to 75%, and from 51% to 72%, respectively (Fig. 2, A andB, Table I). This data suggests that the growth inhibitory effect of TPA on these lung cancer cells is mainly due to its effect on cell cycle progression. When ZR75-1 and T47D breast cancer cells were analyzed, we observed a decrease in G0/G1 cell population (Fig. 2,A and B). This decrease was more apparent in ZR75-1 cells, with a percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase decreasing from 75 to 43% when they were treated with 10 nm TPA for 15 h (Fig. 2,A and B, Table I). At the same time an increase in S phase cell population of 37 and 16% was observed in ZR75-1 and T47D cells, respectively. When the effect of trans-RA on cell cycle progression was analyzed, trans-RA alone did not show significant changes of G0/G1 arrest of H460, H292, and ZR75-1 cells, except a slight increase (5%) observed in T47D cells (Table I). When trans-RA was used together with TPA, it slightly increased TPA-induced G0/G1 in H460 and H292 cells (Table I). However, the inhibitory effect of TPA on G0/G1phase in ZR75-1 and T47D cells was largely blocked bytrans-RA (Table I). In ZR75-1 cells, in the absence oftrans-RA, TPA decreased G0/G1 phase from 75 to 43%, which was reverted to 55% when trans-RA was present. The effect of TPA on G0/G1 phase in T47D cells was completely abolished by trans-RA. These data demonstrate that trans-RA could inhibit the effect of TPA on cell cycle progression of ZR75-1 and T47D cells.Table IEffect of TPA and RA on cell cycle distribution of human cancer cell linesCell cycle phaseDistribution in cell cycleaCell cycle distribution of cells treated with 10−6m trans-RA and/or 10 nm TPA.

Open table in a new tab To obtain insight into the molecular mechanism by which TPA regulates cell cycle progression of cancer cells, we examined the effect of TPA on p21WAF1, p53 and Cdk2 gene expression. When expression of p21WAF1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (31El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar), was determined by Northern blot analysis, we observed that it was rapidly and strongly induced by TPA in H460, H292, ZR75-1, and T47D cells (Fig.3, A and B). Interestingly, when expression of p21WAF1 was analyzed by Western blotting, we found that it was only strongly induced in H292 and H460 cells (Fig. 4A). Slight induction of p21WAF1 was observed in T47D cells, whereas ZR75-1 cells did not show any expression of p21WAF1 either in the absence or in the presence of TPA (Fig. 4 B). This observation suggests that p21WAF1 expression is also regulated by a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. A 12-h treatment increased p21WAF1 expression by about 8-fold in H460 cells and 12-fold in H292 cells (Fig. 4 A). There was no evidence for p53 induction by TPA in these cell lines (Fig. 4 A). The fact that p21WAF1 was induced in H460 and H292 cells, in which p53 was not expressed or induced indicates that TPA-induced p21WAF1is p53-independent. We also examined the effect of TPA on expression of Cdk2 gene, which is also known to play a critical role in G0/G1 progression (13Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1997; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). The Cdk2 gene was highly expressed in all cell lines investigated (Fig. 4, Aand B). However, TPA treatment for 12 h strongly inhibited expression of Cdk2 in H460 cells (Fig. 4 A), while it had no effect in H292, ZR75-1, and T47D cells (Fig. 4, Aand B). These data suggest that induction of G0/G1 arrest by TPA in H292 cells is likely due to its effect on p21WAF1, whereas induction of p21WAF1and/or inhibition of Cdk2 expression may be responsible for TPA-induced G0/G1 arrest in H460 cells.Figure 4Analysis of TPA effect on p21WAF1, p53, and Cdk2 expression by Western blot. A, lung cancer cells. B, breast cancer cells. Cell extracts were prepared from the indicated cell lines treated with 10 nmTPA at the indicated times and analyzed for the expression of p21WAF1, p53, and Cdk2.

Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 8Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). We then determined whether induction of AP-1 could account for enhancement of cell proliferation by TPA in ZR75-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, expression of both c-Jun and c-Fos was strongly induced in ZR75-1 cells. Induction of c-Jun and c-Fos occurred as early as 30 min after TPA treatment. c-Jun was expressed in both H460 and H292 cells. However, its level of expression was not affected by TPA treatment. Expression of c-Fos in H460 and H292 cells was not influenced by TPA either (Fig. 3 A). These data, therefore, suggest that induction of c-Jun and c-Fos may contribute to TPA-induced cell proliferation in ZR75-1 cells. To study how TPA regulates p21WAF1 expression and whether trans-RA modulates TPA activities in lung and breast cancer cell lines, we evaluated ERK activity that is known to regulate expression of p21WAF1 (12Liu Y. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 31-35PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the phosphorylation of MBP after immunoprecipitation of the whole cell extracts with anti-ERK2 antibody to determine ERK activity. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of H460 cells with TPA for 30 min strongly induced ERK activity, while treatment with trans-RA did not show a clear effect on this activity. When trans-RA and TPA were used together TPA-induced ERK activity was not affected (Fig. 5). In ZR75-1 cells, ERK activity was slightly induced by TPA. Again, trans-RA did not show any effect on TPA-induced ERK activity in these cells. To determine whether induction of ERK activity by TPA is responsible for p21WAF1 induction, we examined the effect of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of Raf/ERK pathway, on p21WAF1 expression in H460 and ZR75-1 cells (Fig. 6). PD98059 alone (50 μm) did not show any effect on the expression of p21WAF1. However, when PD98059 was used together with 10 nm TPA, induction of p21WAF1 by TPA was completely inhibited in both cell lines (Fig. 6). This suggests that induction of ERK is mainly responsible for p21WAF1 induction. Treatment of H460 cells with trans-RA for 24 h did not show a clear effect on p21WAF1 expression, consistent with the observation that trans-RA could not affect TPA-induced ERK activity. Thus, trans-RA has no effect on TPA-induced ERK/p21WAF1 pathway.Figure 6PD98059 inhibits TPA-induced p21WAF1. Cells maintained in 0.5% FCS were first treated with 10−6m trans-RA for 24 h. One day later PD98059 (PD) (50 μm) was added, and the cells were incubated for 4 h before addition of TPA (10 nm). Cells were then incubated for an additional 15 h. Total RNAs were prepared from H460 and ZR75-1 cells and analyzed for the expression of p21WAF1 by Northern blot. Expression of β-actin is shown to ensure that equal amounts of RNAs were used.Control, untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data demonstrate that TPA was able to induce c-Jun and c-Fos expression in ZR75-1 cells (Fig.3 B), suggesting that signaling that leads to AP-1 induction is functional in these cells. Transcriptional regulation of c-Jun expression is mainly mediated by a TPA-response element in its promoter, which binds to c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimer (33Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). ATF-2 and c-Jun are activated mainly by JNK. The fact that c-Jun expression was rapidly induced by TPA in ZR75-1 cells (Fig. 3 B) suggests that TPA may induce JNK in this cell line. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed JNK activation in H460 and ZR75-1 cells. JNK activity was determined by examination of the phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun in whole cell extracts prepared from H460 and ZR75-1 cells treated with different agents. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of ZR75-1 cells with 10 nm TPA for 30 min strongly induced JNK activity in these cells. However, the same treatment failed to activate JNK in H460 cells. As a control, UV stimulation exhibited a strong activation of JNK in both cell lines. These data suggest that induction of c-Jun by TPA in ZR75-1 cells is likely due to activation of JNK. trans-RA has been shown to inhibit JNK activity in various cell types (34Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Gene Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To study whether inhibition of TPA-induced cell proliferation in ZR75-1 cells bytrans-RA was due to inhibition of JNK activity, we cotreated cells with TPA and trans-RA. Trans-RA alone did not show any effect on JNK activity in ZR75-1 cells (Fig. 7). It also failed to inhibit TPA-induced JNK activity. Thus, it is unlikely thattrans-RA antagonizes TPA effect by inhibiting TPA-induced JNK activity in ZR75-1 cells. trans-RA can antagonize TPA effect through inhibition of AP-1 activity (20Pfahl M. Endocrinol . Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We then investigated the effect of trans-RA on transactivation of collagenase promoter which contains an AP-1 binding site (25Yang-Yen H.F. Zhang X.-k. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219PubMed Google Scholar, 26Agadir A. Shealy Y.F. Hill D.L. Zhang X.-k. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3444-3450PubMed Google Scholar). When reporter construct containing the collagenase promoter linked with the CAT gene, −73Col-CAT, was transiently transfected into ZR75-1 cells, treatment of the cells with TPA strongly induced the reporter transcription (Fig. 8 A). In contrast, the −73-Col-CAT reporter was highly active in H292 cells, and addition of TPA did not significantly induce transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 8 B). This suggests that TPA could strongly induce AP-1 activity in ZR75-1 cells but not in H292 cells, consistent with regulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expression by TPA (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2091152346,"Four transcriptional activatingcis-elements within the gp91phox promoter bind a protein complex of similar mobility and binding specificity, denoted BID (binding increased during differentiation). The intensity of BID complexes increases upon myeloid cell differentiation, coincident with induction of gp91phox expression, and BID competes with the transcriptional repressor CDP for binding to each of these promoter elements. To determine the identity of BID, an expression library was ligand screened with the BID-binding site that surrounds the −145-base pair (bp) region of the gp91phox promoter. One recovered factor that exhibits the expected binding specificity is YY1, a ubiquitous multifunctional transcription factor. BID complexes that form with the four binding sites within the gp91phox promoter are disrupted by YY1 antiserum, and a fifth YY1-binding site was detected in the −412-bp promoter region. Overexpression of YY1 in transient co-transfection assays trans-activates a minimal promoter containing two copies of the −145-bp binding site from the gp91phox promoter. Neither the level of YY1 protein nor DNA binding activity increases during myeloid cell differentiation. These studies identify a target gene of YY1 function in mature myeloid cells, and demonstrate that YY1 function can be controlled during myeloid development by the modulation of a competing DNA-binding factor."
https://openalex.org/W2030061983,"Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) are plasminogen-related growth and motility factors that interact with cell-surface protein tyrosine kinase receptors. Each one is a heterodimeric protein comprising a disulfide-linked α chain and a serine protease-like β chain. Despite structural similarities between MSP and HGF, the primary receptor binding site is located on the α chain of HGF/SF but on the β chain of MSP. To obtain insight into the structural basis for MSP β chain binding, β chain structure was modeled from coordinates of an existing model of the HGF β chain. The model revealed that the region corresponding to the S1 specificity pocket in trypsin is filled by the Asn682/Glu648 interacting pair, leaving a shallow cavity for possible β chain interaction with the receptor. Mutants in this region were created, and their binding characteristics were determined. A double mutation of Asn682/Glu648 caused diminished binding of the β chain to the MSP receptor, and a single mutation of neighboring Arg683 completely abolished binding. Thus, this region of the molecule is critical for binding. We also found that at equimolar concentrations of free α and β chains, α chain binding to receptor was detectable, at levels considerably lower than β chain binding. The EC50 values determined by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are 0.25 and 16.9 nm for β and α chain, respectively.

Hara H. Takehara T. Shimonishi M. Sakai H. Shimizu N. Shimizu S. Wang M.-H. Hagiya M. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to make a disulfide-linked αβ chain heterodimer (20Nanney L.B. Skeel A. Luan J. Polis S. Richmond A. Wang M.-H. Leonard E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MSP and HGF have 40% sequence similarity to plasminogen and the same domain organization. The three proteins evolved from a common ancestor (21Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Features of the α chain of MSP and HGF include an N-terminal domain (N domain) corresponding to the plasminogen preactivation peptide, four kringles, and a segment that terminates in the cleavage site for activation; the β chain is the serine protease-like domain. HGF binds with high affinity to its receptor via the α chain. The N domain makes a critical contribution to HGF binding, since N domain deletion mutants have reduced or absent biological activity (22Sakata H. Stahl S.J. Taylor W.G. Rosenberg J.M. Sakaguchi K.

Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and fail to inhibit binding of HGF to Met-expressing target cells (23Lokker N.A. Presta L.G. Godowski P.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast to HGF, studies with125 I-labeled subunits of MSP showed that the β chain bound with high affinity to RON, whereas α chain binding was undetectable (24Wang M.H. Julian F.M. Breathnach R. Godowski P.J. Takehara T. Yoshikawa W. Hagiya M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16999-17004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mutant MSP lacking the β chain is biologically inactive (25Waltz S.E. McDowell S.A. Muraoka R.S. Air E.L. Flick L.M. Chen Y.Q. Wang M.H. Degen S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30526-30537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, despite the similarity in domains of HGF and MSP, the loci for high affinity binding to their receptors are completely different. To explore the basis of MSP β chain binding to RON, we took advantage of a recently published energy-minimized three-dimensional model of the β chain of HGF (21Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We used the HGF model coordinates to make a comparable model of the MSP β chain to look for features that might account for its binding properties. By analogy to proteases, MSP and HGF correspond to enzymes, and their receptors correspond to enzyme substrates. From this viewpoint, regions of the MSP serine protease-like domain of particular interest for binding to receptor would include the catalytic site and several surface loops that define the substrate binding cleft for chymotrypsin-like proteases (26Perona J.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our model of the MSP β chain revealed features that were postulated to account for its binding to RON. Mutagenesis studies reported herein established that the region corresponding to an enzyme S1 site is essential for β chain binding to RON. Our experiments also revealed binding to RON-expressing cells of MSP-free α chain, which was a small fraction of the amount of β chain binding. This suggests that MSP has two receptor binding sites, a high affinity site in the β chain and a low affinity site in the α chain. The result supports a recent hypothesis that ligand-induced RON dimerization by MSP is mediated by a single ligand molecule, which binds to a receptor via the β chain, after which a second receptor is engaged by the α chain (27Miller M. Leonard E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Human recombinant MSP and free α and β chains were from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit and mouse anti-MSP antibodies were described (28Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguchi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and CHO-K1 cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). MDCK cells stably transfected with a human RON cDNA (clone RE7) were described (9Wang M.-H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.-C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the MSP β chain has 48% amino acid identity to the HGF β chain, we used the coordinates of the three-dimensional model of the HGF β chain (21Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) to model the MSP β chain structure. Side chains of HGF were replaced with MSP side chains according to the alignment shown in Fig. 1. Positions of the conserved backbone atoms were not altered. The loop comprising residues 525–533 was modeled to reflect the experimentally demonstrated disulfide bridge between Cys527 and Cys562 (19Yoshikawa W. Hara H. Takehara T. Shimonishi M. Sakai H. Shimizu N. Shimizu S. Wang M.-H. Hagiya M. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Subsequently the positions of several side chains were adjusted manually (program FRODO and its silicon graphics version TOM (29Jones A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar)) to remove bad contacts and to optimize electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The model was then energy-minimized using program XPLOR (30Brunger A. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) employing 250 cycles of the Powell conjugate gradient algorithm. All mutants were generated using the pAlterII (Promega, Madison, WI) mutagenesis kit with mutagenic oligonucleotides as follows: for R683Q, GGAATTATAATCCCCAACCAAGTATGCGCAAGGTCCCGC; for E648G/D682G, ATGTGCACTGGGGGACTGTTG/ATAATCCCCGGCCGAGTATGC. For stable transfection of eukaryotic cells wild type and mutant MSP were re-cloned into pCL-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum. For stable expression of MSP, cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of MSP cDNA by Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and placed in medium with 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After selection, single colonies were cloned, and clones with highest equal expression of wild type and mutant MSP were selected. The concentration of recombinant MSP in culture supernatants was measured by sandwich ELISA. The concentration of secreted recombinant MSP in cell culture supernatants was determined by sandwich ELISA (28Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguchi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Concentrations were calculated by reference to a standard curve generated with wild type recombinant human MSP. MSP from culture supernatants was immunoprecipitated by rabbit polyclonal anti-MSP antibodies conjugated to Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed and boiled after addition of 2× sample buffer. After PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MSP was detected with rabbit anti-MSP antibodies. ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for visualization of the peroxidase complex. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant MSP were incubated for 48 h with35 S-easy labeling mix ([35 S]cysteine and [35 S]methionine) (NEN Life Science Products) in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The quality and quantity of 35 S-labeled MSP were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. MDCK-RE7 cells with stably expressed RON receptor were used. The parental MDCK cell line without detectable expression of RON was used as a negative control. Five ml of supernatant containing equal concentrations of 35 S-labeled wild type or mutant MSP were added to 5 × 106 RE7 or MDCK cells. Cells were equilibrated for 4 h at 4 °C. After equilibration, cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After clarification, lysates were immunoprecipitated by equilibration overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-MSP antibodies coupled to Sepharose. Then immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were detected by radioautography. For competition assays, 50 nmunlabeled recombinant human MSP or free α or β chains were equilibrated with cells together with 35 S-labeled MSP culture supernatants. RE7 cells (5 × 106/well) with stably expressed RON receptor and parental MDCK cells as a negative control were equilibrated for 4 h at 4 °C in 5 nm free recombinant α chain or MSP. Cells were then washed, and cell lysates were processed as described above, except that detection of protein bands was by immunoblotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-MSP antibodies. ELISA microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with the recombinant mouse MSP receptor RON/Fc (rmRON/Fc) chimera (R & D Systems, Inc.) (100 μl/well at 0.5 μg/ml in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. RON-coated ELISA plates were then incubated for 2 h with a series of 2-fold dilutions of human recombinant MSP (highest concentration 6.4 nm), free β chain (highest concentration 8 nm) or free α chain (highest concentration 320 nm). ELISA plates were washed 3 times with TBS/Tween 20 after this and subsequent steps. Plates were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-MSP for an additional 2 h. The rabbit anti-MSP antibodies recognize MSP and separate free chains with comparable sensitivity, as determined by direct ELISA in which microtiter wells were coated with MSP or free α or β chain standards (data not shown). Bound rabbit anti-MSP was detected by equilibration with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Substrate 104 (Sigma) was used for quantifying alkaline phosphatase activity. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured with an ELISA reader. At least three independent experiments were performed. To quantify ligand binding affinity, EC50 values were calculated by using a four-parameter nonlinear fitting algorithm (31Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The structural core of all chymotrypsin-like serine proteases is composed of two six-stranded β barrels, with the active site in a crevice between these two domains. MSP and HGF β chains have 48% sequence identity (Fig. 1) and higher than 30% sequence similarity to several mammalian serine proteases. Features in common include the same bilobed core, several surface loops, and a C-terminal helix (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, despite loss of enzymatic activity because of catalytic triad mutations, the geometry of the regions of MSP that correspond to the active site of serine proteases has been conserved. This includes mutated catalytic triad residues Gln522(57), 3MSP residue numbers in the text are followed in parentheses by the corresponding bovine trypsin residue number.Gln568(102), and Tyr661(195) (coloredmagenta in Figs. 1 and 2) at the junction of the β barrels, the same conformation of the Gly655(189)-Asp660(194) segment (coloredviolet) necessary for the formation of an oxyanion hole and a mature substrate specificity pocket. The critical interaction maintaining active site architecture, a salt bridge between Asp660(194) and the NH3+ group from the N-terminal Val of the β chain, is conserved. The residues critical for zymogen activation (for a review see Ref. 32Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) are also conserved in MSP, suggesting that conversion to the biologically active growth factor conformation mirrors the mechanism of zymogen activation. In the zymogen form of the chymotrypsin-like enzymes, the active site cleft is not completely formed. His505(40) interacts with Asp660(194), and the adjacent segment Gly655(189)-Asp660(194) is oriented to the interior of the zymogen. Upon activation, Asp660(194) forms the salt bridge noted above with the newly liberated N terminus, and segment Gly655(189)-Asp660(194) (coloredviolet in Fig. 2 A) moves outward toward solvent to complete the active site cleft. Surface loop features specific for MSP are noted in the legend of Fig.2 A. A detailed view of the region of MSP corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and catalytic triad is shown in Fig.2 B. Several features distinguish MSP from trypsin in this region as follows: 1) The entrance to the large cylindrical S1 pocket is blocked in MSP by Asn682(216) and Ala692(226), in contrast to trypsin, which has Gly residues at these positions. The conformation of Asn682(216) is stabilized by interaction with Glu648(184) buried inside the pocket. 2) Residue 655 in the base of the pocket in MSP is Gly, whereas in trypsin it is Asp, which interacts with the scissile bond Lys of the substrate. Thus, the model suggests that the receptor binding region of MSP does not include the base of the S1 pocket but involves the entrance. Two MSP mutants were generated, a double mutant of residues that stabilize the shape of the S1 pocket (E648G/N682G) and a mutation of Arg683 (R683Q), adjacent to the entrance to the S1 pocket. Wild type and mutated MSP cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCl-neo, and stable CHO cell transfectants were generated. Serum-containing medium from the transfected cells was used as a source of wild type and mutant MSP. We selected clones that produced equal amounts of wild type or mutant MSP, and by sandwich ELISA the concentration in the medium was 0.5 nm (data not shown). The products were further characterized by SDS-PAGE. Culture fluids from35 S-metabolically labeled CHO cell transfectants were immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-MSP antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions (Fig.3). In confirmation of the sandwich ELISA results, the intensity of the bands in Fig. 3 shows that the selected CHO cell clones produce comparable amounts of wild type or mutated MSP. SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions shows that there is no 80-kDa pro-MSP in CHO supernatants. Only two bands at molecular mass positions of approximately 60 and 30 kDa corresponding to MSP α and β chains were visualized (Fig. 3 B). This is due to the fact that recombinant pro-MSP is cleaved to MSP in supernatants of CHO cells cultured in medium containing serum (17Wang M.-H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of an 80-kDa band under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3 A) demonstrates that the α and β chains of these recombinant products are not disulfide-linked, in contrast to αβ chain heterodimeric native MSP. This is due to the fact that in recombinant pro-MSP, β chain Cys588 may form an intrachain disulfide with Cys672 instead of with α chain Cys468 (19Yoshikawa W. Hara H. Takehara T. Shimonishi M. Sakai H. Shimizu N. Shimizu S. Wang M.-H. Hagiya M. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,33Wahl R.C. Costigan V.J. Batac J.P.

To determine the capacity of wild type and mutated MSP β chain to interact with receptor, MDCK-RE7 cells with overexpressed RON and parental MDCK cells as a control were equilibrated with35 S-labeled CHO cell supernatants containing 0.5 nm free α and β chain. After equilibration, cells were washed and lysed. Cell-bound MSP chains were immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-MSP antibodies which recognize both α and β chains (28Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguchi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Precipitated MSP chains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were visualized by radioautography. Results for RE7 lysates (Fig.4 A) showed an intense wild type MSP β chain band, a faint band for β chain mutated in the S1 pocket, and no band for the R683Q mutant. Densitometry of the β chain bands showed that the amount of double mutant E648G/N682G bound was about 50 times less than bound wild type β chain; no R683Q band was detected. There was no MSP β chain binding to parental MDCK cells, which do not express detectable RON (9Wang M.-H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.-C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interaction of35 S-labeled β chain from CHO supernatants was inhibited by either unlabeled MSP or free β chain (Fig. 4 B). This result suggested that we were observing saturable binding of β chain to RON, a conclusion supported by the absence of binding to MDCK cells. The diminished or absent β chain mutant bands in Fig. 4 Atherefore reflect diminished or undetectable binding of the mutants to RON. In addition to the β chain, we detected binding of free α chain to RON-expressing cells (Fig. 4 A, upper band). Reasons to suggest that the observed band represents MSP α chain are as follows: 1) an appropriate molecular mass; 2) no band in the case of supernatants from metabolically labeled CHO cells transfected with vector alone, which therefore do not express MSP; and 3) no band with supernatants of MSP-transfected cells that were equilibrated with parental MDCK cells, which do not express RON. Comparison of the band intensities in Fig.4 A shows that the amount of bound α chain is only a small fraction of the amount of bound β chain. Therefore it was important to determine whether the band reflected binding of free α chain or a small amount of MSP αβ chain heterodimer binding via the β chain. Two facts weighed against the latter possibility. First, as noted above, SDS-PAGE of metabolically labeled transfected CHO cell supernatants did not reveal any trace of αβ chain MSP. Second, despite no sign of MSP mutant R683Q β chain binding, the α chain band was detectable (Fig. 4 A). To obtain independent evidence that free α chain can interact with RON, a binding assay of purified recombinant α chain was performed. MDCK-RE7 cells or MDCK cells as a control were equilibrated for 4 h at 4 °C with 5 nm free recombinant α chain or disulfide-linked αβ chain MSP. Then bound αβ chain MSP or α chain was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal 2 S anti-MSP, which recognizes only α chain (28Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguchi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated α chain was detected on a blot with rabbit anti-MSP antibodies after SDS-PAGE and transfer of proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane. Fig.5 A shows binding of free α chain to RE-7 cells, which is a small fraction of the amount of α chain detected after αβ chain MSP was equilibrated with the cells. In both cases, binding is RON-dependent, as shown by the absence of bands from MDCK cell lysates. It was also important to consider the possibility that the bound α chain line came from binding of a small amount of αβ MSP that contaminates the α chain preparation. This was ruled out by SDS-PAGE of the same cell immunoprecipitates under non-reducing conditions. If the α chain detected in Fig. 5 A (under reducing conditions) were due entirely to bound αβ chain contaminating the α chain preparation, non-reducing SDS-PAGE should show an αβ line and no α. The converse is the case (Fig. 5 B). For the α chain lane, at an ECL exposure that shows an α chain line comparable in intensity to that of Fig. 5 A, there is no detectable αβ line. At longer exposure times we see an αβ line and a much more intense α chain line. The latter reflects binding of free α chain to the RE-7 cells; the former is due to the small amount of αβ chain contaminating the α chain preparation and is a small fraction of the total bound α chain. In addition to the above experiments on binding of MSP and its chains to cells expressing RON, we quantified by sandwich ELISA the binding of disulfide-linked αβ chain MSP and free α and β chains to recombinant mouse RON receptor adsorbed to wells of a microtiter plate. Binding of each ligand was tested in duplicate in three separate experiments, and concentration-dependent binding curves were generated (Fig. 6). Mean EC50 values calculated from curves of the three experiments (31Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) are shown in the inset of Fig. 6. Disulfide-linked αβ chain MSP has a somewhat higher affinity for RON than free β chain, a result comparable to binding data for RON-expressing cells (24Wang M.H. Julian F.M. Breathnach R. Godowski P.J. Takehara T. Yoshikawa W. Hagiya M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16999-17004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, free α chain binds to RON with a much lower affinity, as reflected in an EC50 that is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the value for MSP. Thus, MSP has two separate binding sites with high and low affinity, located in β and α chains, respectively. The MSP β chain three-dimensional model enabled us to consider possible loci for RON high affinity binding by analogy to substrate-enzyme interactions in the family of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. In zymogens of the family the catalytic triad is formed, but the substrate-binding site is not fully shaped. MSP is able to bind RON with high affinity only after proteolytic cleavage, which in zymogens causes conformational changes leading to formation of a mature binding site (Fig. 2). Thus residues critical for receptor binding should correspond to those that define the subsite preference at the scissile bond of substrate. According to the model, the S1 pocket in MSP is filled by interacting pair Glu648 and Asn682, leaving only a shallow cavity for interaction with the substrate side chain. In addition to a double mutant of the Glu/Asn pair (E648G/N682G), we made a single mutant of Arg683 located at the entrance to the S1 pocket. We mutated Arg683 to Gln, which is also hydrophilic and has side chain length comparable to that of Arg. Thus mutation of Arg683 to Gln was not expected to affect the structure of the β chain. The fact that mutation of Arg683 alone completely abolished β chain binding to RON (Fig. 4 A) suggests that this residue is directly involved in receptor binding. Such a profound effect caused by a single site mutation is not surprising in view of the fact that mutation of a single residue of human growth hormone receptor (34Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar) or HGF α chain (see below) caused loss of binding to their respective ligands. Binding of β chain mutant E648G/N682G is about 50 times less than the binding of β chain wild type. The diminished binding of the double mutant (E648G/N682G) suggests that these residues are required to stabilize the β chain structure in this region. Our results show that the region corresponding to an enzyme S1 site is essential for β chain binding to RON. Other features affecting specificity of MSP-receptor interactions may involve residues from loops 1–3 (shown in Fig.2 A), which influence substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of the trypsin-like serine proteases (26Perona J.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that six Arg side chains from loops 2 and 3 form a prominent cluster of positive charge on the MSP β chain surface in the neighborhood of the S1 site. We recently proposed that both HGF and MSP have two receptor binding sites of different affinity, one on the α chain and one on the β chain, and that Met and RON dimerization can be induced by a single ligand molecule (27Miller M. Leonard E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The site on the β chain becomes available for binding only after proteolytic cleavage of the single chain precursors. For HGF, the high affinity site is on the α chain and the postulated low affinity site is on the β chain. The converse is the case for MSP. Comparison of our model of the MSP β chain structure with that of the HGF β chain shows that, in contrast to MSP, the opening of the HGF S1 pocket is not blocked; and there are differences in the surface loops, as described in the legend of Fig. 2 A. These differences in the S1 pocket and neighboring surface loops could account for the inability of HGF to bind via its β chain to RON (35Wang M.-H. Iwama A. Dlugosz A.A. Sun Y. Skeel A. Yuspa S.H. Suda T. Leonard E.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This communication provides the first evidence that free MSP α chain interacts with the RON receptor (Figs. 4 A, 5, and 6). We previously reported undetectable binding to RON-expressing cells by a125 I-labeled aliquot of the same α chain preparation used in the current study (24Wang M.H. Julian F.M. Breathnach R. Godowski P.J. Takehara T. Yoshikawa W. Hagiya M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16999-17004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We attribute this to a lower sensitivity of the former method. After cells were equilibrated with equimolar concentrations of free α and β chains, bound α chain was less than 10% of bound β chain (determined by densitometry of the blot shown in Fig. 4 A). The published binding curves of iodinated MSP or β chain show that 10% of the observed values would be indistinguishable from background (24Wang M.H. Julian F.M. Breathnach R. Godowski P.J. Takehara T. Yoshikawa W. Hagiya M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16999-17004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We quantified binding of MSP and its free α and β chains to recombinant RON adsorbed to microtiter wells. Results show that MSP has two binding sites with low (EC50 = 16.9 nm) and high (EC50 = 0.25 nm) affinity, located in α and β chains respectively. Despite binding of free α chain or β chain to RON, neither chain can replicate the action of the disulfide-linked heterodimer. Wanget al. (24Wang M.H. Julian F.M. Breathnach R. Godowski P.J. Takehara T. Yoshikawa W. Hagiya M. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16999-17004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that whereas mature MSP caused tyrosine phosphorylation of RON and a cellular biological response, these effects were not induced by strongly binding free β chain or by α chain. In our case, the low level of α chain binding to RON-expressing cells also did not induce RON tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). How does αβ chain MSP cause RON dimerization? The fact that the α chain and β chain are each capable of interacting with RON suggests that MSP is bivalent, with a high affinity locus on the β chain and a low affinity site on the α chain. The contribution of the α chain to the binding strength of MSP to RON was suggested by an MSP binding K d that was significantly lower than the K d for free β chain (24Wang M.H. Julian F.M.

As noted above, we proposed that a RON dimer could be formed by a single MSP molecule that could bind to RON via the β chain, after which a second RON could interact with the α chain. The converse sequence was suggested for HGF. This is the model that has been confirmed for induction of receptor dimerization by growth hormone (36de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). The finding that the α chain can bind to RON supports our proposed model. We thank Dr. Tom L. Blundell and colleagues for providing us with the coordinates of the HGF β chain three-dimensional model.

In order to exert its cytotoxic effects, araC must be incorporated into chromosomal DNA. Although specific DNA lesions that involve base loss or modification stimulate nucleic acid cleavage mediated by type II topoisomerases, the effects of deoxyribose sugar ring modification on enzyme activity have not been examined. Therefore, the effects of incorporated araC residues on the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of human topoisomerase IIα and β were characterized. AraC lesions were position-specific topoisomerase II poisons and stimulated DNA scission mediated by both human type II enzymes. However, the positional specificity of araC residues differed from that previously reported for other cleavage-enhancing DNA lesions. Finally, additive or synergistic increases in DNA cleavage were observed in the presence of araC lesions and etoposide. These findings broaden the range of DNA lesions known to alter topoisomerase II function and raise the possibility that this enzyme may mediate some of the cellular effects of araC.

Therefore, the effects of incorporated araC residues on the DNA cleavage activity of human topoisomerase IIα and -β were characterized. Substitution of a β-hydroxyl for a hydrogen at the 2′-position of deoxycytosine (converting the deoxyribose ring to an arabinose) stimulated DNA scission mediated by the α and β isoforms of human topoisomerase II but did so with a positional specificity that differed from those of other DNA lesions. Moreover, in contrast to previous findings with abasic sites (26Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), additive or synergistic increases in DNA cleavage were observed in the presence of araC lesions and etoposide. These findings suggest sugar ring modifications can alter topoisomerase II function and raise the possibility that the enzyme may mediate some of the physiological effects of araC. A 42-base single-stranded oligonucleotide that corresponds to residues 1050–1091 of theMLL oncogene (29Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar) and its complementary oligonucleotide were synthesized. The sequences of the top and bottom oligonucleotides were 5′-ATGATTGTACCACTGCAG↓TCCAGCCTGGGTGACAAAGCAAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTTGCTTTGTCACCCAGGC↓TGGACTGCAGTGGTACAATCAT-3′, respectively. Points of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are denoted by arrows (28Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N.

Modified top and bottom oligonucleotides containing a cytosine arabinoside residue (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) were synthesized using the corresponding phosphoramidite. For DNA cleavage assays, single-stranded oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled on their 5′ termini with T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified by electrophoresis in a 7m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by UV shadowing, excised, and eluted using the Qiagen gel extraction protocol. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by incubating equimolar amounts of each at 70 °C for 10 min and cooling to 25 °C (28Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Etoposide was obtained from Sigma and stored as a 20 mm stock in Me2SO at room temperature. Human topoisomerase IIα and β were purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described (28Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage reactions contained 100 nmoligonucleotide in 19 μl of cleavage buffer (10 mmHepes-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 2.5% glycerol) that contained 5 mm MgCl2 and were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of human topoisomerase II (150 nm final concentration). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS and 1.5 μl of 250 mm EDTA. When appropriate, cleavage reactions were reversed by the addition of NaCl (500 mmfinal concentration) at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of detergent and EDTA. Reactions containing etoposide contained 100 μm drug and 1% Me2SO (final concentration). DNA cleavage products were digested with proteinase K, precipitated with ethanol, and resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing 7m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gels. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. DNA cleavage was monitored on the complementary wild-type strand. Levels of DNA scission were calculated relative to that obtained with the wild-type substrate. DNA religation assays used a procedure modified from Osheroff and Zechiedrich (30Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cleavage/religation equilibria were established as described above in cleavage buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2. Kinetically competent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were trapped by the addition of EDTA (6 mm final concentration). Sodium chloride (500 mm final concentration) was added to prevent recleavage, and religation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (0.15 mm final concentration). Reactions were terminated at times up to 80 s by the addition of 1% SDS, and samples were analyzed as described above. The apparent first order rate of DNA religation was determined by quantifying the loss of cleaved DNA.

Pretreatment of human cells with araC increases levels of DNA breaks induced by topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer drugs, suggesting possible physiological interactions between topoisomerase II and incorporated araC residues (31Bakic M. Chan D. Andersson B.S. Beran M. Silberman L. Estey E. Ricketts L. Zwelling L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 4067-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since a variety of DNA lesions have been shown to stimulate the DNA cleavage activity of the type II enzyme, the effects of incorporated araC residues on the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of human topoisomerase IIα and β were characterized (24Kingma P.S.

AraC lesions, which contain an arabinose sugar in place of deoxyribose, represent the first sugar ring modification examined for activity against type II topoisomerases. AraC residues were incorporated into a 42-base pair oligonucleotide that contained a centrally located cleavage site for human type II topoisomerases (Fig. 1). The sequence was derived from a region of the MLL oncogene proximal to a leukemic breakpoint at chromosomal band 11q23 (29Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar). Individual substrates contained single araC lesions incorporated at the indicated positions, and the points of DNA scission on the top and bottom strands are indicated by arrows (28Kingma P.S.

Topoisomerase IIα is dramatically up-regulated during periods of rapid cell proliferation, reflecting important and potentially specific roles in DNA replication and chromosomal segregation (32Burden D.A.

In comparison, topoisomerase IIβ levels are relatively constant across both cell and growth cycles, indicating that this isoform may have a more general function in DNA and/or RNA processes (32Burden D.A.

Because of the association of topoisomerase IIα with replicating cells, initial studies focused on interactions between this enzyme isoform and incorporated araC residues. As seen in Fig. 1 (closed bars), araC lesions stimulated DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα in a position-specific fashion. Consistent with previous findings for other DNA lesions, araC residues located within the 4-base cleavage overhang (i.e.the +2 and +3 positions on the top strand) increased levels of DNA scission (24Kingma P.S.

AraC incorporation at the +2 position displayed the greatest effect on enzyme activity and increased cleavage ∼5-fold. AraC lesions located outside of the cleavage overhang 3′ to the scissile bonds (i.e. the +6 position on the top strand and the +5 and +8 positions on the bottom strand) decreased DNA scission.

However, araC residues located outside of the cleavage overhang 5′ to the scissile bonds (i.e. the −3 position on the top strand and the −1 position on the bottom strand) stimulated DNA scission as much as 3.5-fold. AraC residues are the first DNA lesions reported to significantly enhance topoisomerase II-mediated scission when located outside the cleavage site of the enzyme. The basis for this novel positional specificity is not known; however, the structural distortions induced in DNA by incorporated araC residues are considerably different from those generated by other lesions, such as apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, that stimulate DNA scission mediated by topoisomerase II (41Cuniasse P.

In addition, the trans-2′-hydroxyl moiety of araC lesions projects into the major groove of the double helix and forms intrastrand hydrogen bonds (51Gao Y.-G. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Wang A.H.-J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9922-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 52Schweitzer B.I. Mikita T. Kellogg G.W. Gardner K.H. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11460-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that potentially could affect topoisomerase II-DNA interactions. Three additional points should be noted. First, although incorporation of araC residues altered levels of DNA cleavage, the points of scission remained unchanged. Second, DNA cleavage induced by the presence of araC lesions was reversed by treatment with salt prior to protein denaturant (Fig. 1, open bars). Salt reversibility is a hallmark of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission (32Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 54Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, similar increases in DNA cleavage were observed when scission was monitored on either the wild-type oligonucleotide or the lesion-containing strand. This result implies that the observed DNA cleavage was double-stranded in nature. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that the observed DNA cleavage was generated by topoisomerase IIα and was not due to a chemical degradation of lesion-containing oligonucleotides. Since topoisomerase IIβ appears to be present throughout the cell cycle of all mammalian tissues, it also has the potential to interact with araC lesions in chromosomal DNA (32Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 33Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 34Austin C.A.

Therefore, the effects of selected araC residues on the DNA cleavage activity of topoisomerase IIβ were characterized. As seen in Fig.2, significant cleavage stimulation (similar to that seen with the α isoform) was observed with the −3 lesion (top strand). Although cleavage enhancement also was observed with the +2 lesion, it was considerably lower than that seen with topoisomerase IIα, and the effects of the +3 lesion appeared to be negligible. As above, the points of DNA scission did not change in lesion-containing oligonucleotides, and cleavage was salt-reversible. Due to the greater effects of araC lesions on topoisomerase IIα and the probable role of this enzyme in DNA replication, the α isoform was used for further studies. As defined by their ability to inhibit enzyme-mediated DNA religation, topoisomerase II poisons increase levels of enzyme-generated DNA breaks by one of two potential mechanisms (32Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 56Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Whereas some poisons act primarily by impairing the ability of topoisomerase II to religate cleaved DNA molecules, others have little effect on this reaction and are presumed to act primarily by enhancing the formation of enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes. Previous studies indicate that a variety of DNA lesions do not inhibit DNA religation and appear to act by this latter mechanism (24Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Kingma P.S. Corbett A.H. Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of the altered positional specificity of araC residues compared with that of other lesions, the effects of this nucleoside analog on the DNA religation activity of human topoisomerase IIα were characterized. Rates of DNA religation were unaffected by incorporation of araC residues at the −3 or +2 positions (Fig.3). Therefore, it appears that araC lesions act primarily by enhancing the formation of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis for the actions of araC on topoisomerase IIα is independent of the location of the lesion relative to the scissile bonds. Previous studies indicate that multiple abasic sites within a topoisomerase II DNA cleavage overhang induce levels of scission that are greater than those generated by the individual lesions (26Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In some cases, the stimulatory effects were additive or even synergistic in nature. Under clinically relevant conditions, ∼100,000 araC residues/genome can be incorporated into human leukemic cells (1Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 213-233Google Scholar). Although it is unlikely that clusters of araC lesions will be observed routinely under these conditions, it is reasonable that two residues occasionally could be incorporated in close proximity to one another. Therefore, to determine whether multiple araC lesions also induce additive levels of DNA cleavage, the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to cleave oligonucleotides that contained two stimulatory araC residues was characterized. Combinations that coupled the internal (relative to the DNA cleavage overhang) +2 araC lesion with either the adjacent +3 lesion or the external −3 araC were examined (Fig.4). Both combinations enhanced DNA scission in an additive fashion. As found for the individual lesions, cleavage induced by multiple araC residues was salt-reversible (not shown). Thus, levels of DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα can be further stimulated by the incorporation of additional araC lesions proximal to the points of scission. Chemotherapeutic regimens that combine araC with etoposide display synergistic effects in murine leukemia models and are used routinely for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias (1Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 213-233Google Scholar, 57Rivera G. Avery T. Roberts D.W. Eur. J.

Although abasic lesions dominate over etoposide and negate the enhancement of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage by the drug (not shown) (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Therefore, the effects of etoposide on the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to cleave oligonucleotides that contained incorporated araC residues were characterized. As seen in Fig. 5, the DNA cleavage enhancement by etoposide and araC residues located within the cleavage overhang (at the +2 or +3 positions) was additive. Furthermore, when the lesion was located 5′ to the scissile bond at the −3 position, synergistic DNA cleavage enhancement was observed. Levels of scission in the presence of etoposide and the −3 lesion were nearly three times higher than predicted based on simple additivity. The mechanistic basis for this unexpected finding is not known. However, it may be related to the usual ability of araC lesions to enhance topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission when located external to the cleavage overhang. In conclusion, araC is an important anticancer drug that must be incorporated into DNA in order to exert its cytotoxic effects. Cell lines with reduced levels of topoisomerase IIα display resistance to araC (59Goz B. Bastow K.F. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 89-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and pretreatment of cells with araC increases the concentration of DNA breaks induced by the topoisomerase II-targeted drugs, etoposide and amsacrine (31Bakic M. Chan D. Andersson B.S. Beran M. Silberman L. Estey E. Ricketts L. Zwelling L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 4067-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Results of the present study indicate that incorporated araC residues are position-specific poisons of human type II topoisomerases. This work broadens the spectrum of DNA lesions known to stimulate topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and suggests potential roles for the type II enzyme in araC cytotoxicity or mutagenicity.

Isolated mitochondria and microsomes, incubated with sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and an immobilized substrate palmitoyl-CoA-agarose, synthesized both lyso-PA and PA. The mitochondrial and microsomal acylation of glycerophosphate with palmitoyl-CoA-agarose was 80–100% of the values obtained in the presence of free palmitoyl-CoA. In another series of experiments, both free polymyxin B and polymyxin B-agarose stimulated mitochondrial glycerophosphate acyltransferase activity approximately 2-fold.

Transworld Research Network, Trivandrum, India1998: 207-222Google Scholar). On the other hand, very little is known about MGAT. Several lines of evidence suggest that the mitochondrial GAT regulates the selective positioning of saturated fatty acids at thesn-1 position of glycerophospholipids. The selective positioning of the fatty acids is considered to be important in the structural and functional role of biological membranes (13Salem L. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 2100-2113Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14van Deenen L.L.M. Holman R. T Progress in Chemistry of Fats and Other Lipids. Pergamon Press, Oxford1965: 1-115Google Scholar). Unlike the microsomal GAT, the mitochondrial enzyme has strong preference for saturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrate (4Monroy G. Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6884-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Daae L.N.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (15Haldar D. Tso W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in primary tissue culture cells (16Stern W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8047-8055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mitochondrial acyltransferase activity is inversely proportional to the randomization of fatty acids at position 1. Finally, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), synthesized in mitochondria, can exit the organelle, be transported to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of liver fatty acid binding protein (l-FABP), and be converted to PA (17Vancura A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14353-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments from different laboratories also suggest that the activity of mitochondrial GAT can change under different physiological (18Bates E.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. Biochem.

Acta. 1997; 1348: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in the presence of some metabolic modulators (22Nikonov A.V. Haldar D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A1110Google Scholar). These observations suggest that mitochondrial GAT can be controlled at the level of transcription as well as by modulators of activity. Biochemical investigations using proteases suggest that the rat mitochondrial GAT is a transmembrane protein (23Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberU36771) revealed the presence of two transmembrane regions (12Nikonov A.V. Morimoto T. Haldar D Pandalai S. G in Recent Research Development in Lipids Research. Transworld Research Network, Trivandrum, India1998: 207-222Google Scholar), supporting the biochemical observation. Our previous work suggests that acyl-CoA synthetase, which activates fatty acids, spans the MOM (24Hesler C.B. Olymbios C. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6600-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using desulfo-CoA-agarose, an immobilized competitive inhibitor, we established that the catalytic site of the enzyme is located in the outer aspect of the MOM. The acyl-CoA formed can be used either catabolically for β-oxidation of the fatty acids in the mitochondrial matrix or can be used anabolically to acylate glycerophosphate. The synthesis of acyl-CoA on the outer surface of the MOM leads to the question: which leaflet of the MOM is involved in the synthesis of LPA and PA? This paper deals with the location of synthesis of LPA and PA in the transverse plane of the MOM and the extent of translocation of PA necessary for cardiolipin synthesis. Our result suggests that both LPA and PA are synthesized on the outer aspect of the MOM, and subsequently, PA moves to the inner membrane as a precursor of cardiolipin. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY.sn-[2-3H]Glycerol 3-phosphate (1.11 × 104 cpm/nmol) was obtained from American Radiochemicals Inc. Palmitoyl-CoA-agarose, and polymyxin B-agarose, obtained from Sigma, were washed four times with 40 mm MTG buffer (MES/TES/glycylglycine), pH 7.5, before use. All other materials were obtained as described previously (23Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver mitochondria and microsome were prepared from 175–200-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (4Monroy G. Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6884-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of both preparations was evaluated by performing GAT assay in the presence and absence of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, which is an inhibitor of the microsomal GAT (15Haldar D. Tso W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-contamination between mitochondrial and microsomal fractions was <3%. GAT activity was measured by following the incorporation of sn-[2-3H]glycerol 3-phosphate into butanol-extractable phospholipids (15Haldar D. Tso W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Asolectin was omitted from the system. The concentration of the subcellular protein in the incubation medium was maintained between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/ml. For sedimenting mitochondria or microsomes, the incubated mixture was cooled to 0 °C and spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min or at 105,000 × g for 60 min, respectively. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of water. The supernatant, the resuspended pellet, or whole GAT reaction mixture was treated with 1-butanol to extract the radioactive acylation products, LPA and PA, which were separated by thin layer (4Monroy G. Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6884-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or high performance thin layer chromatography. Protein concentration was assayed as per the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Palmitoyl-CoA is commercially available cross-linked to 4% beaded agarose. As the linkage of agarose is with the amino group of CoA with a 7-carbon spacer, it is not possible that the activated acyl group can cross the MOM phospholipid bilayer and reach the inner aspect of the membrane. Microsomal GAT has its catalytic site on the outer surface of the membrane (7Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and was used as a positive control. Fig. 1documents the activity of mitochondrial and microsomal GAT at different concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA-agarose. For both mitochondria and microsomes, their activities of GAT is over 90% in the presence of immobilized substrate when compared with the activities in presence of free palmitoyl-CoA. Since the concentration of palmitoyl-CoA in the immobilized sample cannot be accurately measured, comparison can be made between the activities in the presence of free and bound palmitoyl-CoA at their optimal level of activity. The palmitoyl-CoA-agarose was washed four times before use. There was virtually no difference in the GAT activity using washed or unwashed samples suggesting that the beads contained no free palmitoyl-CoA. To determine whether free palmitoyl-CoA was released during the assay, we measured the incorporation of glycerophosphate into phospholipids at 1, 2, and 3 min of incubation with optimal concentrations of free and immobilized substrate. In both instances, the rate of incorporation was linear with time (results not shown). Therefore, the acyl-CoA was indeed immobilized and was not available to the inner side of the MOM. The activity of GAT in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA-agarose was not a reflection of disruption of mitochondria. The latency of cytochrome oxidase of this and similarly prepared samples revealed only 10–15% disruption of mitochondria. It is known that polymyxin B stimulates the mitochondrial GAT and markedly inhibits the microsomal enzyme (Refs. 26Carroll M.A. Morris P. Grosjean C.D. Anzalone T. Haldar D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 214: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Das S.K. Haldar D. Lipids. 1987; 22: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Fitzpatrick S.M. Sorresso G. Haldar D. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, Fig.2 A). In the presence of polymyxin B-agarose, mitochondria and microsomes showed activation and inhibition in the range of 80–90% of the values obtained in the presence of free polymyxin B (Fig. 2 C). The immobilized polymyxin B is cross-linked to 4% beaded agarose through an amino group with a spacer of 1 carbon. It is, therefore, improbable that the antibiotic can penetrate the MOM. Fig. 2 also includes the results using palmitoyl-CoA-agarose and polymyxin B (Fig. 2 B) and palmitoyl-CoA-agarose and polymyxin B-agarose (Fig. 2 D). Both the free and immobilized polymyxin B stimulated the mitochondrial and inhibited the microsomal GAT. For reason presently unknown, polymyxin B-agarose, at higher concentrations, is less effective in both stimulating and inhibiting mitochondrial and microsomal GAT, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). Amounts of LPA and PA synthesized in mitochondria and microsomes using palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA-agarose as acyl donor are documented in Fig. 3. Both the phospholipids were formed in equal quantities in presence of free palmitoyl-CoA in mitochondria (15Haldar D. Tso W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In microsomes, the amount of LPA was about 30%. A similar profile was seen with the use of palmitoyl-CoA-agarose. In the absence of bovine serum albumin, mainly PA was formed in both microsomes and mitochondria. As reported earlier (17Vancura A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14353-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), l-FABP stimulates the export of LPA from mitochondria. The presence of l-FABP stimulates LPA synthesis 6-fold but reduced PA synthesis by 50%. In the absence ofl-FABP, mitochondria can synthesize significant amount of PA, which remains in the mitochondria. However, this PA was marginally exported when mitochondria were exposed to l-FABP (Fig.4). When mitochondria, loaded with PA, were immediately exposed to 35 μml-FABP, up to 21% of PA left the mitochondria. The amount of PA available for export decreased with time, suggesting that the PA became inaccessible for binding to l-FABP. Preferential export of LPA from mitochondria due to l-FABP is documented in Fig. 5. Mitochondria, loaded with PA, were treated with liver cytosol, which resulted in partial conversion of PA to LPA and glycerides. Subsequent exposure of these mitochondria to l-FABP resulted in 94% release of LPA but only 22% release of PA and 6% release of glycerides. Data shown in Fig. 4 suggest that, with time, PA within mitochondria is becoming less available for export. This observation was confirmed by another approach. Mitochondria, loaded with PA, were exposed either to phospholipase A2 alone or to a mixture of phospholipase A2 and l-FABP. LPA, generated by phospholipase A2 from PA, was exported 2.5-fold more efficiently in the presence of l-FABP and phospholipase A2 than in the presence of phospholipase A2 only (Fig.6). When PA-loaded mitochondria were incubated for 30 min in buffer A prior to phospholipase A2and l-FABP, the amount of exported LPA was reduced to 30%. However, mitochondria after 30-min incubation contained 85–95% of originally present PA. Thus, breakdown of PA was not responsible for reduction in PA release.Figure 6Phospholipase A2 sensitivity of mitochondrial PA . Mitochondria were loaded with PA, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer B, and divided in 0.5-ml aliquots. Each aliquot contained 1.56 nmol of PA, 0.36 nmol of glycerides, and 0.44 mg of mitochondrial protein. Phospholipase A2 (5 μg/ml; ▪, ⋄) or mixture of phospholipase A2 (5 μg/ml) and l-FABP (35 μm)(●, ▵) were added either immediately (▪, ●), or PA-loaded mitochondria were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C prior to addition of these proteins (⋄, ▵). The mitochondria were pelleted and processed as described in the legend to Fig. 5. Results are presented as the amount released from one aliquot (0.44 mg of mitochondrial protein).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two main points emerge from this investigation. First, both LPA and PA are synthesized on the cytosolic side of the MOM. Second, the PA synthesized rapidly moves from the outer surface, presumably to the inner membrane where it is converted to cardiolipin (29Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the immobilized substrate palmitoyl-CoA-agarose, the GAT activity of isolated mitochondria was about the same as that in the presence of the free acyl-CoA (Fig. 1), suggesting that the outer surface of the MOM is the site of LPA formation. This conclusion is in keeping with the results obtained by the use of the immobilized stimulator of the mitochondrial GAT, polymyxin B-agarose. Since mitochondrial GAT could be stimulated approximately 2-fold in the presence of either free or immobilized polymyxin B (Fig. 2), it is suggestive that the catalytic site of mitochondrial GAT is exposed to the cytosolic side of the MOM. If LPA is formed on the outer surface of the MOM, which side of the membrane is PA formed? Analysis of the acylation products (Fig. 3) revealed that both LPA and PA were formed in the presence of the free or agarose-bound palmitoyl-CoA. Absence of bovine serum albumin in the incubation medium similarly affected the LPA:PA ratio with the two forms of the acyl-CoA. As expected (15Haldar D. Tso W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the absence of bovine serum albumin, PA was the main reaction product. These results strongly suggest that both LPA and PA are made on the outer side of the MOM. Formation of both the phospholipids is stimulated in the presence of free or agarose-bound polymyxin B (results not shown), further confirming the site of formation of the phospholipids in the transverse plane of the MOM. The results obtained here, together with those reported earlier on the formation acyl-CoA on the cytosolic side of the MOM (24Hesler C.B. Olymbios C. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6600-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that the three enzymes, acyl-CoA synthetase, GAT, and MGAT, all can draw on the cytosolic pool of substrates. This situation raises the possibility that these three enzymes are closely located and that there could be an efficient substrate “channeling” between these enzymes. The PA synthesized on the outer surface of the MOM leaves the organelle to a very limited extent (Figs. 4 and 6). It can be converted to diacylglycerol by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (30Smith M.E. Sedgwick B. Brindley D.N. Hubscher G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 3: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or can be converted back to LPA under certain conditions by phospholipase A2, which is also located in the MOM (31Nachbaurt J. Vignais P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 33: 315-320Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Schlame M. Rustov B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The fate of the mitochondrially synthesized PA is its conversion to cardiolipin, the final step of which takes place in the inner membrane (33Hostetler K.Y. Hawthorne J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1982: 481-492Google Scholar, 34Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). There is precursor-product relationship between PA and cardiolipin when PA-loaded mitochondria are incubated in a cardiolipin-synthesizing medium. Furthermore, the final step of cardiolipin synthesis takes place on the inner side of the inner membrane (29Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is a complex topological movement of PA from the outer surface of the outer membrane to the inner surface of the inner membrane. Transport of PA from the outer to inner membrane may occur either by simple diffusion (35Wojtzak L. Baranska J. Zborowski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or by some other mechanism, for example, involving some transport protein. However, the movement of PA from the outer to inner membrane fits in with our observation that incubation of PA-loaded mitochondria renders the phospholipid inaccessible to externally added phospholipase A2 (Fig. 6). It appears that each of the products of the three enzymes, acyl-CoA synthetase, GAT, and MGAT, has at least two possible fates (Fig.7). The acyl-CoA synthesized in the mitochondria can either be transported to the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation or be acted upon by GAT to form LPA. It is known that fatty acid biosynthesis is regulated by metabolic modulators (36Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi C.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, as GAT is influenced by ATP and citrate (22Nikonov A.V. Haldar D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A1110Google Scholar), they can very well be involved in this regulation. Similar to acyl-CoA, the LPA formed in the MOM has also two fates. It can either be acylated to form PA (6Haldar D. Kelker C.H. Pullman M.E. Trans. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 41: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), or it can combine with l-FABP and be exported to the endoplasmic reticulum for conversion to PA (17Vancura A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14353-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Haldar D. Lipfert L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11014-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and presumably to other phospholipids. LPA-FABP does not act as a substrate for mitochondrial MGAT (17Vancura A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14353-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small amount of PA can leave the mitochondria. Whether this PA is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum for conversion to complex phospholipids is unknown. However, the majority of mitochondrially synthesized PA appears to be converted to cardiolipin. The dual fate of acyl-CoA, LPA, and PA suggest the existence of multiple control sites in the metabolism of these compounds. We thank Shaista Hussain for her help during the course of this work."
https://openalex.org/W1976139936,"Levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) bound to nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) were examined during multiple turnovers of the enzyme in the presence of an NADPH-regenerating system. Our findings show that NOS-bound BH4 does not remain in a static state but undergoes redox reactions. Under these experimental conditions, the redox state of BH4 was determined by the balance between calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent oxidation of BH4 mediated by the uncoupled formation of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide on the one hand and by reductive regeneration of BH4 on the other hand. BH4oxidation was appreciably increased in the presence of arginine. Levels of NOS-bound BH4 were also examined under single turnover conditions in the absence of an NADPH-regenerating system and in the presence of added superoxide dismutase and catalase to suppress the accumulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. BH4oxidation was again dependent on Ca2+/CaM. The insensitivity to superoxide dismutase and catalase suggested that the single turnover oxidation of BH4 did not proceed through superoxide/peroxide, although the involvement of these oxidants could not be definitively excluded. The amount of BH4 oxidized was highest in the presence of arginine, and this oxidation significantly exceeded that in the presence ofN G-hydroxy-l-arginine. The findings that single turnover oxidation of BH4 is stimulated by arginine in the presence of Ca2+/CaM and that BH4 is regenerated are consistent with a role for the pterin as an electron donor in product formation; this role remains to be defined.

The reaction proceeds in two steps; arginine is first oxygenated to the intermediate N G-hydroxy-l-arginine (NHA), which is then oxygenated to the products NO and citrulline (reviewed in Ref. 1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has attracted much interest because of its involvement in a variety of physiological processes such as vasodilation, cytotoxic activity, and neurotransmission (2Feldman P.L. Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 71: 26-38Crossref Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). NOS is unique as a heme oxygenase in requiring BH4, and elucidation of the role of BH4 is essential in understanding how this enzyme functions.It is well established that BH4 has pronounced effects on the structure of NOS. These effects include the ability to shift the heme iron to its high spin state, promotion of arginine binding, and stabilization of the active dimeric form of the enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 4Gorren A.C. Mayer B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 734-743PubMed Google Scholar), as well as stabilization of the ferrous heme iron coordination structure (5Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of the first molecule of BH4 to an NOS dimer has an anticooperative effect on the binding of the second molecule of BH4 (6Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Studies of the effects of pterin analogues on NOS provide graphic evidence that these structural effects cannot fully explain the requirement for BH4. Whereas the structural effects of BH4 are mimicked by a series of pterin analogues independent of their oxidation state, pterins must be in the tetrahydro state in order to support NO synthesis (5Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Pitters E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8422-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This requirement for a tetrahydropterin suggests an additional, redox, role of BH4.A number of recent reports support a redox role of BH4 in which the pterin provides electrons for the oxygenation reactions catalyzed by NOS. Studies with recombinant BH4-free NOS (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have implicated BH4 as acting as a stoichiometric reactant in the first oxygenation step (arginine to NHA) of NO synthesis. The role of BH4 in this reaction is envisioned by Ruscheet al. (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as being analogous to the well established role of BH4 in the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase systems (10Kaufman S. Enzymes. 1987; 18: 217-282Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that BH4 remains tightly bound to NOS throughout the catalytic cycle (11Giovanelli J. Campos K.L. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Further support for this proposal is provided by the finding that non-heme iron, which is an integral component of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (10Kaufman S. Enzymes. 1987; 18: 217-282Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is a stoichiometric component of NOS and enhances its activity (12Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Again by analogy with the hydroxylation of the aromatic amino acids (10Kaufman S. Enzymes. 1987; 18: 217-282Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the oxidation of BH4 by NOS would generate equivalent amounts of NHA and quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2), and the latter compound would need to be recycled to BH4 by a dihydropterin reductase-like activity in order to maintain the catalytic function of BH4. In these same studies, Rusche et al. (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) further proposed a role for BH4 in the second oxygenation step (NHA to citrulline and NO). It was suggested (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that BH4 may be acting as an electron donor in this step or in an indirect fashion by affecting, for example, the spin equilibrium and reduction potential of the heme.Further support for a redox role of BH4 is provided by the single turnover studies of NOS (13Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It was suggested that BH4 plays a critical role in the first oxygenation step by supplying an electron for reducing the ferric heme superoxide species to the ferric heme peroxo species. Based largely on studies of cytochrome P-450, the latter species, or a closely related form, is believed to carry out the oxygenation of arginine (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lewis D.F.V. Cytochromes P450. Structure, Function and Mechanism. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996: 79-113Google Scholar). Since only one electron is required for reduction of the ferric heme superoxide species to the ferric heme peroxo species by BH4, the oxidized pterin product was formally represented as the trihydrobiopterin radical (BH3·), although the possibility of qBH2 being the product could not be excluded. Based on crystallographic studies and the unexpected finding that arginine recognizes the BH4-binding site, Raman et al. (15Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) suggest that this site may stabilize the positively charged pterin cation radical, thereby supporting a scheme in which electrons are shuttled between the protonated forms of BH4 and BH3·, rather than between BH4 and qBH2. It has recently been reported (16Riethmuller C. Gorren A.C. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Habisch H.J. Heales S.J. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16047-16051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that the 5-methyl analogue of BH4 is functionally active with NOS but does not react with oxygen or stimulate phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is suggested (16Riethmuller C. Gorren A.C. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Habisch H.J. Heales S.J. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16047-16051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) on the basis of these studies that the redox chemistry of BH4 is not the same in NOS as it is in the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, but it could not be excluded that BH4 interacts with the heme or another metal group of NOS through an as yet unrecognized redox chemistry.Since catalytic amounts of BH4 are sufficient for NOS activity (11Giovanelli J. Campos K.L. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), a minimum requirement for any role of BH4 as a reductant is that the oxidized pterin products be regenerated with each catalytic cycle by a dihydropterin reductase-like activity intrinsic to the enzyme. No recycling of exogenousBH4 was detected during NOS turnover (11Giovanelli J. Campos K.L. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but this study did not exclude the possibility of recycling of BH4 tightly bound to the enzyme (17Campos K.L. Giovanelli J. Kaufman S. Moncada S. Marletta M.A. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Higgs E.A. The Biology of Nitric Oxide. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 47-50Google Scholar). The reduction of added qBH2 to BH4 by NOS, probably by the flavoprotein “diaphorase” activity of the enzyme, has been demonstrated (18Witteveen C.F.B. Giovanelli J. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4143-4147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the significance of this finding to the essential role of BH4 was uncertain. Furthermore, under the standard assay conditions of this latter study, any regenerated BH4 that remains firmly bound to NOS would not have been detected, since any such regeneration is limited to the number of BH4-binding sites; these sites are negligible relative to the observed amounts of qBH2reduced.The present work provides experimental support for a redox role of BH4 by showing that NOS-bound BH4 can cycle with its oxidized form(s). Although details of the oxidationof BH4 remain to be clarified, this work is an important step toward defining the mechanistic significance of this reaction in NO formation. The regeneration of BH4 from its oxidized products is probably important in maintaining the pterin in its active, tetrahydro, state.RESULTSLevels of NOS-bound BH4 were examined under three conditions of continuous turnover. In these experiments, continuous turnover of neuronal NOS (nNOS) was achieved in the presence of a low concentration (1 μm) of NADPH and an NADPH-regenerating system. Clearly, in the absence of arginine, no NO is formed. Under this fully uncoupled condition, electrons are transferred from NADPH to oxygen with the exclusive formation of superoxide and peroxide (6Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the presence of arginine, but no added BH4, nNOS is partially coupled, resulting in the formation of both NO and superoxide/peroxide (28Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Böhme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 30Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Maximum coupling of NADPH oxidation to NO formation is approached in the presence of saturating concentrations of both arginine and BH4 (6Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Böhme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, complete coupling of electron transfer from NADPH to NO formation in the presence of arginine and BH4 would not be expected under our conditions. This is because it appears that some superoxide is formed even in the presence of saturating arginine and BH4 (31Miller R.T. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Nishimura J.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15277-15284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the addition of BH4 in our studies resulted in incomplete saturation2 of NOS with BH4.BH4 Levels during Fully Uncoupled Turnover of NOSFig. 1 illustrates representative results for the levels of NOS-bound BH4 in the absence of added BH4 and arginine. In the absence of CaM, the level of BH4 remains constant (curve 1). Addition of CaM results in approximately 40% oxidation of BH4 (curve 2). CaM-dependent oxidation of BH4 is largely prevented by the additional presence of SOD and catalase (curve 3). Furthermore, the CaM-dependent oxidation of BH4 proceeding over an 80-s period (curve 4, open circles) is partially reversed by addition of SOD and catalase, in combination with NNA (curve 4, closed circles). NNA is a potent inhibitor of heme-catalyzed reduction of oxygen by neuronal NOS and the consequent formation of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide (28Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Böhme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 29Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Regeneration of BH4 did not occur in the absence of NNA. These combined findings strongly suggest that BH4 is oxidized by superoxide and/or peroxide generated by NOS during the uncoupled reduction of oxygen by NADPH and that regeneration of BH4 (possibly from qBH2) proceeds when the concentration of superoxide/peroxide is decreased to a low level in the combined presence of SOD, catalase, and NNA.Effects of Supplementation with Arginine on BH4 Levels during Turnover of NOSFig. 2compares the BH4 levels of NOS under partially coupled conditions (presence of supplemental arginine) with those described above under fully uncoupled conditions (Fig. 1). Curves 1 and 2 of Fig. 2 confirm the requirement of CaM for BH4 oxidation. BH4 levels are largely stabilized by addition of NNA at the beginning of the incubation (curve 3). In the presence of CaM, addition of arginine markedly increased the oxidation of BH4 from 40% (curve 2) to 80–90% (curve 4). Oxidation under the latter conditions (arginine and CaM) was greatly attenuated by addition of SOD plus catalase (curve 5), and partially reversed by addition of SOD, catalase, and NNA (curve 6, closed circles versus open circles), indicating that sufficient superoxide/peroxide is generated even in the presence of supplemental arginine to cause extensive oxidation of BH4.Figure 2Effects of supplemental arginine on BH 4 levels during NOS turnover. Conditions are the same as in Fig. 1. ■, curve 1, no additions to the standard reaction mixture; ▵, curve 2, addition of CaM; ▴, curve 3, addition of CaM and NNA; ▿, curve 4, addition of CaM and arginine; ▪, curve 5, addition of CaM, arginine, SOD, and catalase; curve 6, addition of CaM and arginine (○), followed by further addition of SOD, catalase, and NNA after 80 s (●).

Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), it was therefore of interest to determine the effect of adding BH4 to the arginine-supplemented reaction mix used in the experiment described in Fig. 2. The results shown in Fig.3 confirm that little or no oxidation of NOS-bound BH4 occurs in the absence of CaM (curve 1) and further show that similar stability of BH4 is observed in the presence of supplemental BH4 (curve 2). CaM-dependent oxidation is increased marginally by supplementary BH4 (curve 4 versus curve 3). In the presence of arginine, supplementary BH4 initially protects BH4against oxidation (curve 6 versus curve 5), but this protective effect is lost as the incubation progresses. These results show that even in the presence of arginine and BH4, conditions that favor the coupled formation of NO, BH4 is oxidized ultimately to the same low level as observed with arginine alone.Figure 3Effects of supplemental BH 4 and arginine on BH 4 levels during NOS turnover. Native NOS containing 0.5 BH4/NOS subunit was reconstituted with supplemental BH4 to a value approaching 1 BH4/NOS subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”). BH4 levels are expressed as percentages of the initial total BH4 content. Thus, although the amount of initial total BH4 in the BH4-supplemented reaction mixtures is twice that of the unsupplemented reaction mixtures, there is also almost twice as much NOS containing bound BH4. This representation allows direct approximation of relative BH4levels based on the corresponding amount of BH4-bound NOS. Conditions are the same as those described in Fig. 1 except for the absence or presence, respectively, of supplemental BH4: ■ and ▪ curves 1 and 2, no additions; ○ and ●, curves 3 and 4, plus CaM; ▿ and ▾, curves 5 and 6, plus CaM and arginine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BH4 Levels during Single Turnover of NOSIn the studies reported above, reaction mixtures contained an NADPH-regenerating system that provides a source of electrons for both the superoxide/peroxide-mediated oxidation of BH4 and, as demonstrated in the presence of SOD plus catalaseplus NNA, the regeneration of BH4 from its oxidized products. The effects noted above therefore represent steady-state changes determined by the amount of oxidation of BH4 on the one hand and regeneration of BH4 on the other. Clearly, in order to detect any oxidation of BH4that is stoichiometrically coupled with the overall oxygenation of arginine to NO, it is necessary to prevent regeneration of BH4 from its oxidized products. We therefore examined BH4 levels of NOS during the single turnover of arginine to NHA and of NHA to citrulline in the absence of an NADPH-regenerating system; SOD/catalase were included in the reaction mixtures to minimize any oxidation of BH4 by superoxide/peroxide.Fig. 4 illustrates results of experiments to determine the effects of arginine and NHA on BH4oxidation. The possible trace amount of BH4 oxidation in the absence of CaM (curve 1) could reflect the inherent instability of BH4 under these conditions. Addition of CaM (curve 2) or CaM plusNHA (curve 3) caused a small increase in the oxidation. Maximal BH4 oxidation was observed in the presence of CaM plus arginine (curve 4). Higher levels of SOD/catalase added to the reaction mixture of curve 2 resulted in similar results (data not shown).Figure 4BH4 levels under single turnover conditions.

NHA, the immediate product of arginine oxidation, was the dominant product; citrulline formation was negligible (data not shown). The ratio of BH4 oxidized to NHA formed was not constant. It may be estimated from the results of Fig. 5 (inset) that this ratio increased with time from 1.0 at 30 s to 1.7 at 180 s. In this experiment, NOS was not supplemented with BH4. Variable ratios were also observed in a similar experiment in which NOS was supplemented with 1 mol of BH4 per mol of NOS subunit. Under this condition the ratio of BH4 oxidized to NHA formed was 3.1 at 30 s and progressively decreased to 1.8 at 180 s (data not shown).Figure 5BH4 levels and NHA formation under single turnover conditions.

The reaction proceeds in two steps; arginine is first oxygenated to the intermediate N G-hydroxy-l-arginine (NHA), which is then oxygenated to the products NO and citrulline (reviewed in Ref. 1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has attracted much interest because of its involvement in a variety of physiological processes such as vasodilation, cytotoxic activity, and neurotransmission (2Feldman P.L. Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 71: 26-38Crossref Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). NOS is unique as a heme oxygenase in requiring BH4, and elucidation of the role of BH4 is essential in understanding how this enzyme functions. It is well established that BH4 has pronounced effects on the structure of NOS. These effects include the ability to shift the heme iron to its high spin state, promotion of arginine binding, and stabilization of the active dimeric form of the enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 4Gorren A.C. Mayer B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 734-743PubMed Google Scholar), as well as stabilization of the ferrous heme iron coordination structure (5Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of the first molecule of BH4 to an NOS dimer has an anticooperative effect on the binding of the second molecule of BH4 (6Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Studies of the effects of pterin analogues on NOS provide graphic evidence that these structural effects cannot fully explain the requirement for BH4. Whereas the structural effects of BH4 are mimicked by a series of pterin analogues independent of their oxidation state, pterins must be in the tetrahydro state in order to support NO synthesis (5Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Pitters E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8422-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This requirement for a tetrahydropterin suggests an additional, redox, role of BH4. A number of recent reports support a redox role of BH4 in which the pterin provides electrons for the oxygenation reactions catalyzed by NOS. Studies with recombinant BH4-free NOS (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have implicated BH4 as acting as a stoichiometric reactant in the first oxygenation step (arginine to NHA) of NO synthesis. The role of BH4 in this reaction is envisioned by Ruscheet al. (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as being analogous to the well established role of BH4 in the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase systems (10Kaufman S. Enzymes. 1987; 18: 217-282Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that BH4 remains tightly bound to NOS throughout the catalytic cycle (11Giovanelli J. Campos K.L. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Further support for this proposal is provided by the finding that non-heme iron, which is an integral component of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (10Kaufman S. Enzymes. 1987; 18: 217-282Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is a stoichiometric component of NOS and enhances its activity (12Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Again by analogy with the hydroxylation of the aromatic amino acids (10Kaufman S. Enzymes. 1987; 18: 217-282Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the oxidation of BH4 by NOS would generate equivalent amounts of NHA and quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2), and the latter compound would need to be recycled to BH4 by a dihydropterin reductase-like activity in order to maintain the catalytic function of BH4. In these same studies, Rusche et al. (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) further proposed a role for BH4 in the second oxygenation step (NHA to citrulline and NO). It was suggested (9Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that BH4 may be acting as an electron donor in this step or in an indirect fashion by affecting, for example, the spin equilibrium and reduction potential of the heme.

We have previously shown that SR proteins can promote the association of the alternative exon 5 with the flanking constitutive exon 6 of this pre-mRNA. In this study, we have shown that when exons 2, 3, and 4 of the cTnT pre-mRNA are spliced together, the composite exon 2/3/4 contains an additional SR protein binding site. Furthermore, we have found that SR proteins can also promote interactions between the pairs of exons 2/3/4-5 and 2/3/4-6. We then asked whether the SR protein binding sites in these exons play a role in cTnT alternative splicing in vivo. We found that the SR protein binding sites in exons 2/3/4 and 6 promote exon 5 skipping, and it has previously been shown that the SR protein binding site in exon 5 promotes exon 5 inclusion. Consistent with these results, we find that the SR protein-mediated association of exon 2/3/4 with 6 is preferred over associations involving exon 5, in that exons 2/3/4 and 6 are more efficient than exon 5 in competing an SR protein-mediated exon/exon association. We suggest that the relative strengths of SR protein-mediated associations of alternative and constitutive exons play a role in determining alternative splicing patterns.

We suggest that the relative strengths of SR protein-mediated associations of alternative and constitutive exons play a role in determining alternative splicing patterns. During splicing of some precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), splice sites that are short and poorly conserved must be properly chosen and brought together across introns, some as large as 100 kilobases (1Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The selection of any pair of splice sites is the result of interactions of each individual splice site with the splicing machinery combined with the pairing of the selected splice sites with one another across introns. The relative strength of these interactions appears to vary greatly between splice site pairs during alternative splicing, in which as many as hundreds of different mRNAs are formed from single genes (2Black D.L. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moore J.M. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gestleland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar). To understand how splice site pairs are chosen, research has focused on identifying the factors that are responsible for this variation during alternative splicing. SR1 proteins are a family of splicing factors that appear to play an important role in alternative splicing in that individual SR proteins can influence the selection of distinct alternative splice sites (4Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 5Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem.

Insight into the mechanism of SR protein function has come through the identification of RNA sequences to which they bind and appear to influence splicing. These sequences are characteristically composed of purine-rich sequences that reside within an alternatively spliced exon, and when these sequences are found to be important for the selection of the alternative exon where they reside, they are termed exonic splicing enhancers (1Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 5Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR proteins appear to function at exonic splicing enhancers by promoting a variety of interactions that result in the interaction of exons across introns. SR proteins, bound to exonic enhancers, appear to promote interactions of both the U1 and U2 snRNPs 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteincTnTcardiac troponin TPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisWTwild typePCRpolymerase chain reaction with adjacent splice sites (7Staknis D.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These splicing snRNPs may interact with those bound to a flanking exon and in this way promote interactions of exons across introns (11Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As well, SR proteins, independent of other factors, can promote a specific association between an exonic enhancer-containing alternative exon and a flanking, constitutive exon, which also has an SR protein binding site (8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SR proteins may perform this function on a number of pre-mRNAs, because sequence analysis reveals that when purine-rich SR protein binding sites are found in alternative exons, they tend to also be found in one or more of the constitutive exons that flank the alternative exon, based on sequence comparisons (8Stark J.M.

To address this hypothesis, we have analyzed a splicing event that involves SR protein binding sites in contiguous exons: the alternative inclusion of exon 5 into the chicken cardiac troponin T (cTnT) mRNA. Exon 5 is included in mRNAs in embryonic skeletal and cardiac muscle and is excluded from mRNAs in the adult (12Cooper T.A. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11140-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that exon 5 contains an SR protein binding site that is essential for exon 5 inclusion (13Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and that SR proteins can promote the association of the alternative exon 5 with the flanking constitutive exon 6 of this pre-mRNA (8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that SR proteins can also promote interactions between the pairs of exons 2/3/4-5 and 2/3/4-6, where exon 2/3/4 is the composite of exons 2, 3, and 4 spliced together. We also show that SR protein binding sites in the flanking constitutive exons, exons 2/3/4 and 6, appear to promote exon 5 skipping in vivo. Consistent with these results, we find that the SR protein-mediated association of exon 2/3/4 with 6 is preferred over associations involving exon 5, in that exons 2/3/4 and 6 are more efficient than exon 5 in competing an SR protein-mediated exon/exon association. We suggest that the relative strengths of SR protein-mediated associations of alternative and constitutive exons play a role in determining alternative splicing patterns. UV cross-linking of RNA to purified SR proteins was performed similar to that previously described (13Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Exon 2/3/4 RNA was transcribed from a synthetic oligonucleotide template with T7 polymerase and labeled using [α-32 P]GTP. 3 pmol of radiolabeled exon 2/3/4 RNA was incubated with 500 ng of total calf thymus SR proteins and 50 pmol of nonspecific competitor RNA (13Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) under splicing conditions for 10 min at 30°. To some samples other nonradiolabeled RNAs were added as competitors at two concentrations each (10 and 30 pmol/reaction). These exon RNAs (2/3/4, 2 m/3 m/4, 2, 3, and 4) were transcribed from a synthetic oligonucleotide template with T7 polymerase (14Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). RNAs were purified from 5% urea-PAGE gels and quantified using a spectrophotometer. Their sequences are shown in Fig.1 A except for the complete sequence of exon 2, which is UAUGCCUUGCAUGUCGGACUCUGAAGAGGUCGUUGAAGGAUACGACGA. The samples were placed on ice and UV irradiated at 120,000 μJ for 7 min at 254 nm (Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following UV irradiation, each sample was incubated with 1 μl of RNase A and T1 (Ambion) at 37° for 30 min, mixed with an equal volume of protein sample buffer, incubated at 90° for 3 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager, and the relative signals were quantified with Image/Quant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA). RNA affinity chromatography assays for SR protein-mediated exon/exon associations were performed as described previously (8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RNA affinity columns containing exon 5/UP or exon 6 were assembled using R17-exon fusion RNAs. For each column, 8 μg of R17-exon RNA was bound to 10 μg of R17-glutathioneS-transferase protein affixed to 70 μl of glutathione-agarose. The RNA affinity columns were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in a volume of 220 μl in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 220 mm KCl, 3.6 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm ATP, and 4.5 mm creatine phosphate with 100 μl of a solution of 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/mlEscherichia coli tRNA, with or without 2.6 μg of calf thymus or HeLa SR proteins. The final concentration of SR proteins in the defined system was 12 μg/ml, whereas the SR protein concentration in standard splicing reactions with HeLa nuclear extract is approximately 30 μg/ml (15Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNAs were added to the columns at the same time that SR proteins were added. Control RNA was transcribed from Bluescript KS+ linearized with XbaI (small) or XhoI (large). The exon 4, exon 2/3/4, and exon 2 m/3 m/4 RNAs (sequence shown in Fig.1 A) were transcribed from synthetic oligonucleotide templates. All of these RNAs were transcribed with T7 polymerase and labeled using [α-32 P]GTP (14Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The RNAs for a given experiment were transcribed in parallel with the ratios of labeled GTP/cold GTP set such that all the RNAs would have the same molar-specific activity. RNAs were purified from 5% urea-PAGE gels and quantified using a scintillation counter. Equal amounts of the exon/intron RNAs were mixed with a set amount of control RNA to make normalized RNA samples. A part of these samples was saved as preload, and the rest was added in equal amounts to RNA affinity columns. To some columns competitor RNAs were added (exon 5/WT, exon 2/3/4, or exon 6), which were synthesized with T7 polymerase and were not radiolabeled (14Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In these experiments where competitors were added (Fig. 4), the radiolabeled 2/3/4 RNA concentration was 10 pmol/reaction, and the tRNA concentration was 20 μg/ml. Following incubation, columns were washed four times at 4 °C in Buffer S (8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One-third of each sample was loaded onto a 6 m urea, 5% acrylamide gel. The gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager, and the relative signals were quantified with Image/Quant (Molecular Dynamics). The column affinity of an exon was computed by dividing the signal from the exon RNA by the signal from the control RNA. The change in column affinity of an exon because of SR proteins was computed by dividing the column affinity with SR proteins by the column affinity without SR proteins. The WT minigene construct is a derivative of ΔPB.SA (16Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); where ΔPB.SA has a short mutation in exon 4 that creates aBamHI site, the WT minigene in this manuscript has wild-type exon 4. The nucleotide sequence changes made in the mutant minigenes are described in detail in Figs. 1 A and 3. All mutations were created using site-directed mutagenesis and were confirmed by sequencing. Transient transfection of QT35 and primary chicken breast muscle cultures, RNA isolation from transfected cells, and reverse transcription of RNA samples was performed as described previously (17Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of reverse transcription reactions was performed under standard conditions with the following two oligonucleotides: TNTE1, 5′-CATTCACCACATTGGTGTGC; and PBSA, 3′-CCTACAAGATTGTCATC. A fraction of the PBSA 3′ oligonucleotide in the PCR reaction was end-labeled using [γ-32 P]ATP and T4 kinase. PCR products were resolved by 6% urea-PAGE. The gels were exposed both to film and to a PhosphorImager, and the relative signals were quantified with Image/Quant (Molecular Dynamics). The percent of exon 5 inclusion from a given PCR reaction was computed by dividing the signal from the exon 5 inclusion product by the sum of the signals of exon 5 included and exon skipped product (multiplied by 100). The percent exon 5 inclusion for a given minigene is the mean of the percent exon 5 inclusion from at least three independent transfections. To analyze SR protein associations with the cTnT pre-mRNA, we asked whether SR proteins could interact with exons that are upstream of exon 5. In addition to studying the biochemical properties of exon 4 alone, we considered that exon 4 may be part of a larger exon, of exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 spliced together, when it is spliced to exon 5. Exons 2 and 3 are moderately purine-rich and, when spliced to exon 4, could generate an SR protein binding site and thereby influence the splicing pattern of exon 4. Thus, we have analyzed the SR protein binding characteristics of the composite of exons 2, 3, and 4 spliced together, which we refer to as exon 2/3/4 (Fig. 1 A). To test whether exon 2/3/4 can bind SR proteins, we asked whether exon 2/3/4 could form a UV cross-linked species with SR proteins. Radiolabeled exon 2/3/4 (3 pmol) was incubated with purified SR proteins and nonspecific competitor RNA (50 pmol) under splicing conditions and subsequently exposed to UV irradiation at 254 nm, which can create covalent bonds between protein and RNA (13Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The reactions were then treated with RNase A and T1 to displace uncross-linked RNA, and the radiolabeled proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. In these experiments, exon 2/3/4 formed cross-linked species with several SR proteins (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). To determine the specificity of the cross-link, identical reactions were performed in the presence of five different competitor RNAs: exon 2/3/4; exon 2 m/3 m/4, which is similar to exon 2/3/4 except it has 13 purine to pyrimidine mutations in the exon 2 and 3 region (Fig. 1 A); full-length exon 2; exon 3; and exon 4. Each competitor was tested at two concentrations: 10 and 30 pmol/reaction. Addition of the exon 2/3/4 competitor RNA led to a decrease in the cross-linking efficiency of radiolabeled exon 2/3/4 to all the SR proteins (lanes 2 and3). The exon 2 m/3 m/4, full-length exon 2, exon 3, and exon 4 competitor RNAs, in contrast, were significantly less efficient at inhibiting the cross-linking efficiency (lanes 4–11). For example, the cross-link to SRp55 was inhibited 4- and 12-fold by 10 and 30 pmol of exon 2/3/4 competitor, respectively, 1.3- and 1.6-fold for the same amounts of exon 2 m3m4, 1.6- and 1.8-fold for exon 2, 1- and 2-fold for exon 3, and 1.5- and 3-fold for exon 4. These results suggest that an efficient SR protein binding site is created by the splicing together of exons 2, 3, and 4. In a previous study, we found that SR proteins are sufficient to promote a specific association of exon 6 with exon 5/UP, an exon 5 mutant that has an enhanced SR protein binding site (18Nagel R.J. Lancaster A.M. Zahler A.M. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1998; 4: 11-23PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered whether SR proteins could also promote associations of exon 2/3/4 with exons 5 and/or 6. To test this prediction, we assayed the affinities of 1) radiolabeled exon 2/3/4 and exon 4 RNAs for exon 5/UP affinity columns and 2) radiolabeled exon 2/3/4 and exon 2 m/3 m/4 for exon 6 affinity columns. In these experiments, the radiolabeled RNAs were incubated with the affinity columns along with fixed amounts of radiolabeled control RNAs both in the presence or absence of SR proteins. To assay for relevant interactions, the concentration of SR proteins in these experiments is 12 μg/ml, which is on the same order as that present in standard splicing reactions with HeLa nuclear extract (15Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Following several washes, RNA was extracted from the columns and resolved on a 5% urea-PAGE gel. Note that in Fig. 2 the long exon 2/3/4 and 2 m/3 m/4 RNAs (labeled E) are incubated with a short control RNA (labeled C), and the short exon 4 RNA (labeled E) is incubated with a long control RNA (labeled C). In these experiments (Fig. 2), SR proteins reproducibly resulted in a >5-fold increase in the amount of exon 2/3/4, which bound to both exon 5/UP columns (lanes 2and 3) and exon 6 columns (lanes 10 and11). In contrast, the addition of SR proteins did not result in an increase in the amount of exon 4, which bound to exon 5/UP columns (lanes 7 and 8), or in the amount of exon 2 m/3 m/4, which bound to exon 6 columns (lanes 13 and14). Analysis of supernatant fractions from these incubation reactions shows that the amounts of RNAs present at the end of the incubations were the same with or without SR proteins (lanes 4 and 5, and data not shown). This result indicates that SR proteins do not influence the stability of the these RNAs in the binding reaction. The supernatant signal does not diminish with SR proteins because radiolabeled exon RNAs are in molar excess of column exon RNA. These results suggest that SR proteins are sufficient to promote the associations of exon 2/3/4 with exon 5/UP and exon 2/3/4 with exon 6. The findings that SR proteins can promote exon/exon associations between the pairs of exons 5/UP-6 (8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), 2/3/4-5/UP, and 2/3/4-6 suggested that the SR protein binding sites in each of these exons may play a role in cTnT splicing. The SR protein binding sites in alternatively included exons, such as exon 5, are generally found to be essential for inclusion of the alternative exon (1Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 13Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of the SR protein binding sites in constitutive exons, such as exons 2/3/4 and 6, remained unexplored. To characterize the role of purine-rich SR protein binding sites in exon 2/3/4 and exon 6 in the splicing of cTnT, we have mutated these sites and assayed their effects on cTnT splicing in vivo. Four minigenes were constructed (Fig.3 A): WT, which contains wild-type cTnT genomic sequence; 2 m3m, which has the mutations of purine residues in exons 2 and 3 described above (see Fig.1 A); 6 m, which has mutations of purine residues in exon 6 (8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); and 2 m3m6 m, which has a combination of the mutations made in exons 2, 3, and 6. The 2 m3m and 6 m mutations can be expected to affect the SR protein binding capacity of exons 2/3/4 and 6 in vivo (Refs. 8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 13Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Figs. 1 and 2), although it is formally possible that these mutations could also affect the associations of additional factors. These minigenes were transfected into QT35 fibroblasts and primary chicken embryo skeletal muscle cultures. RNA was subsequently isolated from the transfected cells, and the splicing patterns of each minigene were assayed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. In these experiments, the mutations affected the relative ratio of mRNAs including and excluding exon 5. In QT35 cells, where the wild-type cTnT minigene exhibits exon 5 inclusion levels of 42%, both the 2 m3m and 6 m mutant minigenes exhibit increased exon 5 inclusion levels in these cells to 59 and 61%, respectively (Fig.3 A). The combination mutant 2 m3m6 m exhibited an exon 5 inclusion level of 73% in QT35 cells, which is higher than either of the individual mutants. Single mutations in exon 2 and exon 3 each show a partial increase of exon 5 inclusion at 47 ± 4% and 47 ± 3%, respectively, although it is not clear whether these increases are significant. This result indicates that at least two purine-rich regions in exon 2/3/4 need to be mutated to significantly affect its splicing. In muscle cells, the mutant minigenes 2 m3m, 6 m, and 2 m3m6 m showed slight increases in exon 5 inclusion at 94, 98, and 95%, respectively, where the WT exon 5 inclusion is already high at 89%. These results indicate that the purine-rich sites in exons 2, 3, and 6 promote exon 5 skipping. Alternatively, the mutated forms of exons 2, 3, or 6 could possibly be acting as inhibitors of exon 5 inclusion. The simplest interpretation of all of these results is that SR proteins bound to exons 2/3/4 and 6 promote exon 5 skipping. The finding that the SR protein binding sites in exons 2/3/4 and 6 promote exon 5 skipping suggests that SR proteins may prefer to promote the association of exon 2/3/4 with exon 6 instead of associations of exons 2/3/4 or 6 with exon 5. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitrocompetition assay for exon/exon associations where we assayed the relative ability of exons 2/3/4, 5, and 6 to disrupt the SR protein-mediated association of exon 2/3/4 with exon 6. In these experiments, radiolabeled exon 2/3/4 was incubated with exon 6 columns and SR proteins in the presence of exon 5/WT, exon 2/3/4, or exon 6 as competitor RNAs. Following several washes, RNA was extracted from the columns and resolved on a 5% urea-PAGE gel. In the first experiment (Fig.4 A), we compared inhibition capacity of exon 5/WT with that of exon 2/3/4. In this experiment, exon 5/WT inhibited the 2/3/4-6 interaction 3- and 7-fold with a 30 and 300 pmol/reaction, respectively (lanes 4 and 5), whereas exon 2/3/4 inhibited the 2/3/4-6 interaction 6- and 13-fold with a 30 and 300 pmol/reaction, respectively (lanes 6 and7). In the second experiment (Fig. 4 B), we compared the inhibition capacity of exon 5/WT with that of exon 6. In this experiment, exon 5/WT inhibited the 2/3/4-6 interaction 1.3- and 3-fold with a 15 and 150 pmol/reaction, respectively (lanes 4 and 5), whereas exon 6 inhibited the 2/3/4-6 interaction 2.3- and 5.5-fold with a 15 and 150 pmol/reaction, respectively (lanes 6 and 7). Thus, both exon 2/3/4 and exon 6 were each consistently 1.8-fold more efficient than exon 5/WT at disrupting the SR protein-mediated association of the radiolabeled exon 2/3/4 for the exon 6 column. We performed these experiments six times; 1.8-fold effects were observed each time we performed these experiments. These results suggest the SR protein-mediated in vitro association of exon 2/3/4 with 6 is preferred over associations involving exon 5, which is consistent with the observation that the SR protein binding sites in exon 2/3/4 and 6 promote alternative exon 5 skipping in vivo. We suggest that the relative strengths of SR protein-mediated associations between exons 2/3/4, 5, and 6 play a role in cTnT alternative splicing (Fig. 4 C). The relative strengths of exon/exon associations appear to vary between distinct exon pairs during alternative splicing (2Black D.L. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moore J.M. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gestleland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar). To understand how alternative splicing patterns are established, it will be critical to identify the molecular mechanisms that give rise to this variation. In this study, we have characterized the role of SR protein-mediated exon/exon associations in this process. Previous results have shown that SR proteins, bound to exons, may function to promote the interactions of exons across introns, both by promoting exon/exon associations directly and as well by promoting snRNP associations with splice sites (7Staknis D. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7670-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 8Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Hoffmann H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the chicken cardiac troponin T pre-mRNA, which has SR protein binding sites in multiple contiguous exons: the constitutive exons 2/3/4 and 6 and the alternative exon 5. With this pre-mRNA, we show that the SR protein binding sites in the constitutive exons appear to promote alternative exon skipping in vivo. These results are consistent with our additional findings that the SR protein-mediatedin vitro association of the two constitutive exons (exon 2/3/4 with exon 6) is preferred over SR protein-mediated associations involving the intervening alternative exon (exon 5). We suggest that the relative strengths of SR protein-mediated associations of alternative and constitutive exons play a role in determining alternative splicing patterns. SR protein binding sites are not likely to be the only elements that influence the relative strengths of exon/exon associations during cTnT alternative splicing, as is suggested by the finding that the SR protein binding sites in exons 2/3/4 and 6 are not absolutely essential for exon 5 skipping. For example, the efficiency of association of splicing snRNPs with a particular exon, which can interact with snRNPs bound to another exon, is also likely to influence the efficiency of particular exon/exon associations (1Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 11Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 19Nasim F. Spears P. Hoffmann H.M. Kuo H.C. Grabowski P.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 7: 1172-1184Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These mechanisms play a role in cTnT splicing, because exon 5 inclusion can be enhanced by improving the base complimentarity of its 5′-splice site for the U1 snRNA (16Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Cooper T.A. Cardone M.H. Ordahl C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8443-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Another element that likely influences exon/exon associations is the constitutive preference for splicing proximal exons. This appears to be a common feature of RNA splicing, because, in general, the most abundant mature mRNAs contain exons spliced in order (2Black D.L. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that underlie this preference are unknown, although the co-transcriptional nature of splicing suggests that the pairing of two proximal exons could be finished before the synthesis of another distal exon (21Bauren G. Weislander L. Cell. 1994; 76: 183-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Beyer A.L. Osheim Y.N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The finding that exon 5 skipping in cTnT is not simply a default splicing pathway indicates that these mechanisms are at work even in cases of the splicing of weak, alternative exons. Thus, the order that the exons are organized in the pre-mRNA, the relative strengths of the splice sites of each exon, and the relative strengths of SR protein-mediated exon/exon associations likely act in combination to affect the relative efficiencies of particular exon/exon associations during alternative splicing. We have also found that the assembly of SR protein binding sites can depend upon previous splicing events; exon 4 appears to bind efficiently to SR proteins only when it is spliced to exons 2 and 3 in the composite exon 2/3/4. The apparent involvement of at least two purine-rich regions in the splicing of exon 2/3/4 suggests that the long purine-rich sequence in exon 2/3/4 may bind a complex of multiple SR proteins. Plus, the finding that this SR protein binding site influences exon 5 inclusion indicates that the alternative splicing of exon 5 is linked to other splicing events that are distant on the pre-mRNA from the alternative splicing event. It follows that part of the regulation of exon 5 inclusion could occur through controlling the relative timing of these distant splicing events. For example, delayed splicing of exons 2, 3, and 4, which synthesizes the SR protein binding site in exon 2/3/4, could increase the chance that exon 5 could compete with exon 4 for splicing to exon 6. Thus, it appears that regulation of exon 5 inclusion is not limited to intronic elements previously shown to promote muscle-specific exon inclusion (17Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Ryan K.R. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4014-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Clearly, an assumption in this model is that exons 2, 3, and 4 are spliced together when the purine residues in exons 2 and 3 affect exon 5 inclusion, which remains to be determined. There are other examples where the synthesis of a splicing element is dependent upon a previous splicing event. In the pre-protachykinin pre-mRNA, the splicing of exons 4 and 5 places the strong 5′-splice site proximal to exon 4, which promotes the splicing of exon 4 to exon 3 (19Nasim F. Spears P. Hoffmann H.M. Kuo H.C. Grabowski P.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 7: 1172-1184Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the splicing of exons 6 and 8 of the β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA creates an exonic splicing enhancer that is essential for the splicing of exons 6 and 5 (24Helfman D.M. Ricci W.M. Finn L.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Tsukahara T. Casciato C. Helfman D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2318-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In another case, the splicing of intron 3 of the tumor necrosis factor-β gene is dependent upon the presence of an additional upstream intron (26Neel H. Weil D. Giasante C. Dautry F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2194-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

NT and the related peptide neuromedin N are generated from a common precursor protein and are thought to have overlapping signaling functions (3Dobner P.R. Barber D.L. Villa-Komaroff L. McKiernan C.

There is considerable anatomical and functional evidence indicating that NT functions as a neuromodulator in the dopamine (DA) pathways in the central nervous system. The majority of midbrain DA neurons express the cloned high affinity NT receptor (NTR-1), and there is evidence that at least some DA neurons are directly contacted by NT-positive axons (5Szigethy E.

NT appears to excite midbrain DA neurons both directly (7Pinnock R.D. Brain Res. 1985; 338: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Jiang Z.-G. Pessia M. North R.A. J. Physiol.

However, NT also attenuates d-amphetamine locomotor activation after intracerebroventricular administration or after direct application in the ventral striatum possibly through the inhibition of post-synaptic D2 signaling (12Nemeroff C.B.

A lower affinity levocobastine-sensitive receptor (NTR-2) was subsequently cloned by low stringency hybridization using an NTR-1 cDNA probe (16Mazella J. Botto J.-M. Guillemare E. Coppola T.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that NT does not stimulate signaling through NTR-2, suggesting that NT acts mainly through NTR-1 (18Botto J.-M. Guillemare E. Vincent J.-P. Mazella J. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 223: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NTR-1 is expressed at high levels in midbrain DA neurons, and dopamine regulates NTR expression in corticolimbic structures in the rat brain (19Bolden-Watson C. Watson M.A. Murray K.D. Isackson P.J.

This hypothesis is further supported by the observations that the indirect DA agonists cocaine and methamphetamine and D2 antagonists stimulate NT gene expression in the dorsal and ventral striatum (22Merchant K.M.

Gully D. Kitabgi P. Bérod A. Rostène W. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 172: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Azzi M. Boudin H. Mahmudi N. Pelaprat D. Rostène W. Berod A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results collectively indicate that DA, NT, and perhaps other signals can result in plastic changes in NTR-1 expression; however, the underlying mechanisms controlling NTR-1 expression are poorly understood. Tissue culture cell lines that express NTR-1 in a regulated or constitutive manner potentially provide model systems for understanding the mechanisms controlling Ntr-1 gene expression. The N1E-115 neuroblastoma cell line was isolated as part of a screen for catecholamine-producing neuronal cell lines from a mouse brain neuroblastoma (26Amano T. Richelson E. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), and Me2SO-induced neuronal differentiation of these cells (27Kimhi Y. Palfrey C. Spector I. Barak Y. Littauer U.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) is accompanied by increased expression of high affinity NT-binding sites (28Poustis C. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.-P. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The transition of these cells to a post-mitotic stationary phase also results in the induction of NTR expression (29Cusack B. Stanton T. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 206: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A neuroblastoma × glioma cell line has also been described that expresses high constitutive levels of high affinity NT-binding sites (30Nakagawa Y. Higashida H. Miki N. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N1E-115 cells are a particularly attractive model to probe Ntr-1 gene regulation since the Ntr-1 gene is expressed in catecholaminergic neurons in vivo (31Nicot A. Rostène W. Berod A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 341: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). They should also be useful for identifying signaling mechanisms that activate the Ntr-1gene during neuronal differentiation (28Poustis C. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.-P. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate the pathways controlling Ntr-1 gene expression in these and other cell types, we have cloned the mouseNtr-1 gene and sequenced the promoter region. Detailed mutational analysis of the Ntr-1 promoter has revealed sequence elements that are crucial for Me2SO induction and basal expression in N1E-115 cells that are conserved in the rat and human promoters. A CACCC sequence appears to be the most critical sequence element for Me2SO responsiveness, and gel shift and DNase I footprinting experiments indicate that an Me2SO-inducible complex binds to this site. Several sequence elements contribute to basal expression, including an Sp1-related site and a sequence that is similar to the initiator element first identified in the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene (32Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). We also present evidence that a transcriptional silencer controls the activity of this positive regulatory region. These results provide evidence that the Ntr-1 gene is transcriptionally activated during Me2SO-induced neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 cells most likely through a mechanism involving the induction of a complex that binds to a sequence that includes a CACCC motif. A mouse genomic library was constructed by ligating partially digested high molecular weight DNA isolated from D3 embryonic stem cells (15–20-kb fragments) into BamHI-digested λEMBL4 using standard methods (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.111Google Scholar). The library was screened using a 32 P-labeledSmaI fragment of the rat NTR-1 cDNA (15Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 847-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) that contains the 5′ 1.3 kb of the cloned sequences and standard filter lift procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.111Google Scholar). Positives were plaque-purified and used to prepare phage DNA. Two positives were further characterized by restriction mapping (λmNTR2–2 and λmNTR10–1). Promoter fragments from λmNTR2–2 were subcloned into pGEM4 (Promega), and the promoter region was sequenced using the chain terminator method. N1E-115 cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g of glucose/liter and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 2 mml-glutamine. NG108 cells were passaged in the medium described above for N1E-115 cells except supplemented with hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (30Nakagawa Y. Higashida H. Miki N. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.0 g of glucose/liter and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. N1E-115 and MEF cells were subcultured from confluent dishes by diluting the cells 1:4 with fresh medium 3 days prior to transfection. All lines were subcultured the day before transfection at a density that resulted in 1 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish at the time of transfection. CsCl-purified plasmid DNA was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation using 10-cm dishes. Briefly, for each reporter plasmid, two 10-cm dishes were fed with 8 ml of fresh medium just prior to transfection, and 25 μg of plasmid DNA as a calcium phosphate precipitate were added to each dish. DNA precipitates were prepared by diluting 50 μg of plasmid DNA (luciferase reporter and pPGKβ-gal standardization plasmids) into 700 μl of NTE (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), 100 μl of 2 mCaCl2, and 800 μl of transfection buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 180 mm NaCl, 2 mmNaPO4), and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min. The calcium phosphate precipitate (800 μl) was added dropwise to the cells, and after 16 h the medium was replaced, and the cells from one 10-cm dish were resuspended by trituration and plated into two 60-mm dishes. The cells were allowed to adhere to the dish for 1 h; 1.5% Me2SO was added to one dish of each pair, and the cells were incubated for an additional 72 h. Cells were incubated for 72 h, and cell extracts were prepared after washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by lysis in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 as described (34Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (35Harrison R.J. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 981-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial NTR luciferase reporter construct was created by ligating a mouse Ntr-1gene 1.2-kb BamHI fragment, containing sequences −1425 to −185 relative to the NTR methionine initiator codon, into aBglII site just upstream of the luciferase gene in the pXP2 reporter plasmid (36Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). Convenient restriction sites (SmaI and SacI) and exonuclease III digestion were used to create a series of 5′ deletion mutants in pXP-2. Additional 5′ and 3′ deletion constructs were created by PCR using appropriate primers. The PCR primers contained 17 nucleotide regions that were complementary to deletion end points and resulted in the introduction of aBamHI site at the 5′ end and a SacI site at the 3′ end. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI andSacI and cloned into the SacI 5′ deletion construct described above digested with BamHI andSacI. This minimal promoter fragment was initially selected based on the positions of the transcriptional start sites that had been determined in rat and human (37Maeno H. Yoshimura R. Fujita S. Su Q. Tanaka K. Wada K. Kiyama H. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 38Le F. Groshan K. Zeng X.P. Richelson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1315-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); however, the start point in the mouse actually lies 5′ to the SacI site used to create the deletion clones. Clustered point mutations were created using the PCR overlap extension protocol (39Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar). Briefly, two overlapping PCR fragments were generated using either a 5′ primer that ends at the promoterSmaI site and introduces a BamHI site and a 3′ primer containing the clustered point mutations flanked by 10 and 6 nucleotide stretches of complementary sequence on the 3′ and 5′ sides, respectively, or a 5′ primer containing clustered point mutations as described above and a 3′ primer with the promoter SacI site as an end point. The two fragments were isolated by electrophoresis on a low melting temperature gel; the gel slices were melted, mixed, and a third PCR reaction was performed using the outer 5′ and 3′ primers described above. The resulting fragment was digested withBamHI and SacI, gel-isolated, and ligated into the SacI deletion clone in pXP-2 described above digested with BamHI and SacI. The promoter regions of the mutant constructs were completely sequenced to verify that only the intended changes had been introduced. Riboprobes were synthesized using either mouse Ntr-1 gene promoter fragments or a fragment of the rat NTR-1 cDNA subcloned into pGEM4 (Promega Biotech). The mouse Ntr-1 gene plasmids were constructed by ligation of either a 293-bp SacI fragment (SacII93, derived from a 2.4-kb PstI fragment subclone) or a 497-bpEcoRI/BamHI fragment (B/E 497, derived from a 1.2-kb BamHI subclone) into either SacI- orBamHI- and EcoRI-digested pGEM4. A 300-bpPstI fragment derived from pBSNTR2–2 (15Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 847-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pGEM4 digested with PstI and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to generate a probe for the quantitation of NTR-1 mRNA (PstI 300). To synthesize32 P-labeled riboprobes, plasmids were linearized with either EcoRI (B/E 497) or HindIII (SacI 293 and PstI 300) and transcribed with either T7 (B/E 497) or SP6 (SacI 293, PstI 300) RNA polymerase as described (40Bullock B.P. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Brain. Res. 1994; 27: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were performed as described (40Bullock B.P. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Brain. Res. 1994; 27: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was mixed with 5 × 105 cpm of32 P-labeled riboprobe, dried, and dissolved in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.7, 0.4 NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Reactions were denatured by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and hybridized overnight (∼16 h) at 45 °C. Following hybridization, 300 μl of RNase digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml nuclease P1, 2 μg/ml RNase T1) was added, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 10% SDS, 5 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml), incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Protection products were analyzed on a sequencing gel and visualized either by autoradiography or on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).32 P-Labeled RNA size markers were synthesized from a pGEM4 rat NT/N gene subclone (pGEM4-NT1.8) using a mixture of templates that were linearized with different restriction enzymes to yield transcripts of 113 (RsaI), 158 (HaeIII), 196 (PvuII), 242 (AvaII), 305 (HinfI), and 496 (DraI) nucleotides. Mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA was treated with DNase I to remove trace amounts of contaminating genomic DNA and RT-PCR reactions using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the conditions specified by the manufacturers, except that RT reactions were performed at 50 °C and betaine was added to the PCR reactions. The reverse transcription reaction was initiated after heat inactivation of the DNase I (70 °C for 5 min) by the addition of 5 pmol of a gene-specific primer (PEX-411c 5′-TGGCGCAGAGAGGAGCGCACGCACGGCTGCCCAGC-3′) complementary to nucleotides −411 to −376 of the mouse Ntr-1 gene and 25 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR reactions were performed using either mouse brain cDNA or embryonic stem cell genomic DNA templates mixed with 10 pmol of the PEX-411c primer and 10 pmol of one of three different 5′ primers (−513, 5′-GTGGAAGCGCGAGGAGCCCG-3′; −548, 5′-TTTTGGATCCACTGCTGGGCGCGCC-3′; −566, 5′-CTCCAACACCCACCCTCCTCCACTG-3′, the numbers correspond to the position of the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide on the mouse NTR-1 promoter). PCR reactions were supplemented with 2.5 mbetaine (Sigma) due to the high GC content of the promoter region, and 30 amplification cycles (94 °C, 15 s; 62 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; the extension time was increased to 4 min on the last cycle) were performed after an initial 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C (41Henke W. Herdel K. Jung K. Schnorr D. Loening S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 19: 3957-3958Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar). 32 P-End-labeled probes spanning the promoter region were prepared by digestion of a 1.2-kb BamHI gene fragment subcloned into pGEM4 with either EcoRI orBamHI followed by Klenow fill-in with [32 P]dATP. The plasmids were subsequently digested with either BamHI or EcoRI, respectively; the resulting fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and the 496-bp labeled EcoRI/BamHI fragments labeled at either the EcoRI or BamHI sites were recovered by centrifugation through a Gen Elute column (Supelco) and ethanol precipitation. Nuclear extracts were prepared from N1E-115 cells that had either been treated with 1.5% Me2SO for 48 h or grown under control conditions as described previously (42Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Whali W.W. Keller M.J. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (43Evers B.M. Wang X. Zhou Z. Townsend Jr., C.M. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3870-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using approximately 20 dishes of cells grown to confluency for each preparation. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method. DNase I footprint reactions were performed as described (35Harrison R.J. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 981-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by mixing 20,000 cpm probe, 160 μg of nuclear extract, and treatment with various amounts of DNase I (DNase I, pure, ribonuclease-free, Worthington). Reactions were also performed without the addition of nuclear extract to identify protected regions. The DNase I-treated reactions were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, analyzed on sequencing gels, and visualized by autoradiography with an intensifying screen. Chemical sequencing reactions (G, G + A) were also run so that the footprinted regions could be precisely aligned with the DNA sequence. Methylation interference reactions were performed as described (44Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 12-8-12-9Google Scholar) using a 32 P-labeled probe spanning nucleotides −589 to −507 generated by PCR and labeled by Klenow fill-in of aBamHI site at the 5′ end. The probe (10 μl, 5 × 105 cpm) was partially methylated by incubation in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfate reaction buffer (sodium cacodylate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 μl of dimethyl sulfate for 5 min at room temperature followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfate stop buffer (1.5 m sodium acetate, 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and ethanol precipitation. The methylated probe was then reacted with 50 μg of nuclear extract from N1E-115 cells that had been induced with 1.5% Me2SO for 72 h, and bound complexes were separated from free probe by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing gel. The complexes were visualized by autoradiography, and the region of the gel containing complexes 1 and 2 and unbound probe were excised, the DNA was electroeluted, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was resuspended in 1 m piperidine, incubated at 95 °C for 30 min, lyophilized several times, and analyzed on a sequencing gel. N1E-115 cells were propagated as described for transfection analysis and treated with 1.5% Me2SO or grown under control conditions in 10-cm dishes. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin, and 2 mm leupeptin), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were lysed by the addition of 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and vigorous vortexing for 10 s followed by centrifugation for 30 s. The supernatant was discarded; the pellet was washed once with buffer A on ice, centrifuged, and resuspended in 30 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 7.9, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin, and 2 mm leupeptin) on ice by vortexing for 10 s every 5 min for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were stored at −80 °C. Binding reactions were performed by mixing (10 μg, 1–2 μl) N1E-115 nuclear extract in binding buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, and in some cases unlabeled competitor DNA (16-μl final volume). The reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min, and 1 × 105 cpm probe was added followed by incubation for 15–20 min at room temperature. The probe was the same as that used for methylation interference. Binding reactions were analyzed on low ionic strength Tris acetate acrylamide gels as described (44Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 12-8-12-9Google Scholar). Mouse NTR-1 clones were isolated by screening a genomic library constructed from D3 mouse embryonic stem cell DNA with a 32 P-labeled 1.3-kb SmaI 5′ fragment of NTR-1 cDNA (15Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 847-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and two were further analyzed (2-2 and 10-1) by restriction mapping and Southern blotting. Exon one was localized to an ∼7-kb HindIII fragment that contained sequences extending ∼2.0 kb 5′ to the initiator methionine codon. A portion of the first exon and the 5′-flanking region were sequenced (Fig.1 A), and comparison with the corresponding regions of the rat (37Maeno H. Yoshimura R. Fujita S. Su Q. Tanaka K. Wada K. Kiyama H. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and human (38Le F. Groshan K. Zeng X.P. Richelson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1315-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) NTR-1genes revealed a region that is highly conserved between all three species (Fig. 1 B). This region contains Sp1-, CRE-, CACCC box-, and initiator element-related sequences as well as a large 40-bp palindromic sequence (mPAL) that includes the initiator element-related sequences (Fig. 1 B). This conserved sequence is located within a 200-bp region that is required for expression. RNase protection experiments were performed to map the approximate location of the transcriptional start site. Two 32 P-labeled antisense riboprobes (depicted schematically in Fig.2 A) were hybridized to total brain, kidney, spleen, or yeast RNA, followed by digestion with a mixture of nuclease P1 and ribonuclease T1, and the resulting products were analyzed on a sequencing gel. An antisense probe transcribed from a subcloned SacI fragment (Sac293, −448 to −149 relative to the AUG start codon) was fully protected after hybridization with mouse brain RNA but not the control RNAs, indicating that the start site is located upstream of the region encompassed by th"
https://openalex.org/W1968845441,"The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor c-Myc is a potent trigger of programmed cell death when overexpressed during late oligodendrocyte development in transgenic mice. Here we provide evidence that c-Myc can act synergistically with the Pit, Oct, Unc homeodomain transcription factor Oct-6 to produce myelin disease pathogenesis in transgenic mice. More than 70% of c<i>-myc/</i>Oct-6 bitransgenic mice, obtained from crosses between phenotypically normal heterozygous mice of various My (c-Myc) and Oc (<i>Oct-6</i>) transgenic strains that express c<i>-myc</i> and <i>oct-6</i> transgenes under transcriptional control of the myelin basic protein gene, developed severe neurological disturbances characterized by action tremors, recurrent seizures, and premature death. Affected bitransgenic mice exhibited multiple hypomyelinated lesions in the white matter that did not stain with myelin-specific antibodies against myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, CNPase, and myelin-associated glycoprotein. The mice also exhibited a larger number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling positive cells in the white matter as well as ultrastructural evidence of glial cell death and astrogliosis. These observations indicate that the myelin lesions observed in the c-<i>myc</i>/<i>oct-6</i>bitransgenic mice result from the untimely programmed cell death of oligodendroglia and that the c<i>-myc</i> and <i>oct-6</i>transgenes act synergistically in producing the lesions."
