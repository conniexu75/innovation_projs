https://openalex.org/W1576238436,"We present, here, evidence that foreign DNA can be specifically delivered to cells by a soluble carrier system that takes advantage of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Our experiments were based on the following concepts: hepatocytes possess a unique receptor that binds and internalizes galactose-terminal (asialo-)glycoproteins; DNA can bind to polycations in a strong but noncovalent manner forming soluble complexes; and the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a bacterial enzyme that acetylates chloramphenicol, is not present in mammalian cells. We coupled asialoorosomucoid (ASOR) to poly-L-lysine to form an asialoorosomucoid-poly-L-lysine conjugate. The plasmid, pSV2 CAT, was complexed to the conjugate in a molar ratio of 1:2. To test this complex, a model system was used consisting of hepatoma cell lines, Hep G2, asialoglycoprotein receptor (+), and SK-Hep 1, receptor (-). Each cell line was incubated with filtered ASOR X poly-L-lysine X DNA complex, or controls consisting of DNA plus ASOR, DNA plus poly-L-lysine, or DNA alone. Cells were assayed for the presence of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity as a measure of gene transformation. SK-Hep 1, receptor (-) cells, produced no detectable acetylated chloramphenicol derivatives under any condition. However, Hep G2, receptor (+) cells, incubated with the ASOR X poly-L-lysine X DNA complex were transformed as indicated by the presence of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (0.028 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase units/10(6) cells). Mixtures of individual components of the complex failed to transform these cells. Competition by a 10-fold excess of ASOR prevented gene transformation by the ASOR X poly-L-lysine X DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1971889217,"Adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by the transcriptional activation of many new genes, including a putative lipid-binding protein termed adipocyte P2 (aP2). The aP2 gene contains a regulatory element (FSE2) 124 bases 5' to its start of transcription. This element binds nuclear factors in sequence-specific and differentiation-dependent fashion as determined by altered mobility in gel retardation assays. Deletion analysis of promoter-linked transfection assays and competition of these constructions in cells with a synthetic FSE2 element suggest that trans-acting factors bind to this region and act as negative regulators of aP2 gene activity in preadipocytes. c-fos appears to participate directly in this nucleoprotein complex, as demonstrated by the ability of antibodies to c-fos to disrupt specific binding of factors to the FSE2 sequence but not to factor-binding sequences from several other genes. Antibodies to c-fos specifically immunoprecipitate protein complexes covalently bound to FSE2 DNA via UV cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W1585338920,"Kinetic and catalytic properties of the DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase HhaI are described. With poly(dG-dC) as substrate, the reaction proceeds by an equilibrium (or processive) ordered Bi-Bi mechanism in which DNA binds to the enzyme first, followed by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). After methyl transfer, S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) dissociates followed by methylated DNA. AdoHcy is a potent competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet (Ki = 2.0 microM) and its generation during reactions results in non-linear kinetics. AdoMet and AdoHcy significantly interact with only the substrate enzyme-DNA complex; they do not bind to free enzyme and bind poorly to the methylated enzyme-DNA complex. In the absence of AdoMet, HhaI methylase catalyzes exchange of the 5-H of substrate cytosines for protons of water at about 7-fold the rate of methylation. The 5-H exchange reaction is inhibited by AdoMet or AdoHcy. In the enzyme-DNA-AdoHcy complex, AdoHcy also suppresses dissociation of DNA and reassociation of the enzyme with other substrate sequences. Our studies reveal that the catalytic mechanism of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases involves attack of the C6 of substrate cytosines by an enzyme nucleophile and formation of a transient covalent adduct. Based on precedents of other enzymes which catalyze similar reactions and the susceptibility of HhaI to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, we propose that the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine residue is the nucleophilic catalyst. Furthermore, we propose that Cys-81 is the active-site catalyst in HhaI. This residue is found in a Pro-Cys doublet which is conserved in all DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases whose sequences have been determined to date and is found in related enzymes. Finally, we discuss the possibility that covalent adducts between C6 of pyrimidines and nucleophiles of proteins may be important general components of protein-nucleic acid interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2156602181,"The direct identification of the intracellular site where proinsulin is proteolytically processed into insulin has been achieved by immunocytochemistry using an insulin-specific monoclonal antibody. Insulin immunoreactivity is absent from the Golgi stack of pancreatic B-cells and first becomes detectable in clathrin-coated secretory vesicles released from the trans Golgi pole. Clathrin-coated secretory vesicles transform into mature noncoated secretory granules which contain the highest concentration of insulin immunoreactive sites. Maturation of clathrin-coated secretory vesicles is accompanied by a progressive acidification of the vesicular milieu, as evidenced by a cytochemical probe that accumulates in acidic compartments whereupon it can be revealed by immunocytochemistry. Thus packaging of the prohormone in secretory vesicles, and acidification of this compartment, are critical steps in the proper proteolytic maturation of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2127667224,"The expression of gene CPA1, encoding the glutaminase subunit of the arginine pathway carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, is repressed by arginine at a posttranscriptional level. The 5' region of CPA1 mRNA contains a 25 codon upstream open reading frame. The importance of this feature for the repression of CPA1 expression has been analyzed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and by sequencing of constitutive cis-dominant mutations obtained in vivo. The results show that the leader peptide, the product of the upstream open reading frame, plays an essential, negative role in the specific repression of CPA1 by arginine. A model of translational regulation of CPA1 is proposed that takes into account the cis-dominance of the mutations affecting the leader peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1599670156,"The concentration of intracellular free ([Ca2+]i) was measured in dissociated bovine parathyroid cells using the fluorescent indicator quin-2 or fura-2. Small increases in the concentration of extracellular produced relatively slow, monophasic increases in [Ca2+]i in quin-2-loaded cells, but rapid and transient increases followed by lower, yet sustained (steady-state), [Ca2+]i increases in fura-2-loaded cells. The different patterns of change in [Ca2+]i reported by quin-2 and fura-2 appear to result from the greater intracellular Ca2+-buffering capacity present within quin-2-loaded cells, which tends to damp rapid and transient changes in [Ca2+]i. In fura-2-loaded parathyroid cells, other divalent cations (Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) also evoked transient increases in [Ca2+]i, and their competitive interactions suggest that they all affect transients by acting on a common site. In contrast, divalent cations failed to cause increases in steady-state levels of cytosolic Ca2+. Low concentrations of La3+ (0.5-10 microM) depressed steady-state levels of cytosolic elicited by extracellular but were without effect on transient increases in [Ca2+]i elicited by extracellular Ca2+, Mg2+ or Sr2+, suggesting that increases in the steady-state [Ca2+]i arise from the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Mg2+- and Sr2+-induced cytosolic transients persisted in the absence of extracellular but were abolished by pretreatment with ionomycin. These results show that cytosolic transients arise from the mobilization of cellular from a nonmitochondrial pool. Extracellular divalent cations thus appear to act at some site on the surface of the cell, and this site can be considered a Ca2+ receptor which enables the parathyroid cell to detect small changes in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1491181982,"Protein kinase C (Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) has been purified from rat brain by a three-step, 18-h procedure resulting in the isolation of milligram quantities of enzyme. Unlike previous preparations from published protocols, which yield a single polypeptide, this procedure yields a protein which consists of a 78/80-kDa doublet upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The two polypeptides have been characterized with respect to structure and function and are very similar in both regards. However, the two forms can be distinguished immunologically by polyclonal antisera generated against purified protein kinase C. The 78- and 80-kDa proteins do not appear to be related to one another by proteolytic cleavage or by differential phosphorylation, although the two purified proteins do contain stoichiometric amounts of phosphate. The 78- and 80-kDa polypeptides therefore appear to represent two distinct forms of protein kinase C, thus providing evidence for the existence of multiple isozymes of this key regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1494255360,"Acetylcholinesterase extracted with Triton X-100 from bovine brain caudate nuclei was purified by affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme was labeled with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate at the active sites and with the photoactivated reagent 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine, a compound which has been shown to be selective for the hydrophobic membrane-binding domains of several other proteins. The subunit structure was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate before and after disulfide reduction. After reduction, a single 3H-labeled band at 70 kDa was stained by silver, but most of the 125I label corresponded to a 20-kDa species. Prior to reduction, five 3H-labeled and silver-stained bands were apparent at 70, 140, 160, 260, and greater than 360 kDa. These species were presumed to represent monomer and disulfide-linked oligomers of 70-kDa catalytic subunits. 125I label was selectively associated with the 160-, 260-, greater than 360-, and a 90-kDa species. Quantitative gel slicing of 3H- and 125I-labeled nonreduced enzyme supported a structural model in which the tetrameric enzyme is a dimer of nonidentical catalytic subunit dimers, one of which involves a direct intersubunit disulfide linkage between two 70-kDa catalytic subunit monomers and the second of which contains two disulfide linkages through an intervening 125I-labeled 20-kDa noncatalytic subunit. This 20-kDa subunit is proposed to contain the membrane attachment site. The brain enzyme did not contain components characteristic of the glycolipid anchors of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterases. However, part of the 125I label was associated with fatty acids, indicating that at least a portion of the brain enzyme membrane anchor is composed of nonamino acid components."
https://openalex.org/W1560584977,"The cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3) of the human erythrocyte membrane is a good substrate of endogenous and exogenous protein-tyrosine kinases. Because one site of tyrosine phosphorylation is within the glycolytic enzyme/hemoglobin-binding region at the N terminus of the polypeptide, we have investigated whether tyrosine phosphorylation of cdb3 might influence its interaction with the above peripheral proteins. Using p40, a protein-tyrosine kinase isolated from bovine thymus, we demonstrate that aldolase binding to cdb3 linked to Affi-Gel 15 is significantly inhibited by phosphorylation of the immobilized band 3. Importantly, upon dephosphorylation of the gel with acid phosphatase, aldolase binding returns to prephosphorylated values. Similarly, cdb3 phosphorylation was found to inhibit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, and hemoglobin binding to immobilized cdb3. In the converse experiment, untreated soluble cdb3 was shown to bind to immobilized aldolase, whereas phosphorylated cdb3 (approximately equal to 1.8 mol of Pi/mol of cdb3) did not. Furthermore, phosphorylated cdb3 was unable to inhibit aldolase catalysis, whereas untreated cdb3, as shown previously by others, was a potent inhibitor. Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of cdb3 on tyrosine residues inhibits peripheral protein binding at the polypeptide's N terminus. In view of the known effect of glycolytic enzyme binding to band 3 on catalytic activity, tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 may modulate glycolysis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1583928970,"We have previously isolated and characterized cloned complementary DNAs (cDNAs) for striated and smooth muscle alpha-tropomyosin. The sequences of these cDNA clones suggested that these two isoforms were encoded by the same gene. Here, we have determined the complete structure of the alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-TM) gene, establishing that a single gene, with a sequence complexity of 28 kilobase pairs, is split into 12 exons and produces the smooth and striated muscle alpha-TM mRNA isoforms by alternative splicing of a minimum of five exchangeable isotype-specific exons. The elucidation of the intron/exon organization of alpha-TM suggests that this gene evolved from an ancestral gene encoding a 21-aa protein that might represent the primordial actin binding domain. Sequence comparison between the pairs of exons coding for the isotype switch and among the corresponding regions of tropomyosin genes in a variety of species ranging from insects to mammals, suggests that the alternatively spliced exons are very old and might have arisen before the radiation of the arthropods, more than 600 million years ago. Additionally, the examination of the intronic sequences has uncovered potential alternative intramolecular secondary structures (hairpin-loop structures) which might be involved in the tissue-specific expression of the duplicated and mutually exclusive alpha-TM isotype-specific exons."
https://openalex.org/W1554226168,"Abstract Bovine retinal rod outer segments (ROS) support the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into rhodopsin. [14C] Palmitoyl-CoA serves as the donor with an apparent Km of 40 microM. Solubilization of ROS in the detergent, Emulphogene, results in increased incorporation of label into rhodopsin. A further increase is found when ConA-Sepharose-purified rhodopsin is used as the source of both and acceptor. Failure to separate enzyme from acceptor suggested the possibility of a nonenzymatic reaction. This was confirmed when boiled rhodopsin was found to support the reaction. However, the acylation of rhodopsin is not an artifact since analysis of purified native rhodopsin reveals the presence of covalently bound palmitate and we showed that whole bovine retinas incubated with [3H] palmitate incorporated the fatty acid into rhodopsin (O'Brien, P.J., and Zatz, M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5054-5057). Furthermore, in vivo experiments with rat retinas have revealed that opsin is acylated both in the rod inner and outer segments (St. Jules, R. S., and O'Brien, P.J. (1986) Exp. Eye Res. 43, 929-940). Incubation of labeled rhodopsin with mercaptoethanol resulted in release of the labeled palmitate indicating the presence of a thioester bond. This also illustrates the ease with which a thioester, such as palmitoyl cysteine or palmitoyl-CoA, can transfer the fatty acyl group to a free thiol, such as cysteine or mercaptoethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1482087249,"Abstract The cadmium-binding properties of rabbit liver Zn7-metallothionein (MT) 2 and apo-MT, rat liver apo-alpha MT and Zn4-alpha MT, and calf liver apo-beta MT, have been studied using circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies. Both sets of spectra recorded during the titration of Zn7-MT 2 with Cd2+ exhibit a complicated pattern that is quite unexpected. Such behavior is not found at all in sets of spectra recorded during titrations of the apo-species (apo-MT, apo-alpha MT, and apo-beta MT), and is observed to a much lesser extent in the titration of Zn-alpha MT. Comparison between the band centers of the Cd-alpha MT and Cd-beta MT indicates that the CD spectrum of Cd7-MT is dominated by intensity from transitions that originate on Cd-S chromophores in the alpha domain, with little direct contribution from the beta domain. Analysis of the spectra recorded during titrations of Zn7-MT 2 with Cd2+ suggests: (i) that Cd2+ replaces Zn2+ in Zn7-MT isomorphously; (ii) that cadmium binds in a nonspecific, distributed manner across both domains; (iii) that cluster formation in the alpha domain only occurs after 4 mol eq of cadmium have been added and is indicated by the presence of a cluster-sensitive, CD spectral feature; (iv) that the characteristic derivative CD spectrum of native Cd4,Zn3-MT is only obtained from Cd4,Zn3-MT following a treatment cycle that allows the redistribution of cadmium into the alpha domain; warming the synthetic native, Cd4,Zn3-MT, to 65 degrees C results in cadmium being preferentially bound in the alpha domain; and (v) Zn7-MT will bind Cd2+ quite normally at up to 65 degrees C but with greater specificity for the alpha domain compared with titrations carried out at 25 degrees C. These results suggest that the initial presence of zinc in both domains is an important factor in the lack of any domain specificity during cadmium binding to Zn-MT which contrasts the domain specific manner observed for cadmium binding to apo-MT."
https://openalex.org/W1546795848,"Carbachol-evoked rises in [Ca2+]i were measured in fura-2-loaded, rat parotid acinar cells. In suspensions of dissociated cells examined by dual wavelength excitation fluorimetry, a maximally effective concentration of carbachol produced a measured peak [Ca2+]i of 780 +/- 60 nM followed by a maintained elevation in the presence of 1 mM external Ca2+, and a peak of 630 +/- 95 nM followed by a return to resting values in the absence of external Ca2+. Stopped-flow, single wavelength fluorimetry was used to resolve the rising phase of the response. There was a dose-dependent lag of 70-220 ms before [Ca2+]i started to increase, and [Ca2+]i was maximal by 800-900 ms. These times were similar in the presence or absence of external Ca2+, although the initial rate of rise was faster in the presence of external Ca2+. These kinetics are consistent with a biochemical event, possibly phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis, mediating both internal release and Ca2+ entry, with a component of the initial rise being due to Ca2+ entry."
https://openalex.org/W1501383298,"The metabolism of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and r-protein mRNAs was examined during mouse myoblast differentiation to identify the levels at which r-protein accumulation is regulated. Pulse-chase analyses of r-proteins in myoblasts and fibers indicate that the synthesis of r-proteins is coordinately reduced 2.0-fold following myoblast differentiation and that newly synthesized r-proteins do not turnover. This decreased synthesis of r-proteins in fibers is due to both a reduction in the steady-state levels of r-protein mRNAs and a decrease in the translational efficiency of r-protein mRNAs. Northern analyses of r-protein mRNA indicate that the steady-state levels of r-protein mRNAs S16, L18, and L32 are decreased 1.5-2.0-fold in fibers as compared to myoblasts. Analyses of the distribution of r-protein mRNAs in polysome gradients indicate that their translational efficiencies are reduced 1.3-1.6-fold in fibers as compared to myoblasts. To determine if the decrease in the steady-state levels of r-protein mRNAs is regulated at the level of transcription, the transcription of these genes was measured in isolated nuclei. These experiments show that the transcription of these r-protein genes is reduced 2-6-fold following myoblast differentiation. Thus, the production of r-proteins is regulated both at the level of transcription and translation during mouse myoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1519416077,"SII was purified from calf thymus tissue to apparent homogeneity by a rapid procedure. The 38-kDa protein stimulated RNA synthesis by purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II 4-fold. The calf thymus SII had similar chromatographic properties and molecular size and cross-reacted immunologically with antibodies to mouse SII (Sekimizu, K., Nakanishi, Y., Mizuno, D., and Natori, S. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 1582-1588). We have substituted the purified calf thymus SII for the partially purified HeLa transcription factor IIS fraction in a HeLa (human) transcription system reconstituted with purified factors and RNA polymerase II. The purified protein stimulated specific transcription from the adenovirus 2 major late promoter by increasing the efficiency of the elongation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1544219582,"A conserved actin-binding domain (Mr = 27,000) of rat hepatic actinogelin, rat skeletal muscle, and chicken gizzard alpha-actinins (Mimura, N., and Asano, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10680-10687) was separated into two components having different isoelectric points (peptides A and B) by chromatofocusing. Thermolysin digestion of peptide A generated peptide B with concomitant loss of peptide A. Amino acid compositions and tryptic maps of peptides A and B also demonstrated that peptide A is a precursor of peptide B upon thermolysin digestion. All of peptides A and B retained the activity to bind with F-actin competitively to each other. By the gel-filtration method, it was also shown that the native actin-binding 27-kDa fragments are monomeric and globular. The non-actin-binding 50- or 53.5-kDa fragment of actinogelin/alpha-actinins was, however, found to be asymmetric and dimeric in the native state. Chemical cross-linking of the 27-kDa fragment with F-actin with a water-soluble carbodiimide produced at least four different complexes (I-IV). Chemical cleaving analysis of the cross-linked products (complexes I and II) indicated that the 27-kDa fragment possesses two possible binding sites on actin at the NH2-terminal residues 1-12 (for complex I) and at residues spanning 86-119 or 123 (for complex II)."
https://openalex.org/W1557919997,"Hybridoma cells which synthesize monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that block ricin toxicity were 50-300-fold resistant to ricin compared with other hybridomas. Two of the mAb blocked two isozymes of ricin, D and E, to different and opposite extents, and the hybridoma cell resistance to the two forms of ricin closely corresponded with the mAb reactivity. The hybridoma cell resistance to ricin was therefore due to the binding activity of the mAb produced by the cells. Neither rabbit polyclonal antibodies, which neutralized extracellular anti-ricin mAb, nor quantitative removal of hybridoma cell surface IgG with papain affected the cellular resistance to ricin. Therefore, neither extracellular or cell surface antibodies contributed to the resistance of the hybridoma cells. In contrast, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide or puromycin, which selectively decreased levels of intracellular secretory IgG, decreased the hybridoma cell resistance to ricin. We conclude that intracellular mAb, synthesized de novo for subsequent secretion, block ricin toxicity. Ricin therefore must meet intracellular secretory antibodies before reaching the cytosol. The monoclonal antibodies can also be used to study toxin function within intracellular compartments. An antibody specific for the galactose-binding site of ricin blocks ricin intracellularly, showing that the ricin galactose-binding activity is required in an intracellular compartment for transport of ricin A chain to the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1520079972,"Abstract The role of plasma membrane Cl(-)-HCO-3-exchange in regulating intracellular pH (pHi) was examined in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers. In cells bathed in 25 mM HCO-3, pH 7.4, steady state pHi was 7.10 +/- 0.03 (n = 14) measured with the fluorescent pH probe 2',7'-biscarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Following acute alkaline loading, pHi recovered exponentially in approximately 4 min. The recovery rate was significantly decreased by Cl- or HCO-3 removal and in the presence of 50 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic stilbene (DIDS). Na+ removal or 10(-3) M amiloride did not inhibit the pHi recovery rate after an acute alkaline load. Following acute intracellular acidification, the pHi recovery rate was significantly inhibited by 10(-3) M amiloride but was not altered by Cl- removal or 50 microM DIDS. At an extracellular pH (pHo) of 7.4, pHi remained unchanged when the cells were bathed in either Cl- free media, HCO-3 free media, or in the presence of 50 microM DIDS. As pHo was increased to 8.0, steady state pHi was significantly greater than control in Cl(-)-free media and in the presence of 50 microM DIDS. It is concluded that Madin-Darby canine kidney cells possess a Na+-independent Cl(-)-HCO-3 exchanger with a Km for external Cl- of approximately 6 mM. The exchanger plays an important role in pHi regulation following an elevation of pHi above approximately 7.1. Recovery of pHi following intracellular acidification is mediated by the Na+/H+ antiporter and not the anion exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1547838161,"The presence of at least two types of conformers in the ferrous CO complex of horseradish peroxidase has been demonstrated with the use of native and deuteroheme-substituted enzymes. Type I conformers, predominant in acidic pH, exhibited both an Fe-CO stretching and an Fe-C-O bending Raman line together with an infrared C-O stretch band below 1920 em-1. On the other hand, type II conformers, dominant species in alkaline pH, showed only an Fe-CO stretching Raman line with the C-O stretch above 1930 cm-1. They were interconvertible either by the changes in pH or by the binding of benzhydroxamate, a substrate for the enzyme. The pKa value for the pH-dependent interconversion of CO complex of deuteroheme-substituted enzyme was 8.3. These findings were interpreted to mean that the bound CO molecule in type I conformers was more tilted over the heme-plane than that in type II conformers. A steric hindrance by the bound substrate or the protonated form of a distal amino acid residue, presumably of histidine, is considered to be the cause for the isomerization. By summarizing present and previous data on the vibrational frequencies of heme-carbonyl complexes, we found that there are inverse-linear relationships between the square of Fe-CO and that of C-O stretching frequencies, while squares of Fe-CO stretching and Fe-C-O bending frequencies were linearly correlated with each other. Also found is that the dissociation rate constant of CO molecule from heme-carbonyl complexes is a linear function of the Fe-CO stretching frequency. The significance of these results is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1480695022,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) extracted from nine strains of Coxiella burnetii were analyzed for chemical compositions, molecular heterogeneity by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and lethal toxicities in galactosamine-sensitized mice. The structure of a unique disaccharide of hydrolyzed phase I LPS was determined to be galactosaminuronyl-alpha (1-6)-glucosamine (GalNU-alpha (1-6)-GlcN, C12H22N2O10) with an Mr of 354. The Mr of LPSs of C. burnetii intra- and interspecific strains and the content of GalNU-alpha (1-6)-GlcN and two sugars, virenose and dihydrohydroxystreptose, were used as biochemical markers of truncated LPSs. Smooth-phase I LPS contained all three compounds, semi-rough-phase I LPS did not contain virenose, and rough-phase II LPS contained none of the three compounds. These analyses indicate that the intermediate to larger Mr LPSs require the addition of GalNU-alpha (1-6)-GlcN and dihydrohydroxystreptose to obtain the major (10.5 kDa), the intermediate (between 10.5 and 27 kDa), and the minor (23 kDa) LPS bands. The addition of virenose to the major and the minor bands produced the large Mr phase I LPSs. Extreme microheterogeneity in the banding profile ranging in Mr from the 2.5 to 10.5 kDa may be due to unidentified components, while the microheterogeneity in Mr of the 10.5-kDa and larger LPS bands is related to variations in the compounds described here. All of the LPSs were toxic in galactosamine-sensitized mice, albeit they were 100-1000-fold less toxic than Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium endotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1521174262,"The human apolipoprotein C-II gene was sequenced and found to contain four exons and three introns, with a major transcription initiation site located 26 base pairs downstream from a TATA sequence element. The third intron was found to be composed almost entirely of a novel 37-base pair minisatellite that is repeated six times. The minisatellite sequence was found to be present in approximately 60 different genomic locations. The minisatellite DNA sequence at three of these loci were compared and found to be highly conserved. In situ hybridization indicated that the minisatellite loci were clustered in the q13.3 band of chromosome 19. This is the first example of a chromosome- and band-specific repetitive element in the mammalian genome."
https://openalex.org/W1607049526,"The ciliated protozoan Paramecium tetraurelia contained two protein kinase activities that were dependent on Ca2+. We purified one of the enzymes to homogeneity by Ca2+-dependent affinity chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and ion exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme contained polypeptides of 50 and 55 kDa, with the 50-kDa species predominant. From its Stokes radius (32 A) and sedimentation coefficient (3.9 S), we calculated a native molecular weight of 51,000, suggesting that the active form is a monomer. Its specific activity was 65-130 nmol X min-1 X mg-1 and the Km for ATP was 17-35 microM, depending on the exogenous substrate used. Kinase activity was completely dependent upon Ca2+; half-maximal activation occurred at approximately 1 microM free Ca2+ at pH 7.2. Phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol did not stimulate activity, nor did the addition of purified Paramecium calmodulin. The enzyme phosphorylated casein and histones, forming primarily phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, respectively. It also catalyzed its own phosphorylation in a Ca2+-dependent reaction; the half-maximal rate of autophosphorylation occurred at approximately 1-1.5 microM free Ca2+, and both the 50- and 55-kDa species were autophosphorylated. After separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and renaturation in situ, the 50-kDa protein retained its Ca2+-dependent ability to phosphorylate casein, suggesting that Ca2+ interacts directly with this polypeptide. This was confirmed by direct binding studies; when the enzyme was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transferred to nitrocellulose, and renatured, there was 45Ca2+-binding in situ to both the 50- and 55-kDa polypeptides. The Paramecium enzyme appears to be a new and unique type of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1496037432,"Infusion of the thromboxane A2 analogue U-46619 into isolated perfused rat livers resulted in dose-dependent increases in glucose output and portal vein pressure, indicative of constriction of the hepatic vasculature. At low concentrations, e.g. less than or equal to 42 ng/ml, glucose output occurred only during agonist infusion; whereas at concentrations greater than or equal to 63 ng/ml, a peak of glucose output also was observed upon termination of agonist infusion coincident with relief of hepatic vasoconstriction. Effluent perfusate lactate/pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratios increased significantly in response to U-46619 infusion. Hepatic oxygen consumption increased at low U-46619 concentrations (less than or equal to 20 ng/ml) and became biphasic with a transient spike of increased consumption followed by a prolonged decrease in consumption at higher concentrations. Increased glucose output in response to 42 ng/ml U-46619 was associated with a rapid activation of glycogen phosphorylase, slight increases in tissue ADP levels, and no increase in cAMP. At 1000 ng/ml, U-46619 activation of glycogen phosphorylase was accompanied by significant increases in tissue levels of AMP and ADP, decreases in ATP, and slight increases in cAMP. In isolated hepatocytes, U-46619 did not stimulate glucose output or activate glycogen phosphorylase. Reducing the perfusate calcium concentration from 1.25 to 0.05 mM resulted in a marked reduction of the glycogenolytic response to U-46619 (42 ng/ml) with no efflux of calcium from the liver. U-46619-induced glucose output and vasoconstriction displayed a similar dose dependence upon the perfusate calcium concentration. Thus, U-46619 exerts a potent agonist effect on glycogenolysis and vasoconstriction in the perfused rat liver. The present findings support the concept that U-46619 stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis indirectly via vasoconstriction-induced hypoxia within the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1590049308,"Using the fluorescent Ca2+ selective chelator Quin2 to induce and measure the dissociation of Ca2+ from actin, we have recently found that actin binds Ca2+ and Mg2+ much more tightly than previously thought (Gershman, L.C., Selden, L.A., and Estes, J.E. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 135, 607-614). In this report, we show that the kinetics of dissociation of Ca2+ from Ca-actin and Mg2+ from Mg-actin closely parallel the fluorescence changes in 1,5-I-N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (AEDANS)-actin, suggesting that the 1,5-I-AEDANS-actin fluorescence directly reflects slow first-order cation exchange rather than a slow Mg2+-induced isomerization as originally proposed by Frieden (Frieden, C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2882-2886). Measuring divalent cation exchange directly, we have determined the dissociation rate constants for Ca2+ (k-Ca) and Mg2+ (k-Mg), the equilibrium dissociation constants for Ca2+ (KCa), and the ratio of cation binding affinities, KMg/Kca, to actin over the pH range 7-8. We have found that k-Ca is 5-10 times greater than k-Mg and KMg is about 4 times greater than KCa. From the data we calculate the association rate constants for Ca2+ (kCa) and Mg2+ (kMg) to be about 7 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 and 2 X 10(5) M-1 s-1, respectively. kCa appears to be diffusion-limited, but kMg is significantly smaller due to the characteristics of the Mg2+ aquo ion. These findings are consistent with a simple first-order binding model for the tight binding of divalent cations to actin."
https://openalex.org/W1571706159,"Abstract The colchicine analog 2-methoxy-5-(2',3',4'-trimethoxyphenol) tropone (AC) was used as a fluorescent probe to study the binding kinetics of podophyllotoxin at high concentrations. The observed pseudo-first order rate constant showed a linear concentration dependence up to 1 mM. The bimolecular rate constant (195 M-1 s-1 at 15 degrees C) and the activation energy (57 kJ/mol) correspond perfectly with those previously determined in the submicromolar range (Cortese, F., Bhattacharyya, B., and Wolf, J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1134-1140). Displacement kinetics of bound AC by podophyllotoxin, allow the determination of the dissociation rate constants for AC. By studying the temperature dependence, and combining with the binding rate constants previously determined (Engelborghs, Y., and Fitzgerald, T.J. (1986) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 466, 709-717) a full characterization of the kinetic pathway is possible. This is shown to differ considerably from the pathway of colchicine binding."
https://openalex.org/W1586066926,"Although the most prominent acute and chronic effect of alcohol ingestion in man is alteration of brain function, metabolism of ethanol by human brain has not been documented. This study was designed to detect and localize a new family of nonoxidative ethanol metabolites, fatty acid ethyl esters, in human brain and characterize their synthetic pathways. Fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity was present in 10 different locations in human brain, with gray matter containing more activity than white matter (0.53 nmol of ethyl oleate/mg of protein/h and 0.25 nmol of ethyl oleate/mg of protein/h, respectively). Two forms of this synthase, present in cytosol or loosely bound to membrane fractions, were isolated from human gray and white matter and then partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Both were active at low ethanol concentrations easily attained in vivo in man. Importantly, fatty acid ethyl esters were also detected in brains of individuals dying while intoxicated; only small amounts were present in control subjects at autopsy. Thus, alcohol metabolism in human brain has been documented for the first time by identifying both fatty acid ethyl esters and their synthases in this important target-organ of alcohol abuse."
https://openalex.org/W2171327897,"Regulation by reversible, covalent modification of proteins requires a continuous expenditure of energy, even in a steady-state situation. The cost of this energy drain is evaluated for the case of an effector controlling the modifying enzyme and an effector controlling the demodifying enzyme and for the case of dual control in which an effector activates one of these enzymes and inhibits the other. Energy consumption is determined when the converter enzymes are functioning in the first-order and zero-order domains. The profile of energy expenditure versus fractional protein modification at steady state varies both as a function of the mechanism of control of the converter enzymes and of the kinetic domain in which they operate. This theory allows one to predict the strategies that would minimize energy costs. Dual control appears to provide maximum sensitivity with minimal energy expenditure. The analysis is applied to two experimental systems. Comparison of ATP turnover rates with rates for individual modification enzymes in living systems shows that a significant fraction of the total energy expenditure of an organism is required for the large number of reactions which involve covalent modification of proteins. It is concluded that there will be selection pressure for energy-efficient control of covalent regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1499861477,"Previous studies have shown that the majority of the asparagine-linked high mannose oligosaccharide units present on the lysosomal enzymes of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum contain mannose 6-sulfate and mannose 6-phosphate residues, the latter being diesterified to methyl groups. Using a variety of techniques, including NMR spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, we have found that many of these oligosaccharides also contain an N-acetylglucosamine residue linked beta 1-4 to the mannose residue linked alpha 1-6 to the beta-linked core mannose. (Formula: see text) As far as we are aware, this is the first description of an intersecting N-acetylglucosamine residue in this position on a high mannose oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W2125446510,"Abstract Eubacterium species V.P.I. 12708 has inducible bile acid 7-dehydroxylase activity that can use either 7 alpha or 7 beta bile acids as substrates. Cell extracts prepared from bacteria grown in the presence of cholic acid catalyzed the rapid conversion of free bile acids into a highly polar bile acid metabolite (HPBA). This conjugation activity co-eluted with bile acid 7-dehydroxylase activity on high performance gel filtration chromatography (GFC). The HPBA was purified by a combination of high performance GFC and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The intact HPBA eluted earlier from reverse-phase HPLC than deoxycholyl-CoA and had a Mr of 1102 by Bio-Gel P-2 (GFC). The HPBA had an absorption peak at 255 nm and was sensitive to treatment with phosphodiesterase I or nucleotide pyrophosphatase. The HPBA has a free phosphate as shown by an increase in elution volume on reverse-phase HPLC following treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Treatment of the purified HPBA with nucleotide pyrophosphate plus alkaline phosphatase yielded adenosine, whereas, treatment with nucleotide pyrophosphatase alone generated 5',3'-ADP. A bile acid metabolite was also generated by nucleotide pyrophosphatase treatment. The bile acid metabolite had different chromatographic properties (HPLC and TLC) than the corresponding free bile acid. Gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed the bile acid metabolite to be 12 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid. We hypothesize that the HPBA is an intermediate in 7-dehydroxylation and consists of this compound linked at the C-24 with an anhydride bond to the beta phosphate (5') of ADP-3'-phosphate. These results suggest a novel mechanism of bile acid 7 alpha/7 beta-dehydroxylation in Eubacterium sp. V.P.I. 12708."
https://openalex.org/W1549010012,"We have isolated and sequenced a full-length cDNA cloned tentatively identified as encoding Xenopus laevis serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) mRNA. The derived amino acid sequence of the Xenopus protein is 63% homologous to the sequence of the human RBP. 17 of 19 amino acids identified as critical in the retinol-binding pocket of human RBP are identical or conservative replacements in the Xenopus protein. The RBP cDNA clone has been used as a hybridization probe to demonstrate that administration of estradiol-17 beta to male X. laevis induces hepatic RBP mRNA 10-fold from its constitutive in vivo level of 1,800 molecules/cell to approximately 18,000 molecules/cell. Using a simplified method for determining relative rates of gene transcription, we demonstrate an estrogen-mediated increase in the rate of RBP gene transcription. These quantitative data provide the first demonstration that a steroid hormone regulates the levels of vertebrate retinol-binding protein mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1607810343,"It was previously shown that reductive alkali treatment of purified human cervical mucin releases a heterogeneous population of reduced neutral, sialylated, and sulfated oligosaccharides (Yurewicz, E. C., and Moghissi, K. S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11895-11904). Four major sialylated oligosaccharide fractions were isolated with approximate compositions of Fuc:GlcNac:Gal:NeuAc:N-acetylgalactosaminitol (GalNAcol) = 0:0:0:1:1 (B1a), 0:0:1:1:1 (B2b), 0:1:2:1:1 (B3a), and 1:1:2:1:1 (B4a), where Fuc is fucose. They comprised roughly 3, 11, 7, and 6% of recovered oligosaccharide chains, respectively. On the basis of periodate oxidations, methylation analyses, and sequential degradations with glycosidases, the following structures were determined. (Formula: see text) Oligosaccharides 1 and 2 are characterized by the presence of N-acetylneuraminic acid in alpha 2,6-linkage to N-acetylgalactosaminitol. The remaining oligosaccharides contain N-acetylneuraminic acid in alpha 2,3-linkage to galactose residues. Oligosaccharides 3 and 4 and oligosaccharides 5 and 6 were isolated as unresolved isomeric mixtures in fractions B3a and B4a, respectively. Oligosaccharides 3 and 4 were distinguished on the basis of susceptibility to digestion with Aspergillus niger beta-galactosidase whereas oligosaccharides 5 and 6 were distinguished on the basis of differential rates of digestion with beef kidney alpha-fucosidase. The structural data indicate the presence of at least two sialyltransferases in human cervical epithelium and further suggest a potential physiologically significant competition between sialyltransferase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase for C-6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine residue O-glycosidically linked to serine/threonine of the polypeptide core."
https://openalex.org/W2142587735,"Conjugation of xenobiotics with glutathione occurs commonly within the liver, and these glutathione conjugates are then preferentially excreted into bile. We have characterized this excretory process using primary cultured hepatocytes (24 h). 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene rapidly entered the cells and formed a glutathione conjugate, S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione, irrespective of the temperature of incubation. In contrast, the efflux of the glutathione conjugate was essentially absent in the cold but recovered rapidly upon rewarming of the cells. Therefore, initial rates of efflux of the conjugate at 37 degrees C were measured from cells preloaded biosynthetically at 10 degrees C. Efflux was a saturable process with respect to intracellular S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione with an apparent Km of 0.58 +/- 0.12 mM and Vmax of 0.15 +/- 0.05 nmol/min/mg of protein. The excretion of S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione had an energy of activation of 15.3 kcal/mol. The glutathione conjugate of p-nitrobenzylchloride when formed within the hepatocytes acted as a competitive inhibitor of S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione efflux. Cultured hepatocytes, therefore, appeared to have a specific transport process for the excretion of glutathione conjugates. The addition of S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione, but not GSH, GSSG, or methionine, to the medium caused a decrease in the rate of efflux of radiolabeled S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione. The hepatocytes were able, however, to excrete the glutathione conjugate against an excess of extracellular S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione. This observation suggested that extracellular S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione, although capable of binding to the carrier, entered the hepatocytes quite slowly relative to rates of efflux. This carrier may function in a manner that would minimize the reuptake by hepatocytes of conjugates that have been excreted into the bile."
https://openalex.org/W1551120409,"We have probed the acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) molecule with six anti-AcChR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) whose binding to the AcChR is inhibited or blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha BgTx). mAbs bound with a maximum stoichiometry of either one mAb (387D, 247G) or two mAbs (383C, 572C, 370C, 249E) per AcChR monomer, and the extent to which they inhibited alpha BgTx binding directly correlated with their stoichiometry of binding. The effect of mAbs on the alpha BgTx and cholinergic ligand binding properties of the AcChR molecule defined three major categories of mAbs: those that block alpha BgTx and carbamylcholine (agonist) binding, but do not block d-tubocurarine (antagonist) binding (383C, 572C, 370C and 249E); mAb 387D, which blocks agonist binding and partially blocks alpha BgTx and d-tubocurarine binding; and mAb 247G, which does not affect agonist binding, blocks at most 50% of the alpha BgTx binding sites, and decreases the affinity of the high affinity component of d-tubocurarine binding (Mihovilovic, M., and Richman, D. P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15051-15059). Except for mAb 247G, these mAbs strongly competed with each other for binding to the AcChR. In contrast, mAb 247G blocks about 50% of the binding of all the other mAbs. The results demonstrate the ability of mAbs to stabilize different conformational states of the AcChR and to probe cholinergic epitopes of functional importance. They also indicate the nonequivalence of the two alpha-toxin binding regions of the AcChR molecule and suggest that it is possible to identify epitopes within the alpha BgTx binding region that when bound produce differential effects on the binding of the agonist (carbamylcholine) and the antagonist (d-tubocurarine)."
https://openalex.org/W1577672866,"Abstract Using sucrose density gradient centrifugation in a vertical rotor, we have separated three major binding components contained in hepatic cytosols from C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Using this preparative method we have obtained, after a 3-h run of 2.4 ml of crude cytosol from 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichlorodipyridyloxy)]benzene-treated C57BL/6 mice (approximately 50 mg of protein: 10,000 fmol of Ah receptor) 50 and 75% yields of isolated Ah receptor and carcinogen-binding protein (4 S binding protein), respectively. Both binding components may be kept at -70 degrees C for several months without loss of activity. A third binding component, which did not sediment in a sucrose density gradient (5-20%), even after a 4-h run at 63,000 rpm, was recovered from the top fractions of gradients. When applied to Sephacryl S-300 columns this component was eluted in the void fraction. Resistant to the direct degradative action of nucleases and proteases, this large complex was sequentially converted to its subcomponents by lipoprotein-lipase, proteinase K, and phospholipases. Only the phospholipases are able to abolish the binding capacity of this light density component (LDC) for [3H]2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin: hence, we conclude that phospholipids are the true binders of this radioligand. In vitro, this lipoprotein irreversibly binds many hydrophobic radioligands (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin,3-methylcholanthrene, benzo(a)pyrene, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, and dexamethasone). Using single vertical spin density gradient ultracentrifugation, the major part (80%) of LDC was characterized as a very low-density lipoprotein, and a minor part (20%) as a low-density lipoprotein. This conclusion was supported by the size of LDC particles (about 25-75 nm) observed in electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1671167872,"The interaction between pure transhydrogenase and ATPase (Complex V) from beef heart mitochondria was investigated with transhydrogenase-ATPase vesicles in which the two proteins were co-reconstituted by dialysis or dilution procedures. In addition to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, reconstitution required phosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylcholine. Transhydrogenase-ATPase vesicles catalyzed a 20-30-fold stimulation of the reduction of NADP+ or thio-NADP+ by NADH and a 70-fold shift of the apparent equilibrium expressed as the nicotinamide nucleotide ratio [NADPH][NAD+]/[NADP+][NADH]. In both of these respects, the transhydrogenase-ATPase vesicles were severalfold more efficient than beef heart submitochondrial particles. By measuring the ATP-driven transhydrogenase and the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activities simultaneously and under the same conditions at low ATP concentrations, i.e. below 15 microM, the ATP-driven transhydrogenase/oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity ratio was found to be about 3. This value is consistent with the stoichiometries of three protons translocated per ATP hydrolyzed and one proton translocated per NADPH formed and with a mechanism where the two enzymes interact through a delocalized proton-motive force."
https://openalex.org/W1634139167,"To investigate the mechanism of allosteric switching in human hemoglobin, we have studied the dissociation of the ligand (CO) from several intermediate ligation states by a stopped-flow kinetic technique that utilizes competitive binding of CO by microperoxidase. The hemoglobin species investigated include Hb(CO)4, the diliganded symmetrical species (alpha beta-CO)2 and (alpha-CO beta)2, and the di- and monoliganded asymmetrical species (alpha-CO beta-CO)(alpha beta), (alpha-CO beta)(alpha beta-CO), (alpha beta-CO) (alpha beta), and (alpha-CO beta)(alpha beta). They were obtained by rapid reduction with dithionite of the corresponding valence intermediates that in turn were obtained by chromatography or by hybridization. The nature and concentration of the intermediates were determined by isoelectric focusing at −25 degrees C. The study was performed at varying hemoglobin concentrations (0.1, 0.02, and 0.001 mM [heme]), pH (6.0, 7.0, 8.0), with and without inositol hexaphosphate. The results indicate that: (a) hemoglobin concentration in the 0.1-0.02 mM range does not significantly affect the kinetic rates; (b) the alpha chains dissociate CO faster than the beta chains; (c) the symmetrical diliganded intermediates show cooperativity with respect to ligand dissociation that disappears in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate; (d) the monoliganded intermediates dissociate CO faster than the diliganded intermediates; (e) the asymmetrical diliganded intermediates are functionally different from the symmetrical species."
https://openalex.org/W1717296144,"From the 70% ethanol extract of Mycobacterium smegmatis cells, we isolated a mixture of weakly acidic oligosaccharides composed mainly of glucose and 6-O-methylglucose. The elution pattern from a Bio-Gel P-4 column suggested that the oligosaccharides were smaller than the O-methylglucose polysaccharide (MGP) and could be biosynthetic precursors. Analysis by fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry revealed that the oligosaccharides fit into a pattern for polysaccharide synthesis based on an alternate glucosylation-methylation mechanism until the chain reached the composition methylglucose11glucose5glyceric acid, at which time 2 glucose units are added to give glucose2methylglucose11glucose5glyceric acid. The addition of the last 2 glucoses and methylation of one of them to give mature MGP (methylglucose1glucose3methylglucose11glucose5glyceric acid) apparently occurs rapidly because the expected intermediates were not observed. Only 4 glucose units are present at the glyceric acid end of some molecules during all stages of the elongation process, and these represent precursors of a minor MGP homolog with an extra methyl group on the beta 1----3-linked glucose unit of MGP. alpha-D-Glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-D-glyceric acid and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----6)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-D-glycer ic acid were also isolated from the extract and correspond in structure to the expected initial precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1517686197,"Structurally abnormal type I collagen was identified in the dermis, bone, and cultured fibroblasts obtained from a baby with lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the CNBr peptides demonstrated that the alpha 1(I)CB7 peptide from the alpha 1(I)-chain of type I collagen existed in a normal form and a mutant form with a more basic charge distribution. This heterozygous peptide defect was not detected in the collagens from either parent. The defect was localized to a 224-residue region at the NH2 terminus of the alpha 1(I)CB7 peptide by mammalian collagenase digestion. Analysis of unhydroxylated collagens produced in cell culture indicated that the mutant alpha 1(I)CB7 migrated faster on electrophoresis suggesting that the abnormality may be a small deletion or a mutation that alters sodium dodecyl sulfate binding. The post-translational hydroxylation of lysine residues was increased in the CB7 peptide and also in peptides CB3 and CB8 which are toward the NH2 terminus of the alpha 1(I)-chain. The COOH-terminal CB6 peptide was normally hydroxylated. These findings support the proposal that the lysine overhydroxylation resulted from a perturbation of helix propagation from the COOH to NH2 terminus of the collagen trimer caused by the structural defect in alpha 1(I)CB7."
https://openalex.org/W1530525011,"The processing of the common precursor for pancreatic polypeptide and pancreatic icosapeptide was studied in primary cultures of endocrine cells isolated from the duodenal part of the canine pancreas. Biosynthetically labeled peptides were characterized by enzymatic digestion and radiosequencing and compared to a COOH-terminally extended form of the icosapeptide which was isolated from canine pancreas and also sequenced. It was substantiated that, in these cell cultures, processing can be studied at a classical dibasic site between the pancreatic polypeptide and the icosapeptide, and at a monobasic processing site between the icosapeptide and its COOH-terminal extension. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the monobasic cleavage occurs later than the dibasic one in the biosynthetic process; the monobasic site was apparently not cleaved before the prohormone had been processed at the dibasic site. The monobasic processing could also be distinguished from the dibasic cleavage mechanism as, in time, the cells gradually lost the ability to cleave at the monobasic site while the dibasic processing was unaffected. It is concluded that monobasic conversion, which is important in the activation of a series of hormones, neuropeptides, and growth factors, is a distinct cellular processing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2139601922,"In vivo effects of dexamethasone and cycloheximide on the phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins and the activities of nucleolar protein kinases of rat livers were studied. Phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins was accomplished by incubation of isolated nucleoli with [gamma-32P]ATP at 37 degrees C for 10 min followed by electrophoretic separation and autoradiographic demonstration of phosphorylated proteins. Of several nucleolar phosphoproteins observed in the liver of adrenalectomized rats, the incorporation of 32P into nucleolar 110-kDa proteins was rapidly increased, reaching about 1.8-fold of the adrenalectomized level at 12 h after administration of dexamethasone. In addition, the activities of liver nucleolar protein kinases which were measured using casein or phosvitin as substrates were stimulated similarly by the administration of dexamethasone. It was found by DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography that nucleolar protein kinases were separated into NI and NII, the activities being increased about 35 and 80% by dexamethasone treatment (12 h), respectively, and that the enhancements were completely abolished by 1-h treatment of cycloheximide. The injection of cycloheximide also suppressed the hormone-induced enhancement of 32P incorporation into 110-kDa proteins but did not reduce the amount of the proteins at least until 2 h. Evidence was obtained indicating that the phosphorylation of the nucleolar 110-kDa proteins is accomplished primarily by protein kinase NII. These results suggest that continuous synthesis of protein(s) is necessary for glucocorticoid-induced enhancement of phosphorylation of 110-kDa proteins of liver nucleoli and that the nucleolar protein kinase NII is involved in the glucocorticoid-induced short-lived protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1554613020,"The spermatophore or sperm sac of Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworm beetle) is an acellular structure composed mostly of structural proteins, termed spermatophorins. The proteins are derived from the bean-shaped accessory reproductive glands of the male and are assembled into the multilayered structure within the ejaculatory duct. Homogenates of the secretory plug from this gland were used as immunogens for the production of monoclonal antibodies, including one identified as PL 21.1 which recognizes an antigen in the gland and the spermatophore. With the aid of gel filtration and immunoaffinity chromatography with a PL 21.1, we isolated a glandular secretory protein that is a precursor to a spermatophorin with similar electrophoretic mobility. On native polyacrylamide gels, the antigen from gland homogenates has an apparent molecular mass of 370 kDa. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the antigen from the gland and that from the spermatophore have apparent molecular masses of 23 kDa. According to immunoblots of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the 23-kDa glandular antigen is organ-specific and adult-specific. By immunocytochemistry with PL 21.1, we found the antigens to be restricted to secretory vesicles of only one cell type in the gland and to a discrete layer in the outer wall of the spermatophore. The 23-kDa secretory antigen is distinguished by being high in glutamic acid/glutamine (15.4%) and in proline (25.2%)."
https://openalex.org/W1638413198,"Laser-excited luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide ions bound to bacteriorhodopsin have been measured in deionized membranes. The luminescence titration curve, as well as the binding curve of apomembrane (retinal-free) with Eu3+, has shown that the removal of the retinal does not significantly affect the affinity of Eu3+ for the two high affinity sites of bacteriorhodopsin. The D2O effects on decay rate constants indicate that Eu3+ bound to the high affinity sites of native membrane or apomembrane is coordinated by about six ligands in the first coordination sphere. Tb3+ is shown to be coordinated by four ligands. The data indicate that metal ions bind to the protein with a specific geometry. From intermetal energy transfer experiments using Eu3+-Pr3+, Tb3+-Ho3+, and Tb3+-Er3+, the distance between the two high affinity sites is estimated to be 7-8 A."
https://openalex.org/W1541744558,"A comparison of the DNase I digestion products of the 32P-5'-end-labeled pachytene nucleosome core particles (containing histones H2A, TH2A, X2, H2B, TH2B, H3, and H4) and liver nucleosome core particles (containing somatic histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) revealed that the cleavage sites that are 30, 40, and 110 nucleotides away from the 5'-end are significantly more accessible in the pachytene core particles than in the liver core particles. These cleavage sites correspond to the region wherein H2B interacts with the nucleosome core DNA. These results, therefore, suggest that the histone-DNA interaction at these sites in the pachytene core particles is weaker, possibly because of the presence of the histone variant TH2B interacting at similar topological positions in the nucleosome core as that of its somatic counterpart H2B. Such a loosened structure may also be maintained even in the native pachytene chromatin since micrococcal nuclease digestion of pachytene nuclei resulted in a higher ratio of subnucleosomes (SN4 + SN7) to mononucleosomes than that observed in liver chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1532551167,"The administration of interferon-alpha/beta to female nude (nu/nu) mice caused significant changes in the levels of the cytosolic hepatic glutathione transferases. Antibodies raised against rat subunits, Ya, Yc, Yb1, Yb2, and Yk, and the subunits of the human transferases, mu (YbYb), lambda (YfYf), and epsilon (B1B1) all reacted with enzymes in the mouse and were used to demonstrate suppression and induction of transferase levels. Western blot analysis followed by semiquantitation by laser scanning showed the Ya, Yb1, Yb2, Yc, Yk, mu, and B1 subunits to be suppressed by 11, 11, 44, 30, 12, 14, and 47%, respectively, by interferon treatment. In contrast to these findings, the Yf subunit was induced 5-7-fold. A concomitant 220% increase was observed in the specific activity of the hepatic cytosol for ethacrynic acid, a substrate for the Yf subunit. Changes in the levels of transferase enzymes in normal and tumor cells may have significant implications when cytotoxic drugs are used in combination with interferons in cancer therapy. The Yf subunit, an enzyme found in human tumors and in placenta (Polidoro, G., Di Mio, C., Del Boccio, G., Zulli, P., and Fererici, G. (1980) Biochem. Pharmacol. 29, 1677-1680) has also been shown to be elevated in hepatic preneoplastic lesions (Kitahara, A., Satoh, K., Nishimura, K., Ishikawa, T., Ruike, K., Sato, K., Tsuda, H., and Ito, N. (1984) Cancer Res. 44, 2698-2703). These data indicate that the Yf subunit represents a potentially important interferon-inducible gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1581765134,"We have shown previously that newly synthesized lanosterol and cholesterol in homogenates of cultured human fibroblasts do not have the same equilibrium buoyant density as the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) (Lange, Y., and Steck, T. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15592-15597). This finding suggested two alternative and novel hypotheses: (a) that lanosterol and cholesterol might be transported rapidly from the SER to other internal membranes or (b) that synthesis of the sterols is not associated with the SER, or at least not with that portion of this organelle bearing HMG-CoA reductase. We therefore compared the subcellular distribution of HMG-CoA reductase with that of enzymes which convert lanosterol to cholesterol. The two activities studied were the consumption of exogenous [3H]lanosterol and the conversion of exogenous radiolanosterol to radiocholesterol. Differential centrifugation, rate zonal centrifugation, and equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation of rat liver homogenates all showed that these enzyme activities did not comigrate with HMG-CoA reductase. The subcellular distribution of newly synthesized sterols also was examined in cultured human fibroblasts. Cells were incubated with radioactive acetate to label endogenous sterols biosynthetically, homogenized, and spun to equilibrium on sucrose gradients. The buoyant density profiles of radioactive cholesterol and lanosterol both had a peak at 1.12 g/cm3. Digitonin treatment shifted both sterols to higher densities, strong evidence that they resided in cholesterol-rich membranes. Pretreatment of intact cells with cholesterol oxidase, which selectively oxidizes plasma membrane cholesterol, abolished the digitonin shift of lanosterol but not of intracellular cholesterol. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that newly synthesized cholesterol and lanosterol are not in the same membrane."

A 1-h incubation of hepatic cytosol with 1-3 M urea at 0 or at 23 degrees C caused a progressive decrease in the steroid binding efficiency of GR. Urea treatment of cytosol incubated with 20 nM [3H]triamcinolone acetonide caused transformation of glucocorticoid-receptor complexes (GRc) and resulted in an increase in the binding of GRc to DNA-cellulose and ATP-Sepharose. The transforming effect was maximal with 2.5 M urea at 0 degrees C for 1 h, and it caused a shift in the rate of sedimentation of the 9 S untransformed GRc to a 4 S form, similar to that observed upon incubation of the cytosol GRc at 23 degrees C. This 9 to 4 S transformation could also be observed in the presence of Na2MoO4. The Stokes radii of the GRc eluted from a Bio-Gel-A-0.5m agarose column were determined to be 5.9 and 4.9 nm in the absence and presence of 2.5 M urea. The aqueous two-phase partitioning analysis revealed a significant change in surface properties of GR following urea treatment; the observed partition coefficient values (cpm upper phase/bottom phase) were 0.022, 0.208, and 0.60 for GRc, GRc + 23 degrees C, and GRc + 2.5 M urea, respectively. Furthermore, the urea treatment rendered the GRc less negatively charged, forcing their appearance in the flow-through fractions of a DEAE-Sephacel column. These results suggest that urea is a potent in vitro modulator of the physicochemical behavior of GR, influencing both the steroid binding and the process of receptor transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1517320826,"Purified nicotinamide-nucleotide transhydrogenase from beef heart mitochondria was co-reconstituted with bacteriorhodopsin to from transhydrogenase-bacteriorhodopsin vesicles that catalyze a 20-fold light-dependent and uncoupler-sensitive stimulation of the reduction of NADP+ and NADP+ analogs by NADH and a 50-fold shift of the nicotinamide nucleotide ratio. In the presence of light, the transhydrogenase-bacteriorhodopsin vesicles catalyzed a pronounced light intensity-dependent inward proton pumping as indicated by a pH shift of the medium. As indicated by pH shifts, proton pumping by the bacteriorhodopsin essentially paralleled the light-driven transhydrogenase. Addition of valinomycin increased the pH shift twice with a concomitant 50% inhibition of the light-driven transhydrogenase, whereas nigericin inhibited the pH shift completely and the light-driven transhydrogenase partially. Taken together, these results suggest that transhydrogenase and bacteriorhodopsin interact through a delocalized proton-motive force. Possible partial reactions of transhydrogenase were investigated with transhydrogenase-bacteriorhodopsin vesicles energized by light. Reduction of oxidized 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide by NADH, previously claimed to represent partial reactions, was found to require NADPH. Similarly, reduction of thio-NADP+ by NADPH required NADH. It is concluded that these reactions do not represent partial reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1534487749,"The dysthrombin, Thrombin Quick, is chromatographically separable into two components designated Thrombin Quick I and Thrombin Quick II. Thrombin Quick II lacks observable catalytic activity toward thrombin substrates. The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of benzoylarginine ethyl ester and Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide by Thrombin Quick I are equivalent to those of thrombin. These results, in addition to binding studies with the active site titrant N2-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)arginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide, indicate that binding interactions at the catalytic site of Thrombin Quick I are unaltered. Thrombin Quick I is inhibited by anti-thrombin III at the same rate as thrombin. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the release of fibrinopeptide A indicate defects in both kcat and Km for Thrombin Quick I with kcat/Km equal to 0.012 of the value for thrombin, corresponding to the relative fibrinogen clotting activity of 0.013. The results are interpreted as indicating a defect in Thrombin Quick I at a binding site, external to the catalytic site, which is essential for determining specificity toward fibrinogen. The defect in kcat may result secondarily from small perturbations in the steric relationship of the catalytic triad residues. The rate of hydrolysis by Thrombin Quick I of the protein substrates bovine prothrombin and bovine protein C (in the absence of cofactors) is about one-third of that observed for thrombin, indicating that hydrolysis of these substrates by thrombin involves different specificity determinants than does the hydrolysis of fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1604642600,"Differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells by retinoic acid treatment results in extraembryonic endoderm-like cells. The effects of this process on the protein composition of the intermediate filaments were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by immunoblotting. By this approach, two new proteins induced in differentiating cells, p57 and p54, were identified in cytoskeletal preparations enriched in intermediate filaments. The 57-kDa protein could be resolved into at least three components (pI 5.6-5.9), and the 54-kDa protein into at least two components (pI approximately 5.6). Both proteins reacted with a monoclonal antibody which recognizes an antigenic determinant common to all intermediate filaments. Based on these results, the two proteins were identified as members of the intermediate filament protein family. Partial digestion with V8 protease showed that p57 was different from vimentin, another intermediate filament protein present in these cells. p57 and p54 were also immunodetected by a polyclonal anti-keratin anti-serum, which suggests that these proteins share some homology with the keratins. These two proteins are different from the endodermal cytoskeletal protein A and B (endo A and endo B) keratins, which are known to be present in extraembryonic endoderm-like cells. They were also more abundant than endo A and endo B in differentiating F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, but almost undetectable in terminally differentiated extraembryonic endoderm-like cells, where endo A and endo B are readily detectable. This suggests that p57 and p54 have a different pattern of expression than endo A and endo B."
https://openalex.org/W1593731634,"Abstract Mammalian fatty acid synthetase carrying a 3-keto, 3-hydroxy, or 2-enoyl acyl-enzyme intermediate on the 4'-phosphopantetheine thiol is reversibly inhibited by binding of NADP to the enoyl reductase domain. Acyl moieties which can normally leave the enzyme by thioester hydrolysis or by transfer to a CoA acceptor cannot readily be removed from the NADP-inhibited enzyme; in addition, 3-keto or 2-enoyl moieties attached to the enzyme 4'-phosphopantetheine cannot readily be reduced when NADP is replaced by NADPH, even though model substrates can be reduced immediately. Reactivation of the NADP-inhibited 3-ketoacyl-enzyme, by exposure to NADPH, is paralleled by reduction and dehydration of the 3-ketoacyl moiety to a saturated acyl moiety without accumulation of either the 3-hydroxy or 2-enoyl acyl-enzyme intermediates, indicating that once the 4'-phosphopantetheine engages the ketoacyl moiety in the ketoreductase domain, subsequent reactions occur very rapidly. The results are consistent with a hypothesis which proposes that NADP binding to the enoyl reductase domain of fatty acid synthetase carrying an acyl intermediate other than a saturated moiety induces a conformational change in the enzyme that results in decreased mobility of the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. Normal mobility of the prosthetic group, essential for transfer of acyl-enzyme intermediates through the active sites of the various functional domains, is restored relatively slowly when NADP is replaced by NADPH. It remains to be determined whether this modulation by pyridine nucleotides observed in vitro plays a role in the regulation of fatty acid synthetase activity in vivo."
