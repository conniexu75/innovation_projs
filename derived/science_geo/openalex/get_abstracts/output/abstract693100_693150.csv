https://openalex.org/W4229011537,"Caloric restriction (CR) prolongs life span, yet the mechanisms by which it does so remain poorly understood. Under CR, mice self-impose chronic cycles of 2-hour feeding and 22-hour fasting, raising the question of if it is calories, fasting, or time of day that is the cause of this increased life span. We show here that 30% CR was sufficient to extend the life span by 10%; however, a daily fasting interval and circadian alignment of feeding acted together to extend life span by 35% in male C57BL/6J mice. These effects were independent of body weight. Aging induced widespread increases in gene expression associated with inflammation and decreases in the expression of genes encoding components of metabolic pathways in liver from ad libitum-fed mice. CR at night ameliorated these aging-related changes. Our results show that circadian interventions promote longevity and provide a perspective to further explore mechanisms of aging."
https://openalex.org/W2889426946,"Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm’s performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins."
https://openalex.org/W4229025118,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification on mammalian messenger RNA. It is installed by a writer complex and can be reversed by erasers such as the fat mass and obesity-associated protein FTO. Despite extensive research, the primary physiological substrates of FTO in mammalian tissues and development remain elusive. Here, we show that FTO mediates m6A demethylation of long-interspersed element-1 (LINE1) RNA in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), regulating LINE1 RNA abundance and the local chromatin state, which in turn modulates the transcription of LINE1-containing genes. FTO-mediated LINE1 RNA m6A demethylation also plays regulatory roles in shaping chromatin state and gene expression during mouse oocyte and embryonic development. Our results suggest broad effects of LINE1 RNA m6A demethylation by FTO in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W4229037708,"Several COVID-19 studies on the felt passage of time have been conducted due to the strong feeling of time distortion many people have experienced during the pandemic. Overall, a relative decelaration of time passage was generally associated with negative affect and social isolation; a relative acceleration was associated with an increase in routine in daily life. There is some variability in results depending on the country of study and COVID-19 restrictions introduced, participants' demographics, and questionnaire items applied. Here we present a study conducted in May 2021 in Germany including n = 500 participants to assess time perception, emotional reactions, and attitudes towards the countermeasures. The passage of time judgments (POTJ) for the preceding 12 months during the pandemic were compared to data addressing the same question posed in previous studies conducted before the outbreak of COVID-19. The previous year was rated as having passed relatively slower during the pandemic compared to the ratings from before the pandemic. The duration judgments (DJ) of the 14 months since the start of the pandemic showed a bimodal distribution with both relatively shorter and relatively longer DJs. Higher levels of several negative emotions, as well as less social satisfaction, were associated with prolonged DJs and partially slower POTJs. Fear for health was not linked with the subjective experience of time, but exploratory analyses suggested that higher levels of fear were linked to more positive evaluations and approval of the governmental countermeasures. Those who reported higher levels of negative, agitated-aggressive emotions showed lower levels of consent with these measures."
https://openalex.org/W4229070309,"Background To investigate modern nonlinear iterative strategies for formula constant optimisation and show the application and results from a large dataset using a set of disclosed theoretical-optical lens power calculation concepts. Methods Nonlinear iterative optimisation algorithms were implemented for optimising the root mean squared (SoSPE), the mean absolute (SoAPE), the mean (MPE), the standard deviation (SDPE), the median (MEDPE), as well as the 90% confidence interval (CLPE) of the prediction error (PE), defined as the difference between postoperative achieved and formula predicted spherical equivalent power of refraction. Optimisation was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (SoSPE and SoAPE) or the interior point method (MPE, SDPE, MEDPE, CLPE) for the SRKT, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, Haigis, and Castrop formulae. The results were based on a dataset of measurements made on 888 eyes after implantation of an aspherical hydrophobic monofocal intraocular lens (Vivinex, Hoya). Results For all formulae and all optimisation metrics, the iterative algorithms showed a fast and stable convergence after a couple of iterations. The results prove that with optimisation for SoSPE, SoAPE, MPE, SDPE, MEDPE, and CLPE the root mean squared PE, mean absolute PE, mean PE, standard deviation of PE, median PE, and confidence interval of PE could be minimised in all situations. The results in terms of cumulative distribution function are quite coherent with optimisation for SoSPE, SoAPE, MPE and MEDPE, whereas with optimisation for SDPE and CLPE the standard deviation and confidence interval of the PE distribution could only be minimised at the cost of a systematic offset in mean and median PE. Conclusion Nonlinear iterative techniques are capable of minimising any statistical metrics (e.g. root mean squared or mean absolute error) of any target parameter (e.g. PE). These optimisation strategies are an important step towards optimising for the target parameters which are used for evaluating the performance of lens power calculation formulae."
https://openalex.org/W4229025171,"Improving the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management network and building cost-effective and well-managed healthcare systems are high priorities for healthcare units. Creating accurate and explainable mortality prediction models helps identify the most critical risk factors in the patients' survival/death status and early detect the most in-need patients. This study proposes a highly accurate and efficient machine learning model for predicting ICU mortality status upon discharge using the information available during the first 24 hours of admission. The most important features in mortality prediction are identified, and the effects of changing each feature on the prediction are studied. We used supervised machine learning models and illness severity scoring systems to benchmark the mortality prediction. We also implemented a combination of SHAP, LIME, partial dependence, and individual conditional expectation plots to explain the predictions made by the best-performing model (CatBoost). We proposed E-CatBoost, an optimized and efficient patient mortality prediction model, which can accurately predict the patients' discharge status using only ten input features. We used eICU-CRD v2.0 to train and validate the models; the dataset contains information on over 200,000 ICU admissions. The patients were divided into twelve disease groups, and models were fitted and tuned for each group. The models' predictive performance was evaluated using the area under a receiver operating curve (AUROC). The AUROC scores were 0.86 [std:0.02] to 0.92 [std:0.02] for CatBoost and 0.83 [std:0.02] to 0.91 [std:0.03] for E-CatBoost models across the defined disease groups; if measured over the entire patient population, their AUROC scores were 7 to 18 and 2 to 12 percent higher than the baseline models, respectively. Based on SHAP explanations, we found age, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urine nitrogen, and creatinine level as the most critical cross-disease features in mortality predictions."
https://openalex.org/W4229001760,"Populations of the entomopathogenic fungus Batkoa major were analyzed using sequences of four genomic regions and evaluated in relation to their genetic diversity, insect hosts and collection site. This entomophthoralean pathogen killed numerous insect species from 23 families and five orders in two remote locations during 2019. The host list of this biotrophic pathogen contains flies, true bugs, butterflies and moths, beetles, and barkflies. Among the infected bugs (Order Hemiptera), the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) is a new invasive planthopper pest of various woody plants that was introduced to the USA from Eastern Asia. A high degree of clonality occurred in the studied populations and high gene flow was revealed using four molecular loci for the analysis of population structure. We did not detect any segregation in the population regarding host affiliation (by family or order), or collection site. This is the first description of population structure of a biotrophic fungus-generalist in the entomopathogenic Order Entomophthorales. This analysis aimed to better understand the potential populations of entomopathogen-generalists infecting emerging invasive hosts in new ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W4229020286,"Background All women require access to high-quality care during pregnancy, labor, and after childbirth. The occurrence of delay at any stage is one of the major causes of maternal mortality. There is, however, a scarcity of data on women’s access to maternal health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the magnitude of delays in maternal health service utilization and its associated factors among pregnant women in the Ilubabor zone during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 pregnant women selected by systematic random sampling. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. Descriptive and summary statistics were used to describe the study population. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the outcome variables. Adjusted odds ratio with respective 95% CI was used to report significant covariates. Results A total of 402 pregnant women participated in this study. The median age of the respondents was 25 years (IQR = 8). On average, a woman stays 1.76 hours (SD = 1.2) to make a decision to seek care. The prevalence of first, second and third delay were 51%, 48%, and 33.3%, respectively. Being unmarried [AOR (95% CI)], [0.145 (0.046–0.452)], being unemployed [AOR (95% CI)], [4.824 (1.685–13.814)], age [AOR (95% CI)], [0.227 (0.089–0.0579)], fear of COVID-19 [AOR (95% CI)], [1.112 (1.036–1.193)], urban residence [AOR (95% CI)], [0.517 (0.295–0.909)], and lack of birth preparedness [AOR (95% CI)], [6.526 (1.954–21.789)] were significantly associated with first delay. Being unmarried [AOR (95% CI)], [5.984 (2.930–12.223)], being unemployed [AOR (95% CI)], [26.978 (3.477–209.308)], and age [AOR (95% CI)], [0.438 (0.226–0.848)] were significantly associated with second delay. Having lengthy admission [AOR (95% CI)], [7.5 (4.053–13.878)] and non-spontaneous vaginal delivery [AOR (95% CI)], [1.471 (1.018–1.999)] were significantly associated with third delay. Conclusion This study identified a significant proportion of mothers experiencing delays, although there were no data to suggest exacerbated delays in utilizing maternal health services due to fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of maternal delay varies with different factors. Improving the decision-making capacity of women is, therefore, essential."
https://openalex.org/W4229053224,"Most of the AML patients in remission develop multidrug resistance after the first-line therapy and relapse. AML stem cells have gained attention for their chemoresistance potentials. Chemoresistance is a multifactorial process resulting from altered survival signaling pathways and apoptosis regulators such as MAPK, NF-κB activation and ROS production. We targeted the survival pathway p38 MAPK, NF-κB and ROS generation in human chemoresistant AML stem cell line KG1a, susceptible to enhance cell sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug 5-Fluorouridine, compared to the chemosensitive AML cell line HL60. After confirming the phenotypic characterization of KG1a and HL60 cells using flow cytometry and transcriptomic array analyses, cell treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor IKKVII resulted in a complete induction of apoptosis, and a few p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190-treated cells underwent apoptosis. No change in the apoptosis status was observed in the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine-treated cells. The p38 MAPK pathway blockade enhanced the KG1a cell sensitivity to 5-Fluorouridine, which was associated with the upregulation of microribonucleic acid-(miR-)328-3p, as determined by the microarray-based miRNA transcriptomic analysis. The downregulation of the miR-210-5p in SB202190-treated KG1a cells exposed to FUrd was monitored using RT-qPCR. The miR-328-3p is known for the enhancement of cancer cell chemosensitivity and apoptosis induction, and the downregulation of miR-210-5p is found in AML patients in complete remission. In conclusion, we highlighted the key role of the p38 MAPK survival pathway in the chemoresistance capacity of the AML stem cells and potentially involved miRNAs, which may pave the way for the development of a new therapeutic strategy targeting survival signaling proteins and reduce the rate of AML relapse."
https://openalex.org/W4228997298,"Rice is critical to global food security which demands immediate attention to meet the ever-growing population. Development of improved variety is the major focus area of research, in which doubled haploid (DH) technology plays a vital role. Since, androgenesis shows its potential in DH production, this method was not capitalized specially in indica rice due to due to its recalcitrant nature to tissue culture. Success of androgenesis is governed by many important factors such as stage of anther, pre-treatment conditions, accurate concentrations of media, and plant growth regulators. Though reports of androgenesis are abundant in rice, most of them either used japonica or a specific cultivar of indica rice ecotypes. In this study, a media combination was established which is successful in producing doubled haploids from F1s of Savitri x Pokkali, IR20 x Mahulata along with the popular indica hybrids of Arize 8433DT, Arize 6453, Arize Bold, and Swift Gold. Out of 12 different media combinations tested, and 5 different durations of cold-treatments studied, N6 media with 2,4-D (2.0 mg/l) and BAP (0.5 mg/l) with 7th day cold pre-treatment was found to be most effective in all of the F1s for callus induction. Among all the F1s, rice hybrid, Arize 8433DT showed highest of 52% callus induction. In case of green shoot regeneration, MS media with NAA (0.5 mg/l), BAP (2.0 mg/l) and Kn (1.0 mg/l) (MS+C4) was found to be the most efficient of six treatments studied with highest of 58.25% regeneration in Arize 8433DT. Further, MS+C4 in combination with proline (5.0 mg/l) increased the regeneration rate to 85.99%. Besides, MS media with NAA (1.0 mg/l), Kn (0.1 mg/l) and 50 g/l sucrose was found to be most efficient for supporting root induction in all F1s. This study claims the establishment of genotype independent androgenic protocol for indica rice which could be capitalized in indica rice improvement."
https://openalex.org/W4229012383,"High prevalence of anxiety symptoms has been reported globally in the university students. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the recognized treatment for anxiety and is traditionally conducted face-to-face (f-CBT). The efficacy of internet-based CBT (i-CBT) for anxiety has been extensively studied, yet evidence on its cost-effectiveness is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of guided low-intensity i-CBT for university students with mild anxiety symptoms from the societal perspective of Hong Kong.A 5-year Markov model was designed to compare outcomes of guided i-CBT and f-CBT in a hypothetical cohort of university students with mild anxiety symptoms. Model inputs of cost and healthcare resources associated with anxiety were retrospectively collected from a cohort of university students with anxiety symptoms. Clinical and utility model inputs were retrieved from published literature. Model outcome measures were anxiety-related total cost (including direct medical and indirect costs) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of base-case results.In base-case analysis, i-CBT gained higher QALYs (2.9956 versus 2.9917) at lower total cost (US$6,101 versus US$6,246) than f-CBT. In one-way sensitivity analysis, the QALY gained by i-CBT was sensitive to the relative patient acceptance and adherence to CBT. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, i-CBT was cost-effective in 90.9% of the time at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 138,210 per QALY (3× GDP per capita in Hong Kong). The probability of i-CBT to be cost-effective was 99.9% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of zero.Guided i-CBT appears to be cost-saving and effective for management of university students with mild symptoms of anxiety from the societal perspective of Hong Kong. The cost-effectiveness of i-CBT is highly subject to the individual acceptance and adherence of CBT delivered by the internet platform."
https://openalex.org/W4229065063,"Ultrasound has been shown to affect the function of both neurons and non-neuronal cells, but, the underlying molecular machinery has been poorly understood. Here, we show that at least two mechanosensitive proteins act together to generate C. elegans behavioral responses to ultrasound stimuli. We first show that these animals generate reversals in response to a single 10 msec pulse from a 2.25 MHz ultrasound transducer. Next, we show that the pore-forming subunit of the mechanosensitive channel TRP-4, and a DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel MEC-4, are both required for this ultrasound-evoked reversal response. Further, the trp-4;mec-4 double mutant shows a stronger behavioral deficit compared to either single mutant. Finally, overexpressing TRP-4 in specific chemosensory neurons can rescue the ultrasound-triggered behavioral deficit in the mec-4 null mutant, suggesting that both TRP-4 and MEC-4 act together in affecting behavior. Together, we demonstrate that multiple mechanosensitive proteins likely cooperate to transform ultrasound stimuli into behavioral changes."
https://openalex.org/W4229036168,"Household food insecurity and inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) contribute to ill health. However, the interactions between household food insecurity, WASH and health have been rarely assessed concurrently. This study investigated compounded impacts of household food insecurity and WASH on self-reported physical and mental health of adults in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta.This cross-sectional survey interviewed 552 households in one northern and one southern province of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The survey incorporated previously validated tools such as the Short Form 12-item Health Survey, Household Food Insecurity Assessment Scale, and the Access and Behavioural Outcome Indicators for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene. Physical and mental health were quantified using the physical health composite score (PCS) and mental health composite score (MCS), respectively. These measures were the dependent variables of interest for this study.Statistical analysis revealed that household food insecurity and using <50 litres of water per person per day (pppd) were independently associated with lower PCS (p<0.05), after adjusting for socio-economic confounders. Household food insecurity and lack of food availability, using <50 litres of water pppd, and the use of untreated drinking water were associated with lower MCS (p<0.05), with water usage being an effect modifier of the relationship between household food insecurity and MCS. The results indicate that being food insecure and having limited potable quality water had a compounding effect on MCS, compared to being individually either food insecure or having limited water.This study is one of only a few that have established a link between potable water availability, food insecurity and poorer physical and mental health. The results also indicate a need to validate national data with fine-scale investigations in less populous regions to evaluate national initiatives with local populations that may be at higher risk. Adopting joint dual-action policies for interventions that simultaneously address water and food insecurity should result in larger improvements in health, particularly mental health, compared to targeting either food or water insecurity in isolation."

However, China’s opencast coal mines lack an efficient and straightforward construction scheme of monitoring and management systems and a short-term prediction model to support dust control. In this study, by establishing a PM2.5 and other real-time environmental information to monitor, manage, visualize and predict the Internet of things monitoring and prediction system to solve these problems. This study solves these problems by establishing an Internet of things monitoring and prediction system, which can monitor PM2.5 and other real-time environmental information for monitoring, management, visualization, and prediction. We use Lua language to write interface protocol code in the APRUS adapter, which can simplify the construction of environmental monitoring system. The Internet of things platform has a custom visualization scheme, which is convenient for managers without programming experience to manage sensors and real-time data. We analyze real-time data using a time series model in Python, and RMSE and MAPE evaluate cross-validation results. The evaluation results show that the average RMSE of the ARIMA (4,1,0) and Double Exponential Smoothing models are 12.68 and 8.34, respectively. Both models have good generalization ability. The average MAPE of the fitting results are 10.5% and 1.7%, respectively, and the relative error is small. Because the ARIMA model has a more flexible prediction range and strong expansibility, and ARIMA model shows good adaptability in cross-validation, the ARIMA model is more suitable as the short-term prediction model of the prediction system. The prediction system can continuously predict PM2.5 dust through the ARIMA model. The monitoring and prediction system is very suitable for managers of opencast coal mines to prevent and control road dust."
https://openalex.org/W4229074152,"The postpartum period is a challenging transition period with almost one in ten mothers experiencing depression after childbirth. Perceived social support is associated with mental health. Yet empirical evidence regarding the causal effects of social support on postpartum mental health remains scarce. In this paper, we used a nationally representative panel data of women to examine causality between perceived social support and postpartum mental health. We used fixed-effect method and included dependent variable lags to account for past mental health condition before birth (i.e., the pre-pregnancy and prenatal periods). The study also used an instrumental variable approach to address endogeneity. We find a declining trend in postpartum mental health between 2002 to 2018. Our study also showed that past mental health (i.e., before childbirth) is positively correlated with postpartum mental health. A universal routine mental health screening for expectant and new mothers should remain a key priority to ensure mental wellbeing for the mothers and their infants."
https://openalex.org/W4229079339,"With the development of cloud computing, interest in database outsourcing has recently increased. In cloud computing, it is necessary to protect the sensitive information of data owners and authorized users. For this, data mining techniques over encrypted data have been studied to protect the original database, user queries and data access patterns. The typical data mining technique is kNN classification which is widely used for data analysis and artificial intelligence. However, existing works do not provide a sufficient level of efficiency for a large amount of encrypted data. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving parallel kNN classification algorithm. To reduce the computation cost for encryption, we propose an improved secure protocol by using an encrypted random value pool. To reduce the query processing time, we not only design a parallel algorithm, but also adopt a garbled circuit. In addition, the security analysis of the proposed algorithm is performed to prove its data protection, query protection, and access pattern protection. Through our performance evaluation, the proposed algorithm shows about 2∼25 times better performance compared with existing algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4229023241,"Background To identify 30-day rehospitalizations in patients discharged with heart failure (HF) based on clinical indications, physiologic measures and symptoms. Methods Fifty-six patients with heart failure participated. After discharge to home, clinical indicators of dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea with exertion, daily weight, edema, heart rate, blood pressure, mental condition, medication adherence, and overall well-being were reported by participants daily for up to 30 days. Results Joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event approach was applied to assess the association of readmission with longitudinal measurements. There was no association between demographic, physiological, or laboratory variables and re-hospitalization within 30 days post discharge. Perceptions of dyspnea ( p = .012) and feeling unwell ( p &lt; .001) were associated with rehospitalization. Patients struggling to breath were 10.7 times more likely to be readmitted than those not struggling to breath. Conclusion Perceived measures, particularly dyspnea and feeling unwell were more important factors than demographic, physiological, or laboratory parameters in predicting 30-day rehospitalizations in this racially diverse cohort. The symptomatic experience of heart failure is an important indicator of rehospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W4229026625,"We investigated dietary patterns and their associations with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in Saudi adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 297 participants (154 men and 143 women) with a mean age (standard deviation) of 54.0 (7.0) years were enrolled in the current study. Self-reported information on sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, eating behavior, and frequency of consumption was collected from all participants. Principal component analysis was used to determine dietary patterns. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the associations between dietary patterns and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. We identified five dietary patterns: “Vegetables and olive oil,” “Refined grains and sweets,” “Dairy products and legumes,” “Dates and beverages,” and “Fruit.” Age was inversely associated with the pattern “Refined grains and sweets” (β = -0.036, p &lt;0.001). Females were more likely to have higher scores with the “Fruit” pattern (β = 0.410, p = 0.011). Smoking was associated with “Vegetables and olive oil” (β = 0.919, p = 0.001) and “Dates and beverages” (β = -0.947, p = 0.001) patterns. The level of physical activity was associated with “Dates and beverages” (β = 0.104, p = 0.048) and “Vegetables and olive oil” (β = -0.102, p = 0.048) patterns. The number of snacks consumed was associated with “Dates and beverages” pattern (β = -0.241, p = 0.005), and the frequency of meals eaten in fast food locations and restaurants per month was associated with “Vegetables and olive oil” pattern (β = -0.043, p = 0.034). Each dietary pattern was associated with different sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and eating behaviors. This study provides insights into the underlying nutritional habits of Saudi Arabian patients with T2DM. Future studies are necessary to assess these associations in representative samples."
https://openalex.org/W4229038119,"Background Early reports of increased thrombosis risk with SARS-CoV-2 infection led to changes in venous thromboembolism (VTE) management. Real-world data on the prevalence, efficacy and harms of these changes informs best practices. Objective Define practice patterns and clinical outcomes related to VTE diagnosis, prevention, and management in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) using a multi-hospital US sample. Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study of 1121 patients admitted to 33 hospitals, exposure was dose of anticoagulant prescribed for VTE prophylaxis (standard, intensified, therapeutic), and primary outcome was VTE (pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis [DVT]); secondary outcomes were PE, DVT, arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and bleeding events. Multivariable logistic regression models accounting for clustering by site and adjusted for risk factors were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs). Inverse probability weighting was used to account for confounding by indication. Results 1121 patients (mean age 60 ± 18, 47% female) admitted with COVID-19 between February 2, 2020 and December 31, 2020 to 33 US hospitals were included. Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis was prescribed in 86%. Forty-seven patients (4.2%) had PE, 51 (4.6%) had DVT, and 23 (2.1%) had ATE. Forty-six patients (4.1%) had major bleeding and 46 (4.1%) had clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Compared to standard prophylaxis, adjusted odds of VTE were 0.67 (95% CI 0.21–2.1) with no prophylaxis, 1.0 (95% CI 0.06–17) with intensified, and 3.0 (95% CI 0.89–10) with therapeutic. Adjusted odds of bleeding with no prophylaxis were 5.6 (95% CI 3.0–11) and 5.3 (95% CI 3.0–10) with therapeutic (no events on intensified dosing). Conclusions Therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with a 3-fold increased odds of VTE and 5-fold increased odds of bleeding. While higher bleeding rates with high-intensity prophylaxis were likely due to full-dose anticoagulation, we conclude that high thrombosis rates were due to clinical concern for thrombosis before formal diagnosis."

We aimed to compare disease burden, including a broad range of health aspects, across men and women with IA treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi).Adult outpatients with IA (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis) were included as part of standard care. Patient-reported outcomes, disease activity, TNFi trough levels, calprotectin, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment, comorbidities and cardiovascular risk profile were assessed. Unadjusted comparisons across sexes were done with independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and X2-test and adjusted analyses with General Linear Models and logistic/ordinal logistic regression.A total of 305 IA patients were included (167 men, 138 women). A significantly lower proportion of women (45%) than men (59%) were in remission according to disease-specific composite scores (p = 0.02). Women had significantly worse scores on pain, joint pain, fatigue, enthesitis, Health Assessment Questionnaire and Short Form (SF)-36 vitality and social functioning (all p≤0.04). Both sexes had worse SF-36 scale scores than the general population. Women reported more absenteeism (work time missed) and activity impairment. TNFi trough levels, neutralizing antibodies and calprotectin were similar across sexes. A similar total number of comorbidities was seen. Self-reported hypothyroidism was more frequent in women. Men had higher 10-year calculated risk of fatal cardiovascular events.Important differences in disease burden between men and women were seen. More attention to sex differences in the follow-up of IA patients is warranted."

However, there are no large population-based surveys on infantile allergic symptoms in Japan. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of wheezing and asthma in infants in Nagoya, Japan. This population-based cross-sectional study was performed in the metropolitan city of Nagoya, Japan. We surveyed parents to ascertain the prevalence of wheezing and eczema in infants who attended group health checkups at 3, 18, and 36 months of age. Their parents completed modified questionnaires from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. More than 90% of the approximately 40,000 children in each study group living in the target area were included in the survey. The prevalence of wheezing was 8%, 17%, and 13% at 3, 18, and 36 months, respectively, and was characterized by birth season. The prevalence of eczema was 24%, 30%, and 31%, at 3, 18, and 36 months, respectively. Participants born in autumn and winter had a higher incidence of eczema in each age group. Three-quarters of the children had a parental history of allergic conditions. Parental allergic diseases and male gender are risk factors for wheezing and eczema in children. This survey had a high response rate and covered almost the entire population of the target age groups in a large city. We believe that the results of this study, therefore, provide a much higher level of confidence regarding the prevalence of allergies in infants in Japan than that in previous studies with limited cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W4229082811,"Despite widespread advocacy for exclusive breastfeeding, and the associated benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for both infants and mothers, there is low prevalence in both developed and developing countries. Additionally, although several studies have been conducted on exclusive breastfeeding, very few of such studies have linked birth weight and birth size to exclusive breastfeeding. This study seeks to examine the influence of birth weight and birth size on exclusive breastfeeding.This study adopted a sequential explanatory mixed method approach using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative approach used cross-sectional data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) and the qualitative data from interviews with exclusive breastfeeding mothers from two health facilities in La Nkwantanang Municipal Assembly in Accra, Ghana. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine whether infants birth weight and mothers perceived birth size are associated with the practice of exclusive breastfeeding while the qualitative data provided further insights into the findings from the quantitative analysis.Majority (85%) of the infants in the study were of normal birth weight while 52% of the infants were perceived by their mothers to be of small birth size. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was found to be 54.8%. The birth weight of infants and mothers' perceived birth size were found to be significant predictors of exclusive breastfeeding. Infants of normal birth weight (OR = 7.532; 95% CI: 2.171-26.132) and high birth weight (OR = 6.654; 95% CI: 1.477-29.978) were more likely to be exclusively breastfed compared to low-birth-weight infants. Similarly, infants perceived to be of normal birth size were more likely (OR = 1.908; 95% CI: 1.058-3.441) to be exclusively breastfed compared to infants perceived to be of small birth size. The findings from the qualitative analysis show that birth weight rather than birth size influence mothers' decision to practice exclusive breastfeeding.The findings of the study underscore the relevance of infant birth weight and perceived birth size in the practice of exclusive breastfeeding and highlights the need to incorporate both actual measurement of birth weight, and perception of infant's birth size into policies targeted at exclusive breastfeeding. There is the need for deliberate targeted efforts at women who deliver infants of low birth weight and women who perceive their children to be of small birth size to practice exclusive breastfeeding."
https://openalex.org/W4228998894,"Background Providing compassionate and respectful maternity care to mothers is a vital intervention to improve health outcomes of women and newborns. However, there is less data of compassionate and respectful maternity care in Gondar city. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of mistreatment and associated factors among mothers who gave birth at the public health facilities in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2019 in Gondar city public nine health facilities. A total of 584 randomly selected women in the postpartum period were recruited in this study. A binary logistic regression analysis was done to see whether there was an association between mistreatment and independent variables. Finally, the logistic regression analysis was done by stratifying type of parity and mode of delivery. Results Overall, 73.2% (95% CI: 69.7–76.7%) of the women were mistreated during their childbirth care. Non-consented care was the most commonly experienced form of mistreatment (63.6%, 95% CI: 59.6–67.6%). Having less than four antenatal care follow-up visits (AOR = 3.58, 95% CI: 2.04–6.29), giving birth in the hospital (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.52–5.27), and facing complications during delivery (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.52–3.98) were significantly associated with mistreatment among postpartum mothers. Conclusions This study showed a lower proportion of mistreatment than other studies in Ethiopia. Having less than four ANC follow up, place of current delivery, and facing complication during delivery were identified as the determinants of mistreatment. Therefore, this calls for strengthening actions, like providing maternity education during antenatal care and appropriate management of complications to improve the quality of maternity care at health facilities, and enhancing hospital working health workers capacity on compassionate and respectful maternity care."

In addition, it has been shown that PCR is more sensitive as compared to antigen-based tests. Here we describe the analytical and clinical evaluation of our in-house RNA extraction-free saliva-based molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Analytical sensitivity of the test was equal to the sensitivity obtained in other Dutch diagnostic laboratories that process NP/T swabs. In this study, 955 individuals participated and provided NP/T swabs for routine molecular analysis (with RNA extraction) and saliva for comparison. Our RT-qPCR resulted in a sensitivity of 82,86% and a specificity of 98,94% compared to the gold standard. A false-negative ratio of 1,9% was found. The SARS-CoV-2 detection workflow described here enables easy, economical, and reliable saliva processing, useful for repeated testing of individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4229045814,"In many respects, freshwater springs can be considered as unique ecosystems on the fringe of aquatic habitats. This integrates their uniqueness in terms of stability of environmental metrics. The main objective of our study was to evaluate how environmental variables may shape invertebrate diversity and community composition in different freshwater spring types and habitats within. In order to do so, we sampled invertebrates from 49 springs in Iceland, where we included both limnocrene and rheocrene springs. At each site, samples were taken from the benthic substrate of the spring (“surface”) and the upwelling groundwater at the spring source (“source”). To collect invertebrates from the spring sources we used a modified method of “electrobugging” and Surber sampler for collecting invertebrates from the surface. In total, 54 invertebrate taxa were identified, mostly Chironomidae (Diptera). Chironomid larvae also dominated in terms of abundance (67%), followed by Ostracoda (12%) and Copepoda (9%). The species composition in the surface samples differed considerably between rheocrene and limnocrene springs and was characterised by several indicator species. Alpha diversity was greater at the surface of springs than at the source, but the beta diversity was higher at the source. Diversity, as summarized by taxa richness and Shannon diversity, was negatively correlated with temperature at the surface. At the source, on the other hand, Shannon diversity increased with temperature. The community assembly in springs appears to be greatly affected by water temperature, with the source community of hot springs being more niche-assembled (i.e., affected by mechanisms of tolerance and adaptation) than the source community of cold springs, which is more dispersal-assembled (i.e., by mechanisms of drift and colonization)."
https://openalex.org/W4229052443,"Mutualism–the disposition to cooperate in ways that benefit both actor and recipient–has been proposed as a key construct in the evolution of cooperation, with distinct adaptations for 1) partner choice, 2) division, 3) punishment, and 4) helping. However, no psychological validation of this 4-fold psychological structure exists, and no measure of the trait is available. To fill this need, in two pre-registered studies (total N = 902), we: (A) Develop and administer items assessing each of the four mutualist adaptations; (B) Show good fit to the predicted four factor model; (C) Demonstrate reliability and stability across time; (D) Evidence discriminant validity from existing constructs, including compassion and utilitarianism; (E) Establish external validity by predicting proportional choices in catch division, opposition to partner coercion, and reduced support for redistribution; and (F) Replicate each of these findings. Jointly, these results support the validity of mutualism, including a motive to maintain the freedom to choose, and provide reliable scales for use in integrating, further developing, and applying mutualism."

Although these medications have different mechanisms of action, they have similar indications and treatment duration has been positively correlated with cardiovascular risk although the degree of risk varies by medication. Our objective was to study treatment effects of chronic use of individual NSAID medications and acetaminophen on all-cause mortality among patients who tested positive for COVID-19 while accounting for adherence. We used the VA national datasets in this retrospective cohort study to differentiate between sporadic and chronic medication use: sporadic users filled an NSAID within the last year, but not recently or regularly. Using established and possible risk factors for severe COVID-19, we used propensity scores analysis to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between treatment groups. Then, we used multivariate logistic regression incorporating inverse propensity score weighting to assess mortality. The cohort consisted of 28,856 patients. Chronic use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam, celecoxib, diclofenac or acetaminophen was not associated with significant differences in mortality at 30 days (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.95-1.00; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00; OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00; OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01; and OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.02, respectively) nor at 60 days (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-1.00; OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.00; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01; OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01; and OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99-1.02, respectively). Although the study design cannot determine causality, the study should assure patients as it finds no association between mortality and chronic use of these medications compared with sporadic NSAID use among those infected with COVID-19."

The current study on morphological characters of seed rhizomes stored in Zero Energy Cool Chambers recorded a weight loss of 28% at three months after storage. The number of sprouting buds was maximum (12.25) in the seed rhizomes stored for three months. The dimensions of the bud measured at the varied periods of storage interval showed variation. The length of the bud increased from 0.847μm to 2.19 μm and the breadth reduced from 1.19 μm to 0.703μm in three months of storage. The current study provides the anatomical morphology of ginger seed rhizomes. Histochemical studies of seed rhizome for three months storage showed that the number of cork layers varied from 5–15, size of starch grain decreased on storage from 40 μm to 20 μm and the oil globules found inside the parenchymatous cells increased from 20 μm to 40 μm.

https://openalex.org/W4229032970,"Warfarin is a widely used anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic index and large interpatient variability in the therapeutic dose. Warfarin sensitivity has been reported to be associated with increased incidence of international normalized ratio (INR) > 5. However, whether warfarin sensitivity is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in critically ill patients remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of different machine learning algorithms for the prediction of warfarin sensitivity and to determine the impact of warfarin sensitivity on outcomes in critically ill patients.Nine different machine learning algorithms for the prediction of warfarin sensitivity were tested in the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetic Consortium cohort and Easton cohort. Furthermore, a total of 7,647 critically ill patients was analyzed for warfarin sensitivity on in-hospital mortality by multivariable regression. Covariates that potentially confound the association were further adjusted using propensity score matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting.We found that logistic regression (AUC = 0.879, 95% CI: 0.834-0.924) was indistinguishable from support vector machine with a linear kernel, neural network, AdaBoost and light gradient boosting trees, and significantly outperformed all the other machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we found that warfarin sensitivity predicted by the logistic regression model was significantly associated with worse in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.33 (95% CI, 1.01-1.77).Our data suggest that the logistic regression model is the best model for the prediction of warfarin sensitivity clinically and that warfarin sensitivity is likely to be a risk factor for adverse outcomes in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W4229035426,"Introduction Even in a country with a tax-based healthcare financing system, health insurance can play an important role, especially in the management of chronic diseases with high disease and economic burden such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The insurance coverage among T2DM patients in Malaysia is currently unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the insurance status of T2DM patients in public and private healthcare facilities in Malaysia, and the association between this status and patients’ sociodemographic and economic factors. Methods A cross-sectional study among T2DM patients seeking inpatient or outpatient treatment at a public tertiary hospital (Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz) and a private tertiary hospital (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Specialist Centre) in Kuala Lumpur between August 2019 and March 2020. Patients were identified via convenience sampling using a self-administered questionnaire. Data collection focused on identifying insurance status as the dependent factor while the independent factors were the patients’ sociodemographic characteristics and economic factors. Results Of 400 T2DM patients, 313 responded (response rate, 78.3%) and 76.0% were uninsured. About 69.6% of the respondents had low monthly incomes of &lt;RM5000. Two-thirds of participants (59.1%) spent RM100–500 for outpatient visits whilst 58.5% spent &lt;RM100 on medicines per month (RM1 = USD0.244). Patients who visited a private facility had five times more likely to have insurance than patients who visited a public facility. Participants aged 18–49 years with higher education levels were 4.8 times more likely to be insured than participants aged ≥50 years with low education levels (2 times). Conclusions The majority of T2DM patients were uninsured. The main factors determining health insurance status were public facilities, age of ≥ 50 years, low education level, unemployment, and monthly expenditure on medicines."
https://openalex.org/W4229040549,"The lived experiences of caregivers of older adults in Ghana are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore and discuss the lived experiences of these caregivers using the Ethics of Care as a theoretical lens and Interpretative phenomenological analysis as the methodological approach. Ten caregivers in receipt of social welfare services on behalf of older adults were recruited from the Social Welfare Unit at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in southern Ghana. The analysis identified five interrelated themes: 1) committing the Self to caregiving; 2) caregiving impacting the Self; 3) motivating factors to caregiving; 4) caregiving burdens, and 5) thinking about personal affairs. Their experiences demonstrate that caregivers value the caregiving relationship, as posited by Ethics of Care, and tend to care for their health and well-being. Caregivers’ expression of commitment to caring for older adults is mainly influenced by reciprocity, despite internal and external stressors, and desire to fulfil unmet personal needs. Ethics of care offers an understanding of the lived experiences of caregivers of older adults in Ghana. The findings draw attention to the state to develop specific programs to ensure the health, social and financial well-being of older adults’ caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W4229063551,"The present study was designed to evaluate the test-retest consistency of repetition maximum tests at standardized relative loads and determine the robustness of strength-endurance profiles across test-retest trials. Twenty-four resistance-trained males and females (age, 27.4 ± 4.0 y; body mass, 77.2 ± 12.6 kg; relative bench press one-repetition maximum [1-RM], 1.19 ± 0.23 kg•kg-1) were assessed for their 1-RM in the free-weight bench press. After 48 to 72 hours, they were tested for the maximum number of achievable repetitions at 90%, 80% and 70% of their 1-RM. A retest was completed for all assessments one week later. Gathered data were used to model the relationship between relative load and repetitions to failure with respect to individual trends using Bayesian multilevel modeling and applying four recently proposed model types. The maximum number of repetitions showed slightly better reliability at lower relative loads (ICC at 70% 1-RM = 0.86, 90% highest density interval: [0.71, 0.93]) compared to higher relative loads (ICC at 90% 1-RM = 0.65 [0.39, 0.83]), whereas the absolute agreement was slightly better at higher loads (SEM at 90% 1-RM = 0.7 repetitions [0.5, 0.9]; SEM at 70% 1-RM = 1.1 repetitions [0.8, 1.4]). The linear regression model and the 2-parameters exponential regression model revealed the most robust parameter estimates across test-retest trials. Results testify to good reproducibility of repetition maximum tests at standardized relative loads obtained over short periods of time. A complementary free-to-use web application was developed to help practitioners calculate strength-endurance profiles and build individual repetition maximum tables based on robust statistical models."
https://openalex.org/W4229067936,"Background South Asians have high incidence of chronic disease. Physical activity (PA) and sedentary time are modifiable risk factors for chronic disease but their assessment in South Asians has been primarily based on self-report. This study presents directly-measured PA and sedentary time in South Asian adults in Canada. Methods A subset of 100 South Asian participants from a larger study who were identified at being at a higher risk for type 2 diabetes wore Actical accelerometers for 7 days. Anthropometric measures were taken and socio-demographic factors including age, income, education level, years since immigration, presence of children under the age of 12 years in the household and employment status were self-reported. Results Ninety-one participants (mean age 65.6 years) provided valid accelerometer data. Participants accumulated mean 673.5 (95% CI: 656.6, 691.0) min/day sedentary time, 130.5 (95% CI: 117.3, 145.3) min/day light PA (LPA) and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3, 4.2) min/day moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). For sedentary time and LPA, sex and BMI explained 51% of variability. For MVPA, BMI, season of assessment and employment status explained 23% variability with those who were employed accumulating significantly higher mean min/day of MVPA compared to those who were unemployed; (5.8, 95% CI: 1.5, 21.7) vs (1.5, 95% CI: 5.3, 20.0) respectively. Conclusion High sedentary time, and low MVPA indicates the need to focus health promotion efforts on shifting sedentary time into LPA while trying to increase MVPA. Future studies need to be based on larger, representative samples of South Asians."
https://openalex.org/W4229075485,"The invertebrate LFRFamide (LFRFa) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF), consisting of 6 to 10 amino acids, are orthologs for bilaterian NPF/Y, which consist of 36 to 40 amino acids. Recently, a molluscan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for NPF was characterized in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai). To address the functional evolutionary route of the invertebrate LFRFa and NPF signaling system, in this study, we identified cDNAs encoding LFRFa precursors and the sNPF receptor (Hdh-sNPFR) in Pacific abalone. Four LFRFa mature peptides with 6 or 7 amino acids were predicted: GSLFRFa, GGLFRFa, GTLFRFa, and GSTLFRFa. Hdh-sNPFR was identified as a classical rhodopsin-like GPCR and classified into a molluscan sNPFR group. In HEK293 cells, Hdh-sNPFR was mainly localized in the cell membranes and internalized in the cytoplasm following treatment with LFRFa peptides. Reporter assays demonstrated that LFRFa peptides inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in Hdh-sNPFR-expressing HEK293 cells. LFRFa precursor and Hdh-sNPFR transcripts were more strongly expressed in the cerebral and pleural-pedal ganglia of Pacific abalone than in the peripheral tissues such as the ovary, gills, intestine, and hepatopancreas. The levels of LFRFa transcripts in the ovary, intestine, and hepatopancreas were significantly higher in mature female abalone than in immature females. Injection of LFRFa induced the egg release and spawning behavior of mature abalone, but suppressed food intake. These results suggest that LFRFa peptides are endogenous ligands for Hdh-sNPFR involved in food intake and reproduction through a Gαi-protein dependent signaling pathway."

This has been associated with new psychological challenges and emotional stress that can induce burnout.To determine the prevalence of burnout syndrome and factors associated with burnout among pharmacy professionals in the healthcare system in Qatar.This institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 850 pharmacy professionals within Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in Qatar. Convenience sampling was followed. The survey utilized the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Toolkit™ for Medical Personnel and a modified version of the Astudillo and Mendinueta questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 for Windows and SAS Studio 3.8 (Enterprise Edition). P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.One hundred ninety-four pharmacy professionals (23%) responded to the survey. The prevalence of burnout was 19.7% [95% Confidence interval (CI); 13.8% - 26.8%] among 142 respondents who completed MBI questionnaire and 17.3% [95% CI; 11.7%-24.2%] among 139 respondents who completed Astudillo Mendinueta questionnaire. The most commonly reported factors that may lead to burnout were: tension and lack of organization in teamwork (59.6%), lack of recognition of or indifference to effort from patients, superiors, and colleagues (58.2%), and demanding and challenging patients and family members (56.7%). Multiple regression analysis showed that overtime working hours per month is independently associated with a higher risk of burnout [odds ratio (OR), 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15-2.14 for each 10-hours increase in monthly overtime, P = 0.005], while non-Arab ethnicity is associated with lower risk of burnout [OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.1-0.75; P = 0.012].There is a relatively low prevalence of burnout syndrome among health-system pharmacy professionals in Qatar.

However, the association between appetite loss at discharge and long-term outcome remains unclear. Methods The Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure registry is a prospective cohort study that enrolled consecutive patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in Japan. We assessed 3528 patients alive at discharge, and for whom appetite and follow-up data were available. We compared one-year clinical outcomes in patients with and without appetite loss at discharge. Results In the multivariable logistic regression analysis using 19 clinical and laboratory factors with P value &lt; 0.1 by univariate analysis, BMI &lt; 22 kg/m 2 (odds ratio (OR): 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11–2.24, P = 0.01), CRP &gt;1.0mg/dL (OR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.04–2.14, P = 0.03), and presence of edema at discharge (OR: 4.30, 95%CI: 2.99–6.22, P&lt;0.001) were associated with an increased risk of appetite loss at discharge, whereas ambulatory status (OR: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.39–0.83, P = 0.004) and the use of ACE-I/ARB (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50–0.98, P = 0.04) were related to a decreased risk in the presence of appetite loss. The cumulative 1-year incidence of all-cause death (primary outcome measure) was significantly higher in patients with appetite loss than in those without appetite loss (31.0% vs. 15.0%, P&lt;0.001). The excess adjusted risk of appetite loss relative to no appetite loss remained significant for all-cause death (hazard ratio (HR): 1.63, 95%CI: 1.29–2.07, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions Loss of appetite at discharge was associated with worse 1-year mortality in patients with ADHF. Appetite is a simple, reliable, and useful subjective marker for risk stratification of patients with ADHF."

The aim of this study was to outline a performance analysis process in field hockey that captures, analyses and visualises strategy in layers of detail culminating in the creation of an RStudio Shiny application. Computerised notational analysis systems were developed to capture in-game events and ball tracking data of 74 matches from the Women’s Pro League 2019. Game styles were developed using k-means cluster analysis to reduce detailed in-game events into practical profiles to identify the attack types, game actions and tempo of a team’s strategy. Ball movement profiles were developed to identify the predictability (entropy) and direction (progression rates) of ball movements, and consequent distribution of possession in different attacking zones. The Shiny application, an interactive web-platform, links the information from simple game profiles with detailed game variables to understand each teams’ holistic game plan, how they are different, and how to exploit these differences. The process outlined can be applied to any team invasion sport to understand, develop and communicate successful strategies under different match situations."

Several demographic and lifestyle factors are known to affect HbA1c levels. We evaluated the association of HbA1c with aerobic and resistance exercise in non-diabetic Taiwanese adults based on the waist-hip ratio (WHR).We conducted this study based on TWB data collected from 90,958 individuals between 2008 and 2019. We estimated the Beta (β) coefficient and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for HbA1c using multivariate regression models.Based on the multivariate analysis, lower HbA1c levels were associated with both resistance exercise (β-coefficient = -0.027, 95% CI -0.037 to -0.017) and aerobic exercise (β-coefficient = 0.018, 95% CI, -0.023 to -0.013). Higher HbA1c levels were associated with abnormal WHR compared to normal WHR (β-coefficient = 0.091, 95% CI, 0.086 to 0.096). We detected an interaction between exercise and WHR (p for interaction = 0.0181). To determine the magnitude of the interaction, we performed additional analyses (with the reference group being 'abnormal WHR with no exercise') and observed substantial decreases in HbA1c regardless of the WHR and exercise category. However, the largest reduction occurred in the 'normal WHR and resistance exercise' group (β = -0.121, 95% CI, -0.132 to -0.109).We found that normal resistance exercise, coupled with a normal WHR was significantly associated with lower HbA1c levels among non-diabetic individuals in Taiwan."

However, radiological analysis often reveals humeral stem misalignment in the frontal plane, along with high filling ratios that can lead to proximal bone remodeling under stress shielding. The aim of this cadaveric study was to test whether using compactors for standard-length (> 100 mm) stems to implant short (< 100 mm) stems reduces the risk of stem misalignment without compromising in terms of a higher filling ratio.In a cadaveric study, twenty short stems were implanted using instrumentation for standard-length stems. Alignment and filling ratios were evaluated on anteroposterior radiographs for both the compactors and the stems. The angular deviations (α) from the humeral axis of the compactors and the short stems were measured. Misalignment was defined as |α| > 5°. Metaphyseal and diaphyseal filling ratios were calculated and defined as either high (≥ 0.7) or low (< 0.7).The median angular deviations of the compactors and the short stems were respectively 1.6° (range, 0.03 to 5.9°) and 1.3° (range, 0.3 to 9.6°). Nineteen of the 20 compactors (95%) and 17/20 short stems (85%) were correctly aligned. The proportions of correctly aligned compactors and stems were not significantly different (95% CI, -0.33 to 0.11; Z-test of proportions p = .60), and the respective angular deviations were significantly correlated (Spearman ρ = .60, p = 0.006). The diaphyseal and metaphyseal filling ratios of the compactors and the stems were all low.In this series of 20 implants in cadavers, the narrow short humeral stems implanted with compactors for standard-length stems were correctly aligned with the humeral axis. This approach may be a way to achieve both correct frontal alignment and low filling ratios."
https://openalex.org/W4229034475,"In radiotherapy, the presence of air gaps near a tumour can lead to underdose to the tumour. In this study, the impact of air gaps on dose to the surface was evaluated. 3D-printing was used to construct a Eurosil-4 Pink bolus customised to the patient and its dosimetric properties were compared with that of Paraffin wax bolus.Surface dose was measured for flat sheets of Eurosil-4 Pink bolus with different thicknesses. Different air gap thicknesses were inserted between the bolus and the surface, and dose was measured for each air gap using 10 cm × 10 cm fields. This was repeated with the effective field size calculated from the patient plan. Surface dose was measured for varying angles of incidence. A customised chest phantom was used to compare dose for two customised Eurosil-4 Pink boluses, and commonly used Paraffin wax bolus.The surface dose was found to be highest for 1.1 cm thick bolus. The decrease in surface dose for the Eurosil-4 Pink bolus was minimal for the 10 cm × 10 cm field, but higher for the effective field size and larger angles of incidence. For instance, the dose was reduced by 6.2% as a result of 1 cm air gap for the effective field size and 60 degree angle of incidence. The doses measured using Gafchromic film under the customised Eurosil-4 Pink boluses were similar to that of the Paraffin wax bolus, and higher than prescribed dose.The impact of air gaps can be significant for small field sizes and oblique beams. A customised Eurosil-4 Pink bolus has promising physical and dosimetric properties to ensure sufficient dose to the tumour, even for treatments where larger impact of air gaps is suspected."
https://openalex.org/W4229051570,"To evaluate the effectiveness of three models for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service delivery to HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in Nigeria.297 heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples were recruited into three PrEP delivery models and followed up for 18 months. The models were i) Outpatient clinic model providing PreP in routine outpatient care; ii) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic model providing PrEP in ART clinics; and iii) Decentralized care model providing PrEP through primary and secondary care centres linked to a tertiary care centre. The primary effectiveness endpoint was incident HIV-1 infection. The HIV incidence before and after the study was compared and the incidence rate ratio computed for each model. Survival analysis was conducted, Cox regression analysis was used to compare the factors that influenced couple retention in each of the models. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the median retention time (in months) of the study participants in each of the study models, and log-rank test for equality of survival functions was conducted to test for significant differences among the three models.There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the couple retention rates among the three models. At months 3, 6 and 9, adherence of the HIV-1-infected partners to ART was highest in the decentralized model, whereas at months 9 and 12, the outpatient model had the highest proportion of HIV-1- uninfected partners adhering to PrEP (p<0.001). The HIV incidence per 100 person-years was zero in the general outpatient clinic and ART clinic models and 1.6 (95% CI: 0.04-9.1) in the decentralized clinic model. The difference in the observed and expected incidence rate was 4.3 (95% CI: 0.44-39.57) for the decentralized clinic model.Although incidence of HIV seroconversion was highest in the decentralized clinic model, this difference may be due to the higher sexual risk behavior among study participants in the decentralized model rather than the type of service delivery. The study findings imply that any of the models can effectively deliver PrEP services."
https://openalex.org/W4229053764,"Background Arm-crank exercise training (ACT) is an alternative exercise strategy for patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to the attenuation of pain symptoms during the exercise, as well as the benefits to functional capacity. Purpose The aim of this study is to describe the study protocol to analyze the effects of ACT exercise on cardiovascular function, functional capacity, cognition and quality of life in patients with symptomatic PAD. Methods This is a three-armed randomized, prospective, single-blind data collection, single-center, controlled study enrolling 45 patients with symptomatic PAD who will be randomized into 3 intervention groups: walking training (WT), ACT and control group. The WT and ACT will perform 2 sessions/week, 15 to 10 sets of 2 to 5 minutes at values of 13 to 15 on the Borg scale. Before and after 12 weeks of intervention, cardiovascular function (ambulatory blood pressure, office blood pressure, central blood pressure, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness and vascular function), functional capacity (six-minute walk test, 2 minute step test, handgrip test, Walking impairment questionnaire, Walking estimated limitation calculated by history, Baltimore activity scale for intermittent claudication, and short physical performance battery), cognition (executive function and memory), and quality of life (vascular quality of life questionnaire and World Health Organization Quality of Life) will be assessed. Results This is the first trial to evaluate the effects of ACT on regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system in PAD patients. If the results are as expected, they will provide evidence the ability of ACT to promote cardiovascular benefits in the symptomatic PAD population."
https://openalex.org/W4229055308,"Image processing algorithms are used to improve digital image representations in either their appearance or storage efficiency. The merit of these algorithms depends, in part, on visual perception by human observers. However, in practice, most are assessed numerically, and the perceptual metrics that do exist are criterion sensitive with several shortcomings. Here we propose an objective performance-based perceptual measure of image quality and demonstrate this by comparing the efficacy of a denoising algorithm for a variety of filters. For baseline, we measured detection thresholds for a white noise signal added to one of a pair of natural images in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm where each image was selected randomly from a set of n = 308 on each trial. In a series of experimental conditions, the stimulus image pairs were passed through various configurations of a denoising algorithm. The differences in noise detection thresholds with and without denoising are objective perceptual measures of the ability of the algorithm to render noise invisible. This was a factor of two (6dB) in our experiment and consistent across a range of filter bandwidths and types. We also found that thresholds in all conditions converged on a common value of PSNR, offering support for this metric. We discuss how the 2AFC approach might be used for other algorithms including compression, deblurring and edge-detection. Finally, we provide a derivation for our Cartesian-separable log-Gabor filters, with polar parameters. For the biological vision community this has some advantages over the more typical (i) polar-separable variety and (ii) Cartesian-separable variety with Cartesian parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4229058798,"To sustainably provide good quality care to increasing numbers of people living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings, care delivery must shift from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to differentiated service delivery models. Such models should reallocate resources from PLHIV who are doing well to groups of PLHIV who may need more attention, such as those with treatment failure. The VIral load Triggered ART care Lesotho (VITAL) trial assesses a viral load (VL)-, participant's preference-informed, electronic health (eHealth)-supported, automated differentiated service delivery model (VITAL model). With VITAL, we aim to assess if the VITAL model is at least non-inferior to the standard of care in the proportion of participants engaged in care with viral suppression at 24 months follow-up and if it is cost-saving.The VITAL trial is a pragmatic, multicenter, cluster-randomized, non-blinded, non-inferiority trial with 1:1 allocation conducted at 18 nurse-led, rural health facilities in two districts of northern Lesotho, enrolling adult PLHIV taking ART. In intervention clinics, providers are trained to implement the VITAL model and are guided by a clinical decision support tool, the VITALapp. VITAL differentiates care according to VL results, clinical characteristics, sub-population and participants' and health care providers' preferences.Evidence on the effect of differentiated service delivery for PLHIV on treatment outcomes is still limited. This pragmatic cluster-randomized trial will assess if the VITAL model is at least non-inferior to the standard of care and if it is cost saving.The study has been registered with clinicaltrials.gov (Registration number NCT04527874; August 27, 2020)."
https://openalex.org/W4229058875,"Moisture evolution in Central Asia including Northwest China shows less similarity with its surroundings and attracts a growing number of studies. In this study, a well-dated thick lacustrine sequence is chosen in Northwest China and detailed geochemical analysis is conducted during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT, 14–11 Ma). The multi-proxy records (Na 2 O/Al 2 O 3 , CIA, Rb/Sr) revealed that chemical weathering was the strongest during 11.85–11 Ma, the coldest period in 14–11 Ma as evidenced by the global deep-sea oxygen isotope records. Accordingly, we conclude that global climate cooled during MMCT and reached the coldest during 11.85–11 Ma. Thus, the westerly circulation became the strongest during this period, which brought more water vapor to Northwest China and the chemical weathering was significantly improved. On the other hand, the significant decrease in temperature led to the marked weakening of evapotranspiration, and thus the effective humidity was relatively increased. Both aspects contribute greatly to the significant enhancement of chemical weathering in eastern Central Asia. This weathering history of the sediments in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is of great scientific significance to understanding tectonism and climate change in Asia during MMCT."
https://openalex.org/W4229061970,"Increased preoperative red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with higher mortality following non-cardiac surgery in patients older than 65 years. Little is known if this association holds for all adult emergency laparotomy patients and whether it affects 30-day or long-term mortality. Thus, we examined the relationship between increased RDW and postoperative mortality. Furthermore, we investigated the prognostic worth of anisocytosis and explored a possible association between increased RDW and frailty in this cohort. We conducted a retrospective, single centre National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) database study at St Mary's Hospital Imperial NHS Trust between January 2014 and April 2018. A total of 356 patients were included. Survival models were developed using Cox regression analysis, whereas RDW and frailty were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Underlying model assumptions were checked, including discrimination and calibration. We internally validated our models using bootstrap resampling. There were 33 (9.3%) deaths within 30-days and 72 (20.2%) overall. Median RDW values for 30-day mortality were 13.8% (IQR 13.1%-15%) in survivors and 14.9% (IQR 13.7%-16.1%) in non-survivors, p = 0.007. Similarly, median RDW values were lower in overall survivors (13.7% (IQR 13%-14.7%) versus 14.9% (IQR 13.9%-15.9%) (p<0.001)). Mortality increased across quartiles of RDW, as did the proportion of frail patients. Anisocytosis was not associated with 30-day mortality but demonstrated a link with overall death rates. Increasing RDW was associated with a higher probability of frailty for 30-day (Odds ratio (OR) 4.3, 95% CI 1.22-14.43, (p = 0.01)) and overall mortality (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.68-14.09, (p = 0.001)). We were able to show that preoperative anisocytosis is associated with greater long-term mortality after emergency laparotomy. Increasing RDW demonstrates a relationship with frailty. Given that RDW is readily available at no additional cost, future studies should prospectively validate the role of RDW in the NELA cohort nationally."
https://openalex.org/W4229076380,"Diameter is currently the only screening and diagnostic criterion for asymptomatic aneurysms. Therefore, aortic and lower-extremity arterial diameter has diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic importance. We aimed to determine aortic and lower-extremity arterial reference diameters in a general population and compare them according to age, sex, and other characteristics.We evaluated consecutive 3,692 patients who underwent computed tomography as part of a general health checkup from 2015-2019 in a single tertiary center. Aortic and lower-extremity arterial diameters and the most important factor related to arterial diameters were evaluated.The mean diameter of the abdominal aorta was 17.490 ± 2.110 mm, while that of the common iliac artery was 10.851 ± 1.689 mm. The mean diameter of the abdominal aorta was 18.377 ± 1.766 mm in men and 15.884 ± 1.694 mm in women. Significant intersex differences were observed for all mean diameters and lengths. Multilinear regression analysis showed that age, sex, and body surface area impacted mean diameters of all measured sites except aorta and common iliac artery length. Between male and female patients matched for body surface area, there were significant intersex differences for all measured sites, except for common iliac artery length.The mean diameter of the abdominal aorta in this healthy cohort was 17.490 ± 2.110 mm overall, 18.377 ± 1.766 mm in men, and 15.884 ± 1.694 mm in women. Arterial diameter increased with male sex, older age, and increased body surface area, and aortic diameters were larger in men than in women with the same body surface area."
