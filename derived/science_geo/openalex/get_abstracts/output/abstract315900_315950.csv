https://openalex.org/W2000029449,"Traditionally studies of cold tolerance in insects have focused on seasonal adaptations related to overwintering that are observed after weeks or months of exposure to low temperature. In contrast, an extremely rapid cold-hardening response was observed in nonoverwintering stages that confers protection against injury due to cold shock at temperatures above the supercooling point. This response was observed in nondiapausing larvae and pharate adults of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis, nondiapausing adults of the elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca luteola, and the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. The rapid hardening response is correlated with the accumulation of glycerol."
https://openalex.org/W2023844609,"Haffer's refuge theory proposes that during the arid climatic phases of the late Pleistocene, tropical lowland forests of Amazonia were reduced to isolated patches contributing to the high species richness of the present-day forest. The theory was developed because no obvious historic or modern geomorphic isolation barriers were recorded in Amazonia. Analyses of radar images combined with stratigraphical data show that in the basinal forelands of the tectonically active Andes the geological setting causes long-term fluvial perturbance. This leads to a temporally structured highly complex mosaic of fossil and present floodplains. These dynamics have been present with varying activity and geographic range during the Tertiary and Quaternary, providing site-turnover that has not been recognized by the biogeographic tradition of the Amazon basin."

Individual domains between fracture-zone-like discontinuities contain a variety of bilaterally symmetrical topographic elements that suggest that topographic features have been created at rise crests, rifted and separated, and moved laterally to their present symmetrical positions. The topographic and morphologic similarities, together with strikingly similar mirror-image map patterns on both sides of the rise axis, suggest that western Aphrodite Terra shares the characteristics of oceanic divergent plate boundaries, and is the site of crustal spreading on Venus. Topographic profiles are consistent with spreading rates of the order of several centimeters per year."

Values of τc range from 0.46 to 20 picoseconds. The solvent dependence of τc cannot be explained in terms of solvent polarity, molecular dipole moment, solvent basicity, solvent dielectric relaxation, or solvent viscosity. The rapid rotation and the variation with solvent can be accounted for by a model that involves hydrogen bonding of an NH proton to more than one solvent molecule in a disordered solvation environment."
https://openalex.org/W2093721221,"The mechanism of formation of polymer molecules in the gas phase is difficult to study because the involatile polymers tend to condense out of that phase. However, new techniques, involving the use of cloud chambers, have enabled workers to use the nucleation of liquid drops in supersaturated monomer vapors to detect single polymer molecules and therefore to work with so few simultaneously growing polymers that aggregation and condensation are avoided. Chain polymerization in which the chain carriers are either radicals or ions can therefore be studied in the vapor. Furthermore, the ability to work with such small concentrations of growing polymeric radicals, for example, makes it possible to avoid encounters between them that lead to recombination and the formation of ""dead"" polymers that are incapable of further growth. Many aspects of gas-phase polymerization can be studied including, besides radical and ion chains, ring-opening polymerization, initiation, radiation-induced polymerization, and especially ""ultraslow"" chemistry."

https://openalex.org/W2046975080,"Research in Antarctica is becoming increasingly important in the large interdisciplinary studies of connections within the earth's geosphere-biosphere system. Four examples of broad research areas are discussed. Upper atmosphere research explores the sun-earth interactions, which are most intense in the polar regions. The mass balance and dynamics of the large Antarctic ice sheet, and its paleoclimatic records recovered from deep ice cores, are important indicators of past and present global changes. Antarctica and sediment cores from the Southern Ocean contain the history of inception and growth of the ice masses and their subsequent fluctuations, and the long-term history of paleoclimate. The remarkable adaptations of Antarctic biota to extreme cold and drought may allow, through biotic monitoring, the detection of changes in the ocean and climate of Antarctica."
