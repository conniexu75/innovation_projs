https://openalex.org/W1996646964,"Data on the distribution and abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation in Chesapeake Bay indicate a significant reduction in all species in all sections of the bay during the last 15 to 20 years. This decline is unprecedented in the bay's recent history. The reduction in one major species, Zostera marina, may be greater than the decline that occurred during the pandemic demise of the 1930' s."

There are deformed Quaternary terraces, which indicate long-term deformation in the valleys of the alluvial rivers that cross these structures, and there are floodplain and channel convexities that provide evidence of modern deformation. In addition, the channels show significant variations of morphology (sinuosity, gradient, and depth) and behavior appropriate to reaches of increased and decreased valley slope. These alluvial rivers are adjusting to modern deformation and their adjustment confirms two geodetic leveling anomalies."

Preliminary results show that igneous rock units can be identified from their free silica content, and that carbonate as well as clay-bearing units are readily separable on the digitally processed images."

https://openalex.org/W2059296242,"A model for the process of meteorite concentration in blue ice regions of the Antarctic ice sheet is proposed based on data from near the Allan Hills and the assumptions that both meteorite influx and glacial flow have been constant. The meteorite influx is calculated to be 60 × 10-6 kilogram per square kilometer per year, and the age of the exposed ice to be 0 to 600,000 years, varying with distance from the Allan Hills. These results are in line with other estimates of influx rate and with measurements of the terrestrial ages of the meteorites, providing support for the assumption of steady flow and meteorite influx. This may be the oldest sequence of ice in stratigraphic order yet discovered, and the results imply that this part of the east Antarctic ice sheet has been approximately steady during this time interval."
https://openalex.org/W1971698733,"Crab zoeae (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) were exposed during their development opment to a range of free cupric ion activities regulated in seawater by use of a copper chelate buffer system. Most cytosolic copper was found to be associated with metallothionein. Copper-thionein could be related to free cupric ion activity, and a shift in copper-thionein accumulation was correlated with inhibition of larval growth. These data reveal predictable relations between cupric ion activity in seawater and processes at the cellular and organismic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2092881067,"Genetic engineering applied to the production of fish, molluscs, algae, algal products, and crustaceans in natural environments and hatchery systems is still at the rudimentary stage. Cloning systems for producing commercially important chemicals, pharmacologically active compounds, and metamorphosis-stimulating substances present in marine organisms are being sought. Attempts are being made to develop useful drugs from the sea, including antineoplastic, antibiotic, growth-promoting (or -inhibiting), analgesic, and antispasmodic agents. Immediate commercial applications can be expected from engineered systems involving polysaccharide and specialty chemical production, with marine microorganisms as the source of genetic material."
https://openalex.org/W1987070114,"The Voyager spacecraft observed a narrow, eccentric ringlet in the Maxwell gap (1.45 Saturn radii) in Saturn's rings. Intercomparison of the Voyager imaging, photopolarimeter, ultraviolet spectrometer, and radio science observations yields results not available from individual observations. The width of the ringlet varies from about 30 to about 100 kilometers, its edges are sharp on a radial scale < 1 kilometer, and its opacity exhibits a double peak near the center. The shape and width of the ringlet are consistent with a set of uniformly precessing, confocal ellipses with foci at Saturn's center of mass. The ringlet precesses as a unit at a rate consistent with the known dynamical oblateness of Saturn; the lack of differential precession across the ringlet yields a ringlet mass of about 5 x 10(18) grams. The ratio of surface mass density to particle cross-sectional area is about five times smaller than values obtained elsewhere in the Saturn ring system, indicating a relatively larger fraction of small particles. Also, comparison of the measured transmission of the ringlet at radio, visible, and ultraviolet wavelengths indicates that about half of the total extinction is due to particles smaller than 1 centimeter in radius, in contrast even with nearby regions of the C ring. However, the color and brightness of the ringlet material are not measurably different from those of nearby C ring particles. We find this ringlet is similar to several of the rings of Uranus."
https://openalex.org/W2006417174,"Danaus chrysippus has two common forms, chrysippus and dorippus, in east Africa. Form chrysippus males have a mating advantage lasting 3 to 4 months, which is lost as their frequency increases. Female dorippus are normally superior to female chrysippus in sexual vigor. Sexual selection favoring different morphs in each sex contributes to the maintenance of the polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W1996260310,"In a bed of anthracite or bituminous coke fluidized by air at 10 to 15 meters per second at 1200 degrees to 1400 degrees C, molten ash forms beads on the surface of a coke particle, some exuding from its interior. The beads merge and detach them-selves to grow further as loose fluidized ash agglomerates of low carbon content."
https://openalex.org/W2083128082,A new method of separating isotopes in a gaseous mixture is described. The method takes advantage of the differences in velocities of isotopic species in a molecular beam formed by expansion of the mixture with a light gas from a nozzle source. For the separation of the hexafluorides of uranium-235 and uranium-238 the technique has an estimated separative work factor about 500 times higher than the gaseous diffusion process and 100 times higher than the curved-jet method.

https://openalex.org/W1971632131,"Convective heat flow measurements of a basaltic lava flow were made during the 1983 eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. Eight field measurements of induced natural convection were made, giving heat flux values that ranged from 1.78 to 8.09 kilowatts per square meter at lava temperatures of 1088 and 1128 degrees Celsius, respectively. These field measurements of convective heat flux at subliquidus temperatures agree with previous laboratory measurements in furnace-melted samples of molten lava, and are useful for predicting heat transfer in magma bodies and for estimating heat extraction rates for magma energy."

https://openalex.org/W2037844363,"Forecasts for crude petroleum consumption are presented which take into account attempts by the Federal Energy Office to regulate residential and commercial thermostats. On the basis of an economic demand model, it is found that lowering all thermostats by 6°F would lower the projected residential and commercial petroleum demand in 1973 by 12 percent. This amount is compared to forecasts made by the Federal Energy Office and to the effect of a price increase of $0.10 per gallon for heating oil."

https://openalex.org/W2068329237,"With today's technology, the center-of-mass energy of proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions can be extended by an order of magnitude beyond that achievable with machines presently in operation or under construction. Such a facility would open a vast new energy region which has been suggested theoretically to contain new kinds of particles and interactions. Several accelerator options, their rate capabilities, and their costs are described."

https://openalex.org/W1967901183,"In his editorial Acid rain Philip H. Abelson writes that everyone who drives an automobile is a contributor to acid rain. Examination of emissions data indicates that controlling automobile emissions will contribute little to solving acid precipitation problems. Of the strong acid anions associated with precipitation acidity, sulfate accounts for about 60% and nitrate for about 40%, on an equivalence basis. The contribution to national SO/sub 2/ emissions by all forms of transportation is about 3%. The corresponding value for national NO/sub x/ emissions is about 44%. If ground-level emissions from highway vehicles contribute to long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants and to precipitation acidity on an equal basis with other sources, for example, power plant smokestacks, then the respective contributions to precipitation acidity can be approximated. The atmospheric chemistry of NO/sub x/ and its interaction with SO/sub 2/ is poorly known. However, it is likely that automobiles account for less than 14% of total equivalents of strong acid anions in either wet or dry deposition in the eastern US. The implication of these data for regulatory policies aimed at controlling acid precipitation by reducing SO/sub 2/ and NO/sub x/ emissions is obvious."

https://openalex.org/W1982508185,"An estimated 20,000 to 30,000 transformers contain toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls). While data on effects of low-dose PCBs are not clearcut, a recent study indicates firefighters, for example, could be more at risk than currently believed because furans are formed when PCBs in transformers are intensely hot. California and Florida utility companies have spent millions of dollars to replace transformers. The Environmental Protection Agency appears ready to accede to demands to replace PCB-containing electrical equipment more quickly than just as equipment wears out."
