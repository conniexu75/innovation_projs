https://openalex.org/W2061071534,"Naturally occurring Foxp3 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. Here, we show that a specific deficiency of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in Tregs results in spontaneous development of systemic lymphoproliferation, fatal T cell–mediated autoimmune disease, and hyperproduction of immunoglobulin E in mice, and it also produces potent tumor immunity. Treg-specific CTLA-4 deficiency impairs in vivo and in vitro suppressive function of Tregs—in particular, Treg-mediated down-regulation of CD80 and CD86 expression on dendritic cells. Thus, natural Tregs may critically require CTLA-4 to suppress immune responses by affecting the potency of antigen-presenting cells to activate other T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2096853390,"Susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a complex inflammatory disease involving the small intestine, is controlled by over 30 loci. One Crohn's disease risk allele is in ATG16L1, a gene homologous to the essential yeast autophagy gene ATG16 (ref. 2). It is not known how ATG16L1 or autophagy contributes to intestinal biology or Crohn's disease pathogenesis. To address these questions, we generated and characterized mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 protein expression, and validated conclusions on the basis of studies in these mice by analysing intestinal tissues that we collected from Crohn's disease patients carrying the Crohn's disease risk allele of ATG16L1. Here we show that ATG16L1 is a bona fide autophagy protein. Within the ileal epithelium, both ATG16L1 and a second essential autophagy protein ATG5 are selectively important for the biology of the Paneth cell, a specialized epithelial cell that functions in part by secretion of granule contents containing antimicrobial peptides and other proteins that alter the intestinal environment. ATG16L1- and ATG5-deficient Paneth cells exhibited notable abnormalities in the granule exocytosis pathway. In addition, transcriptional analysis revealed an unexpected gain of function specific to ATG16L1-deficient Paneth cells including increased expression of genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling and lipid metabolism, of acute phase reactants and of two adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin, known to directly influence intestinal injury responses. Importantly, Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk allele displayed Paneth cell granule abnormalities similar to those observed in autophagy-protein-deficient mice and expressed increased levels of leptin protein. Thus, ATG16L1, and probably the process of autophagy, have a role within the intestinal epithelium of mice and Crohn's disease patients by selective effects on the cell biology and specialized regulatory properties of Paneth cells."
https://openalex.org/W2103209538,"Many studies suggest that global warming is driving species ranges poleward and toward higher elevations at temperate latitudes, but evidence for range shifts is scarce for the tropics, where the shallow latitudinal temperature gradient makes upslope shifts more likely than poleward shifts. Based on new data for plants and insects on an elevational transect in Costa Rica, we assess the potential for lowland biotic attrition, range-shift gaps, and mountaintop extinctions under projected warming. We conclude that tropical lowland biotas may face a level of net lowland biotic attrition without parallel at higher latitudes (where range shifts may be compensated for by species from lower latitudes) and that a high proportion of tropical species soon faces gaps between current and projected elevational ranges."
https://openalex.org/W2009552537,"We provide a century-scale view of small-mammal responses to global warming, without confounding effects of land-use change, by repeating Grinnell's early–20th century survey across a 3000-meter-elevation gradient that spans Yosemite National Park, California, USA. Using occupancy modeling to control for variation in detectability, we show substantial (∼500 meters on average) upward changes in elevational limits for half of 28 species monitored, consistent with the observed ∼3°C increase in minimum temperatures. Formerly low-elevation species expanded their ranges and high-elevation species contracted theirs, leading to changed community composition at mid- and high elevations. Elevational replacement among congeners changed because species' responses were idiosyncratic. Though some high-elevation species are threatened, protection of elevation gradients allows other species to respond via migration."
https://openalex.org/W1984522719,"Neuromuscular synapse formation requires a complex exchange of signals between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers, leading to the accumulation of postsynaptic proteins, including acetylcholine receptors in the muscle membrane and specialized release sites, or active zones in the presynaptic nerve terminal. MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed in skeletal muscle, and Agrin, a motor neuron-derived ligand that stimulates MuSK phosphorylation, play critical roles in synaptic differentiation, as synapses do not form in their absence, and mutations in MuSK or downstream effectors are a major cause of a group of neuromuscular disorders, termed congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). How Agrin activates MuSK and stimulates synaptic differentiation is not known and remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of signaling at neuromuscular synapses. Here, we report that Lrp4, a member of the LDLR family, is a receptor for Agrin, forms a complex with MuSK, and mediates MuSK activation by Agrin."
https://openalex.org/W2047632644,"Genomic data allow the large-scale manual or semi-automated assembly of metabolic network reconstructions, which provide highly curated organism-specific knowledge bases. Although several genome-scale network reconstructions describe Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, they differ in scope and content, and use different terminologies to describe the same chemical entities. This makes comparisons between them difficult and underscores the desirability of a consolidated metabolic network that collects and formalizes the 'community knowledge' of yeast metabolism. We describe how we have produced a consensus metabolic network reconstruction for S. cerevisiae. In drafting it, we placed special emphasis on referencing molecules to persistent databases or using database-independent forms, such as SMILES or InChI strings, as this permits their chemical structure to be represented unambiguously and in a manner that permits automated reasoning. The reconstruction is readily available via a publicly accessible database and in the Systems Biology Markup Language ( http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet ). It can be maintained as a resource that serves as a common denominator for studying the systems biology of yeast. Similar strategies should benefit communities studying genome-scale metabolic networks of other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1970277428,"During early fasting, increases in skeletal muscle proteolysis liberate free amino acids for hepatic gluconeogenesis in response to pancreatic glucagon. Hepatic glucose output diminishes during the late protein-sparing phase of fasting, when ketone body production by the liver supplies compensatory fuel for glucose-dependent tissues. Glucagon stimulates the gluconeogenic program by triggering the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2; also known as TORC2), while parallel decreases in insulin signalling augment gluconeogenic gene expression through the dephosphorylation and nuclear shuttling of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Here we show that a fasting-inducible switch, consisting of the histone acetyltransferase p300 and the nutrient-sensing deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), maintains energy balance in mice through the sequential induction of CRTC2 and FOXO1. After glucagon induction, CRTC2 stimulated gluconeogenic gene expression by an association with p300, which we show here is also activated by dephosphorylation at Ser 89 during fasting. In turn, p300 increased hepatic CRTC2 activity by acetylating it at Lys 628, a site that also targets CRTC2 for degradation after its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase constitutive photomorphogenic protein (COP1). Glucagon effects were attenuated during late fasting, when CRTC2 was downregulated owing to SIRT1-mediated deacetylation and when FOXO1 supported expression of the gluconeogenic program. Disrupting SIRT1 activity, by liver-specific knockout of the Sirt1 gene or by administration of a SIRT1 antagonist, increased CRTC2 activity and glucose output, whereas exposure to SIRT1 agonists reduced them. In view of the reciprocal activation of FOXO1 and its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha, encoded by Ppargc1a) by SIRT1 activators, our results illustrate how the exchange of two gluconeogenic regulators during fasting maintains energy balance."

https://openalex.org/W2167877584,"DNA from low-biodiversity fracture water collected at 2.8-kilometer depth in a South African gold mine was sequenced and assembled into a single, complete genome. This bacterium, Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator , composes &gt;99.9% of the microorganisms inhabiting the fluid phase of this particular fracture. Its genome indicates a motile, sporulating, sulfate-reducing, chemoautotrophic thermophile that can fix its own nitrogen and carbon by using machinery shared with archaea. Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator is capable of an independent life-style well suited to long-term isolation from the photosphere deep within Earth's crust and offers an example of a natural ecosystem that appears to have its biological component entirely encoded within a single genome."
https://openalex.org/W2053014389,"The massive visual input from the eye to the brain requires selective processing of some visual information at the expense of other information, a process referred to as visual attention. Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex. Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Crick argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that ""if the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway"", a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN."
https://openalex.org/W2070623737,"A variety of reactive oxygen species react readily with methionine residues in proteins to form methionine sulfoxide, thus scavenging the reactive species. Most cells contain methionine sulfoxide reductases, which catalyze a thioredoxin-dependent reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to methionine. Thus, methionine residues may act as catalytic antioxidants, protecting both the protein where they are located and other macromolecules. To test this hypothesis directly, we replaced 40% of the methionine residues in Escherichia coli with norleucine, the carbon-containing analog, in which the sulfur of methionine is substituted by a methylene group (-CH2-). The intracellular free methionine and S-adenosylmethionine pools were not altered, nor was the specific activity of the key enzyme, glutamine synthetase. When unstressed, both control and norleucine-substituted cells survived equally well at stationary phase for at least 32 h. However, oxidative stress was more damaging to the norleucine-substituted cells. They died more rapidly than control cells when challenged by hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, or ionizing radiation. One of the most abundant proteins in the cell, elongation factor Tu, was found to be more oxidatively modified in norleucine-substituted cells, consistent with loss of the antioxidant defense provided by methionine residues. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that methionine in protein acts as an endogenous antioxidant in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1995796039,"Reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) from neuronal latency is a common and potentially devastating cause of disease worldwide. CD8 + T cells can completely inhibit HSV reactivation in mice, with interferon-γ affording a portion of this protection. We found that CD8 + T cell lytic granules are also required for the maintenance of neuronal latency both in vivo and in ex vivo ganglia cultures and that their directed release to the junction with neurons in latently infected ganglia did not induce neuronal apoptosis. Here, we describe a nonlethal mechanism of viral inactivation in which the lytic granule component, granzyme B, degrades the HSV-1 immediate early protein, ICP4, which is essential for further viral gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2035031395,"The APOBEC family members are involved in diverse biological functions. APOBEC3G restricts the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and retroelements by cytidine deamination on single-stranded DNA or by RNA binding. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal deaminase domain of APOBEC3G (APOBEC3G-CD2) purified from Escherichia coli. The APOBEC3G-CD2 structure has a five-stranded beta-sheet core that is common to all known deaminase structures and closely resembles the structure of another APOBEC protein, APOBEC2 (ref. 5). A comparison of APOBEC3G-CD2 with other deaminase structures shows a structural conservation of the active-site loops that are directly involved in substrate binding. In the X-ray structure, these APOBEC3G active-site loops form a continuous 'substrate groove' around the active centre. The orientation of this putative substrate groove differs markedly (by 90 degrees) from the groove predicted by the NMR structure. We have introduced mutations around the groove, and have identified residues involved in substrate specificity, single-stranded DNA binding and deaminase activity. These results provide a basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of substrate specificity for the APOBEC family."
https://openalex.org/W2087444873,"It could be argued that the greatest transformative aspect of the Human Genome Project has been not the sequencing of the genome itself, but the resultant development of new technologies. A host of new approaches has fundamentally changed the way we approach problems in basic and translational research. Now, a new generation of high-throughput sequencing technologies promises to again transform the scientific enterprise, potentially supplanting array-based technologies and opening up many new possibilities. By allowing DNA/RNA to be assayed more rapidly than previously possible, these next-generation platforms promise a deeper understanding of genome regulation and biology. Significantly enhancing sequencing throughput will allow us to follow the evolution of viral and bacterial resistance in real time, to uncover the huge diversity of novel genes that are currently inaccessible, to understand nucleic acid therapeutics, to better integrate biological information for a complete picture of health and disease at a personalized level and to move to advances that we cannot yet imagine."
https://openalex.org/W2083763767,"Background Many men develop a rising PSA after initial therapy for prostate cancer. While some of these men will develop a local or metastatic recurrence that warrants further therapy, others will have no evidence of disease progression. We hypothesized that an expression biomarker panel can predict which men with a rising PSA would benefit from further therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings A case-control design was used to test the association of gene expression with outcome. Systemic (SYS) progression cases were men post-prostatectomy who developed systemic progression within 5 years after PSA recurrence. PSA progression controls were matched men post-prostatectomy with PSA recurrence but no evidence of clinical progression within 5 years. Using expression arrays optimized for paraffin-embedded tissue RNA, 1021 cancer-related genes were evaluated–including 570 genes implicated in prostate cancer progression. Genes from 8 previously reported marker panels were included. A systemic progression model containing 17 genes was developed. This model generated an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84–0.92). Similar AUCs were generated using 3 previously reported panels. In secondary analyses, the model predicted the endpoints of prostate cancer death (in SYS cases) and systemic progression beyond 5 years (in PSA controls) with hazard ratios 2.5 and 4.7, respectively (log-rank p-values of 0.0007 and 0.0005). Genes mapped to 8q24 were significantly enriched in the model. Conclusions/Significance Specific gene expression patterns are significantly associated with systemic progression after PSA recurrence. The measurement of gene expression pattern may be useful for determining which men may benefit from additional therapy after PSA recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2084253472,"As part of the response to exogenous DNA damage, the transcription of certain genes involved in cell cycle checkpoints and survival is affected; these changes help the cell to maintain its genomic integrity. There are also situations in which endogenous, physiological DNA double-strand breaks occur. In this work, Bredemeyer et al. show that the breaks which initiate the rearrangement of antigen receptor genes also activate a transcriptional program — but with a difference. Many of the regulated genes are involved in lymphocyte development. Thus, DNA breaks can regulate cell-type-specific processes and not just functions that will allow the cell to repair and survive a DNA break. As part of the response to exogenous DNA damage, the transcription of certain genes involved in cell cycle checkpoints and survival is affected; these changes help the cell to maintain its genomic integrity. There are also situations in which endogenous, physiological DNA double-strand breaks occur. This paper shows that the breaks which initiate the rearrangement of antigen receptor genes also activate a transcriptional program, but with a difference. Many of the regulated genes are involved in lymphocyte development. DNA double-strand breaks are generated by genotoxic agents and by cellular endonucleases as intermediates of several important physiological processes. The cellular response to genotoxic DNA breaks includes the activation of transcriptional programs known primarily to regulate cell-cycle checkpoints and cell survival1,2,3,4,5. DNA double-strand breaks are generated in all developing lymphocytes during the assembly of antigen receptor genes, a process that is essential for normal lymphocyte development. Here we show that in murine lymphocytes these physiological DNA breaks activate a broad transcriptional program. This program transcends the canonical DNA double-strand break response and includes many genes that regulate diverse cellular processes important for lymphocyte development. Moreover, the expression of several of these genes is regulated similarly in response to genotoxic DNA damage. Thus, physiological DNA double-strand breaks provide cues that can regulate cell-type-specific processes not directly involved in maintaining the integrity of the genome, and genotoxic DNA breaks could disrupt normal cellular functions by corrupting these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2149073460,"Brain edema and the consequent increase in intracranial pressure and brain herniation are major complications of acute liver failure (fulminant hepatic failure) and a major cause of death in this condition. Ammonia has been strongly implicated as an important factor, and astrocyte swelling appears to be primarily responsible for the edema. Ammonia is known to cause cell swelling in cultured astrocytes, although the means by which this occurs has not been fully elucidated. A disturbance in one or more of these systems may result in loss of ion homeostasis and cell swelling. In particular, activation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been shown to be involved in cell swelling in several neurological disorders. We therefore examined the effect of ammonia on NKCC activity and its potential role in the swelling of astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were exposed to ammonia (NH4Cl; 5 mm), and NKCC activity was measured. Ammonia increased NKCC activity at 24 h. Inhibition of this activity by bumetanide diminished ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling. Ammonia also increased total as well as phosphorylated NKCC1. Treatment with cyclohexamide, a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, diminished NKCC1 protein expression and NKCC activity. Since ammonia is known to induce oxidative/nitrosative stress, and antioxidants and nitric-oxide synthase inhibition diminish astrocyte swelling, we also examined whether ammonia caused oxidation and/or nitration of NKCC1. Cultures exposed to ammonia increased the state of oxidation and nitration of NKCC1, whereas the antioxidants N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and uric acid all significantly diminished NKCC activity. These agents also reduced phosphorylated NKCC1 expression. These results suggest that activation of NKCC1 is an important factor in the mediation of astrocyte swelling by ammonia and that such activation appears to be mediated by NKCC1 abundance as well as by its oxidation/nitration and phosphorylation.

Mechanisms mediating the astrocyte swelling and the subsequent brain edema in fulminant hepatic failure remain poorly understood. Ion channels, exchangers, and transporters represent important factors in the mechanism of cell volume regulation (for reviews, see Refs. 8Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev.

This study investigated whether NKCC activation occurs in ammonia-treated astrocyte cultures and whether such activation contributes to astrocyte swelling. Our findings demonstrate that ammonia increased NKCC activity, which was associated with an increase in total and phosphorylated NKCC1 protein expression, as well as in its oxidation and nitration. Blocking NKCC activity with bumetanide attenuated ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling. Altogether, our findings suggest that activation of NKCC plays an important role in the mediation of ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling and possibly in the brain edema associated with fulminant hepatic failure. Astrocyte Cultures—Astrocyte cultures were prepared from brains of 1–2-day-old rat pups by the method of Ducis et al. (31Ducis I. Norenberg L.O.B. Norenberg M.D. Brain Res. 1990; 531: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were freed of meninges, minced, dissociated by trituration and vortexing, passed through sterile nylon sieves, placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber provided with 5% CO2 and 95% air. After 10 days in culture, bovine serum was replaced with 10% horse serum. After 14 days, cultures were treated and maintained with dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma) so as to enhance cell differentiation (32Juurlink B.H. Hertz L. Dev. Neurosci. 1985; 7: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cultures consisted of at least 98% astrocytes, as determined by glial fibrillary acidic protein and glutamine synthetase immunocytochemistry. The remaining cells consisted of microglia. Experiments were carried out in 3–4-week-old cells. Procedures followed guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the local animal care committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). NKCC Activity—NKCC activity was measured as the bumetanide-sensitive K+ influx, using 86Rb as a tracer for K+ by a modification of the method of Sun and Murali (33Sun D. Murali S.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary astrocyte cultures were treated once with a pathophysiological concentration of ammonia (NH4Cl; 5 mm); such a value is found in the brains of animals with acute liver failure (34Swain M. Butterworth R.F. Blei A.T. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The ammonia concentration in the medium rapidly declines to undetectable levels by 30–60 min. 4M. D. Norenberg, unpublished observation. At the end of the treatment (24 h), cultures were equilibrated and preincubated with or without 50 μm bumetanide for 15–30 min at 37 °C in an isotonic HEPES-minimal essential medium (140 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 1.27 mm CaCl2, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 5.55 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (300 mosm)). Cultures were then exposed to 1 μCi/ml 86Rb for 3 min and subsequently rinsed with ice-cold 0.1 m MgCl2. Cells were then extracted in 1% SDS, and the radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation. The 86Rb influx rate was calculated by subtracting the influx (with bumetanide) from total influx (without bumetanide) and expressed as nmol of 86Rb/mg of protein/min. Quadruplicate determinations were obtained throughout the study, and the protein content was determined employing the BCA assay (Pierce). Measurement of Intracellular Na+ Concentration [Na+]i—As another measure of NKCC activity, [Na+]i level was determined by modifications of the methods of Rose and Ransom (35Rose C.R. Ransom B.R. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Su et al. (26Su G. Kintner D.B. Sun D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1136-C1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), employing the fluorescent dye sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxy methyl esters-AM. Culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed two times with 2 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) HEPES-minimal essential medium. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for 1 h in 2 ml of fresh HEPES-minimal essential medium containing 0.05% pluronic acid and 10 μm sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxy methyl esters-AM. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped into 500 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100 and sonicated for 5 s. A small aliquot of the cell extract was removed for protein estimation, and fluorescence intensity was measured in the remaining solution with a spectrofluorophotometer (Spectrophotofluorome, RF-1501; Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Norcross, GA) at dual excitation wavelength of 340 nm/385 nm, and emission fluorescence at 510 nm. Protein content was determined by the BCA method. The results were expressed as fluorescence intensity units/mg of protein. Cell Volume Determination—Cell volume was estimated by measuring the intracellular water space by the method of Kletzien et al. (36Kletzein R.F. Pariza M.W. Becker J.E. Potter V.R. Ann. Biochem. 1975; 68: 537-544Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar), as modified by Kimelberg (37Kimelberg H.K. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1987; 82: 294-303PubMed Google Scholar) and Bender and Norenberg (38Bender A.S. Norenberg M.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mm 3-O-methylglucose and 0.5 μCi/ml 3H-labeled 3-O-methylglucose were added to the culture 6 h before the volume assay. At the end of the incubation period, culture medium was aspirated, and an aliquot was saved for radioactivity determination. Cells were rapidly washed six times with ice-cold buffer containing 229 mm sucrose, 1 mm Tris nitrate, 0.5 mm calcium nitrate, and 0.1 mm phloretin, pH 7.4. Cells were then harvested into 0.5 ml of 1 n sodium hydroxide. Radioactivity in the cell extracts and medium were determined, and an aliquot of the cell extract was used for protein estimation (BCA method). Values were normalized to protein level, and the cell volume was expressed as μl/mg of protein. Western Blots—Astrocyte cultures were solubilized in lysis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and protein levels were measured by the BCA method. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to gel electrophoresis, as previously described (39Jayakumar A.R. Panickar K.S. Murthy C.R.K. Norenberg M.D. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4774-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following blocking with nonfat dry milk, membranes were incubated with respective antibodies. Total NKCC1 antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Primary antibodies to detect phosphorylated (R5) and total NKCC1 were used at 1:1000. Anti-α-tubulin antibody was obtained from Oncogene (San Diego, CA). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) were used at 1:1000. Optical density of the bands were determined with the Chemi-Imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) digital imaging system, and the results were quantified with the Sigma Scan Pro (Jandell Scientific, San Jose, CA) program as a proportion of the signal of a housekeeping protein band (α-tubulin). Determination of NKCC1 Oxidation and Nitration—NKCC1 oxidative adducts (an index of protein oxidation) were determined in NKCC1-immunoprecipitated samples by using the OxyBlot™ protein oxidation detection kit (S7150; Chemicon International). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with NKCC1 (T4) antibody (developed by Christian Lytle, University of California, Riverside; obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by the University of Iowa Department of Biological Sciences (Iowa City, IA)) and subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described above. Anti-nitrotyrosine (mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000; catalog number 487923; Calbiochem) was used to detect nitrated NKCC1 (T4). Each experimental group consisted of 4–5 culture dishes/experiment for each time point studied in the cell swelling experiments. At least 2–4 plates were used for Western blot analysis. All experiments were performed from 4–7 separate seedings. Data were subjected to ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post hoc comparisons. At each time point, the experimental cultures were compared with their respective controls. Activation of NKCC by Ammonia in Cultured Astrocytes—Ammonia significantly increased NKCC activity, as measured by the bumetanide-sensitive K+ influx, using 86Rb as a tracer for K+. The initial increase was observed at 12 h (37.5%; p < 0.05 versus control), which persisted up to 24 h, with the peak increase occurring at 18 and 24 h (61.4 and 63%, respectively; p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig. 1). Ammonia Increased [Na+]i—As another measure of NKCC1 activity, we examined [Na+]i after exposure to ammonia for 24 h. [Na+]i was measured in the presence or absence of the NKCC inhibitor bumetanide. Cultures exposed to ammonia significantly increased [Na+]i (63.2%; p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig. 2). Such an increase was blocked by bumetanide (50 μm) (Fig. 2). Inhibition of NKCC Activity Attenuated Ammonia-induced Astrocyte Swelling—Astrocyte cultures were exposed to ammonia for 24 h with or without bumetanide (50 μm), and cell volume was determined. The intracellular water space of control primary astrocytes culture was 4.2 ± 0.1 μl/mg of protein. Cultures exposed to ammonia showed a significant increase in cell volume (41% as compared with control; p < 0.05). Cell swelling was significantly attenuated by treatment with 50 μm bumetanide (64%; p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig. 3). Ammonia Increased NKCC1 Protein Expression—Cultures exposed to ammonia significantly increased the total NKCC1 protein level as measured by Western blots. The initial increase was observed at 6 h and persisted for up to 24 h (Fig. 4), which was similar to the time course of NKCC activation (Fig. 1). Inhibition of Protein Synthesis Diminished Ammonia-induced NKCC1 Protein Expression and Activity—To test whether the increase in NKCC activity was associated with an increase in NKCC1 protein synthesis, astrocyte cultures were exposed to 5 mm NH4Cl in the presence or absence of different concentrations of cyclohexamide (CHX) (100 nm, 500 nm, 1 μm, 2 μm, and 3 μm). NH4Cl significantly increased total NKCC1 protein level at 24 h (46.2% as compared with control; p < 0.05). This enhancement in protein abundance was significantly reduced by treatment with 1 μm CHX (61%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). Doses other than 1 μm CHX had no significant effect on ammonia-induced increase in total NKCC1 protein expression (data not shown). We then examined whether the increase in protein abundance contributed to changes in NKCC activity. Cultures exposed to NH4Cl significantly increased NKCC activity at 24 h (61.7%), whereas treatment with 1 μm CHX significantly diminished this activity (40.1%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 5), suggesting that an ammonia-induced increase in NKCC1 protein abundance contributes to its increased activity. Ammonia Increased Phosphorylated (Activated) NKCC1 (p-NKCC1)—Cultures exposed to ammonia significantly increased p-NKCC1 protein expression. The initial increase was observed at 3 h and persisted for up to 18 h (Fig. 6). At 24 h, a slight increase (23.1%) in p-NKCC1 was observed, but it was not significant from control. Inhibition of the Ammonia-induced Increase in p-NKCC1 by Antioxidants, N-Nitro-l-arginine Methyl Ester (l-NAME), and Uric Acid—Pretreatment (15 min) of cultures with antioxidants (dimethylthiourea (100 μm), Mn(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (10 μm), catalase (250 units/ml), α-tocopherol (100 μm), and tempol (10 μm)) significantly decreased ammonia-induced increase in p-NKCC1 levels (53.7, 58.6, 50.5, 49.1, and 72.7%, respectively; p < 0.05) (Fig. 7). Cultures treated with the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NAME (250 μm) and the peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid (500 μm) also significantly diminished the ammonia-induced increase in p-NKCC1 levels (56.1 and 53.8%, respectively; p < 0.05) (Fig. 7). Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that oxidative/nitrosative stress contributes to the ammonia-induced NKCC1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Ammonia-induced NKCC Activity by Antioxidants, l-NAME, and Uric Acid—Cultures exposed to NH4Cl significantly increased NKCC activity at 24 h (74% as compared with control). Pretreatment (15 min) of cultures with antioxidants Mn(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (10 μm), dimethylthiourea (100 μm), tempol (10 μm), catalase (250 units/ml), and α-tocopherol (100 μm) significantly decreased ammonia-induced NKCC activity (68.7, 52, 69.3, 48.5, and 71.6%, respectively; p < 0.05) (Fig. 8). Although N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone diminished NKCC1 activity (by 23.6%; p < 0.05 versus NH4Cl), this decrease was not significant (Fig. 8). Cultures treated with l-NAME (250 μm) and uric acid (500 μm) also significantly diminished ammonia-induced NKCC activity (63 and 76.5%, respectively; p < 0.05) (Fig. 8). Oxidation and Nitration of NKCC1 by Ammonia—Astrocyte cultures exposed to ammonia displayed an increase in both oxidized (carbonylated) and nitrated (nitrotyrosinated) NKCC1. Increased oxidation of NKCC1 was detected at 1 h (348% as compared with control; p < 0.05), which persisted for up to 12 h (Fig. 9). Ammonia also increased the nitration of NKCC1 (1–48 h). The initial increase in nitrated NKCC1 was observed at 1 h (136.4% versus control), after which there was a decline at 3 h, followed by an increase at 6–48 h (Fig. 10). As positive controls, cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 250 μm) and the nitric oxide (NO) donors S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP; 200 μm) and 3-morpholinosydnoimine HCl (SIN-1; 500 μm). Such treatment exhibited a significant increase in oxidized and nitrated NKCC1 levels at 3 h (Fig. 11).FIGURE 10Cultured astrocytes were treated with 5 mm NH4Cl for different time periods (1–48 h), and nitrated NKCC1 was measured.

Oxidants and NO donors significantly increased NKCC activity as compared with the control group (H2O2, 58%; tert-butylhydroperoxide, 53%; SNAP, 71%; and SIN-1, 64%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 12). This study demonstrates for the first time that the ion transporter protein NKCC1 is involved in the mechanism of ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling. Cultured astrocytes exposed to ammonia increased the bumetanide-sensitive NKCC activity, which was associated with an increase in total and phosphorylated (activated) NKCC1 protein. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cyclohexamide significantly diminished NKCC1 protein expression and NKCC activity. The time course of NKCC activation paralleled the previously established time course of ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling (40Rama Rao K.V. Chen M. Simard J.M. Norenberg M.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Blocking NKCC activation with bumetanide diminished ammonia-induced cell swelling. Additionally, cultures exposed to ammonia increased the state of oxidation, nitration, and phosphorylation of NKCC1, and such protein modifications led to the increase in NKCC activity. This increase in activity was diminished by antioxidants, an NOS inhibitor (l-NAME), and a peroxynitrite scavenger (uric acid). Taken together, these findings suggest that ammonia-induced activation of NKCC is an important factor in the mediation of cell swelling in cultured astrocytes and that such activation appears to be mediated by increased NKCC1 protein abundance as well as by oxidation, nitration, and phosphorylation of NKCC1. The use of ammonia-treated cultured astrocytes as a model for hepatic encephalopathy is highly appropriate. First, substantial evidence invokes the role of ammonia in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (2Albrecht J. Jones E.A. J. Neurol.

The RTX CPD is efficiently activated by the eukaryote-specific small molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6 ), and we present the 2.1 angstrom structure of the RTX CPD in complex with InsP 6 . InsP 6 binds to a conserved basic cleft that is distant from the protease active site. Biochemical and kinetic analyses of CPD mutants indicate that InsP 6 binding induces an allosteric switch that leads to the autoprocessing and intracellular release of toxin-effector domains."
https://openalex.org/W2061038984,"Although the cochlea is an amplifier and a remarkably sensitive and finely tuned detector of sounds, it also produces conspicuous mechanical and electrical waveform distortions. These distortions reflect nonlinear mechanical interactions within the cochlea. By allowing one tone to suppress another (masking effect), they contribute to speech intelligibility. Tones can also combine to produce sounds with frequencies not present in the acoustic stimulus. These sounds compose the otoacoustic emissions that are extensively used to screen hearing in newborns. Because both cochlear amplification and distortion originate from the outer hair cells-one of the two types of sensory receptor cells-it has been speculated that they stem from a common mechanism. Here we show that the nonlinearity underlying cochlear waveform distortions relies on the presence of stereocilin, a protein defective in a recessive form of human deafness. Stereocilin was detected in association with horizontal top connectors, lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the outer hair cell's hair bundle. These links were absent in stereocilin-null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf. At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced and both acoustic and electrical waveform distortions were completely lacking. From this unique functional situation, we conclude that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a deflection-dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic nonlinear behaviour of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel."
https://openalex.org/W2127498551,"Mutation of sarA in Staphylococcus aureus results in a reduced capacity to form a biofilm, but the mechanistic basis for this remains unknown. Previous transcriptional profiling experiments identified a number of genes that are differentially expressed both in a biofilm and in a sarA mutant. This included genes involved in acid tolerance and the production of nucleolytic and proteolytic exoenzymes. Based on this we generated mutations in alsSD, nuc and sspA in the S. aureus clinical isolate UAMS-1 and its isogenic sarA mutant and assessed the impact on biofilm formation. Because expression of alsSD was increased in a biofilm but decreased in a sarA mutant, we also generated a plasmid construct that allowed expression of alsSD in a sarA mutant. Mutation of alsSD limited biofilm formation, but not to the degree observed with the corresponding sarA mutant, and restoration of alsSD expression did not restore the ability to form a biofilm. In contrast, concomitant mutation of sarA and nuc significantly enhanced biofilm formation by comparison to the sarA mutant. Although mutation of sspA had no significant impact on the ability of a sarA mutant to form a biofilm, a combination of protease inhibitors (E-64, 1-10-phenanthroline, and dichloroisocoumarin) that was shown to inhibit the production of multiple extracellular proteases without inhibiting growth was also shown to enhance the ability of a sarA mutant to form a biofilm. This effect was evident only when all three inhibitors were used concurrently. This suggests that the reduced capacity of a sarA mutant to form a biofilm involves extracellular proteases of all three classes (serine, cysteine and metalloproteases). Inclusion of protease inhibitors also enhanced biofilm formation in a sarA/nuc mutant, with the combined effect of mutating nuc and adding protease inhibitors resulting in a level of biofilm formation with the sarA mutant that approached that of the UAMS-1 parent strain. These results demonstrate that the inability of a sarA mutant to repress production of extracellular nuclease and multiple proteases have independent but cumulative effects that make a significant contribution to the biofilm-deficient phenotype of an S. aureus sarA mutant."

https://openalex.org/W2057560723,"The integral membrane protein p22phox forms a heterodimeric enzyme complex with NADPH oxidases (Noxs) and is required for their catalytic activity. Nox4, a Nox linked to cardiovascular disease, angiogenesis, and insulin signaling, is unique in its ability to produce hydrogen peroxide constitutively. To date, p22phox constitutes the only identified regulatory component for Nox4 function. To delineate structural elements in p22phox essential for formation and localization of the Nox4-p22phox complex and its enzymatic function, truncation and point mutagenesis was used. Human lung carcinoma cells served as a heterologous expression system, since this cell type is p22phox-deficient and promotes cell surface expression of the Nox4-p22phox heterodimer. Expression of p22phox truncation mutants indicates that the dual tryptophan motif contained in the N-terminal amino acids 6-11 is essential, whereas the C terminus (amino acids 130-195) is dispensable for Nox4 activity. Introduction of charged residues in domains predicted to be extracellular by topology modeling was mostly tolerated, whereas the exchange of amino acids in predicted membrane-spanning domains caused loss of function or showed distinct differences in p22phox interaction with various Noxs. For example, the substitution of tyrosine 121 with histidine in p22phox, which abolished Nox2 and Nox3 function in vivo, preserved Nox4 activity when expressed in lung cancer cells. Many of the examined p22phox mutations inhibiting Nox1 to -3 maturation did not alter Nox4-p22phox association, further accenting the differences between Noxs. These studies highlight the distinct interaction of the key regulatory p22phox subunit with Nox4, a feature which could provide the basis for selective inhibitor development."

https://openalex.org/W2024991780,"Cystic fibrosis is characterized by recurring pulmonary exacerbations that lead to the deterioration of lung function and eventual lung failure. Excessive inflammatory responses by airway epithelia have been linked to the overproduction of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and IL-8. The mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood, but normal IL-1β mediated activation of the production of these cytokines occurs via H2O2 dependent signaling. Therefore, we speculated that CFTR dysfunction causes alterations in the regulation of steady state H2O2. We found significantly elevated levels of H2O2 in three cultured epithelial cell models of CF, one primary and two immortalized. Increases in H2O2 heavily contributed to the excessive IL-6 and IL-8 production in CF epithelia. Proteomic analysis of three in vitro and two in vivo models revealed a decrease in antioxidant proteins that regulate H2O2 processing, by ≥2 fold in CF vs. matched normal controls. When cells are stimulated, differential expression in CF versus normal is enhanced; corresponding to an increase in H2O2 mediated production of IL-6 and IL-8. The cause of this redox imbalance is a decrease by ∼70% in CF cells versus normal in the expression and activity of the transcription factor Nrf-2. Inhibition of CFTR function in normal cells produced this phenotype, while N-acetyl cysteine, selenium, an activator of Nrf-2, and the overexpression of Nrf-2 all normalized H2O2 processing and decreased IL-6 and IL-8 to normal levels, in CF cells. We conclude that a paradoxical decrease in Nrf-2 driven antioxidant responses in CF epithelia results in an increase in steady state H2O2, which in turn contributes to the overproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Treatment with antioxidants can ameliorate exaggerated cytokine production without affecting normal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2082604565,"Background The γ-aminubutyrate (GABA) shunt bypasses two steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In plants, the pathway is composed of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated cytosolic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the mitochondrial enzymes GABA transaminase (GABA-T; POP2) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). We have previously shown that compromising the function of the GABA-shunt, by disrupting the SSADH gene of Arabidopsis, causes enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and cell death in response to light and heat stress. However, to date, genetic investigations of the relationships between enzymes of the GABA shunt have not been reported. Principal Findings To elucidate the role of succinic semialdehyde (SSA), γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and GABA in the accumulation of ROIs, we combined two genetic approaches to suppress the severe phenotype of ssadh mutants. Analysis of double pop2 ssadh mutants revealed that pop2 is epistatic to ssadh. Moreover, we isolated EMS-generated mutants suppressing the phenotype of ssadh revealing two new pop2 alleles. By measuring thermoluminescence at high temperature, the peroxide contents of ssadh and pop2 mutants were evaluated, showing that only ssadh plants accumulate peroxides. In addition, pop2 ssadh seedlings are more sensitive to exogenous SSA or GHB relative to wild type, because GHB and/or SSA accumulate in these plants. Significance We conclude that the lack of supply of succinate and NADH to the TCA cycle is not responsible for the oxidative stress and growth retardations of ssadh mutants. Rather, we suggest that the accumulation of SSA, GHB, or both, produced downstream of the GABA-T transamination step, is toxic to the plants, resulting in high ROI levels and impaired development."
https://openalex.org/W2135630628,"The pituitary hormones adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), β-endorphin, and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) are synthesized by proteolytic processing of their common proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor. Key findings from this study show that cathepsin L functions as a major proteolytic enzyme for the production of POMC-derived peptide hormones in secretory vesicles. Specifically, cathepsin L knock-out mice showed major decreases in ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH that were reduced to 23, 18, and 7! of wild-type controls (100!) in pituitary. These decreased peptide levels were accompanied by increased levels of POMC consistent with proteolysis of POMC by cathepsin L. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed colocalization of cathepsin L with β-endorphin and α-MSH in the intermediate pituitary and with ACTH in the anterior pituitary. In contrast, cathepsin L was only partially colocalized with the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 in pituitary, consistent with its extralysosomal function in secretory vesicles. Expression of cathepsin L in pituitary AtT-20 cells resulted in increased ACTH and β-endorphin in the regulated secretory pathway. Furthermore, treatment of AtT-20 cells with CLIK-148, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin L, resulted in reduced production of ACTH and accumulation of POMC. These findings demonstrate a prominent role for cathepsin L in the production of ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH peptide hormones in the regulated secretory pathway.

In contrast, cathepsin L was only partially colocalized with the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 in pituitary, consistent with its extralysosomal function in secretory vesicles. Expression of cathepsin L in pituitary AtT-20 cells resulted in increased ACTH and β-endorphin in the regulated secretory pathway. Furthermore, treatment of AtT-20 cells with CLIK-148, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin L, resulted in reduced production of ACTH and accumulation of POMC. These findings demonstrate a prominent role for cathepsin L in the production of ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH peptide hormones in the regulated secretory pathway.

The mature peptide hormones are stored in pituitary secretory vesicles for regulated secretion and control of physiological functions in target organs.

Peptides. 2003; 24: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but the identity of the protease has not yet been achieved. In early studies of POMC processing activity in pituitary secretory vesicles, cysteine protease activity represented a significant portion of POMC cleaving activity, based on its inhibition by the thiol reagent p-chloromercuribenzoate (9Loh Y.P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In anterior and intermediate pituitary cells in culture, treatment of cells with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d reduced cell levels of POMC-derived ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH (10Sei C.

Peptides. 2003; 24: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that a cysteine protease participates in POMC processing. Participation of a cysteine protease in POMC processing would represent a new protease pathway, in addition to the subtilisin-like prohormone convertase enzymes (PC2 and PC1/3) that participate in processing POMC (12Miller R.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to identify the cysteine protease that produces ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH peptide hormones derived from POMC. Herein we provide evidence indicating a key role for the cysteine protease cathepsin L in the biosynthesis of ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH in secretory vesicles. Cathepsin L gene knock-out mice showed major reductions in pituitary tissue levels of ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH. Furthermore, cathepsin L KO mouse pituitaries displayed accumulation of POMC, consistent with proteolysis of POMC by cathepsin L. In vivo cellular localization of cathepsin L in pituitary cells demonstrated a high degree of colocalization with β-endorphin, α-MSH, and ACTH in secretory vesicles. Expression of the cathepsin L cDNA in pituitary AtT-20 cells resulted in increased production of ACTH and β-endorphin in the regulated secretory pathway. In addition, CLIK-148, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin (16Katunuma N. Murata E. Kakegawa H. Matsui A. Tsuzuki H. Tsuge H. Turk D. Turk V. Fukushima M. Tada Y. Aso T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), reduced ACTH production. These gene knock-out and gene expression studies indicate a significant role for cathepsin L in the production of POMC-derived peptide hormones in secretory vesicles. Analyses of POMC-derived Peptide Hormones in Cathepsin L Knock-out Mice—Cathepsin L-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells, as described previously (17Reinheckel T. Deussing J. Roth W. Peters C. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar, 18Roth W. Deussing J. Botchkarev V.A. Pauley-Evers M. Saftig P. Hafner A. Schmidt P. Schmahi W. Scherer J.

Genotyping established cathepsin L gene knock-out (-/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice. Cathepsin L knock-out mice and age-matched wild-type control mice were generated in the C57BL/6J mouse strain. The absence of cathepsin L in the knock-out mice has been confirmed by the absence of cathepsin L mRNA (by Northern blots) and absence of cathepsin L enzyme protein (by Western blots) (18Roth W. Deussing J. Botchkarev V.A. Pauley-Evers M. Saftig P. Hafner A. Schmidt P. Schmahi W. Scherer J. Anton-Lamprecht I. Von Figura K. Paus R. Peters C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Brain tissues from adult mice (∼3 months of age) were collected and homogenized in 1 n acetic acid, heated at 95! for 10 min, and centrifuged (15,000 × g for 15 min), and the supernatant was analyzed for ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH by radioimmunoassays as described previously (12Miller R. Aaron W. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V. Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in tissue extracts were measured (DC protein assay kit; Bio-Rad). Tissue content of peptide hormones per unit amount of protein was calculated. Anti-ACTH Western blots were performed for pituitary from cathepsin L gene knock-out mice and wild type animals. Pituitaries were homogenized on ice in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1! Nonidet P-40, and 0.25! sodium deoxycolate, pH 7.0) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma). After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by a centrifugation step at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, protein concentration was measured (Bio-Rad). The homogenate preparation was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with 5! nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-ACTH (N-terminal (residues 1–24) reactive; Cymbus Biotechnology, Eastleigh, UK) at a dilution of 1:400. The washed blots were then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (sheep anti-mouse; Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h and developed with the KPL western luminescence ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences) chemiluminescent system. Colocalization of Cathepsin L with POMC-derived Peptides in Mouse Pituitary by Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Tissues in mice (CD1 Swiss male, adult mice; Charles River Laboratories) were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (intracardially) and then with 4! paraformaldehyde. Pituitary tissue was dissected and fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde overnight and cryoprotected with 30! sucrose. Tissue sections (30 μm) were then incubated and permeabilized with PBS containing 3! bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1! Triton for 1 h at room temperature. Double immunostaining of tissue sections with cathepsin L and each POMC-derived peptide hormone was conducted to assess their colocalization. The extent of colocalization of cathepsin L with the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 was also assessed. Incubation with primary antibodies consisted of anti-cathepsin L-goat (15 μg/ml; R & D Systems), anti-β-endorphin-guinea pig (1:1000; Bachem-Peninsula Laboratories), anti-ACTH-rabbit (1:1000; NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), anti-α-MSH-rabbit (1:500; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), or monoclonal anti-Lamp-1-rat (1:100; Abcam). Cathepsin L was detected with secondary anti-goat IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence; 1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); β-endorphin, ACTH, α-MSH, or Lamp-1 was detected with antisera (directed to IgGs from guinea pig, rabbit, or rat, respectively) labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (red fluorescence; 1:200; Molecular Probes). Tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were mounted on glass slides, coverslipped with mounting medium, and examined with spectral deconvolution confocal microscope FV1000 (Olympus). Images were analyzed with the Olympus Fluoview software. Information for antibody specificity and controls conducted for immunofluorescence staining were utilized to confirm the specificity of immunostaining. With respect to primary antisera, immunostaining of cathepsin L was blocked by preincubation of anti-cathepsin L with cathepsin L enzyme protein. The antisera to ACTH and α-MSH used in our immunochemical studies have been well characterized for specificity in our radioimmunoassays (12Miller R. Aaron W. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V. Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-ACTH (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health) specifically detects ACTH and does not cross-react with α-MSH or β-endorphin. Anti-α-MSH (Phoenix, CA) specifically detects α-MSH and does not cross-react with ACTH, β-endorphin, or (Met)enkephalin. The specificity of anti-β-endorphin has been determined (by Bachem-Peninsula Laboratories), and it detects β-endorphin and does not cross-react with ACTH, α-MSH, or (Met)enkephalin. In addition, the anti-Lamp-1 is a monoclonal antibody that is directed to mouse Lamp-1 (Abcam). With respect to secondary antisera, specificities have been determined by assessing immunofluorescence with incubation with secondary antisera alone (i.e. without primary antisera), which results in lack of immunofluorescence staining. For double immunostaining procedures to detect two antigens (“a” and “b”), the secondary antisera to antigen “a” has been tested for lack of cross-reactivity to antigen “b”, and the secondary antisera to antigen “b” has been tested for lack of cross-reactivity to antigen “a”. These controls have been conducted for all colocalization experiments of cathepsin L colocalization with POMC-derived peptide hormones and controls that compared cathepsin L and Lamp-1 localization. Evaluation of Cathepsin L Colocalization with ACTH in Mouse Pituitary AtT-20 Cells by Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—AtT-20 cells were cultured as previously described (19Hook V.Y. Heisler S.

Commun. 1982; 106: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) on polylysine-coated glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) and fixed with 4! paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with Triton X-100 (0.1!), cells were incubated with PBS containing 3! BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then double-stained for 2 h at room temperature in PBS plus 3! BSA with primary antibodies anti-cathepsin L-rabbit (1:50; Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA) and anti-ACTH-mouse (1:100; Abcam). Primary antibodies were revealed by the secondary antibodies in PBS plus 3! BSA with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence; 1:200; Molecular Probes) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (red fluorescence; 1:200; Molecular Probes) for 45 min at room temperature. Slides were mounted with Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences) and images were taken with the microscope Delta Vision Spectris Image Deconvolution System on an Olympus IX70 using the software Softworx Explorer from Applied Precision. Expression of Cathepsin L in AtT-20 Cells and Analyses of ACTH and β-Endorphin Production in the Regulated Secretory Pathway—Cathepsin L cDNA was expressed in AtT-20 cells to assess effects on production of ACTH and β-endorphin in the regulated secretory pathway. Effective expression of transfected cathepsin L in a neuroendocrine cell line has been demonstrated (21Hwang S.-R Garza C. Mosier C. Toneff T. Wunderlich E. Goldsmith P. Hook V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9556-9563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were plated 1 day before transfection in 6-well plates (Corning Glass) and were at ∼70! confluence when transfected with the preprocathepsin L cDNA/pcDNA3.1 (bovine) (21Hwang S.-R Garza C.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9556-9563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or pcDNA3.1 vector alone (at 2 μg of DNA/well) with transfection reagent Fugene HD (8 μl; Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, cells were incubated with BaCl2 (1 mm) for 2 h to stimulate regulated secretion of ACTH and β-endorphin, measured by radioimmunoassays as previously described (12Miller R. Aaron W. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V. Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression conditions were each conducted in replicate wells (six replicates), and experiments were repeated two times. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of ACTH or β-endorphin secreted/well. Cell extracts were also analyzed by anti-ACTH Western blots (anti-ACTH from NIDDK), performed as described previously (12Miller R. Aaron W. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V. Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression of cathepsin L activity in cell extracts was confirmed by monitoring benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-MCA cleaving activity that is inhibited by the specific cathepsin L inhibitor CLIK-148 (16Katunuma N. Murata E. Kakegawa H. Matsui A. Tsuzuki H. Tsuge H. Turk D. Turk V. Fukushima M. Tada Y. Aso T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by homogenization in cathepsin L assay buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm dithiothreitol). Homogenate was sonicated and centrifuged (13,000 × g). Cathepsin L activity was monitored as the amount of activity (37 °C for 15 min) detected with the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-MCA (16Katunuma N. Murata E. Kakegawa H. Matsui A. Tsuzuki H. Tsuge H. Turk D. Turk V. Fukushima M. Tada Y. Aso T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that is inhibited by CLIK-148 (50 μm). Expression of Cathepsin L/EGFP Fusion Protein—To demonstrate expression from the CMV promoter-driven plasmid vector in AtT-20 cells, expression of cathepsin L was monitored as a fusion protein with EGFP to distinguish it from endogenous cathepsin L. Expression of the cathepsin L/EGFP protein allowed its detection by anti-EGFP in Western blot to demonstrate expression. Specifically, the bovine cDNA encoding preprocathepsin L was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from preprocathepsin L cDNA/cDNA3.1 with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) utilizing primers consisting of 5′-AAAAAGCTAGCATGAATCCTTCATTCTTCCTGACTGTCCTTTGCTTG-3′ (with the NheI site underlined) for the sense primer and 5′-AAAAACTCGAGAACAGTTGGATAGCTGGCTGCTGTGGCAATT-3′ (with XhoI site underlined) for the antisense primer, under PCR cycle conditions of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min, for a total of 35 cycles. The amplified preprocathepsin L cDNA fragment (size of about 1.0 kb) was double-digested with NheI/XhoI and ligated to NheI/XhoI-digested pEGFP-N1 plasmid expression vector (Clontech). This construct was subjected to DNA sequencing (Davis DNA Sequencing Inc.) to verify the nucleotide sequence and deduced primary amino acid sequence of the bovine preprocathepsin L cDNA. Preprocathepsin L/EGFP fusion protein plasmid expression vector was transfected in AtT-20 cells with the same conditions as for preprocathepsin L cDNA, described above. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested, and homogenates were prepared for Western blots, as described previously (12Miller R. Aaron W. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V. Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–12! BisTris gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in 3! BSA in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05! Tween 20) and were incubated with a mouse anti-EGFP antibody (Abcam) at dilution of 1:500 in TBST overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TBST and incubation with sheep anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) for 1 h followed by washing, the membrane was developed by ECL plus Western blotting detection systems (GE Healthcare). Treatment of AtT-20 Cells with CLIK-148, Inhibitor of Cathepsin L—AtT-20 cells were treated with the specific inhibitor of cathepsin L, CLIK-148 (16Katunuma N. Murata E. Kakegawa H. Matsui A. Tsuzuki H. Tsuge H. Turk D. Turk V. Fukushima M. Tada Y. Aso T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (50 μm) (from Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA). Triplicate cell samples of CLIK-148-treated and -untreated conditions were prepared. After treatment, cells were harvested by preparation of acetic acid extracts (as described previously (12Miller R. Aaron W. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V. Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) for measurements of ACTH content by radioimmunoassay. Protein content in extracts was determined (DC protein assay kit; Bio-Rad). The amount of ACTH (pg) per unit amount of protein was calculated. This experiment was repeated three times. Analyses of cells included anti-ACTH Western blots, performed as described previously (12Miller R. Aaron W. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V. Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Statistical Evaluation of Results—Experiments were conducted with an appropriate number of replicate samples, consisting of 8–10 cathepsin L knock-out mice and 8–10 wild-type age-matched control mice. This experiment was repeated twice. AtT-20 cell experiments were conducted in triplicate samples for each condition, and experiments were repeated two or three times. Differences in peptide hormone levels were evaluated for statistical significance with Student's t test, with p < 0.05. Cathepsin L Gene Knock-out Mice Show Substantial Reduction of POMC-derived Peptide Hormones in Pituitary—The peptide hormones ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH are derived from the common POMC prohormone precursor by proteolytic processing. They are especially important as pituitary hormones and are highly expressed in this tissue. To determine the role of cathepsin L in the production of these POMC-derived peptide hormones, cathepsin L gene knock-out (-/- genotype) mice were analyzed for pituitary levels of these peptide hormones, with comparison with wild-type controls (+/+ genotype). Notably, all POMC-derived peptide hormones were substantially reduced in the cathepsin L knock-out mice compared with controls (Fig. 1). ACTH levels in cathepsin L KO mice were reduced to 23! of control levels (100!). β-Endorphin levels in pituitaries of cathepsin L KO mice were reduced to 18! of control levels (100!), and α-MSH was reduced in KO mice to 7! of control levels (100!). These data demonstrate a key role for cathepsin L in the production of POMC-derived peptide hormones. In parallel to the decreased levels of POMC-derived peptide hormones, cathepsin L KO mice showed increased levels of POMC, detected by anti-ACTH Western blots, compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 2). Accumulation of POMC in the cathepsin L knock-out is consistent with its role as a substrate for cathepsin L. The increase in POMC was not due to changes in its mRNA, since POMC mRNA levels in pituitaries of cathepsin L knock-out compared with wild-type controls were the same. 3L. Funkelstein, T. Toneff, C. Mosier, S.-R. Hwang, F. Beuschlein, U. D. Lichtenauer, T. Reinheckel, C. Peters, and V. Hook, unpublished observations. The accumulation of POMC in the cathepsin L KO condition (compared with control wild-type mice) suggests a role for proteolysis of POMC by cathepsin L. In addition, increased levels of the POMC-derived 22-kDa ACTH intermediate were observed in pituitaries of cathepsin L KO mice (compared with wild type). Such results implicate cathepsin L in modifying ACTH production from POMC. In the cathepsin L KO mice, there was no change in levels of PC1/3 or PC2 protein or enzyme activities in pituitaries of cathepsin L KO mice. These controls indicated that there was no detectable compensatory change in PC1/3 or PC2 enzymes. 3L. Funkelstein, T. Toneff, C. Mosier, S.-R. Hwang, F. Beuschlein, U. D. Lichtenauer, T. Reinheckel, C. Peters, and V. Hook, unpublished observations. Thus, the significant reduction of ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH is consistent with a role of cathepsin L for production of ACTH, β-endorphin, and α-MSH peptide hormones. Cathepsin L Colocalizes in Vivo with β-Endorphin, α-MSH, and ACTH in Secretory Vesicles of Mouse Pituitary; Comparison with the Lamp-1 Marker for Lysosomes—A role for cathepsin L in the production of POMC-derived peptide hormones requires localization of cathepsin L with these peptide hormones in secretory vesicles, the primary subcellular site for peptide hormone production, storage, and secretion. Therefore, colocalization studies of cathepsin L with POMC-derived peptide hormones in pituitary (normal wild-type mouse) were conducted by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In intermediate pituitary, cathepsin L was colocalized with β-endorphin that is present in secretory vesicles (Fig. 3a). Cathepsin L immunofluorescence staining was observed as a punctate pattern of staining in the perinuclear areas of intermediate pituitary cells. The colocalization of cathepsin L with β-endorphin was illustrated by the merged images showing areas of colocalization as yellow fluorescence. All β-endorphin subcellular areas showed the presence of cathepsin L. Controls with only secondary antisera resulted in the absence of immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3b). These results show selective immunofluorescence detection of cathepsin L and β-endorphin by primary antisera. Results also showed excellent colocalization of cathepsin L with α-MSH in intermediate pituitary (Fig. 4). Cathepsin L localization (green fluorescence) with α-MSH (red fluorescence) was illustrated by their merged images showing areas of colocalization by yellow fluorescence. In mouse anterior pituitary, cathepsin L was colocalized with ACTH-containing cells (Fig. 5). The pattern of ACTH immunostaining was consistent with the knowledge that ACTH corticotroph cells comprise 3–5! of cells in anterior pituitary (3Frohman L.A. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 1981; : 293-312, McGraw-Hill, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar, 4Norris D.O. Vertebrate Endocrinology. 1997; : 106-166, Academic Press, Inc., San DiegoGoogle Scholar). Immunostaining showed that all ACTH-containing cells show colocalization of cathepsin L and ACTH. Furthermore, cathepsin L was present in other cell types of anterior pituitary that are known to produce other anterior pituitary hormones (3Frohman L.A. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 1981; : 293-312, McGraw-Hill, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar, 4Norris D.O. Vertebrate Endocrinology. 1997; : 106-166, Academic Press, Inc., San DiegoGoogle Scholar). The overlapping localization of ACTH and cathepsin L indicated the presence of cathepsin L in ACTH-containing secretory vesicles. It was of interest that a large portion of cathepsin L was colocalized with β-endorphin and α-MSH in intermediate pituitary, suggesting perhaps greater localization of cathepsin L with peptide hormone-containing secretory vesicles compared with the presence of cathepsin L in lysosomes. Direct assessment of the localization of cathepsin L with the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 showed that cathepsin L partially colocalized with Lamp-1 in intermediate pituitary (Fig. 6). Similar results for partial colocalization of cathepsin L with Lamp-1 in anterior pituitary were also observed (data not shown). These findings support results of this study showing a high degree of cathepsin L localization in peptide hormone-containing secretory vesicles in pituitary.

https://openalex.org/W2072369599,"Background In non-human primates grasp-related sensorimotor transformations are accomplished in a circuit involving the anterior intraparietal sulcus (area AIP) and both the ventral and the dorsal sectors of the premotor cortex (vPMC and dPMC, respectively). Although a human homologue of such a circuit has been identified whether activity within this circuit varies depending on handedness has yet to be investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explicitly test how handedness modulates activity within human grasping-related brain areas. Right- and left-handers subjects were requested to reach towards and grasp an object with either the right or the left hand using a precision grip while scanned. A kinematic study was conducted with similar procedures as a behavioral counterpart for the fMRI experiment. Results from a factorial design revealed significant activity within the right dPMC, the right cerebellum and AIP bilaterally. The pattern of activity within these areas mirrored the results found for the behavioral study. Conclusion/Significance Data are discussed in terms of an handedness-independent role for the right dPMC in monitoring hand shaping, the need for bilateral AIP activity for the performance of precision grip movements which varies depending on handedness and the involvement of the cerebellum in terms of its connections with AIP. These results provide the first compelling evidence of specific grasping related neural activity depending on handedness."
https://openalex.org/W1972724028,"P-type ATPases pump ions across membranes, generating steep electrochemical gradients that are essential for the function of all cells. Access to the ion-binding sites within the pumps alternates between the two sides of the membrane to avoid the dissipation of the gradients that would occur during simultaneous access. In Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pumps treated with the marine agent palytoxin, this strict alternation is disrupted and binding sites are sometimes simultaneously accessible from both sides of the membrane, transforming the pumps into ion channels (see, for example, refs 2, 3). Current recordings in these channels can monitor accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to water-soluble sulphydryl-specific reagents. We found previously that Na(+),K(+) pump-channels open to the extracellular surface through a deep and wide vestibule that emanates from a narrower pathway between transmembrane helices 4 and 6 (TM4 and TM6). Here we report that cysteine scans from TM1 to TM6 reveal a single unbroken cation pathway that traverses palytoxin-bound Na(+),K(+) pump-channels from one side of the membrane to the other. This pathway comprises residues from TM1, TM2, TM4 and TM6, passes through ion-binding site II, and is probably conserved in structurally and evolutionarily related P-type pumps, such as sarcoplasmic- and endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases and H(+),K(+)-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2067240517,"FLN29 was identified as an interferon (IFN)-inducible gene, and it has been shown to suppress Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-κB activation by binding to TRAF6. To elucidate the physiological roles of FLN29, we generated FLN29-deficient mice. FLN29 deficiency resulted in hyper-response to LPS both in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating the negative regulatory role of FLN29 in TLR4 signaling. Furthermore, we found that FLN29–/– mice exhibited increased susceptibility to poly(I:C)-induced septic shock compared with WT mice. FLN29–/– fibroblasts were highly resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus infection, and these cells produced more IFN-β than WT cells did in response to not only intracellular poly(I:C) but also overexpression of IPS-1. Forced expression of FLN29 inhibited the IPS-1-dependent activation of both NF-κB and IRF3. We also found that FLN29 could interact with TRIF, IPS-1, TRAF3, and TRAF6. Together, these results suggest that FLN29, in addition to playing a negative regulatory role in the TLR4 signaling pathway, negatively regulates the RIG-I-like helicase signaling pathway at the level of IPS-1/TRAF6 and IPS-1/TRAF3 complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2063509106,"Although it is clear that telomerase expression is crucial for the maintenance of telomere homeostasis, there is increasing evidence that the TERT protein can have physiological roles that are independent of this central function. To further examine the role of telomerase during vertebrate development, the zebrafish telomerase reverse transcriptase (zTERT) was functionally characterized. Upon zTERT knockdown, zebrafish embryos show reduced telomerase activity and are viable, but develop pancytopenia resulting from aberrant hematopoiesis. The blood cell counts in TERT-depleted zebrafish embryos are markedly decreased and hematopoietic cell differentiation is impaired, whereas other somatic lineages remain morphologically unaffected. Although both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis is disrupted by zTERT knockdown, the telomere lengths are not significantly altered throughout early development. Induced p53 deficiency, as well as overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and E1B-19K, significantly relieves the decreased blood cells numbers caused by zTERT knockdown, but not the impaired blood cell differentiation. Surprisingly, only the reverse transcriptase motifs of zTERT are crucial, but the telomerase RNA-binding domain of zTERT is not required, for rescuing complete hematopoiesis. This is therefore the first demonstration of a non-canonical catalytic activity of TERT, which is different from ""authentic"" telomerase activity, is required for during vertebrate hematopoiesis. On the other hand, zTERT deficiency induced a defect in hematopoiesis through a potent and specific effect on the gene expression of key regulators in the absence of telomere dysfunction. These results suggest that TERT non-canonically functions in hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival in vertebrates, independently of its role in telomere homeostasis. The data also provide insights into a non-canonical pathway by which TERT functions to modulate specification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells during vertebrate development. (276 words)."
https://openalex.org/W2071240809,"We present the first population genetic analysis of homologous loci from two sympatric human malaria parasite populations sharing the same human hosts, using full-length sequences of ama1 genes from Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum collected in the Venezuelan Amazon.Significant differences between the two species were found in genetic diversity at the ama1 locus, with 18 distinct haplotypes identified among the 73 Pvama1 sequences obtained, compared to 6 unique haplotypes from 30 Pfama1 sequences, giving overall diversity estimates of h = 0.9091, and h = 0.538 respectively. Levels of recombination were also found to differ between the species, with P. falciparum exhibiting very little recombination across the 1.77 kb sequence. In contrast, analysis of patterns of nucleotide substitutions provided evidence that polymorphisms in the ama1 gene of both species are maintained by balancing selection, particularly in domain I. The two distinct population structures observed are unlikely to result from different selective forces acting upon the two species, which share both human and mosquito hosts in this setting. Rather, the highly structured P. falciparum population appears to be the result of a population bottleneck, while the much less structured P. vivax population is likely to be derived from an ancient pool of diversity, as reflected in a larger estimate of effective population size for this species. Greatly reduced mosquito transmission in 1997, due to low rainfall prior to the second survey, was associated with far fewer P. falciparum infections, but an increase in P. vivax infections, probably due to hypnozoite activation.The relevance of these findings to putative competitive interactions between these two important human pathogen species is discussed. These results highlight the need for future control interventions to employ strategies targeting each of the parasite species present in endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W1994078509,"Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme in the metabolism of homocysteine, has previously been shown to require a heme co-factor for maximal activity. However, the biochemical function of the CBS heme is not well defined. Here, we show that expression of human CBS in heme-deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli results in production of an enzyme that is misfolded and degraded. Addition of exogenous heme, porphyrins with non-iron metal, or porphyrin lacking metal entirely produced stable and active CBS enzyme. Purification of recombinant CBS enzyme expressed in the presence of various metalloporphyrins confirmed that Mn(III) and Co(III) had 30–60% of the specific activity of Fe(III)-CBS, and still responded to allosteric activation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Treatment of S. cerevisiae with the chemical chaperone trimethylamine-N-oxide resulted in near complete restoration of function to human CBS produced in a heme-deficient strain. Taken together, these results suggest that porphyrin moiety of the heme plays a critical role in proper CBS folding and assembly, but that the metal ion is not essential for this function or for allosteric regulation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine.

CBS forms homotetramers comprised of identical subunits of 551 amino acids each with a molecular mass of ∼63 kDa. The CBS monomer has a modular structure in which the N-terminal, the middle, and the C-terminal regions serve as heme binding, catalytic and regulatory domains of the enzyme, respectively (6.Miles E.W. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29871-29874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regulatory domain consists of a hydrophobic CBS domain tandem named CBS1 and CBS2, which were recently identified as the binding site for the allosteric CBS activator S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) (7.Scott J.W.

It has been shown that the C-terminal region also performs an autoinhibitory function by partial shielding the active site. Binding of AdoMet, deletion of the C-terminal region, increased temperature or specific mutations alleviate this inhibitory effect (9.Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10625-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10.Shan X. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Christopher S.A. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol.

A truncated 45-kDa form of CBS (1–413 residues), devoid of the C-terminal region forms homodimers, which are constitutively activated and unresponsive to AdoMet (11.Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This truncated CBS was successfully used to generate crystals used to resolve the CBS tertiary structure (12.Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10454-10461Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the functions of the regulatory C-terminal domain and the central catalytic core binding the PLP cofactor have been elucidated, the role of the heme cofactor is still unanswered. The N-terminal heme moiety is coordinated by Cys52 and His65 residues (12.Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). CBS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as Trypanosoma cruzi, lack the heme cofactor of human CBS (14.Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol.

These enzymes are also not stimulated by AdoMet suggesting that: 1) heme and AdoMet stimulation are new acquisitions in evolution of higher eukaryotes, and 2) that AdoMet activation may be dependent on the presence of heme in CBS. Furthermore, heme-free N-terminal-truncated human enzyme is catalytically active as are human CBS crystals from which the heme was removed (17.Oliveriusova J. Kery V. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. J. Biol.

The potential physiological role for such redox sensing may be to regulate intracellular homocysteine flow by switching between the transmethylation and trans-sulfuration pathways.

Here we examine the potential role of the heme moiety in CBS folding and in its interaction with AdoMet and PLP. We have developed two different systems that allowed us to manipulate the heme content of human CBS. For the first system, we have engineered a yeast strain that is deficient in heme biosynthesis and expresses human but not yeast CBS. In this strain, we found that CBS expression and activity were directly dependent on the availability of exogenous heme. Furthermore, various heme analogs were examined to test for the iron requirement in the protoporphyrin. Interestingly, the chemical chaperone trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was able to substitute for a structural function of heme and allowed for the formation of stable and active enzymes. In the second system, we used Escherichia coli deficient in heme synthesis for expression and purification of human CBS containing various heme analogs. Our results suggest that heme plays a key role in proper CBS folding and assembly. Chemicals—Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific.

To determine the effect of the chemical chaperone, TMAO, it was dissolved in the growth medium in a final concentration of 0.2–0.8 m and filter sterilized. The supernatant was used as a soluble fraction. CBS Expression and Preparation of Crude Extracts in E. coli—The expression of human CBS in the presence and absence of different porphyrins and preparation of crude extracts from E. coli cells were performed as described previously with some modifications (19.Frank N. Kent J.O. Meier M. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 470: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The previously described expression plasmid encoding human CBS as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase was used in all E. coli expression experiments (19.Frank N. Kent J.O. Meier M. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 470: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Strains were grown in 50 ml of LB medium anaerobically under a layer of sterile mineral oil at 30 °C with gentle mixing on a magnetic stirrer. Bacterial cells used as an inoculum for these cultures were grown twice anaerobically in the absence of any protoporphyrin. The growth medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.001% thiamine-HCl and the desired protoporphyrin to give a final concentration of 60 μg/ml. The porhyrins were kept sterile in the dark at 4 °C as a 2 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in 0.2 m Na2HPO4, pH 12. Expression was carried overnight (16–20 h) by induction using isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 150 μm. Harvested cells were washed in 0.9% NaCl and subsequently lysed in an ice-cold buffer containing 1× TBS, pH 8.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 100 μm PLP and Sigma bacterial protease inhibitor mixture. Crude extracts were obtained after shearing the genomic DNA by sonication and removing the insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Expression and Purification of CBS Substituted with Heme Analogs—The starter cultures were grown as described above. Overnight expressions were carried out in tightly sealed 2-liter bottles (Nalgene) degassed for 15 min with sterile nitrogen. For purification of the fusion proteins, the crude extracts were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 2 mm ATP and 10 mm MgSO4 to prevent nonspecific interaction of E. coli DNA K protein with the affinity resin. The fusion proteins were purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column as described previously (19.Frank N. Kent J.O. Meier M. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 470: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The isolated GST-hCBS fusion proteins were cleaved with Prescission protease (GE Healthcare) in 1× cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 12 h at a final concentration of 0.5 units/mg of protein. The cleaved fusion protein was subsequently concentrated on Amicon YM-30 (Millipore) with three buffer exchanges for 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 0.01% Tween 20. Spectroscopic Measurements—The UV-visible spectra of purified CBS proteins were measured at room temperature in a HP diode array model 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.01% Tween 20. CBS Activity Assay—The CBS activity was determined by a previously described radioisotope assay using l-[U-14C]serine as the labeled substrate (25.Kraus J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 150 μg of the crude extract or 25 μg of concentrated cleaved fusion protein, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry procedure using bovine serum albumin as a standard (26.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot—Denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using a 9% separating gel with a 4% stacking gel. The commercially available apparatus (Criterion, Bio-Rad) was used for separation of either denatured proteins by SDS-PAGE using 10% Tris-HCl precast gels or native samples using 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient Tris-HCl precast gels. For visualization, gels were stained with Simple Blue (Invitrogen). Western blot analysis of crude cell lysates under denaturing conditions was performed as described previously (17.Oliveriusova J. Kery V. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48386-48394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and probed with affinity-purified polyclonal or commercial monoclonal anti-CBS antibody (Abnova), respectively. The Precision Plus Standard Kaleidoscope (Bio-Rad) was used as molecular weight marker for SDS-PAGE gels. CBS Expression and Activity Is Dependent on Heme Availability—We developed an expression system for human CBS in a yeast strain deficient in both heme and yeast CBS biosynthesis to study the role of heme in human CBS expression, folding, and activity. Strain WY254 (Table 1) contains a deletion of the yeast CBS gene (Δcys4) and contains a mutation in the HEM2 enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of δ-ALA to porphobilinogen, the second step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This strain can grow in media supplemented with ergosterol and Tween 80 as a source of unsaturated fatty acids and sterols (15.Maclean K.N. Janosik M. Oliveriusova J. Kery V. Kraus J.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We transformed WY254 with an expression vector carrying human WT CBS and created WY254pHCBS (23.Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To study the effect of heme availability on CBS we grew this strain in the minimal medium supplemented with 2% ergosterol and 0.5% Tween 80, and 30 μg/ml glutathione in the presence of exogenous hemin in concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μg/ml of medium. Fig. 1 shows that expression of CBS as well as its specific activity increase with increasing hemin concentration in the growth medium. Without hemin supplementation there was no signal for CBS on a Western blot probed with monoclonal anti-CBS antibody. As the concentration of hemin gradually increased, the CBS band intensity increased as well (Fig. 1, top). Similarly, there was no CBS activity without added hemin and activity gradually grew in response to higher hemin concentrations (Fig. 1, bottom). The maximum activity achieved was ∼25% of the positive control (WY61 WT yeast strain with deleted endogenous yeast CBS and transformed with plasmid expressing human WT CBS). At the highest concentration of hemin in the medium (100 μg/ml) we still did not attain the intensity of the control CBS band on Western blot. The signal saturation was not achieved even if the concentration of hemin was increased to 300 μg/ml (data not shown). At concentrations higher than 100 μg/ml, the yeast growth was substantially slower and precipitation of hemin in the growth medium was observed. Western blot analysis did not detect any CBS in insoluble fractions (data not shown). This result suggests that CBS expressed in yeast in the absence of heme is likely misfolded and degraded. The enzyme activity was fully responsive to AdoMet (not shown), as can be expected for human enzyme but not for the yeast enzyme (15.Maclean K.N. Janosik M. Oliveriusova J. Kery V. Kraus J.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results indicate that availability of heme is a limiting factor for CBS expression, thus one of the functions of heme may be to nucleate proper folding and/or assembly of the enzyme. The Iron in Heme May Be Replaceable by Other Metals—To further support one of the possible heme roles as a structural scaffold during CBS synthesis and/or assembly we decided to express CBS from the heme-deficient yeast strain in the presence of various porphyrins coordinated to different metals at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The selected porphyrins share the same structure of the porhyrin ring but they differ in the metal in the central position. We also included protoporphyrin IX, which does not possess any metal within its structure. We detected CBS in each yeast extract on a Western blot probed with monoclonal anti-CBS antibody (Fig. 2, top). The amounts of detected CBS on Western blot roughly correlate with CBS activities for the same samples (Fig. 2, bottom). Protoporhyrin IX (PPIX), Zn(II)-PPIX, and Co(III)-PPIX gave the highest activities roughly equivalent to 17% of a positive control. We also examined human CBS expressed in heme-deficient E. coli. Again, we found that all of the porphyrins tested resulted in increased CBS protein and activity (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Expression and activity of human CBS in the presence of various heme analogs in E. coli system. Western blot of E. coli RP523 bearing plasmid expressing human CBS. Cell lysates (40 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on a 9% SDS gel.

CBS enzymes with different porphyrins retained their AdoMet responsiveness (results not shown). Our results further suggest that heme in CBS can be replaced with a similar structure either possessing no metal or a different metal ion in the central location. The Function of Heme in CBS Folding Can Be Substituted by a Chemical Chaperone—Recently, it was shown that chemical chaperones can facilitate proper folding and increase specific activity of misfolded or unassembled mutant CBS enzymes (28.Singh L.R. Chen X. Kozich V. Kruger W.D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2007; 91: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We examined if a chemical chaperone could be beneficial for folding and/or assembly of wild-type human CBS expressed in the absence of heme. We tested the effect of different concentrations of the osmolyte chemical chaperone TMAO on expression and activity of CBS using our yeast system in the absence of exogenous heme (Fig. 4). We observed that 0.2 m TMAO is capable in rescuing expression as well as activity of CBS to 82% of WT in the absence of exogenous hemin. However, higher TMAO concentrations led to a decreased expression (Fig. 4, top) as well as lower specific activity of CBS (Fig. 4, bottom). This result further supports the chaperone-like function of heme in proper folding and/or assembly of CBS. Expression and Purification of CBS Containing Heme Analogs—The finding that the heme cofactor in CBS can be replaced by a different porphyrin or even be completely missing led us to purification and characterization of such modified enzymes. For these experiments we chose to use the heme-deficient E. coli expression system, as it utilized a fusion tag that facilitated large scale purification of CBS. Therefore, we employed the hemA mutant E. coli HU227 and hemB mutant E. coli RP523 containing an uncharacterized permeability alteration that render the bacteria hemin-permeable (29.Li J.M. Umanoff H. Proenca R. Russell C.S. Cosloy S.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These auxotrophic mutants are able to grow without exogenous heme supplementation under anaerobic conditions. Preliminary experiments suggested that the CBS expression levels were somewhat better in the RP523 strain than in the HU227, thus all subsequent expressions were done in the former strain. We transformed it with a plasmid expressing a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CBS fusion protein (19.Frank N. Kent J.O. Meier M. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 470: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We used this bacterial system for expression of human CBS in the presence of porphyrins containing Fe(III), Co(III), and Mn(III) metal ion at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml as well as in the absence of any porphyrin. SDS-PAGE shows that the isolated proteins are highly purified, whereas some degradation is visible in the last lane containing the heme-free CBS (Fig. 5). Characterization of the Purified Enzymes—For spectral analysis and activity determinations some of the purified GST-CBS fusion proteins were cleaved with Prescission protease to remove the GST tag (all the heme analog containing CBS), whereas others were only concentrated as fusion proteins (heme-free CBS). The absence of heme in the heme-free CBS was ascertained by recording absorption spectra in the visible region. Fig. 6 shows spectra of WT and heme-free CBS. In the ferric CBS there was the characteristic 428-nm Soret absorption peak for ferric CBS with a broad α/β adsorption centered at ∼550 nm. The A428/A280 ratio was equal to 1. On the other hand, the heme-free GST-CBS fusion protein spectrum did not have any significant adsorption peak in the visible spectrum. This result also means that PLP binding to the heme-free CBS was impaired consistent with our earlier observation that PLP binding depends on the presence of heme moiety in CBS (30.Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the spectra of pyridine hemochrome of the reduced porphyrins released from Fe(III)-CBS, Mn(III)-CBS, and Co(III)-CBS. In each case a pyridine hemochrome spectrum of a protoporphyrin sample with a corresponding metal is shown. The reduced Fe(II)-PPXI spectrum (Fig. 7A) displays a peak at 416 and peaks at 521 and 554 nm in the α and β region, whereas the Fe(II)-CBS sample has peaks at 419, 524 and 556 nm. These peaks are within 1 nm of the pig liver CBS (H-450) hemochrome spectrum of Kim and Deal (31.Kim I.C. Deal Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The α and β peaks also agree with the hemochrome spectrum of heme b from myoglobin (32.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The Mn(II)-PPXI Soret peak is red-shifted to 436 nm with the α and β peaks at 559 and 593 nm (Fig. 7B). Mn(II)-CBS absorbs at 434, 556, and 593 nm. In contrast, the Co(II)-PPXI shows a shift of the Soret peak to 423 nm and 534 and 567 nm, whereas Co(II)-CBS has very similar maxima at 423, 535, and 566 nm (Fig. 7C). These spectra demonstrate that the resulting purified proteins indeed contained the various metals and that the Mn(III)- and Co(III)-CBS did not contain any appreciable amount of iron.FIGURE 7Reduced pyridine hemochromogen spectra of metalloporphyrins extracted from various heme-substituted CBS enzymes. Protoporphyrins were released from the respective CBS proteins (200 μg) in 30 mm NaOH and subsequently stabilized by adding 1 volume of pyridine to 3 volumes of the alkali mixture. Samples were reduced with a trace of solid Na2S2O4 and immediately measured. Solid line represents protoporphyrin released from GST-CBS fusion proteins. Dashed line corresponds to relevant protoporhyrin substance used as a standard. Stock solutions of metalloporhyrins were prepared at 2 mg/ml in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 12.

Using our established procedure for expression and purification of wild type CBS we reproducibly get a fusion protein with specific activity of around 30 units/mg of protein. The CBS is expressed under aerobic conditions in a medium supplemented with the heme precursor, δ-ALA. The enzyme is fully responsive to AdoMet stimulation (2–4-fold) as well as fully saturated with PLP. However, the specific activity of CBS expressed under anaerobic conditions utilizing exogenous hemin was only 10.5 units/mg. The enzymes expressed in the presence of PPIX containing Co(III) and Mn(III) instead of iron showed similar properties except for somewhat lower specific activity: 6 and 3 units/mg, respectively. The heme-free GST-CBS fusion protein had a very low activity of about 1 unit/mg. All of the e"

Here we describe a protein encoded by a novel germ cell-specific gene, Mm.290718/ZFP541, identified from the mouse spermatocyte UniGene library. The protein contains specific motifs and domains potentially involved in DNA binding and chromatin reorganization. An antibody against Mm.290718/ZFP541 revealed the existence of the protein in testicular spermatogenic cells (159 kDa) but not testicular and mature sperm. Immunostaining analysis of cells at various stages of spermatogenesis consistently showed that the protein is present in spermatocytes and round spermatids only. Transfection assays and immunofluorescence studies indicate that the protein is localized specifically in the nucleus. Proteomic analyses performed to explore the functional characteristics of Mm.290718/ZFP541 showed that the protein forms a unique complex. Other major components of the complex included histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and heat-shock protein A2. Disappearance of Mm.290718/ZFP541 was highly correlated with hyperacetylation in spermatids during spermatogenesis, and specific domains of the protein were involved in the regulation of interactions and nuclear localization of HDAC1. Furthermore, we found that premature hyperacetylation, induced by an HDAC inhibitor, is associated with an alteration in the integrity of Mm.290718/ZFP541 in spermatogenic cells. Our results collectively suggest that the Mm.290718/ZFP541 complex is implicated in chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis, and we provide further information on the previously unknown molecular mechanism.

During spermatogenesis, primary spermatocytes undergo meiotic division to produce spermatids. Early round spermatids undergo differentiation through elongation and condensation to develop into spermatozoa, a process termed spermiogenesis. Major events during this post-meiotic phase of male germ cell development include nuclear condensation and morphogenesis. In particular, spermatid chromatin undergoes reorganization to substitute histones with specific basic proteins (transition proteins). Subsequently, small arginine-rich proteins (protamines) replace transition proteins. As a result, the sperm head is condensed, and DNA is stabilized (1.Caron C. Govin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2005; 38: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2.Cho C. Jung-Ha H. Willis W.D. Goulding E.H. Stein P. Xu Z. Schultz R.M. Hecht N.B. Eddy E.M. Biol.

Genet. 2001; 28: 82-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tightly regulated process indicates the presence of a highly organized, intrinsic genetic program involving genes unique to germ cells. Previously, we investigated mouse spermatocyte and round spermatid UniGene libraries containing 2124 and 2155 gene-oriented transcript clusters (4.Hong S. Choi I. Woo J.M. Oh J. Kim T. Choi E. Kim T.W. Jung Y.K. Kim D.H. Sun C.H. Yi G.S. Eddy E.M. Cho C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7685-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5.Choi E. Lee J. Oh J. Park I. Han C. Yi C. Kim Do H. Cho B.N. Eddy E.M. Cho C. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 256Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, the proportions of germ cell-specific genes in the spermatocyte and round spermatid libraries were predicted as 11% (230 genes) and 22% (467 genes), respectively. Remarkably, more than half of these unique genes are currently unknown or uncharacterized. With the aid of systematic in silico and in vitro approaches, we narrowed the numbers down to 24 (spermatocyte UniGene study) and 28 genes (round spermatid UniGene study) exhibiting abundant transcription unique to germ cells. In silico analyses led to the prediction that a number of these genes are implicated in diverse functions, such as transcriptional regulation, nuclear integrity, cell structure, and metabolism, in spermatogenic cells. One such gene is Mm.290718 (GenBank™ accession number BC157962.1). The Mm.290718 gene encompasses a region of ∼25 kb in mouse chromosome 7. The human ortholog of Mm.290718 is in the genomic region (human chromosome 19q13.3) of conserved synteny between mouse and human. The Mm.290718 gene is composed of 12 exons, and transcribes into 4084-nucleotide mRNA encoding 1302 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass of Mm.290718 is 148 kDa. In this study, we characterized the protein encoded by the Mm.290718 gene at the cellular and functional levels. The Mm.290718 protein is predicted to contain numerous motifs and domains potentially involved in DNA binding and chromatin reorganization. Our results show that the Mm.290718 gene encodes a nuclear protein expressed at specific stages of spermiogenesis. Proteomic analysis indicated the presence of a unique complex associated with the Mm.290718 protein. One of the major complex components was histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC1, histone deacetylase 1; HSPA2, heat shock protein A2; KCTD19, potassium channel tetramerization domain 19; RT, reverse transcription; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; VPA, valproic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SMN, survival of motor neuron. Further analyses suggest that the Mm.290718 complex functions in chromatin remodeling during the period of development from round to elongated spermatids. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide comprehensive information about a novel germ cell-specific protein with a potential role in the chromatin-remodeling process. Total RNA Extraction and RT-PCRs—Total RNA samples obtained from seven tissues (testis, brain, liver, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and ovary) of adult mouse, cDNA from germ cell-devoid testes of W/Wv mutant mice, and prepubertal and adult male mice (aged 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 30, and 84 days) were used for reverse transcription. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol™ Reagent (MRC) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cDNA was synthesized by random hexamer and oligo(dT) priming with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). RT-PCRs were performed with primers for potassium channel tetramerization domain 19 (KCTD19) (forward, 5′-GCG GAT CCT GTA AAC AGT GGG AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TAC TCG AGC TGC TCA GGA GCA GG-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-TGA AGG TCG GAG TCA ACG GAT TTG GT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAT GTG GGC CAT GAG GTC CAC CAC-3′) as a control.

Amplified products were digested with BamHI and XhoI, and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare). The resulting constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Each glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Two of the purified fusion proteins were used as antigens for producing a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Peptron). Antibodies were purified using the corresponding proteins as antigens and an AminoLink Immobilization kit (Pierce). Anti-Mm.290718, anti-KCTD19, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against acetylated lysine (Abcam) antibodies were used (2 μg/ml) for immunofluorescence. The anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used (1:1000 dilution) for Western blot analysis. Anti-heat-shock protein A2 (HSPA2) (6.Rosario M.O. Perkins S.L. O'Brien D.A. Allen R.L. Eddy E.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 150: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), ADAM2, and HDAC1 (Abcam) polyclonal antibodies were used (1:1000 dilution) for Western blot analysis. Acetylated lysine (2 μg/ml) and HSPA2 (1:100) antibodies were used for immunofluorescence. Protein Samples and Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed using protein samples from the testes of prepubertal and adult male mice (aged 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 30, and 84 days) as well as germ cell-devoid testes of W/Wv mutant mice. Testicular cells and sperm from testes of normal adult male mice were isolated by suspension in 52% isotonic Percoll (GE Healthcare) and centrifugation for 10 min (27,000 × g, 10 °C) and were resuspended in Mg2+-Hepes buffer (7.Phelps B.M. Koppel D.E. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sperm from the caudal epididymis and vas deferens was directly released into Mg2+-Hepes buffer. The purity of cells and sperm was evaluated by microscopy (>95%). All samples were resuspended in 5× SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling for 5 min. Samples were reduced with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Each sample containing ∼20 μg of protein was subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and hybridized for 1 h with primary antibodies. Bound IgG was detected following a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—Paraffin sections of mouse testis (Zyagen) were deparaffinized using xylene, rehydrated using a graded series of 100, 95, and 80% ethanol, and incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Tissue sections were heated in a microwave oven for 10 min in 10 mm citrate solution (pH 6) for antigen retrieval. Isolated testicular cells and sperm were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Mm.290718 domain-expressing HEK293T and GC-2 cells were washed twice with 1 mm calcium chloride and 1 mm magnesium chloride. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody and/or Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) at 1:1000 dilution, and stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Sigma). Fluorescence signals were observed under a microscope (DMLB; Leica Microsystems). Immunoprecipitation—Testes and Mm.290718 domain-expressing HEK293T cells were lysed in nonionic detergent (1% Nonidet P-40) lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin). Total tissue lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 0.5 μg of anti-Mm.290718 antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C. Total cell lysates (600 μg) were incubated with 0.5 μg of anti-GFP antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 8 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads were washed in a 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C three times and separated on an 8% SDS gel. Enzymatic Digestion of Immunoprecipitated Protein Samples—Protein elution from antibody beads was performed using 8 m urea in 100 mm Tris (pH 8) buffer solution. Eluted proteins were reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (final concentration of 5 mm) at room temperature for 30 min, and alkylated with iodoacetamide (final concentration of 25 mm) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The sample was diluted with 2 m urea using 100 mm Tris buffer solution (pH 8). CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the proteins were digested in digestion buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm CaCl2) using sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega) for 14 h at 37 °C with an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:25. Trypsin digestion of eluted proteins was quenched by adding 90% formic acid (final concentration of 5%). Capillary Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS and Data Analysis—Digested proteins were loaded onto fused silica capillary columns (100 μm inner diameter, 360 μm outer diameter) containing 7.5 cm of 5-μm particle Aqua C18 reversed-phase column material (Phenomenex). The column was placed inline with an Agilent HP1100 quaternary LC pump, and a splitter system was used to achieve a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Buffer A (5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) were used to create a gradient over 80 min. The gradient profile started with 3 min of 100% buffer A, followed by 5 min from 0 to 15% buffer B, 57 min from 15 to 55% buffer B, and 15 min from 55 to 100% buffer B. Eluted peptides were directly electrosprayed into an LTQ Ion Trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Palo Alto, CA) by applying 2.3 kV of DC voltage. A data-dependent scan consisting of 1 full MS (400-2000 m/z) and 10 data-dependent MS/MS scans was used to generate MS/MS spectra of eluted peptides. Normalized collision energy of 35% was used throughout the data acquisition period. MS/MS spectra were compared with the Mouse IPI protein data base (version 3.31) using TurboSequest and SEQUEST Cluster Systems (14 nodes). DTASelect was used to filter the search results, and the following Xcorr and ΔCn values were applied to different charge states of peptides with a fully tryptic digested end requirement of 1.8 for singly charged peptides, 2.2 for doubly charged peptides, and 3.2 for triply charged peptides, with a ΔCn value of 0.08 for all charge states. Manual assignments of fragment ions in all filtered MS/MS spectra were followed to confirm the protein data base search results. Cloning and Cell Culture—Mm.290718 cDNA sequences were amplified from mouse testis cDNA using the primers forward, 5′-GGA AGC TTG ATG GAG CCA TAC AGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATG TCG ACT CCA CTG CAA AGG GC-3′, incorporating 5′ HindIII and 3′ SalI sites, and cloned into the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech). The zinc finger domain, first, second, and third regions, ELM2, and/or SANT domain were amplified from mouse testis cDNA using the following primers: first region: forward, 5′-GCG TCG ACC GAT GGA GCC ATA CAG T-3′, and reverse, 5′-TAG GAT CCC TGA TGG GAC AGA GT-3′; second region: forward, 5′-TCG AAT TCA TGT CAG GAT CCC AGC C-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAG TCG ACA AGG AGA GTG CAG GCA G-3′; third region: forward, 5′-TCG AAT TCA TGC CAG GAG GGT GCC A-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATG TCG ACT CCA CTG CAA GGG GCC C-3′; zinc finger domain: forward, 5′-GCG AAT TCA TGC TGT GTG GGA AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCG GAT CCT CAG GAT GCA TAC TC-3′; ELM2 domain: forward, 5′-CCA GAA TTC GAT GCC ACA TAT CAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTG GAT CCT CAG GTT GGT GCC C-3′; SANT domain: forward, 5′-GGA ATT CGA TGC GAT ACA CAG GT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGG ATC CTC ATC TTT TTC CAG ATG-3′; ELM2-SANT domain: forward, 5′-CCA GAA TTC GAT GCC ACA TAT CAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGG ATC CTC ATC TTT TTC CAG ATG-3′; and subcloned into pEGFP-N2. HEK293T and GC-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were transiently transfected with the pEGFP vector construct using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma), and analyzed for fluorescent signals using a microscope. Primary Cell Culture—Testes were collected from 8-week-old ICR mice. Testes were encapsulated into Hepes buffer and then slightly disintegrated mechanically. The disintegrated seminiferous tubules were incubated in 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (type IV, Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 min with agitation. The buffer was passed through a 70-μm filter (BD Biosciences), and the seminiferous tubules were incubated in 0.5 mg/ml collagenase and 0.25 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 min with agitation, and the buffer was then passed through 40-μm filter (BD Biosciences). The filtrate was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and testicular cells in the pellet were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The isolated testicular cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 mm valproic acid (VPA, Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 20 h (8.Backliwal G. Hildinger M. Kuettel I. Delegrange F. Hacker D.L. Wurm F.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2008; 101: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After 20 h, we observed that somatic cells (<5%) isolated from mouse testis stuck to the dish, and the isolated testicular cells (>95%) were still in suspension. The different types of testicular cells were distinguishable by cell size and distinctive features of nucleus by Hoechst staining. We obtained pure testicular cells from the medium. The cell viability was ascertained by the 0.4% trypan blue. Amino Acid Sequences and Specific Domains of Mm. 290718/ZFP541—The novel spermatogenic cell-specific gene Mm.290718 encodes 1302 residues (Fig. 1A) with a predicted molecular mass of 148 kDa. Based on our in silico analysis utilizing the InterProScan database and gene information at NCBI, the amino acid sequence of Mm.290718 is predicted to contain specific motifs and domains. First, Mm.290718 contains five zinc finger motifs (Fig. 1, A and B) that bind to DNA. Among the five motifs, three are found in the N terminus (positions 142-162, 170-190, and 198-221) and the other two are located at positions 40-860 and 1242-1262. These five domains represent the C2H2 type of zinc finger subfamily. The Mm.290718 gene was designated “zinc finger protein 541” (ZFP541) at NCBI during the course of our study. Accordingly, we denote the gene “Mm.290718/ZFP541” in this study. Second, the Mm.290718/ZFP541 protein contains an ELM2 (Egl-27 and MTA1 homology 2) domain (Fig. 1, A-C). The ELM2 domain is conserved with the consensus sequence AXX- LXXXXXDXXXAXXL. Both the Egl-27 protein in Caenorhabditis elegans and the MTA1 protein in human are components of a nucleosome-remodeling complex containing histone deacetylase (9.Solari F. Bateman A. Ahringer J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the Mm.290718/ZFP541 protein contains a SANT (Swi3, Ada2, co-repressor NCoR, and TFIIIB) domain (Fig. 1, A-C), a 50-residue motif consisting of three α-helices (10.Boyer L.A. Latek R.R. Peterson C.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The SANT domain is found in the subunits of a number of chromatin-remodeling complexes. Moreover, most ELM2 domain-containing proteins include the SANT domain (11.Ding Z. Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Together, the in silico features of Mm.290718/ZFP541 support the theory of a DNA-binding protein involved in chromatin remodeling. Characterization of Mm.290718/ZFP541 in Mouse Spermatogenic Cells—To determine the expression profile of Mm.290718/ZFP541 in spermatogenic cells, we generated a polyclonal antibody against a glutathione S-transferase recombinant protein containing the N-terminal zinc finger motif. Immunoblot analysis was performed on testes from normal and germ cell-devoid mutant mice. Mm.290718/ZFP541 with a molecular size of 159 kDa was detected in normal but not germ cell-lacking testis, suggestive of germ cell-specific protein expression (Fig. 2A). Further immunoblot analysis was performed with mouse testis obtained at different times after birth. Mm.290718/ZFP541 was expressed in 16-day-old postnatal mouse testis, and its level increased during development (Fig. 2B). Most cells in the testis on day 8 are somatic, and the proportion of germ cells increases as spermatogenesis proceeds. Thus, the data suggest germ cell-specific expression of the Mm.290718/ZFP541 protein. To determine the expression pattern of Mm.290718/ZFP541 in germ cells during spermatogenesis, the protein level was examined in cells from different stages during sperm development. Mm.290718/ZFP541 protein was detected in testicular cells, but not testicular and mature sperm (Fig. 2C), indicating developmentally regulated expression. To further establish the cellular localization of Mm.290718/ZFP541, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using paraffin sections of adult mouse testis. In seminiferous tubules of paraffinized sections, we observed the Mm.290718/ZFP541 protein signal in spermatocytes and round spermatids. The protein was specifically localized in the cell nuclei (Fig. 2D). However, Mm.290718/ZFP541 was absent from cells beyond the stage of round spermatids. Our results collectively demonstrate that Mm.290718/ZFP541 is a nuclear protein, and its expression in spermatogenic cells is regulated in a developmental stage-dependent manner. Subcellular Localization of Mm.290718/ZFP541—To further investigate the subcellular localization of Mm.290718/ZFP541 protein at the domain level, GFP-tagged cDNA sequences corresponding to the various domains and regions of Mm.290718/ZFP541 were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The first region containing three zinc finger motifs was localized mainly in the cytoplasm. Cells transfected with only the zinc finger motifs displayed a localization pattern similar to the control (nucleus and cytoplasm). In contrast, the second region containing one zinc finger motif was identified specifically in the nucleus. Upon transfection of cells with the ELM2 domain, we detected the signal in the nucleus and cytoplasm, similar to control cells. In contrast, the SANT and ELM2-SANT domains were only found in the nucleus. The nuclear localization pattern was similar with the third region containing ELM2 and SANT domains and the final zinc finger motif. In these cases, GFP signals were most abundant in the subnuclear spherical regions (Fig. 3B). Our data suggest that specific zinc finger motifs and the SANT domain are responsible for targeting of the Mm.290718/ZFP541 protein to the nucleus. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the GFP-tagged proteins could behave differently from the way the native proteins would, and the localization patterns in HEK293T cells could be different from those in germ cells. Identification of Proteins Associated with Mm.290718/ZFP541 by Proteomic Analysis—To establish the functional characteristics of Mm.290718/ZFP541, we identified the interacting proteins. Immunoprecipitation with protein lysates from mouse testis was performed using the anti-Mm.290718/ZFP541 antibody. Precipitates were subjected to tryptic digestion, followed by mass spectrometry analysis, such as capillary reverse phase liquid chromatography-MS/MS and peptide mass fingerprinting. These experiments resulted in the identification of 11 proteins, with reproducibility in three individual experiments (Table 2). The identified proteins include a previously unexplored potential testis-specific protein (KCTD19), a critical protein for transcription regulation and chromatin organization (HDAC1), a well known spermatogenic cell-specific molecular chaperone (HSPA2, also known as HSP70.2), and several proteins related to the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex (deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminal-interacting protein 1, gem-associated protein 5, small nuclear ribo-nucleoprotein Sm D1, probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX20, and survivor of motor neuron protein-interacting protein 1 with unknown function). Based on the properties of Mm.290718/ZFP541 predicted from in silico analyses (zinc finger motifs and the SANT domain), cell type distribution (spermatogenic cells), and subcellular localization (nucleus) results, we further characterized the interacting KCTD19, HSPA2, and HDAC1 proteins (see below).TABLE 2Proteins associated with Mm.290718/ZFP541No.Protein descriptionSwiss-Prot (UniProtKB)Matched peptideaNumber of non-redundant peptides that were identified for each protein.Xcorr/ΔCn (max)bMaximum Xcorr and ΔCn values using TurboSEQUEST software were obtained for any of the peptides identified for a single protein.Measured mass (kDa)/pIcData were calculated using TurboSEQUEST software.Protein coverage (%)dProtein coverage was calculated based on the amino acid count.Peptides1Potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein Kctd19KCTD19_MOUSE (Q562E2-2)146.83/0.53107.3/6.523.1K.

https://openalex.org/W2141472960,"The earliest steps in nascent protein maturation greatly affect its overall efficiency. Constraints placed on maturing proteins at these early stages limit available conformations and help to direct the native maturation process. For type II membrane proteins, these cotranslational constraints include N- and C-terminal membrane tethering, chaperone binding, and disulfide bond formation. The cotranslational maturation process for the type II membrane glycoprotein influenza neuraminidase (NA) was investigated to provide a deeper understanding of these initial endoplasmic reticulum events. The type II orientation provides experimental advantages to monitor the first maturation steps. Calnexin was shown to cotranslationally interact with NA prior to calreticulin. These interactions were required for the efficient maturation of NA as it prematurely formed intramolecular disulfides and aggregated when calnexin and calreticulin interactions were abolished. Lectin chaperone binding slowed the NA maturation process, increasing its fidelity. Carbohydrates were required for NA maturation in a regio-specific manner. A subset of NA formed intermolecular disulfides and oligomerized cotranslationally. This fraction increased in the absence of calnexin and calreticulin binding. NA dimerization also occurred for an NA mutant lacking the critical large loop disulfide bond, indicating that dimerization did not require proper NA oxidation. The strict evaluation of proper maturation carried out by the quality control machinery was instilled at the tetramerization step.

This study illustrates the type II membrane protein maturation process and shows how important cotranslational events contribute to the proper cellular maturation of glycoproteins. Protein folding in living cells begins during synthesis or cotranslationally (1Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Frydman J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). By folding cotranslationally, a protein can fold vectorially with the N-terminal region folding prior to completion of the synthesis of its C terminus. Coupling protein folding and synthesis tapers the possible ensemble of the available folding intermediates during progression to the native state, thereby minimizing nonproductive options, which helps to increase the overall fidelity of the folding reaction (3Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32715-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Additionally, cotranslational folding ensures that the vulnerable nascent chain initially resides in a controlled environment optimized for proper folding (4Clark P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 527-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For proteins that traverse the secretory pathway, translation is linked to translocation producing a cotranslational and cotranslocational process that supports folding upon entrance into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NA, neuraminidase, CNX, calnexin; CRT, calreticulin; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; DNJ, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; JBM, jack bean α-mannosidase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. lumen through the Sec61 translocon. The translocon and its associated proteins provide a privileged folding environment that favors proper maturation and limits interchain aggregation (6Chen W. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol.

Understanding cotranslational protein maturation and the organization of the ER translocon folding environment is of fundamental biological concern. Nascent proteins can start to fold or form disulfide bonds as soon as the completed domain or Cys residues are translocated into the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen (1Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10Kowarik M. Kung S. Martoglio B. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ER houses various molecular chaperones, foldases, folding sensors, and covalent modifiers that assist with the proper folding and assembly of nascent proteins (11Cabral C.M. Liu Y. Sifers R.N.

Sci. 2003; 28: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It also provides a quality control system that permits properly folded and completely assembled proteins to exit the ER for trafficking to the Golgi (12Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 15Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Proteins that fail to reach their native state are generally retained in the ER and eventually degraded through the ER-associated protein degradation pathway (16Brodsky J.L. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The vast majority of proteins that traverse the secretory pathway are glycosylated. N-linked glycans are cotranslationally added when the consensus glycosylation site (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) resides ∼12–14 amino acids away from the translocon (17Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bulky, hydrophilic, and flexible N-linked glycans act as maturation and quality control tags that mediate interactions with molecular chaperones or quality control sorting receptors (13Hebert D.N. Garman S.C. Molinari M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18Caramelo, J. J., and Parodi, A. J. (2008) J. Biol.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). In the ER, the carbohydrate-binding molecular chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) assist glycoproteins with maturation. They recognize monoglucosylated N-linked carbohydrates (Glc1ManxGlcNAc2) (21Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 22Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), which are rapidly generated through sequential trimming of triglucosylated species (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) by the ER glucosidases I and II. Lectin chaperone binding persists until glucosidase II trims the final glucose. The unbound substrate is then free to fold and assemble to its native state (23Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 24Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Proteins with non-native or immature conformations are reglucosylated by the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT1) to re-enter the CNX binding cycle (25Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Caramelo J.J. Parodi A.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Pearse B.R. Gabriel L. Wang N. Hebert D.N. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, glucosidase II and GT1 act antagonistically to support retention of immature, misfolded, or unassembled proteins in the CNX cycle and the ER (18Caramelo, J. J., and Parodi, A. J. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 10221–10225Google Scholar, 28Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Viral proteins have been used as model substrates to advance our general knowledge of cellular protein maturation because they utilize the host cellular machinery for their maturation and are expressed at high levels in infected cells (29Copeland C.S.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Little is known about the early maturation steps for type II membrane proteins. Initially, they are dually constrained by the N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane segment that tethers the polypeptide to the membrane and the C-terminal attachment to the ribosome and translocon. The type II orientation provides technical advantages for live cell cotranslational protein maturation studies, which support the ability to monitor these critical early events in detail. Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is a type II membrane glycoprotein. The structure of the enzymatically active head domain for the avian NA subtype 9 has been solved (31Tulip W.R. Varghese J.N. Baker A.T. van Donkelaar A. Laver W.G. Webster R.G. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). N9 NA contains seven N-linked carbohydrates, nine intramolecular disulfide bonds, and two additional Cys residues that might be involved in intermolecular linkages. In this study, we investigated the molecular chaperone-assisted cotranslational folding and maturation processes of NA, uncovering critical early steps in the maturation process for a type II membrane protein. Reagents—The T7 transcription kit was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Reagents for cell-free translation (Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate, DTT, RNasin) were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). EasyTag [35S]Met/Cys was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture and transfection reagents are as follows. Minimum essential alpha medium, fetal bovine serum, Lipofectamine 2000, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Opti-MEM were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Protein A-Sepharose and G-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. NA and CRT antiserum were from Dr. G. M. Air (Oklahoma City, OK) and Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), respectively. Anti-CNX antibodies were described previously (32Wang N. Daniels R. Hebert D.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3740-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Construction of His-tagged NA and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding wild type N9 subtype NA (NA WT) of the influenza virus A/tern/Australia/G70C/75 in the plasmid pBluescript KS+ was from Dr. G. Laver (Canberra, Australia). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For affinity purification of full-length and nascent chain NA peptides, a His8 tag was added to the N terminus to generate NA WT*. Site-directed mutagenesis using pBluescript-NA WT* as the template was used to generate the following mutants: C41S*, C43S*, C41/43S*, C93/419S*, and to generate the glycosylation site mutations S44A*, S54A*, T65A*, T68A*, T89A*, T149A*, S204A*, Δstem glycan*, Δhead glycan*, and glycan null*. Translations—NA WT* and single glycan mutants* in pBluescript were linearized by digestion with KpnI, and the C terminus truncations were created by digestion with BsaI, BstZ17I, BglII, and EcoRI. The digestion products were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]Met/Cys and translocated for 1 h at 27 °C into rough ER microsomes or semipermeabilized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, as described previously (32Wang N.

Transfection of CHO Cells and Metabolic Labeling—CHO cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (34Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Following infection and 4 h of transient transfection, CHO cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) and starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking Cys and Met, with or without 1 mm N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (DNJ). 5 μg/ml of tunicamycin was added 3 h after infection as indicated. Cells were pulsed with 220 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys, and 5 mm DTT was used for reducing pulse experiments when indicated. After pulse/chase, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS/20 mm N-ethylmaleimide and incubated for 10 min on ice with PBS/20 mm N-ethylmaleimide/1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then scraped, pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 5 min in 4 °C, and lysed in 1% Nonidet-P40, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ng/μl leupeptin, and 10 ng/μl pepstatin, 50 mm imidazole in PBS for nickel-Sepharose purification.

Co-immunoprecipitants were eluted by heating to 95 °C for 5 min in 100 μl of 1% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, cooled to room temperature. Samples were subsequently diluted with freshly made 2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 250 mm NaCl, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Affinity purification by nickel chelation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glycosidase digestion was performed as described previously (23Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE—Tube Gel Adaptor Kit SE 220 from Hoefer Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) was used for casting of 4% acrylamide stacking and 7.5%/11% acrylamide-resolving tube gels; discontinuous SDS-PAGE was performed under nonreducing conditions. Following electrophoresis, the tube gels were extruded and heated for 5 min at 95 °C in sample buffer with 100 mm DTT, layered onto 1.5-mm-thick minigels, and subjected to a second dimension of 7.5/11% SDS-PAGE, as indicated. Signal was visualized by phosphorimaging (FLA-500; Fuji). Data were analyzed and quantified using Multi-Gauge V. 2.02 (Fuji). Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds Link NA Dimers and Tetramers—Cotranslational studies require a method to equally isolate the shortest translation intermediates and longer or full-length nascent chains. Polyclonal antibodies raised against purified proteins generally favor the isolation of longer chains because they often recognize more epitopes on the longer chains when compared with shorter nascent chains. The employment of antibodies that solely recognize an N-terminal epitope is complicated by the fact that most secretory cargoes contain cleavable N-terminal targeting sequences. An antibody generated against the mature N-terminal amino acids, in the case of influenza hemagglutinin, only recognized the substrate after signal sequence cleavage (7Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The employment of a class II membrane protein with a noncleavable N-terminal signal sequence as a model maturation substrate circumvents these problems. The N-terminal six amino acids of NA subtype N9 reside in the cytoplasm, and therefore, are unlikely to contribute to the proper folding of the ectodomain of the protein within the ER lumen (Fig. 1A) (for review, see Ref. 35Colman P.M. Krug R.M. The Influenza Viruses. Plenum Press, New York1989: 175-218Crossref Google Scholar). To create a method for efficient isolation of the shortest translation and maturation intermediates, the four N-terminal cytosolic amino acids that follow the initiating Met were exchanged for a poly-His affinity tag. To determine whether the N-terminal tag altered NA maturation, the oxidation and oligomerization of wild type NA (WT) or poly-His-NA (WT*) were monitored in CHO cells. These cells were transfected with NA WT or WT* and pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 30 min before alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide to block free thiol reactive groups. WT NA was immunoprecipitated with NA antisera, whereas WT* was affinity-purified with Ni-NTA agarose. 35S-labeled NA was then analyzed by nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Three bands were observed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE with WT NA (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The fastest migrating band of ∼60 kDa corresponded to NA monomer. This nonreduced band migrated slightly faster than the reduced protein (Fig. 1B, lane 6), suggestive of the oxidized sample containing intramolecular disulfides that created a more compact structure (36Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Two additional bands migrated at ∼120 and ∼240 kDa. These bands were both reduced by the addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT; Fig. 1B, lane 6), suggesting that they are homodimers (denoted as D) and homotetramers (designated as T). Equivalent results were obtained for WT*-NA (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 7), indicating that the alteration of the NA N terminus did not appear to affect its maturation. The role of the stem domain Cys residues 41 and 43 in supporting intermolecular interactions was investigated by mutating them to Ser. When the Cys were mutated individually (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), NA formed monomers and dimers. However, when both Cys were altered (C41/43S*; Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 10), no covalent oligomers were detected. The monomeric band, however, migrated with identical mobility to WT* upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE, indicating intramolecular disulfide pairing. In summary, NA of subtype N9 forms intramolecular and intermolecular disulfides. The stem domain residues Cys-41 and Cys-43 support the formation of covalent dimers and tetramers. Cotranslational Oxidation Increases the Maturation Efficiency of NA—To address the necessity for maturation to commence cotranslationally, the oxidation of NA initiated cotranslationally was compared with post-translational initiation. Post-translational oxidation requires that the protein be synthesized under reducing conditions during the radioactive pulse and subsequently chased for various times under oxidizing conditions. The oxidizing environment of the ER can be rapidly re-established after DTT removal (36Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The NA maturation efficiency under co- or post-translational disulfide bond-forming conditions was compared by quantifying the efficiency of oligomerization, including the relative amounts of dimer and tetramer, and trafficking to the Golgi using an endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivity assay (Fig. 2). NA was able to form oligomers under both cotranslational and post-translational oxidizing conditions. However, the efficiency of oligomerization was greatly diminished when oxidation was initiated post-translationally. Cotranslational oxidation conditions supported a peak oligomerization level of 65% after 120 min (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–10, and 2B). Maximal oligomerization with post-translational oxidation was approximately half that observed for cotranslational oxidation (Fig. 2A, lanes 11–20, and 2B). Also, a large fraction of the oligomers formed under post-translational oxidation conditions were ER-export deficient, as indicated by the persistent Endo H sensitivity observed after 120 min of chase (Fig. 2A, right panel, and 2C). In contrast, NA oxidized under cotranslational conditions was transported to the Golgi in a time-dependent manner, increasing to a maximum level of 55% after 120 min (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–10, and 2C). Interestingly, both the dimer and the tetramer were export-competent, indicating that intermolecular disulfide-linked tetramerization is not required for NA export. Together, these results show that cotranslational oxidation provides a more efficient mechanism for NA maturation. Head Domain Glycans Are Required for NA Maturation—N-linked glycans play key roles in the maturation of glycoproteins (13Hebert D.N. Garman S.C. Molinari M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Hebert D.N. Molinari M. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1377-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 20Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). NA has four consensus sites for glycosylation in its stem domain (Asn-42, -52, -63, and -66) and three in its head domain (Asn-87, -147, and -202) (Fig. 1A). To determine which N-linked glycosylation sites on NA were utilized, a panel of NA point mutants was constructed with Ser or Thr mutated to Ala within the individual glycosylation consensus sequence. The mutants were in vitro translated in the presence of ER-derived microsomes and glucosidase (N-butyl deoxynojirimycin, DNJ) and mannosidase (deoxymannojirimycin) inhibitors to remove any heterogeneity in protein mobility created by glycan trimming (23Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 37Hebert D.N. Zhang J.-X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All seven single site mutants migrated ∼3 kDa faster upon reducing SDS-PAGE, indicative of the absence of the corresponding glycan (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–8). The slower rate of in vitro translation can allow for prolonged exposure of the nascent protein to the ER translocon, increasing occupancy efficiency of suboptimal N-linked glycosylation sites (33Újvári A. Aron R. Eisenhaure T. Cheng E. Parag H.A. Smicun Y. Halaban R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5924-5931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, similar results were also obtained when the NA glycosylation mutants were expressed in live cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 9–16), demonstrating that all seven glycosylation sites of NA are efficiently occupied. Some glycoproteins can undergo improper folding, misassembly, intracellular retention, and degradation if glycosylation is inhibited, whereas for others, glycosylation is dispensable or only a subset of the glycosylation sites are essential (20Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). To evaluate the necessity of NA glycans for proper maturation, a chemical inhibitor of glycosylation (tunicamycin) and additional NA mutants were utilized. NA was radiolabeled for 5 min and then chased for various times. WT* NA initially migrated predominantly as a monomeric protein (Fig. 3B, lane 1); mobility increased with time, indicative of glycan trimming because the mobility difference persisted upon reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–3). The level of NA oligomerization also increased with time. In sharp contrast, when glycosylation was inhibited by tunicamycin treatment, most of the protein was found in high molecular weight intermolecularly cross-linked aggregates at the top of the gel under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6). The monomeric protein migrated ∼15 kDa faster by reducing SDS-PAGE, indicative of the absence of all seven glycans. Tunicamycin abolishes the transfer of N-linked glycans to all glycoproteins. This activates an ER stress response due to accumulation of unfolded proteins, which can disrupt the activity of the ER (38Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). To ensure that the requirement for NA glycans was a direct effect, the maturation of mutant NA missing all seven glycosylation sites was analyzed (Fig. 3B, lanes 7–9; glycan null*). Equivalent results were obtained with glycan null* and WT* plus tunicamycin. Glycan null* NA was predominantly found in large intermolecularly linked aggregates. Therefore, NA glycosylation is essential for its proper maturation in the ER. Next we asked, which glycans are essential for proper NA folding and maturation? To address this question, the maturation of NA single glycan mutants was analyzed (Fig. 3C). All mutants expressed in CHO cells were able to form dimers and tetramers with similar efficiencies to wild type NA, demonstrating that no individual glycan was required for NA maturation. To determine whether glycan clusters were required for NA maturation, mutants lacking either stem domain glycans (Asn-42, -52, -63, -66; Δstem glycan*) or head domain glycans (Asn-87, -147, -202; Δhead glycan*) were expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, NA was able to efficiently oligomerize without the four stem domain glycans, but the majority of NA lacking its three head domain glycans was found in intermolecularly linked aggregates at the top of the nonreducing gel. These results demonstrated that the head domain glycans were required for the proper maturation of NA but that the stem domain glycans were dispensable. Temporal CNX and CRT Binding and NA Oligomerization—The lectin chaperones CNX and CRT can promote protein folding, oligomeric assembly, and quality control in the ER through their recognition of monoglucosylated N-linked glycans on maturing substrates (21Ou W.J.

To analyze binding of CNX and CRT to NA, CHO cells were radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 5 min and then chased for various times. NA was directly isolated with Ni-NTA agarose or co-immunoprecipitated with either CNX or CRT antisera prior to affinity purification. Both CNX and CRT transiently bound monomeric NA with a half-time of ∼7.5 min (Fig. 4, lanes 13–18 and 25–30). This binding required glucose trimming because the addition of the glucosidase inhibitor DNJ greatly diminished CNX and CRT interactions (Fig. 4, lanes 19–24 and 31–36). In the pre"
https://openalex.org/W1968182774,"Little information is available on the ability of terminally differentiated cells to efficiently repair DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and one might reasonably speculate that efficient DNA repair of these threatening DNA lesions, is needed in cells of long life span with no or limited regeneration from precursor. Few tissues are available besides neurons that allow the study of DNA DSBs repair activity in very long-lived cells. Adipocytes represent a suitable model since it is generally admitted that there is a very slow turnover of adipocytes in adult. Using both Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and the disappearance of the phosphorylated form of the histone variant H2AX, we demonstrated that the ability to repair DSBs is increased during adipocyte differentiation using the murine pre-adipocyte cell line, 3T3F442A. In mammalian cells, DSBs are mainly repaired by the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) that relies on the DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity. During the first 24 h following the commitment into adipogenesis, we show an increase in the expression and activity of the catalytic sub-unit of the DNA-PK complex, DNA-PKcs. The increased in DNA DSBs repair activity observed in adipocytes was due to the increase in DNA-PK activity as shown by the use of DNA-PK inhibitor or sub-clones of 3T3F442A deficient in DNA-PKcs using long term RNA interference. Interestingly, the up-regulation of DNA-PK does not regulate the differentiation program itself. Finally, similar positive regulation of DNA-PKcs expression and activity was observed during differentiation of primary culture of pre-adipocytes isolated from human sub-cutaneous adipose tissue. Our results show that DNA DSBs repair activity is up regulated during the early commitment into adipogenesis due to an up-regulation of DNA-PK expression and activity. In opposition to the general view that DNA DSBs repair is decreased during differentiation, our results demonstrate that an up-regulation of this process might be observed in post-mitotic long-lived cells."

GalAGs are linear polysaccharides of 1→4-linked repeating disaccharide units. The disaccharide units consist of a uronic acid (α-l-iduronic acid; IdoA or β-d-glucuronic acid; GlcA) linked 1→3 to a β-d-N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc). Each disaccharide unit can additionally possess variations in the form of sulfation at the 2-O and 3-O positions of the uronic acid and 4-O and 6-O positions of the GalNAc (1Sasisekharan R. Raman R.

The application of cABCI at the site of central nervous system injury is believed to prune CS chains from proteoglycans localized to the glial scar. The absence of these CS chains, inhibitory to axon regeneration, facilitates neural outgrowth and reconstruction of damaged tissue. However, the use of chondroitinases as therapeutics is limited because of the lack of availability of pure and contaminant-free enzyme. Further, chondroitinase enzymes are often difficult to handle, because of thermal instability and spontaneous proteolysis, as reported by various groups (12Hamai A. Hashimoto N. Mochizuki H. Kato F.

In fact, the ability of the conventional enzyme known as “chondroitinase ABC” to catalyze the complete depolymerization of GalAG substrates to disaccharides is actually the result of the joint action of cABCI and cABCII. Recently, cABCI from P. vulgaris was cloned, recombinantly expressed, and characterized biochemically in terms of its active site and the role of divalent cations in processing CS and DS substrates (10Prabhakar V.

Building on our previous efforts, the present study describes the cloning, recombinant expression, and biochemical characterization of cABCII from P. vulgaris. Using an efficient system of Escherichia coli-mediated expression and purification, recombinant cABCII was obtained, and the conditions for its optimal activity were examined. The kinetic parameters and mode of action of the enzyme were characterized using CS and DS substrates. In contrast to cABCI, which is predominantly an endolytic enzyme, cABCII is an exolytic enzyme that cleaves the substrate only at the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide. Furthermore, cABCII was able to efficiently cleave a DS tetrasaccharide that was resistant to cleavage by cABCI (10Prabhakar V. Raman R. Capila I. Bosques C.J. Pojasek K. Sasisekharan R. Biochem.

The establishment of a contaminant-free recombinant cABCII and detailed characterization of its structure-function relationship enables using this enzyme in a variety of biotechnological applications that include sequencing biologically important GalAG motifs and augmenting therapeutic strategies to reverse central nervous system deficit. Isolating Chondroitinase ABC II from P. vulgaris—Genomic DNA was isolated from cultures of P. vulgaris (ATCC 6896) using a DNeasy purification kit (Qiagen). The primers were designed based on the available sequence of the gene for both the full-length and mature versions (19Ryan, M. J., Khandke, K. M., Tilley, B. C., and Lotvin, J. A. (November 10, 1994) International Patent WO 94/25567Google Scholar). Forward primers were designed so as to incorporate an NdeI restriction site; the reverse primer was designed to incorporate BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. This allowed cloning into a pET-28a vector (Novagen). The primers for cloning cABCII had the sequences: 5′-CATATGCTAATAAAAAACCCTTTAGCCC-3′ (forward primer for the full-length gene), 5′-CATATGTTACCCACTCTGTCTCATGAAGC-3′ (forward primer for the truncated gene-excluding signal sequence), and 5′-GGATCCTCGAGTTACTTAACTAAATTAATAACAGTAGG-3′ (reverse primer). It should be noted that for the truncated gene an additional methionine was introduced into the primer sequence to allow for translation of the protein product. This causes an increment in the numbering of the residues by one for the final protein product thus produced. PCR was run using genomic DNA as template with an extension time of 3 min. The PCR product was ligated into the pCR 4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP10 E. coli cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated, and the cABCII gene was excised by exploiting the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The excised gene was ligated into similarly digested pET28a. These ligation products were transformed into DH5α E. coli cells. Plasmid DNA isolated from the colonies was screened by restriction digestion for incorporation of the cABCII gene. Sequencing was also undertaken to confirm incorporation of the gene. E. coli cells (BL21(DE3)) were transformed with plasmid DNA for expression. Protein Preparation—Recombinant cABCII was expressed in E. coli using an adapted version of a previous approach (5Pojasek K. Shriver Z. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Prabhakar V. Capila I. Bosques C.J. Pojasek K. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The pET28a expression system contains an inducible T7 promoter, as well as an N-terminal six-histidine tag for facile purification. Cultures of Luria-Bertani broth containing kanamycin were inoculated, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in mid-log phase (A600 =∼0.8), and incubated at room temperature overnight. Centrifugation was used to harvest the cells, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was kept on ice and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.9 (binding buffer), and then lysed by sonication. Soluble protein was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The soluble lysate was sequentially filtered through a 0.8-μm membrane and then a 0.45-μm membrane. A 5-ml Hi-Trap Metal Chelate column (GE Healthcare) was prepared by charging with 200 mm NiSO4 and treatment with binding buffer. The protein was loaded onto the column, washed with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole, and eluted into a similar buffer with increased imidazole (250 mm). The six-histidine tag was removed using a thrombin capture kit (Novagen) as previously described (20Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The presence and purity of the proteins was assessed by standard methods using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used with plasmid DNA template to induce mutations in the cABCII clone. As previously described (18Prabhakar V. Capila I. Bosques C.J. Pojasek K. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), plasmid denaturation and annealing of custom-crafted complementary oligonucleotide primers were used to introduce mutations. The primers were designed as follows (all primers are read in the 5′ → 3′ orientation): the 5′ I23T primer had the sequence GAA GGT GAA TTA CCC AAT ACC CTT ACC ACT TC and the 3′ I23T primer had the sequence GA AGT GGT AAG GGT ATT GGG TAA TTC ACC TTC; the 5′ G247V primer had the sequence TGG GAA AAA TTG GTG TTA ACA CAA CAC GCT GAT GGC and the 3′ G247V primer had the sequence GCC ATC AGC GTG TTG TGT TAA CAC CAA TTT TTC CCA; the 5′ R356W primer had the sequence CC AGA GAA CTT TTT GAT GCA TGG TTT ATT GGC CGT C and the 3′ R356W primer had the sequence G ACG GCC AAT AAA CCA TGC ATC AAA AAG TTC TCT GG; the 5′ D389N primer had the sequence GGA CGT ATT TTT GAA AAA AAT AAT GAA ATT GTT GAT GCA AAT GTC and the 3′ D389N primer had the sequence GAC ATT TGC ATC AAC AAT TTC ATT ATT TTT TTC AAA AAT ACG TCC; and the 5′ H490R primer had the sequence CGC TTA TCT ACT TCA GCA CAT GAG CGT TTA AAA GAT G and the 3′ H490R primer had the sequence C ATC TTT TAA ACG CTC ATG TGC TGA AGT AGA TAA GCG. Extension of the primers in a PCR machine with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase followed. The mutated plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. The plasmids were prepared using a Qiagen miniprep kit. Each clone was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. Plasmid DNA was used to transform BL21 (DE3) E. coli. In addition to the mutants described above, other mutations in residues believed to be important for enzyme activity were also made. The primer sequences for each of the mutants are listed below. The H344A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-CGA GGA AGT GGT TAT CAA ATT ATT ACT GCT GTT GGT TAC CAA ACC-3′ and 5′-GGT TTG GTA ACC AAC AGC AGT AAT AAT TTG ATA ACC ACT TCC TCG-3′. The H453A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-CT GAT GGT TCT ATT TTT GCC CAT TCA CAA CAT TAC CCC GC-3′ and 5′-GC GGG GTA ATG TTG TGA ATG GGC AAA AAT AGA ACC ATC AG-3′. The H454A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-C AAA TCT GAT GGT TCT ATT TTT CAC GCT TCA CAA CAT TAC CCC GC-3′ and 5′-GC GGG CTA ATG TTG TGA AGC GTG AAA AAT AGA ACC ATC AGA TTT G-3′. The H457A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-CAC CAT TCA CAA GCT TAC CCC GCT TAT GCT AAA GAT GC-3′ and 5′-GC ATC TTT AGC ATA AGC GGG GTA AGC TTG TGA ATG GTG-3′. The Y461A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-CA CAA CAT TAC CCC GCT GCT GCT AAA GAT GCA TTT GGT GG-3′ and 5′-CC ACC AAA TGC ATC TTT AGC AGC AGC GGG GTA ATG TTG TG-3′. The R514A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-CCT GTG GTA TTA AGT GGT GCT CAT CCA ACT GGG TTG C-3′ and 5′-G CAA CCC AGT TGG ATG AGC ACC ACT TAA TAC CAC AGG-3′. The E609A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-AGC CGT TAT CTT GTT GGT AAT GCT AGC TAT GAA AAT AAC AAC CGT-3′ and 5′-ACG GTT GTT ATT TTC ATA GCT AGC ATT ACC AAC AAG ATA ACG GCT-3′. Composition Analysis of Products from cABCII Processing of CS and DS Substrates—To investigate the composition of the final products of cABCII digestion, capillary electrophoresis was performed as previously described (6Pojasek K. Raman R. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31179-31186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Substrates included C6S from shark cartilage (Sigma), DS from porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma), and C4S from sturgeon notochord (Seikagaku). Exhaustive overnight digestions of substrate by cABCII were analyzed using a Hewlett Packard three-dimensional capillary electrophoresis instrument with an extended path length cell. A voltage of 30 kV was applied using reverse polarity. Oligosaccharides were injected into the capillary using hydrodynamic pressure. They were detected using an ultraviolet detector set to 232 nm. Biochemical Characterization of Chondroitinase ABC II Activity—Substrates (C6S and DS) were dissolved at 1 mg/ml concentration in various buffers to determine the relative effects of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and sodium acetate concentration on enzyme activity, as previously described (18Prabhakar V. Capila I. Bosques C.J. Pojasek K. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Chondroitin from shark cartilage (Seikagaku), hyaluronan from human umbilical cord (Sigma), heparin (Celsus), heparan sulfate (Celsus), and keratan sulfate (Sigma) were also used in these studies. For activity experiments, 2 μl of enzyme was placed in 248 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and reacted with 1 mg/ml substrate at 37 °C (0.25 mg/ml for hyaluronan). Product formation was monitored as an increase in absorbance at 232 nm as a function of time in a SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices) 96-well quartz format. For kinetic assays, 1 μl of enzyme (0.2–1.0 μg/μl) was added to 249 μl of a solution containing a GalAG substrate. Substrate concentration ranged from 0.1 to 5 mg/ml. Product formation was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 232 nm every 2 s. Kinetic parameters were determined using the initial rate of product formation and calculated as previously described based on Michaelis-Menten and Hanes techniques (18Prabhakar V. Capila I. Bosques C.J. Pojasek K. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Modeling the Theoretical cABCII-Substrate Structural Complex—The crystal structure of cABCI from P. vulgaris (Protein Data Bank code 1HN0) was used as a template to obtain the model of cABCII. Initial inspection of the sequence alignment between cABCI and cABCII revealed that cABCII had multiple insertions of large loop regions as compared with cABCI. In addition to cABCI, the crystal structures of distinct cACs (which share the same structural fold with cABCI) from P. heparinus (PhcAC; Protein Data Bank code 1CB8) and from A. aurescens (AacAC; Protein Data Bank code 1RW9) were also used to model the loop regions in cABCII that aligned with either of the cACs. The structural superimposition of cABCI and these distinct cACs was obtained using combinatorial extension-Monte Carlo (CE-MC) multiple structural alignment tool (21Guda C. Scheeff E.D. Bourne P.E. Shindyalov I.N. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2001; 6: 275-286Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). A homology-based structural model of cABCII was generated using the homology module of InsightII v2005 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The deletions in the modeled structure were closed by constrained minimization upon holding most of the structure rigid, except for regions close to the deletion site. This was followed by 300 iterations of steepest descent and 400 iterations of conjugate gradient minimization without including charges. The loops and side chains of all of the residues were then allowed to move freely by performing 500 iterations of steepest descent minimization. The refined structure was then subjected to 500 iterations of steepest descent minimization without including charges and 500 iterations of conjugate gradient minimization including charges to obtain the final predicted model of the cABCII enzyme. The final model of cABCII was validated using Whatif web-based interfaces and the Ramachandran plot explorer (supplemental Fig. S2). A C4S Tetrasaccharide Substrate, (GlcA-GalNAc,4S)2, was docked into the putative active site of cABCII using the following approach. The SuperPose version 1.0 server (22Maiti R. Van Domselaar G.H. Zhang H. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) was used to superimpose the co-crystal structure of cAC-CS tetrasaccharide complex (Protein Data Bank code 1HMW) with the modeled cABCII structure. The CS tetrasaccharide in this cAC complex had a uronic acid with a Δ4,5 unsaturated linkage at the nonreducing end. The starting model of the C4S tetrasaccharide in the cABCII active site was therefore derived from the coordinates of a C4S hexasaccharide (Protein Data Bank code 1C4S), which was superimposed on the CS substrate in the cAC co-crystal structure. The enzyme-substrate complex was subject to minimization without charges with 400 steps of steepest descent and 600 steps of conjugate-gradient methods. This was followed by another 500 steps, each of steepest descent and conjugate-gradient methods with charges. To constrain the ring torsion angles to maintain the ring conformation of the tetrasaccharides during the process of energy minimization, a force constant of 7000 kcal/mol was utilized. To evaluate the exolytic versus endolytic propensity of cABCII in comparison with that of cABCI, an octasaccharide C4S substrate, (GlcA-GalNAc,4S)4, was also docked in a similar fashion (described above) into putative active sites of cABCI and cABCII, respectively. The octasaccharide was generated from the coordinates of a C4S hexasaccharide (Protein Data Bank code 1C4S) by adding another, GlcA-GalNAc,4S, to the reducing end of the hexasaccharide. The viewer, builder, and discover modules of InsightII v2005 (Accelrys) were used for the visualization, structure building, and energy minimization, respectively. The AMBER force field (Amber95) provided with the Discover module was used to assign the potentials for both the enzyme and substrate. The parameters for sulfates and sulfamate groups in glycosaminoglycans described previously (23Huige C.J.M. Altona C. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 56-79Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were incorporated into this force field to assign potentials for the C4S substrates. A distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4*r and scaling of 0.5 for the p1–4 cross terms were used in the discover module for the AMBER force field-based simulations according to the specifications in the InsightII manual. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of cABCII—Two versions of the cABCII gene were cloned from P. vulgaris DNA: a full-length version and a truncated version that corresponds to the mature form of the enzyme, that is, without its putative leader sequence. These cABCII transcripts are ∼3 kb in length—rather large, but still at an appropriate size to tolerate amplification via standard polymerase chain reaction techniques. Following cloning into a TOPO vector, the PCR product was subcloned into the pET28a expression vector. This facilitates E. coli-mediated uptake of the transcript and, ultimately, expression of the protein. Chondroitinase ABC II was expressed in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purification over a charged Ni2+ resin was possible because of the incorporation of an N-terminal His6 tag. As described in our earlier studies on recombinant cABCI (18Prabhakar V. Capila I. Bosques C.J. Pojasek K. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we faced similar challenges because of the discrepancies between our cABCII transcript and the sequence reported previously (19Ryan, M. J., Khandke, K. M., Tilley, B. C., and Lotvin, J. A. (November 10, 1994) International Patent WO 94/25567Google Scholar). The codons of concern occupy positions 23 (our clone contains isoleucine instead of threonine), 247 (glycine instead of valine), 356 (arginine instead of tryptophan), 389 (aspartic acid instead of asparagine), and 490 (histidine instead of arginine). After unsuccessfully trying out different measures to minimize transcript discrepancies (including the use of various high fidelity polymerases), sequential site-directed mutagenesis was successfully employed to achieve the desired DNA sequence. Chondroitinase ABC II was expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal His6 tag. Expression was induced in the log phase by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Purification of cABCII generated in excess of 50 mg of protein/500 ml of culture. SDS/PAGE analysis (Fig. 1A) confirmed the presence of highly pure cABCII at ∼100 kDa, consistent with previously reported masses of the enzyme (12Hamai A. Hashimoto N. Mochizuki H. Kato F. Makiguchi Y. Horie K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9123-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Expression of the full-length cABCII clone generated a protein largely present in the insoluble fraction. The yield of soluble enzyme was greatly improved by the engineered removal of the hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence. We then turned our attention to the truncated clones, both the original sequence and the transcript that underwent our sequential mutagenesis resolution. The recombinant protein with the sequence discrepancies was unable to effectively process GalAG substrates (Fig. 1B). The expression and purification of the modified cABCII gene, on the other hand, generated a protein product with reinvigorated functionality as demonstrated by the observed cleavage"

Because it remains unclear how p63 regulates epithelial cell differentiation, we examined the function(s) of p63 in keratinocyte differentiation through the use of a keratinocyte culture system. ΔNp63; (ΔNp51B), a p63 isoform specifically expressed in basal keratinocytes, suppressed the differentiation of specific late-stage proteins, such as filaggrin and loricrin. In contrast, ΔNp63; induced keratin 1 (K1), which is expressed at the start of differentiation, via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1 activation. However, p63 did not induce K1 expression in the basal layer in vivo, although basal keratinocytes had high levels of p63. This discrepancy was explained by the suppression of K1 expression by dermis-secreted keratinocyte growth factor. This suppression occurred via extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling, and counteracted the p63-mediated induction of K1. Thus, a precise balance between p63 and keratinocyte growth factor mediates the onset of epithelial cell differentiation, through JNK and ERK signaling. These data may provide mechanistic explanations for the pathological features of skin diseases, including psoriasis. p63/p51, a homolog of the tumor suppressor protein p53, is chiefly expressed in epithelial tissues, including the epidermis. p63 affects cell death similar to p53, and also plays important roles in the development of epithelial tissues and the maintenance of epithelial stem cells.

These data may provide mechanistic explanations for the pathological features of skin diseases, including psoriasis. p63, also known as p51, is a homologue of the tumor suppressor protein p53. The p53 family of transcription factors consists of three members, p53, p63, and p73 (1Mills A.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The p63 gene possesses two transcriptional start sites that generate transcripts encoding proteins with (termed TAp63) or without (termed ΔNp63) an N-terminal transactivation (TA) 3The abbreviations used are: TA, transactivation; Lor, loricrin; Fil, filaggrin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR2-III;, FGF receptor 2 III;; CM, conditioned medium; K1, keratin 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. domain. In addition, alternative splicing primarily results in 3 isoforms, p63;, p63;, and p63;, each of which is unique at its C terminus. Despite a high similarity in their structures, members of the p53 family seem to play mostly distinct functions in tumor suppression and development. Whereas mutations of p53 are found in more than half of all human cancers, the overexpression of p63, and particularly of the ΔNp63; isoform, has been reported in a variety of squamous cell cancers (2Glickman J.N. Yang A. Shahsafaei A. McKeon F. Odze R.D. Hum. Pathol. 2001; 32: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Hu H. Xia S.H. Li A.D. Xu X. Cai Y. Han Y.L. Wei F. Chen B.S. Huang X.P.

Edgerton M.E. Westfall M.D. Roberts J.R. Pietenpol J.A. Carbone D.P. Gonzalez A.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7113-7121PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, p63 mutations result in various human hereditary diseases involving ectodermal dysplasia, a variety of abnormalities characterized by defects in the skin and its associated structures (5van Bokhoven H. Brunner H.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). p63-/- mice also display severe abnormalities of the skin, limbs, and mammary glands (6Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 7Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to p53-/- mice that develop apparently normal (8Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). The skin of p63-/- mice has an epidermis that is thin, lacks stratification, and does not express markers of keratinocyte differentiation. These features indicate a critical role for p63 in regulating various facets of epithelial cell biology. The epidermis is organized in several distinct overlying layers designated, from the bottom to the surface, as the basal, spinous, granular, and cornified layers (9Dotto G.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Actively proliferating keratinocytes are limited to the basal layer, and are characterized by their attachment to the underlying basement membrane. As keratinocytes begin to differentiate, they lose contact with the basement membrane and migrate to the suprabasal layer, which is the bottom layer of the spinous layer. Suprabasal layer cells express the differentiation-specific keratins 1 (K1) and 10 (K10) (11Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the granular layer, keratinocytes synthesize filaggrin (Fil) and loricrin (Lor), which contribute to cornified envelope formation in the outermost layer. Thus, the cells undergo complicated changes during differentiation, which requires the precise coordination of various events. A large body of work has highlighted important roles for many molecules in this differentiation process, including myc, Notch, and NF;B (12Honeycutt K.A. Koster M.I. Roop D.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2004; 9: 261-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Okuyama R. Tagami H. Aiba S. J. Dermatol.

Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). p63 also plays an important role in keratinocyte regulation (15Koster M.I. Kim S. Roop D.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2005; 10: 118-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Truong A.B. Khavari P.A. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on the severe epidermal defects found in p63-/- mice, p63 has been implicated in the commitment of the ectoderm to stratified epithelia, as well as in the proliferative potential of epidermal stem cells (6Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 7Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). However, the function(s) of p63 in a post-developmental context remain unclear. Analyses using skin organotypic culture have shown that p63 up-regulates cell growth in a p53-dependent manner (17Truong A.B. Kretz M. Ridky T.W. Kimmel R. Khavari P.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3185-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition, p63 induces K1 expression, which suggests that p63 helps initiate the differentiation process (18Nguyen B.C. Lefort K. Mandinova A. Antonini D. Devgan V. Della Gatta G. Koster M.I. Zhang Z. Wang J. Tommasi di Vignano A. Kitajewski J. Chiorino G. Roop D.R. Missero C. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that p63 function relies on key signaling molecules, such as Notch and IKK; (18Nguyen B.C. Lefort K.

We recently analyzed how p63 controls epidermal homeostasis in the post-developmental stage. Our study revealed that p63 maintains cell immaturity by inhibiting Notch activity (19Okuyama R. Ogawa E.

In addition, p63 inhibits UV-induced apoptosis via Akt activation (20Ogawa E. Okuyama R. Ikawa S. Nagoshi H. Egawa T. Kurihara A. Yabuki M. Tagami H. Obinata M. Aiba S. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the role of p63 in keratinocyte differentiation. We found that whereas p63 induced the initiation of differentiation, it also suppressed progression to late-stage differentiation. Because basal keratinocytes maintain an undifferentiated state in vivo despite high levels of p63, we hypothesized the existence of suppressive factor(s) that counteract the induction of differentiation by p63. We found that differentiation was inhibited by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) secreted from the underlying dermis. We therefore postulated the existence of a network for controlling the initiation of keratinocyte differentiation. Plasmids and Antibodies—The plasmid Rc/CMV-ΔNp63; was constructed as described previously (21Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The plasmid with the AP-1 response element, which was the kind gift of Dr. K. Yokoyama (Riken BioResource Center, Tsukuba, Japan), contains 3 copies of 5′-TGA CTA A-3′ upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in phRL-TK. The reporter plasmid for the K1 regulatory region was obtained by PCR amplification, with the oligonucleotide 5′-CAC AAG AGA TGA AGG ATG TGT CAA CC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-TCT CTA GGC TCT CTG AAA GCA AGA ACC-3′ as the reverse primer. The amplified fragment spanning +7795 to +8395 of the human K1 gene was cloned into the luciferase reporter pGL3-promoter vector (Promega, Tokyo). This region includes the AP-1 consensus sequence 5′-TGA TTC A-3′, which is activated in response to increased calcium concentration (22Huff C.A. Yuspa S.H. Rosenthal D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 377-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lu B. Rothnagel J.A. Longley M.A. Tsai S.Y. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7443-7449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased and used as recommended by their suppliers: mouse anti-p63 monoclonal (4A4, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), rabbit antibodies against phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Thr183/Tyr185), JNK, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Thr202/Tyr204), ERK, phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) (Ser217/Ser221), and MEK (Cell Signaling Technology, Tokyo); rabbit antibodies against K1, K5, K10, Fil, and Lor (Covance, Emeryville, CA); mouse anti-tubulin-; monoclonal (Sigma, Tokyo); and goat anti-KGF antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). A fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo) were used as secondary antibodies. Cell Cultures, Transfection, and Adenoviral Infection—Primary keratinocytes were prepared from the newborn ICR mouse epidermis as described (24Okuyama R. Nguyen B.C. Talora C. Ogawa E. Tommasi di Vignano A. Lioumi M. Chiorino G. Tagami H. Woo M. Dotto G.P. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In brief, the epidermis was separated from the dermis with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen, Tokyo) overnight at 4 °C, plated in dishes precoated with collagen type I (Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan), and cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 4% Chelex-treated fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml; Invitrogen), and 0.05 mm CaCl2. Under these conditions, keratinocytes are maintained in an immature state, and differentiation was induced by the addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm. The reagents added to the media were KGF, fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10; R&D Systems), SP600125 (Merck, Tokyo), and PD98059 (Cell Signaling Technology). Transfections were carried out by use of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Tokyo). To examine promoter activity, the transfected keratinocytes were subjected to a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega) 72 h after transfection. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting nucleotides 576–596 (P-1) and 1728–1748 (P-2) of ΔNp63;, where nucleotide 1 corresponds to the A base of the ΔNp63; cDNA start codon, were synthesized commercially (Thermo, Ulm, Germany). P-1 and P-2 siRNAs recognize the DNA-binding domains of all isoforms and the carboxyl-terminal domains specific to ΔNp63; and TAp63;, respectively. An siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein was used as a control. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing either ΔNp63; or LacZ were generated as described and used at a multiplicity of infection of 50 or as indicated (19Okuyama R. Ogawa E. Nagoshi H. Yabuki M. Kurihara A. Terui T. Aiba S. Obinata M. Tagami H. Ikawa S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Ogawa E. Okuyama R. Ikawa S. Nagoshi H. Egawa T. Kurihara A. Yabuki M. Tagami H. Obinata M. Aiba S. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Adenovirus with LacZ was used as a control. Immunoblotting and Immunostaining—Proteins were extracted from cultured keratinocytes and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (24Okuyama R. Nguyen B.C. Talora C. Ogawa E. Tommasi di Vignano A. Lioumi M. Chiorino G. Tagami H. Woo M. Dotto G.P. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In brief, electroblotted membranes were blocked with TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies, rinsed with TBST, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After additional rinses, the blots were exposed to LumiGLO reagent (Cell Signaling Technology) and then to x-ray film. Equal loading was achieved by normalization of the protein concentration using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Frozen skin sections (6 ;m thick) were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Non-specific binding was blocked by using 5% serum, and the skin sections were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with isotype-specific secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide after the immunostaining. Stained preparations were photographed with a TCS 4D scanner (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) connected to an inverted LEITZ DM IRB microscope (Oberkonen, Germany). Real-time PCR—The total RNA was prepared from primary keratinocytes using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), as recommended by the manufacturer, using 3 ;g of the total RNA as a template. Real-time PCR analyses were performed with a Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and an iCycler (Bio-Rad, Tokyo), using the following primers: for K1, 5′-GAC CAG TCA CGG ATG GAT TC-3′ and 5′-CGA ACT CAT TCT CTG CGT TG-3′; for FGF receptor 2 III; (FGFR2-III;), 5′-AGT TTA AGC AGG AGC ATC GC-3′ and 5′-TCA CAT TGA ACA GAG CCA GC-3′. Statistical Analyses—The data were analyzed using unpaired Student's t tests. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05. ΔNp63; Suppresses Late Differentiation Proteins but Increases K1 Expression—We first examined the effects of p63 on the induction of differentiation markers in keratinocytes. The keratinocyte is an excellent tool for analyzing epithelial tissues, because its features can be modulated in vitro through changes in extracellular calcium concentration. Cells cultivated in a low calcium environment mimic undifferentiated, proliferating keratinocytes. Upon replacement with a high calcium medium, the cells mimic in vivo differentiation processes, which include induction of differentiation-specific proteins such as K1, K10, Fil, and Lor. These proteins can be categorized as early markers (K1 and K10), which are initially expressed in the spinous layer, and late markers (Fil and Lor), whose expression is initially in the granular layer and beyond (11Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ΔNp63; is the predominant p63 isoform expressed in keratinocytes; it is down-regulated at the start of differentiation (25Laurikkala J. Mikkola M.L. James M. Tummers M. Mills A.A. Thesleff I. Development. 2006; 133: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We overexpressed ΔNp63; in keratinocytes using an adenovirus transduction system. We observed that ΔNp63; overexpression decreased levels of the late differentiation markers Fil and Lor, but did not alter K10 levels (Fig. 1A). However, ΔNp63; increased K1 expression (Fig. 1A). This was unexpected, because ΔNp63; is abundantly expressed in the basal layer where K1 is not expressed. K1 expression in the spinous layers was initiated during the differentiation process at time points when ΔNp63; levels were gradually decreasing. To confirm that ΔNp63; was responsible for these changes in differentiation marker levels, we added various amounts of the ΔNp63; vector to our culture system. K1 levels increased with increasing levels of ΔNp63;, in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, Fil levels decreased dose-dependently (Fig. 1, B and C). K1 up-regulation was also verified by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Conversely, ΔNp63; reduction by two independent p63 sequence-specific siRNAs decreased K1 expression (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that ΔNp63; induces the expression of K1, which suggests that p63 induces the initiation of keratinocyte differentiation. ΔNp63; Induction of K1 Is Mediated by JNK Signaling Activation—To investigate the mechanism of the ΔNp63;-dependent induction of K1, we examined the effects of p63 on K1 transcription. Human K1 induction is controlled by a regulatory region located in the 3′ flanking area that includes the AP-1 response element (22Huff C.A. Yuspa S.H. Rosenthal D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 377-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lu B. Rothnagel J.A. Longley M.A. Tsai S.Y. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7443-7449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated the K1 regulatory region and monitored luciferase reporter activity to examine the effects of p63 on K1 gene expression. A shift from low to high calcium concentration transactivated the K1 regulatory region (Fig. 2A), which mimicked the endogenous response of the K1 gene. Transfection of ΔNp63; transactivated the K1 regulatory region (Fig. 2B) and the AP-1 response element (Fig. 2C). Conversely, the activity of the AP-1 response element was decreased following siRNA reduction of p63 (Fig. 2D). AP-1 activity is activated by JNK via Jun phosphorylation. Therefore, we used Western blot analysis to examine the effects of p63 on JNK activity by detecting JNK phosphorylation at threonine 183 and tyrosine 185. ΔNp63; induced JNK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abrogated the ΔNp63;-dependent expression of K1 (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that ΔNp63; induces K1 expression by activating the JNK/AP-1 pathway. KGF Blocks the p63 Induction of K1 Expression—Despite K1 induction by ΔNp63; in pure keratinocyte cultures in vitro, K1 is not induced in basal keratinocytes in vivo, even with high amounts of ΔNp63;. To investigate the reasons for this discrepancy, we sought to determine whether K1 induction was suppressed by the paracrine field effect that is mediated by skin cells except keratinocytes. We focused on dermal fibroblasts, which are thought to be responsible for preserving keratinocyte homeostasis. We collected conditioned medium (CM) from a culture of dermal fibroblasts, and added this CM to a keratinocyte culture (Fig. 3A). Cultured medium partially suppressed the ΔNp63;-induced expression of K1, suggesting that K1 was suppressed by some soluble factor(s) secreted from dermal fibroblasts. We examined the roles of KGF (also known as FGF-7) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the suppression of K1, because both KGF and GM-CSF regulate keratinocyte homeostasis in a paracrine manner (26Szabowski A. Maas-Szabowski N. Andrecht S. Kolbus A. Schorpp-Kistner M. Fusenig N.E. Angel P. Cell. 2000; 103: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). ΔNp63;-dependent K1 induction was blocked by KGF, but not by GM-CSF (Fig. 3B). KGF down-regulated the expression of the K1 protein and its mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, a KGF neutralization antibody clearly enhanced K1 expression, albeit weakly, in LacZ-expressing or ΔNp63;-overexpressing keratinocytes (Fig. 3E). Because our cultivated dermal fibroblasts produced KGF mRNA (Fig. 3F), these results indicated that KGF secreted from dermal fibroblasts was responsible for K1 down-regulation. However, epidermal homeostasis is controlled by several soluble factors in addition to KGF, including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor growth factor-;, and platelet-derived growth factor (27Schroder J.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 20S-24SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ΔNp63; induction of K1 was inhibited by FGF10, an FGF family member that closely resembles KGF (Fig. 3G). Thus, the induction of K1 expression by ΔNp63; was inhibited by dermal fibroblast-expressed KGF. In addition, KGF blocked the expression of K10 and Lor, but did not alter the expression of Fil (Fig. 3H). The KGF-activating ERK Signal Competes with p63 in Inducing K1 Expression—To assess the mechanism of KGF-dependent K1 inhibition, we first tested the possibility that KGF inhibits the activity of the transcriptional regulatory element. ΔNp63; increased K1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1D) and the activity of the K1 regulatory element (Fig. 2B), but KGF inhibited the ΔNp63;-dependent increase of K1 mRNA (Fig. 3D). However, KGF did not inhibit luciferase activity in the K1 regulatory element or in the AP-1 response element (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that KGF controls K1 expression through a mechanism other than the AP-1 response element. We next analyzed ERK signaling, which is thought to mediate not only cell proliferation but also cell differentiation. KGF induced MEK-ERK phosphorylation, and hence MEK-ERK activation (Fig. 4C). Use of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 revealed that K1 expression was up-regulated by the reduction of ERK activity (Fig. 4D). These results suggested the possibility that KGF inhibits K1 expression via ERK activation. However, despite its role in inducing K1 expression, ΔNp63; activated the ERK pathway, similar to KGF (Fig. 4E). To clarify the role of ERK signaling in p63/KGF-mediated K1 expression, we inhibited ERK signaling in ΔNp63;-overexpressing and/or KGF-supplemented keratinocytes. The inhibition of ERK signaling in ΔNp63;-overexpressing keratinocytes enhanced K1 induction (Fig. 4F), indicating that ΔNp63;-mediated ERK activation inhibits K1 induction. Furthermore, ERK signaling inhibition counteracted the KGF-mediated inhibition of p63-induced K1 expression (Fig. 4G). Therefore, we concluded that ΔNp63; suppresses K1 induction by ERK signaling, but that this suppression can be overwhelmed by JNK/AP-1-mediated K1 induction. KGF Inhibits K1 Induction in Vivo—We examined the expression of the KGF receptor, FGFR2-III;, by real time RT-PCR, which revealed an abundance of FGFR2-III; in undifferentiated keratinocytes under low calcium conditions (Fig. 5A). FGFR2-III; expression was minimal in differentiated keratinocytes and in dermal fibroblasts, consistent with previous data showing that FGFR2-III; localizes to the basal layer in vivo (28Finch P.W. Murphy F. Cardinale I. Krueger J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1619-1628PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, KGF chiefly affects undifferentiated keratinocytes, such as basal keratinocytes. We also examined the effect of p63 on FGFR2-III; expression, and found that FGFR2-III; transcription was increased by ΔNp63; expression, but not by TAp63; expression (Fig. 5B). To assess the effects of KGF in vivo, we injected a KGF neutralizing antibody into the subcutaneous space of mouse skin. Although K1 is usually absent from basal keratinocytes, the blockade of KGF-induced K1 expression (Fig. 5, C and D). This suggests that KGF competes with p63 for K1 expression in undifferentiated keratinocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have established specific requirements for p63 in epithelial homeostasis. Here, we show that p63 initiates keratinocyte differentiation via JNK activation, but suppresses keratinocyte progression to the late stages of differentiation. By signaling through ERK, dermis-secreted KGF can counteract the p63-mediated initiation of differentiation. Thus, the balance of p63 and KGF levels regulates the onset of cellular differentiation. p63 Induces Keratinocyte Differentiation Onset via JNK Activation—Defects in the squamous epithelia of p63-/- mice indicate that p63 is necessary for epithelial development. However, p63 is expressed abundantly in the squamous epithelia even after birth and also in some types of cancers, suggesting that p63 can still play an important role in the post-developmental stage. Previously, we reported that p63 supports cell proliferation and integrin expression by inhibiting Notch activity, causing growth-capable keratinocytes to remain in the basal layer (19Okuyama R. Ogawa E. Nagoshi H. Yabuki M. Kurihara A. Terui T. Aiba S. Obinata M. Tagami H. Ikawa S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that ΔNp63; induced K1, the earliest marker that is normally observed in the suprabasal layer, and blocked the induction of the late markers Fil and Lor. Although King et al. (29King K.E. Ponnamperuma R.M. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Lee L.A. Young M.F. Weinberg W.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have reported that ΔNp63; suppresses K1 expression, which is contrary to our findings, Nguyen et al. (18Nguyen B.C. Lefort K. Mandinova A. Antonini D. Devgan V. Della Gatta G. Koster M.I. Zhang Z. Wang J. Tommasi di Vignano A. Kitajewski J. Chiorino G. Roop D.R. Missero C. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) have reported K1 induction in primary mouse keratinocytes, similar to our results. The reason for the discrepancy between our study and that of King et al. (29King K.E. Ponnamperuma R.M. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Lee L.A. Young M.F. Weinberg W.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) remains to be elucidated. Recently, analyses using skin organotypic culture have suggested that p63 plays an important role in initiating keratinocyte differentiation, as well as in maintaining cell growth in developmentally mature keratinocytes (17Truong A.B. Kretz M. Ridky T.W. Kimmel R. Khavari P.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3185-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the organotypic epidermis, ΔNp63; knockdown leads to the impaired expression of squamous epithelium-specific proteins, including K1, K10, and Lor. ΔNp63; knockdown also leads to the re-induction of the simple epithelium-specific proteins K8 and K18. In the absence of ΔNp63;, this differentiation should be blocked at an early point and forbidden to proceed further. Therefore, p63 supports the continuance of cell differentiation, rather than the maintenance of cells in an undifferentiated state. We showed here that p63 activates JNK, a classic stress-activated protein kinase. A number of stress stimuli, including UV radiation and inflammatory cytokines, induce JNK activation. Activated JNK can phosphorylate Jun family transcription factors, such as c-Jun that participates in the activation/formation of the AP-1 complex. The AP-1 complex is a heterogenous set of dimeric proteins, consisting of members of the Jun, Fos, and ATF families. In keratinocytes, AP-1 activation induces K1 transcription (22Huff C.A. Yuspa S.H. Rosenthal D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 377-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lu B. Rothnagel J.A. Longley M.A. Tsai S.Y. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7443-7449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, many other genes have AP-1 binding sites in their promoters, including the late differentiation markers Fil and Lor (30Angel P. Szabowski A. Schorpp-Kistner M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of whether p63 controls late differentiation markers through the JNK/AP-1 pathway has yet to be performed. However, based on our data that ΔNp63; differentially regulates the expressions of K1 and Fil/Lor, ΔNp63; would be required for the initial commitment to the differentiated phenotype (K1 induction). Furthermore, the subsequent down-regulation of ΔNp63; would be required for differentiation progression (Fil/Lor induction). In addition, because AP-1 binding sites are also located in the epidermal growth factor receptor, JNK activation in keratinocytes results in hyperproliferation and tumor formation via epidermal growth factor signaling (31Li G. Gustafson-Brown C. Hanks S.K. Nason K. Arbeit J.M. Pogliano K. Wisdom R.M. Johnson R.S. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32Zenz R. Scheuch H. Martin P. Frank C. Eferl R. Kenner L. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 879-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, p63 induces JNK activation, which can modulate not only differentiation but also proliferation, cell motility, and apoptosis. We primarily analyzed the predominant ΔNp63; isoform of p63, and not the TAp63 isoforms. The ΔNp63 isoforms were originally proposed to act as repressor molecules against TAp63 and p53, but recent studies have indicated that ΔNp63 proteins have unique and independent biological functions. Similar to ΔNp63;, TAp63; could induce K1 expression, but its effect was weaker than that of ΔNp63; (data not shown). Given that the ΔNp63 isoform shares a number of downstream genes with TAp63 (17Truong A.B. Kretz M. Ridky T.W. Kimmel R. Khavari P.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3185-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), the weak induction by TAp63 may be caused by unstable characteristics of the isoform. Furthermore, the skin phenotype of p63-null mice can be partially rescued by the expression of ΔNp63, but not by the expression of TAp63 (33Candi E. Rufini A. Terrinoni A. Dinsdale D. Ranalli M. Paradisi A. De Laurenzi V. Spagnoli L.G. Catani M.V. Ramadan S. Knight R.A. Melino G. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, differentiation can be chiefly governed by ΔNp63;, although we cannot neglect the contribution of the TAp63 isoforms. KGF Counteracts p63-induced K1 Expression—In contrast with the predominantly held view of p63, our data reveal that this protein promotes the expression of K1, a factor expressed at the start of keratinocyte differentiation. Despite its role in inducing K1 expression in vitro, p63 is highly expressed in basal keratinocytes, which do not induce K1 expression in vivo. This discrepancy suggests that the processes regulating the start of differentiation must involve other factors presumably derived from non-keratinocytes, because our cell culture consisted of almost pure keratinocytes. KGF meets this criterion. KGF is a paracrine-acting growth factor produced by mesenchymal cells to stimulate epithelial cell proliferation via FGFR2-III; (34Werner S. Smola H. Liao X. Longaker M.T. Krieg T. Hofschneider P.H. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It stimulates keratinocyte proliferation, consistent with its rapid induction in the healing wound (35Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). However, the effects of KGF on differentiation have not been well examined. In organotypic culture, KGF induces a delay in keratinocyte differentiation (36Andreadis S.T. Hamoen K.E. Yarmush M.L. Morgan J.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that it inhibits the differentiation process. We show here that KGF counteracts differentiation progression via ERK phosphorylation, consistent with the function of ERK in delaying the differentiation process (37Haase I. Hobbs R.M. Romero M.R. Broad S. Watt F.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, the effect of KGF is chiefly localized to the basal layer, because FGFR2-III; is restricted to this layer (28Finch P.W. Murphy F. Cardinale I. Krueger J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1619-1628PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, basal keratinocytes can maintain their undifferentiated state through p63 and KGF signaling, whereas suprabasal keratinocytes undergo differentiation due to the function of p63 and the loss of FGFR2-III;. Although not thought to be the sole dermis signaling molecule, KGF regulates keratinocyte homeostasis cooperatively with p63. p63 can induce FGFR2 splicing toward the III; type by binding with ABBP1, a member of the RNA processing machinery (38Fomenkov A. Huang Y.P. Topaloglu O. Brechman A. Osada M. Fomenkova T. Yuriditsky E. Trink B. Sidransky D. Ratovitski E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The p63 mutations found in Hay-Wells syndrome abolish p63/ABBP1 complex formation, which disturbs splicing to FGFR2-III;. The altered skin phenotype observed in Hay-Wells syndrome is attributed to abnormalities in FGFR2 splicing. We observed an increase in FGFR2-III; expression when ΔNp63; was overexpressed by keratinocytes, but not when TAp63 was overexpressed. This result suggests the possibility that p63 suppresses differentiation via KGF receptor expression while inducing differentiation via the JNK/AP-1 pathway. Furthermore, p63 dysregulation is also observed in psoriasis, a common skin disease marked by the hyperproliferation and delayed differentiation of epidermal cells (39Shen C.S. Tsuda T. Fushiki S. Mizutani H. Yamanishi K. J. Dermatol. 2005; 32: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). p63 is expressed throughout almost the whole epidermis, except for a few layers located at or near the skin surface. Interestingly, and at the same time as p63 expressed, FGFR2-III; is expressed basally, and in psoriasis is also expressed by differentiated keratinocytes (28Finch P.W. Murphy F. Cardinale I. Krueger J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1619-1628PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, KGF production is increased in the mesenchymal cells subjacent to the epidermis (28Finch P.W. Murphy F. Cardinale I. Krueger J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1619-1628PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas p63 induces the initiation of keratinocyte differentiation through JNK activation, the cooperative increase in KGF signaling may enhance cell proliferation and delay differentiation by activating both the JNK and ERK signaling pathways. This model is consistent with the activation of both signals in psoriasis (37Haase I. Hobbs R.M. Romero M.R. Broad S. Watt F.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40Takahashi H. Ibe M. Nakamura S. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Hashimoto Y. Iizuka H. J. Dermatol.

Our data on the role of p63 in keratinocyte differentiation may serve as a basis for the dissection of disease mechanisms, and may shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying skin physiology and pathology."

The recent Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition yielded millions of predicted protein sequences, which significantly altered the landscape of known protein space by more than doubling its size and adding thousands of new families (Yooseph et al., 2007 PLoS Biol 5, e16). Such datasets, not only by their sheer size, but also by many other features, defy conventional analysis and annotation methods. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we describe an approach for rapid analysis of the sequence diversity and the internal structure of such very large datasets by advanced clustering strategies using the newly modified CD-HIT algorithm. We performed a hierarchical clustering analysis on the 17.4 million Open Reading Frames (ORFs) identified from the GOS study and found over 33 thousand large predicted protein clusters comprising nearly 6 million sequences. Twenty percent of these clusters did not match known protein families by sequence similarity search and might represent novel protein families. Distributions of the large clusters were illustrated on organism composition, functional class, and sample locations. Conclusion/Significance Our clustering took about two orders of magnitude less computational effort than the similar protein family analysis of original GOS study. This approach will help to analyze other large metagenomic datasets in the future. A Web server with our clustering results and annotations of predicted protein clusters is available online at http://tools.camera.calit2.net/gos under the CAMERA project."
https://openalex.org/W2042492281,"Obstructed labour remains one of the leading causes of maternal and foetal death and morbidity in poorly resourced areas of the world, where the 24 hours availability of a caesarean section (CS) cannot be guaranteed, and the CS related mortality rate is still high. In these settings, reinstatement of symphysiotomy has been advocated. The objectives were, in1994; to study perioperative and long-term complications of symphysiotomy and compare them to those related to CS for similar indications, in 1996; to measure the symphyseal width after symphysiotomy and compare it to that after normal vaginal delivery, and, in 1998; to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice related to symphysiotomy among doctors and midwives in Zimbabwe.Thirty-four women who had undergone symphysiotomy and 29 women who had undergone a CS for obstructed labour were interviewed. The symphyseal widths of 19 women with a previous symphysiotomy were compared to that of 92 women with previous normal vaginal deliveries, using ultrasound technique. Forty-one doctors and 39 midwives, in three central hospitals and seven district hospitals in Zimbabwe, were interviewed about symphysiotomy. None of the 34 women reported serious soft tissue injuries or infections post symphysiotomy. Long-term complications after symphysiotomy do not differ notably from those after CS for similar indications. The intra-articular width of the symphysis pubis is increased after a symphysiotomy. Seventy-nine of the 80 interviewed health care workers knew about symphysiotomy. One obstetrician had performed symphysiotomies. Two-thirds of the participants considered symphysiotomy an obsolete and second-class operation, but lifesaving and appropriate in remote areas of Zimbabwe. Ten of 13 midwives in remote areas wanted to carry out symphysiotomies themselves.No severe complications due to symphysiotomy were revealed in this study. The results suggest that a modest permanent enlargement of the pelvis post symphysiotomy (together with the absence of a scarred uterus) may facilitate subsequent vaginal delivery. Doctors and midwives working in district hospitals have a more positive attitude to symphysiotomies than the colleagues in central hospitals. Obstetricians (who would have to do the teaching), working in the large urban hospitals almost exclude symphysiotomy as an alternative management in Zimbabwe."
https://openalex.org/W2040270721,"Sulfated glycans play critical roles in various cell recognition events among leukocytes. The 6-sulfated lactosamine glycans in particular have been widely noted for their importance because they are involved in cell recognition events mediated by cell-adhesion molecules such as selectins and sialic acid-recognizing molecules such as siglecs and also in the activation of CD44 in binding to extracellular matrix hyaluronate. A pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α, induces expression of 6-sulfated glycans on human leukocytes. Here we report that the transcription of the GlcNAc6ST-1 gene, the gene encoding a sulfotransferase for 6-sulfated glycan synthesis, is induced in human T-lymphoid cells through tandem NF-κB and GATA motifs in its 5′-regulatory region. Results of our reporter assays, immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that GATA-3 and/or GATA-2, but not GATA-1, associates with NF-κB in a transcription factor complex on the 5′-regulatory region of the gene and acts synergistically with NF-κB in triggering GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription. Recently, a skin-homing subset of helper memory T cells exhibiting the Th2 marker CCR4 was shown to specifically express 6-sulfated glycans. The transactivation mechanism described here suggested that GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription is coordinated with the NF-κB/GATA-3 axis, which is known to figure heavily in Th2 cell differentiation. In line with this, in vitro differentiation of human T cells to Th2 cells was found to significantly induce GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription and 6-sulfated glycan expression.

Sulfation of cell surface glycoconjugates is implicated in various cell-to-cell interactions. The sulfation of lactosamine and polylactosamines in cell surface glycoproteins has especially attracted the attention of researchers (1.Uchimura K. Rosen S.D.

Sulfation of polylactosamine occurs at its GlcNAc and galactose residues. As sulfation at the C-6′ position of the galactose residue in lactosamine is postulated to require prior 6-sulfation at the GlcNAc residue (4.Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the sulfation of the C-6 position of GlcNAc is considered to be a de facto rate-limiting step in polylactosamine sulfation. Sulfation at the C-6 position of GlcNAc is involved in several important biological recognition phenomena including selectin-mediated cell adhesion (5.Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K.

Sulfation at the C-6 position of GlcNAc in glycoproteins in leukocytes is catalyzed by enzymes in the GlcNAcβ:6-O-sulfotransferase family, and the first gene cloned for this enzyme family was GlcNAc6ST-1 (22.Uchimura K.

GlcNAc6ST-1 is proposed also to play a major role in the activation of CD44 in TNF-α-activated monocytes (16.Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enzyme synthesizes 6-sulfated lactosamine in N-glycans carried by CD44 upon TNF-α stimulation, and this carbohydrate modification of CD44 activates its hyaluronate binding activity (16.Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17.Delcommenne M. Kannagi R. Johnson P.

Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of sulfation at the C-6 position of GlcNAc, however, is not well studied to date. In view of our recent finding that a subset of T cells exhibiting a Th2 marker express 6-sulfated glycans (10.Ohmori K. Fukui F. Kiso M. Imai T. Yoshie O. Hasegawa H. Matsushima K. Kannagi R. Blood. 2006; 107: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we attempted to clarify transcriptional regulation of GlcNAc6ST-1, which is involved in the induction of 6-sulfated glycan expression in human T-lymphocytes. Cells, Antibodies, and Flow-cytometric Analysis—Human cell lines (Jurkat and HL-60) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Monoclonal anti-6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) antibody (AG107, murine IgM) and anti-sialyl-6-sulfo-LacNAc antibody (G72, murine IgM) were prepared as described previously (5.Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H. Nakamura S. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11225-11233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22.Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.W. Kurosawa N. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. Habuchi O.

G72 is specific to sialyl-6-sulfo-LacNAc and does not react to non-sulfated sialyl LacNAc. Anti-GATA-1 (H-200, sc-13053), anti-GATA-2 (H-116, sc-9008), anti-GATA-3 (H-48, sc-9009), anti-p65 (A, sc-109), and anti-p50 (H-119, sc-7178) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For flow-cytometric analysis, cells were harvested at a semiconfluent stage and stained with the respective antibody using purified antibody at 1 μg/ml or culture supernatant at a dilution of 1:5. The cells were then stained with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody and analyzed with FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Control murine IgM was obtained from BD Biosciences. In some experiments, the Jurkat cells were stimulated with recombinant human TNF-α (10∼20 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 48 h and harvested for luciferase report assay or flow-cytometric analysis. The sialidase treatments (Roche Applied Bioscience, catalog no. 11080725001, used at 1:10 dilution) of the cells, when indicated, were performed at 37 °C for 2 h before staining. Primary Culture of T-lymphocytes and Th1/Th2 Polarization—Human T-lymphocyte were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by Ficoll-Paque™ PLUS centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences) of buffy coats prepared from healthy adult blood donors, who provided informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The T-lymphocytes were cultured at a cell concentration of 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The cells were cultured with or without recombinant TNF-α at 10 ng/ml for 36 h. Naive CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection with magnetic beads (naive CD4+ T cell isolation kit, Miltenyi Biotec), when indicated. For induction of Th1 and Th2 differentiation, the naive CD4+ T cells were treated as previously reported with modification (24.Shibuya K. Shirakawa J. Kameyama T. Honda S. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Miyamoto A. Onodera M. Sumida T. Nakauchi H. Miyoshi H. Shibuya A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1829-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml; R&D Systems) and soluble anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) antibodies during the first 2 days. The cells were cultured for 6 days with IL-12 (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems), anti-IL-4 antibody (10 μg/ml; R&D Systems), and IL-2 (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems) for Th1 differentiation or with IL-4 (30 ng/ml; R&D Systems), anti-IL-12 antibody (10 μg/ml; R&D Systems), and IL-2 (20 ng/ml) for Th2 differentiation, respectively. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Cultured cells were collected, and total cellular RNA was isolated according to the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-chloroform extraction method using an Isogen kit (Nippon-Gene, Tokyo, Japan). First-strand cDNA was prepared using 300 ng of total cellular RNA. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out in a 20-μl reaction volume using the Superscript Preamplification System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with oligo(dT) as initiation primer. The primers used in reverse transcription-PCR analysis for human GlcNAc6ST-1 reported by Uchimura et al. (25.Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kaname T. Ogawa H. Yamakawa T. Fan Q.W. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R.

The primers for GATA-2 were 5′-TGTTGTGCAAATTGTCAGACG-3′ and 5′-CACAGGTGCCATGTGTCCAGC-3′, which give a 279-bp product, and those for GATA-3 were 5′-AAGGCATCCAGACCAGAAACCG-3′ and 5′-AGCATCGAGCAGGGCTCTAACC-3′, which give a 273-bp product. The primers for T-bet were 5′-GATCATCACCAAGCAGGGACG-3′ and 5′-TCCACACTGCACCCACTTGC-3′, which give a 154-bp product. Those for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′, which give a 983-bp product. Plasmid Constructs—The GlcNAc6ST-1 luciferase report plasmid constructs were prepared from genomic DNA from Jurkat cells. The following primers were used to amplify the regulatory region: GlcNAc6ST1-F1, 5′-GGAAGCTTGTGTCGGAAGCCAGAGAACGGCG-3′ and GlcNAc6ST1-R1; 5′-GGAAGCTTACCGCAGCTTCCTGTCTCGC-3′, where the underlined sequence is a synthetic HindIII site. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and then the sequences were confirmed by the ABI 377 sequencer. For generation of the luciferase reporter plasmids, the HindIII fragments were subcloned into the corresponding sites of promoter-less luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 (Promega), to yield p(–813). p(–580) and p(–181) were derived from p(–813): a SacI fragment was cut out from p(–813) and the remaining DNA was then self-ligated to yield p(–580); a KpnI fragment was cut out from p(–813), and the remaining DNA was then self-ligated to yield p(–181). GATA-1, -2, and -3 expression constructs were prepared as described previously (27.Minami T. Murakami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Noguchi T. Miyazaki J. Hamakubo T. Aird W.C. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20626-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Standard molecular cloning techniques described by Maniatis et al. (28.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 187-209Google Scholar) were used for preparing these constructs. All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfection and luciferase assay were performed as described previously (29.Chen G.-Y. Osada H. Santamaria-Babi L.F. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16894-16899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmids (1 μg) and pRL/CMV plasmid (50 ng), used as an internal standard for normalization of the transfection efficiency, were co-transfected. After 40 h, cell extracts were prepared and used for luciferase assay (Dual-Luciferase™ Reporter Assay System, Promega). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—For siRNA experiments, GATA-1 siRNA (human) (sc-29330), GATA-2 (human) (sc-37228), GATA-3 (human) (sc-29331), and control siRNA-A (sc-37007) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The siRNA was electroporated into Jurkat cells with SiPORT electroporation buffer (8990G; Ambion, Austin, TX). After 72 h, the cells were collected for flow-cytometric analyses. In Vitro Neutralization of Soluble TNF-receptors p55 and p75—Neutralization of TNF-receptors p55 and p75 was done by adding the neutralizing anti-soluble TNFR1 (10 μg/ml; R&D Systems MAB225) or anti-TNFR2 (10 μg/ml, R&D Systems MAB226) into cultured Jurkat cells. The cells were collected for flow-cytometric analysis after 24 h. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blot Analysis—Whole Jurkat cell lysates were prepared in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). An equal amount of the extract was incubated with 4 μg of the respective antibody with gentle shaking overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then mixed with 60 μl of protein A-conjugated agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 2 h at 4 °C,and immunoprecipitates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The concentration of running gel was 10% unless otherwise specified. After blocking, the blots were incubated with respective primary antibody (1:1000 dilution). Following incubation with the second antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, rabbit anti-goat IgG, or goat anti-mouse IgG) (1:5000 dilution), the signal was detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Analysis was performed following a kit protocol (Upstate). Chromatin samples were isolated from Jurkat cells as described previously (29.Chen G.-Y. Osada H. Santamaria-Babi L.F. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16894-16899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for chromatin immunoprecipitation were anti-GATA-1, anti-GATA-2, anti-GATA-3, anti-p65, and anti-p50. The primers used for detection were GlcNAc6ST1-F (5′-GCCAGAGGTCCAGTAAAGCG-3′) and GlcNAc6ST1-R (5′-GAGGATGCTGCTACCCGTCTCC-3′). Induction of Cell Surface 6-Sulfated Glycan Expression by TNF-α—To determine whether the expression of 6-sulfated glycan is induced in response to TNF-α, human cultured T-lymphoid Jurkat cells were treated with TNF-α and tested for reactivity to monoclonal antibody AG107, which recognizes 6-sulfated LacNAc, and monoclonal antibody G72, which recognizes sialylated 6-sulfated LacNAc, by flow cytometry. The structures of glycans recognized by these antibodies are shown in Fig. 1A. The results of flow cytometry demonstrated that unstimulated Jurkat cells expressed low levels of the 6-sulfated and sialylated 6-sulfated lactosamine glycans and that their expression was significantly increased after TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 1A). Similar results were also obtained with HL-60 cells (data not shown). This indicated that TNF-α can induce expression of 6-sulfated LacNAc glycans in a wide range of human leukemic cells as had been observed previously with SR91 cells (17.Delcommenne M. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TNF-α-induced 6-sulfated glycan expression is accompanied by transcriptional induction of genes for specific sulfotransferases, we studied the mRNA levels of two major known GlcNAcβ:6-O-sulfotransferases by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1B). A weak expression of HEC-GlcNAc6ST mRNA was detected in unstimulated Jurkat cells, and its level did not change upon TNF-α stimulation. mRNAs for other known 6-O-sulfotransferases, including I-GlcNAc6ST, GlcNAC6ST-4, and C-GlcNAc6ST, were hardly detectable (data not shown). In contrast, GlcNAc6ST-1 was not readily detectable in unstimulated Jurkat cells, but was induced significantly upon TNF-α stimulation. TNFR1 Mainly Mediates Induction of 6-Sulfated Glycan Expression by TNF-α—TNF-α elicits responses through its binding to the receptors 55-kDa TNFR1 and 75 kDa TNFR2. Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 contain a similar extracellular domain but are different in their cytoplasmic domains. TNFR1 has a so-called death domain region, whereas TNFR2 does not. To test which receptor mediates the TNF-α function in Jurkat cells, we tried to inhibit the TNF-receptor p55 or p75 by adding the neutralizing anti-TNFR1 or anti-TNFR2 antibodies into the culture medium of Jurkat cells when stimulated with TNF-α. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that TNF-α-induced 6-sulfated glycan expression was abrogated by anti-TNFR1, but not efficiently by anti-TNFR2 (Fig. 2), indicating that TNFR1 plays a predominant role in TNF-α-induced 6-sulfated glycan expression in Jurkat cells. Importance of NF-κB and GATA Binding Sites for GlcNAc6ST-1 Transcription—To elucidate the mechanism of the increased transcription of GlcNAc6ST-1 upon TNF-α stimulation, we cloned the GlcNAc6ST-1 promoter region from Jurkat cells, the sequence of which is shown in Fig. 3A. There was no conventional TATA box upstream of the principal transcription start site, but an initiator element was juxtaposed with an Sp1 consensus site for the accurate initiation of RNA transcription. This situation was similar to the regulatory region of fucosyltransferase 7 (FUT7), a gene for another glycosyltransferase involved in synthesis of glycans involved in cell-cell adhesion (29.Chen G.-Y. Osada H. Santamaria-Babi L.F. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16894-16899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30.Hiraiwa N. Yabuta T. Yoritomi K. Hiraiwa M. Tanaka Y. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Kannagi R. Blood. 2003; 101: 3615-3621Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We subcloned the fragment into the luciferase reporter plasmid and prepared several deletion and mutated constructs. Stimulation of the promoter construct p(–580) and p(–813) with TNF-α resulted in a remarkable transcriptional activation compared with that of the promoter construct p(–181) (Fig. 3B). As the reporter constructs p(–580) through p(–181) is activated by TNF-α, the TNF-α-responsive element should reside between nucleotides –181 and –580. In this region, we found the sequence GGGTCTTTCT, which contains just two different nucleotides with the NF-κB motif GGGACTTTCC, and a GATA binding site, CATC. To test whether these transcription factors directly bind to the GlcNAc6ST-1 promoter region in situ, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4A). The results indicated a significant binding of p65 and p50 (Fig. 4A), as well as that of GATA-2 and GATA-3, to the promoter region of GlcNAc6ST-1 (Fig. 4A). The results above showed that GATA-2/3 and NF-κB p65/p50 directly bind to the GlcNAc6ST-1 promoter. To confirm the role of the NF-κB and GATA transcription factors in TNF-α-mediated transactivation of the GlcNAc6ST-1 promoter, reporter assays were performed with cotransfection of GATA expression vectors (Fig. 4B). GATA-2 and GATA-3, but not GATA-1, were found to preferentially activate transcription of the reporter construct. Further enhancement of promoter activity was observed when the cells transfected with GATA-2 or GATA-3 constructs were stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that both the NF-κB and GATA binding sites are important for the transcription of GlcNAc6ST-1 in Jurkat T cells. Modulation of Cell-Surface Expression of 6-Sulfated Glycans by GATA-2 and GATA-3—As GATA-2 or GATA-3 was found to figure heavily in transcriptional induction of GlcNAc6ST-1, we next tested whether GATA-2 or GATA-3 indeed affects cell surface expression of 6-sulfated glycans by TNF-α. The Jurkat cells, which do not express 6-sulfated glycans under the usual culture conditions, showed weak but significant expression of the glycans after introduction of GATA-2 or GATA-3 expression vector (Fig. 5A), whereas siRNA for GATA-2 or GATA-3 blocked the TNF-α-induced expression of 6-sulfated glycans (Fig. 5, B and C). This indicated that the presence of GATA-2 and/or GATA-3 is required to attain maximum expression of cell surface 6-sulfated glycans upon TNF-α stimulation. Enhanced Interaction between NF-κB p65/p50 and GATA-3 upon TNF-α Stimulation—TNF-α stimulation was found to induce transcription of GATA-2 and increase transcription of GATA-3 in Jurkat cells (Fig. 6A), and this may be at least partly involved in TNF-α-induced expression of 6-sulfated glycans. It is well known that NF-κB activation induces transcription of GATA-3 during T cell activation toward Th2 differentiation, and this phenomenon is designated as NF-κB/GATA-3 axis for Th2 differentiation (31.Das J. Chen C.H. Yang L. Cohn L. Ray P. Ray A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32.Boothby M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 471-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells with anti-GATA3 antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies indicated that endogenous GATA-3 binds to p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB in TNF-α-stimulated Jurkat cells (Fig. 6B), suggesting that both transcription factors participate in the formation of transcription factor complex upon TNF-α stimulation. Induction of GlcNAc6ST-1 Transcription in TNF-α-stimulated Primary T Cells and Th2-differentiated Cells—We next tested if TNF-α stimulation of human peripheral primary T cells induces GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription. The results indicated a marked induction of GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription (Fig. 7A), accompanied with 6-glycan expression. In the primary T cells, only the sialylated form of 6-sulfated glycan was induced as detected by the G72 antibody, and the non-sialylated form defined by the AG107 antibody was not efficiently induced (Fig. 7B). This was confirmed by the appearance of the non-sialylated form of 6-sulfated glycans after sialidase treatment of the TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 7B). Experiments on Th1- and Th2-differentiated T cells showed that the induction of GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription occurred specifically in Th2-differentiated cells, but was not detectable in the Th1-differentiated cells (Fig. 7C). This was compatible with the finding that GATA-3 was induced only in Th2-differentiated cells but not in Th1-differentiated cells (Fig. 7C). Instead, the latter cells showed a significant induction of T-bet, the Th1-specific transcription factor. The GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription in Th2-differentiated cells was accompanied with the cell surface expression of 6-sulfated glycans, which was ascertained by staining with the specific antibody AG107 after sialidase treatment (Fig. 7D). The biological significance of 6-sulfated lactosamine glycan was perhaps first noted when it was identified as a specific ligand for L-selectin in homing of naive T-lymphocytes. The endothelial cells of the high endothelial venules in human peripheral lymph nodes express several products of 6-sulfotransferase including α2–3 sialylated 6-sulfo Lewis X, which are known to serve as a specific ligand for L-selectin (5.Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H. Nakamura S. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kannagi R. J. Biol.

Singer M.S. Tsay D. Kannagi R. Muramatsu T. Von Andrian U.H. Rosen S.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). More recently, endothelial cells have been known to also express α2–6 sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc, which is suggested to serve as a preferred ligand for CD22/Siglec-2 (14.Kimura N. Ohmori K. Miyazaki K. Izawa M. Matsuzaki Y. Yasuda Y. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Moriyama A. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32200-32207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several genes are known to be regulated by tandem NF-κB and GATA motifs in endothelial cells, such as erythropoietin (33.La Ferla K. Reimann C. Jelkmann W. Hellwig-Burgel T. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1811-1813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and VCAM-1 (34.Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism for transcriptional regulation of the GlcNAc6ST-1 gene, however, is unique and is not similar to that for the erythropoietin or VCAM-1 genes. Transcription of the erythropoietin gene is quite different from that for the GlcNAc6ST-1 gene in that both NF-κB and GATA-2 strongly inhibit erythropoietin transcription. Transcription of VCAM-1 is induced by GATA-2 but not by GATA-3. This is different from that of GlcNAc6ST-1, which is induced by either GATA-2 or GATA-3. Induction of the GlcNAc6ST-1 gene transcription by inflammatory cytokines was first noted in endothelial cells with IL-1β (6.Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4530-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and later in monocytes with TNF-α (16.Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate 6-sulfation is involved in activation of CD44 in the monocyte/macrophage lineage of cells (16.Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17.Delcommenne M. Kannagi R. Johnson P.

Maiti A. Johnson P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5367-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A non-sialylated 6-sulfated lactosamine glycan is known as a specific marker of a distinct subset of dendritic cell precursors in peripheral blood monocytes (19.Schakel K. Kannagi R. Kniep B. Goto Y. Mitsuoka C. Zwirner J. Soruri A. von Kietzell M. Rieber E.P. Immunity. 2002; 17: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The population of this dendritic cell precursor subset is highly migratory (37.Randolph G.J. Sanchez-Schmitz G. Liebman R.M. Schakel K. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), exhibits readily activated characteristics, and secretes TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines (21.Baumeister S.H. Holig K. Bornhauser M. Meurer M. Rieber E.P. Schakel K. Blood. 2007; 110: 3078-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among T-lymphocytes, a subpopulation of skin-homing helper memory T-lymphocytes bearing Th2-specific chemokine receptor CCR4 was recently shown to express carbohydrate determinant bearing the 6-sulfated lactosamine structure (10.Ohmori K. Fukui F. Kiso M. Imai T. Yoshie O. Hasegawa H. Matsushima K. Kannagi R. Blood. 2006; 107: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the skin-homing helper memory T-lymphocytes, the 6-sulfated lactosamine glycans are further modified with fucose and sialic acid, leading to sialyl 6-sulfated Lewis X determinant, which serves as an essential ligand for vascular E- and P-selectins, which mediate skin homing of the lymphocyte population. We have demonstrated in this study that TNF-α-induced carbohydrate 6-sulfation on cell adhesion molecules requires synergistic interaction of transcription factors through tandem NF-κB and GATA motifs in the 6-sulfotransferase GlcNAc6ST-1 gene. In T-lymphocytes, the so-called NF-κB/GATA-3 axis is known to be essential for differentiation to the Th2 phenotype (31.Das J. Chen C.H. Yang L. Cohn L. Ray P. Ray A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32.Boothby M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 471-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38.Farrar J.D. Asnagli H. Murphy K.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 431-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Th2-predisposed T cells are known to have dominant expression of GATA-3, and this favors a role for GlcNAc6ST-1 in synthesis of the 6-sulfated glycans in Th2 cells. In good agreement with this, our results on in vitro differentiated Th2 cells showed significant induction of GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription and 6-sulfated glycan expression. Five isoenzymes are known to date in humans for 6-sulfotransferases catalyzing sulfation at the C-6 position of GlcNAc in glycoproteins (39.Hemmerich S. Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Bistrup A. Ruddle N.R. Rosen S.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among them, two isoenzymes, GlcNAc6ST-1 and HEC-GlcNAc6ST, figure heavily in leukocytes and endothelial cells. It is not always clear at present which 6-sulfotransferase is involved in the expression of 6-sulfated glycans in the diverse biological phenomena described above. The mechanism for regulation of the HEC-GlcNAc6ST transcription is entirely open for future study. Judging from the finding that inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α induce GlcNAc6ST-1 transcription but not that of HEC-GlcNAc6ST both in monocytes (16.Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and lymphocytes (this work), GlcNAc6ST-1 is more deeply involved in the enhanced expression of 6-sulfated glycans in the pro-inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2043253514,"We devised a novel procedure to identify human cancer genes acting in a recessive manner. Our strategy was to combine the contributions of the different types of genetic alterations to loss of function: amino-acid substitutions, frame-shifts, gene deletions. We studied over 20,000 genes in 3 Gigabases of coding sequences and 700 array comparative genomic hybridizations. Recessive genes were scored according to nucleotide mismatches under positive selective pressure, frame-shifts and genomic deletions in cancer. Four different tests were combined together yielding a cancer recessive p-value for each studied gene. One hundred and fifty four candidate recessive cancer genes (p-value<1.5×10−7, FDR = 0.39) were identified. Strikingly, the prototypical cancer recessive genes TP53, PTEN and CDKN2A all ranked in the top 0.5% genes. The functions significantly affected by cancer mutations are exactly overlapping those of known cancer genes, with the critical exception for the absence of tyrosine kinases, as expected for a recessive gene-set."
https://openalex.org/W2027482694,"Variation in gene expression may give rise to a significant fraction of inter-individual phenotypic variation. Studies searching for the underlying genetic controls for such variation have been conducted in model organisms and humans in recent years. In our previous effort of assessing conserved underlying haplotype patterns across ethnic populations, we constructed common haplotypes using SNPs having conserved linkage disequilibrium (LD) across ethnic populations. These common haplotypes cluster into a simple evolutionary structure based on their frequencies, defining only up to three conserved clusters termed ‘haplotype frameworks’. One intriguing preliminary finding was that a significant portion of reported variants strongly associated with cis-regulation tags these globally conserved haplotype frameworks. Here we expand the investigation by collecting genes showing stringently determined cis-association between genotypes and expression phenotypes from major studies. We conducted phylogenetic analysis of current major haplotypes along with the corresponding haplotypes derived from chimpanzee reference sequences. Our analysis reveals that, for the vast majority of such cis-regulatory genes, the tagging SNPs showing the strongest association also tag the haplotype lineages directly separated from ancestry, inferred from either chimpanzee reference sequences or the allele frequency-derived haplotype frameworks, suggesting that the differentially expressed phenotypes were evolved relatively early in human history. Such evolutionary signatures provide keys for a more effective identification of globally-conserved candidate regulatory haplotypes across human genes in future epidemiologic and pharmacogenetic studies."

https://openalex.org/W2035946762,"The in vitro assembly of a soluble protein into its mature fibrillar form is usually accompanied by loss of its functional activity. Our study is the first demonstration of a natural enzyme (HylP2) retaining its enzymatic activity on conversion from pre-fibril to mature fibril and supports the contention that minor conformational changes in the native folded form of a protein can lead to the formation of a functional fibril. Hyaluronate lyase (HylP2) is a natural enzyme of bacteriophage 10403 of Streptococcus pyogenes. At pH 5.0, the enzyme undergoes partial unfolding localized in its N-terminal domain while the C-terminal domain maintains its folded trimeric conformation. This structural variant of HylP2 retains about 70% enzymatic activity with hyaluronan. It further self-assembles into a fibrillar film in vitro through solvent-exposed nonpolar surfaces and intermolecular β-sheet formation by the β-strands in the protein. Interestingly, the mature fibrillar film of HylP2 also retains about 60 and 20% enzymatic activity for hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, respectively. The possession of broad substrate specificity by the fibrillar form of HylP2 indicates that fluctuations in pH, which do not lead to loss of functionality of HylP2, might assist in bacterial pathogenesis. The formation of fibrillar film-like structure has been observed for the first time among the hyaluronidase enzymes. After acquiring this film-like structure in bacteriophage, HylP2 still retains its enzymatic activity, which establishes that these fibrils are a genuinely acquired protein fold/structure.

The phenomenon of transformation of proteins into fibrils is of interest because extracellular fibrillar protein deposits or amyloid plaques are characteristics of a group of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, as well as many rare systemic diseases such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy (1Wetzel R. Cell. 1996; 6: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Despite a lack of identifiable common features in the sequences and structures of the proteins implicated in the different amyloid diseases, the fibrillar aggregates associated with them are characterized by a high degree of structural order and a high intermolecular β-sheet content (2Sunde M. Blake C.C.F. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 3Sunde M. Blake C.C.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been postulated that there is a common underlying mechanism of formation of the various fibrillar aggregates (4Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). It is widely recognized that fibril formation in globular proteins generally requires the presence of a partially unfolded state, referred to as the “amyloidogenic intermediate” (5Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 6Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This can be a conformational state stable at equilibrium, arising as a result of mutations or changes of solution conditions (pH or ionic strength etc.), a partially folded state accumulating transiently before the major free-energy barrier for folding, or one or more conformations resulting from structural fluctuations within the native-state ensemble (9Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 10Jahn T.R. Radford S.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 469: 100-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The requirement of a partially unfolded state is because of the fact that the conformational rearrangements leading to the cross-β-structure cannot take place in a packed folded conformation; a somewhat unfolded conformational state, in which some of the amide and carbon groups and hydrophobic moieties become accessible, can easily enable the specific intermolecular interactions that are necessary for amyloid aggregation to occur (6Kelly J.W.

Numerous reports on the loss of biological activity of proteins on the formation of proto-fibrils from native protein forms and fibrils from proto-fibrillar forms have been stated (12Bieler S.

Fibrillation in nonpathological proteins leads to loss of their biological function, whereas pathological proteins acquire toxicity in proto-fibrillar forms (14Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F.

To date, the presence of enzymatic activity in mature fibrils of any protein has not been reported. However, functionally active amyloid-like fibrils of a designed RNase A have recently been reported (17Sambashivan S. Lui Y. Sawaya M.R. Eisenberg D. Nature. 2005; 437: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition to being present in the microorganisms, there is a naturally occurring functional amyloid in mammals (Pmel17) that functions as a template for the polymerization of melanin molecules in the melanosome (18Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Alory-Jost C. Marks M.S. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e6Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and thus strengthens the view that fibrillar structures could rather be a selected protein fold in the evolution of functional protein structures. These contradictory findings then raised the need to address an important question pertaining to fibrillar structure that whether native-like structural domains undergo conformational modification or they simply refold on fibril formation.

Akhtar S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7143-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To date there is no report on the presence of amyloid-like fibrillar structures in the bacteriophage of S. pyogenes, although the bacterium itself has been reported to possess amyloid-like M proteins on its surface, which help in spreading bacterial infection by facilitating the attachment of this Gram-positive bacterium to host soft tissues (21Gebbink M.F.

Our work, for the first time, highlights the transformation of a functional, natively folded and nonfibrillar natural enzyme (HylP2) into fibril-like structures that appear as a thin membrane. This form of protein is different in morphology from the disease-causing fibrils known to date, and the presence of enzymatic activity in such structures provides indications toward their plausible role in the biology of the organism. In bacteriophage, these structures can be considered to assist in phage access into the bacterial cells even under stress conditions (altered pH). Escherichia coli DH5α cells were used during the cloning of the gene. pET21d(+) vector (Novagen) and BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) were used for protein expression. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of Full-length HylP2—The cloning, overexpression, and purification of full-length HylP2 was performed as described earlier (20Mishra P. Akhtar S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7143-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fibril Formation in HylP2—A stock (1 mm) solution of ThT (thioflavin T) was prepared by dissolving ThT in double distilled water. ThT was stored at 4 °C and protected from sun-light. Fresh solutions of ThT were passed through a 0.2-μm filter immediately before use. HylP2 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was dialyzed in buffer containing 10 mm citrate glycine/HEPES (CGH), 150 mm Na2SO4 (sodium sulfate), and 10% glycerol at different pH values. The dialysis was carried out at 4 °C for 14 h. Aliquots were taken at desired time intervals for conducting the pH-related experiments. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration experiments were carried out on a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 column (manufacturer's exclusion limit 600 kDa) with AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated and run with 10 mm CGH, 150 mm sodium sulfate, and 10% glycerol (at desired pH values). 200 μl (containing at least 0.2 mg protein) of the sample was loaded on the column and run at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and eluted protein was detected at 280 nm. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorometer in a 5-mm path length quartz cell at 25 °C. For tryptophan fluorescence, excitation wavelength of 290 nm was used, and the spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm using 1 μm of HylP2 for the studies. For ANS binding studies, excitation wavelength was 350 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded between 400 and 500 nm. The final concentration of ANS used for the experiments was 10 μm.5 μm aliquots of the dialyzing samples were added to a solution containing ANS in the dialyzing buffer at pH 5.0 and mixed for 2 min before measuring the fluorescence emission. Background absorption of the buffer for the native HylP2 was subtracted from each reading. All the readings were taken in triplicate. CD Measurements—CD measurements were made with a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter. The results were expressed as mean residual ellipticity [θ], which is defined as [θ] = 100 × θobs/(lc), where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degree; c is the concentration in moles of residue/liter; and l is the length of the light path in centimeter. Each spectrum was an average of two scans. The values obtained were normalized by subtracting the base line recorded for the buffer under similar conditions. Spectra were recorded using 3 μm HylP2 in 1-mm cell, with 1 mm CGH, 150 mm sodium sulfate, 10% glycerol, at different pH values. All scans were made in the far UV region, i.e. between 200 and 250 nm. Activity Assay—The in vitro activity assay for HylP2 was performed using hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) as substrates. The activity of the enzyme was determined by measuring its ability to breakdown HA or CS to unsaturated disaccharide units (22Pritchard D.G. Lin B. Willingham T.R. Baker J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In 1 ml of solution having 0.3 mg/ml HA/CS (or mentioned otherwise), 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 20 mm calcium chloride (pH 6.0), and 2 μg of full-length native HylP2 at pH 7.0 or the fibrillar form of HylP2 at pH 5.0 (diluted just before taking measurement) was added. The reactants were properly mixed immediately, and the measurements were carried out by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm for 200 s at 37 °C. Varying concentrations of HA and CS, between 0.003 and 0.3 mg/ml, were used for kinetic measurements. The kinetic parameters were calculated using extinction coefficient of 5.5 × 10-3 m-1 for the disaccharide products. The readings were taken in triplicate, and percentage error was calculated. Transmission Electron Microscopy—HylP2 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml at pH 7.0 and pH 5.0 was diluted 20 times in CGH buffer of pH 7.0 and pH 5.0, placed onto carbon-coated grids, and allowed to adsorb for 4 min. After 5 min, the excess liquid at the edge of the grid was removed with the help of filter paper. The grid was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate at pH 7.0 and 5.0 (as required) and air-dried after removing the excess stain. After incubating the grid with dye for 5 min, excess of solution was removed with the help of a filter paper, and the grid was left to dry at room temperature. The grid was then stored in an electron microscope grid box prior to examination. The specimens were viewed, and images were recorded at 80 or 120 kV with an FEI Technai Twin transmission electron microscope equipped with a mega view II CCD camera. Image acquisition and analysis were carried out with analysis software. Low magnification (×10,000-12,000) was used to get an idea of the overall sample composition, and a higher magnification (×25,000) was also used to obtain the sheet-like morphology. Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence imaging, a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with an α-Plan-Fluar 100′/1.45 numerical aperture oil immersion objective was used with FluoArc (Zeiss) as light source. Images were captured on 1.4-mega-pixel Zeiss CCD camera AxioCam HRm. Images were acquired and processed using software Axiovision AxioVs40 version 4.4.0.0. For TIRF imaging, TIRF slider coupled with argon ion laser (Lasos, Lasertechnik GmbH, Jena, Germany). 10 μl of HylP2 at pH 7.0 and pH 5.0 at 0.6-1 mg/ml was taken and stained with 2 μl of thioflavin T. The sample was placed on a glass slide, and the image was recorded. ThT Assay for Determining Kinetics of Fibrillation—Free ThT has excitation and emission maxima at 350 and 450 nm, respectively. However, upon binding to fibrils the excitation and emission λmax changed to 450 and 480 nm, respectively (23Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). 5 μm aliquots of the HylP2 at pH 7.0 and dialyzed samples of full-length HylP2 at pH 5.0 were added to a solution containing 10 μm ThT in the dialyzing buffer at pH 5.0 and pH 7.0, respectively, and shaken for 5 min before measuring the fluorescence emission on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorometer in a 5-mm path length quartz cell at 25 °C. A background fluorescence spectrum obtained by running a blank buffer with ThT was subtracted from each sample fluorescence spectrum. The excitation wavelength was 450 nm, and the emission was recorded at 480 nm. Fluorescence intensity at 480 nm was plotted against time for analysis. All readings were taken in triplicate, and the error bar between them was calculated. Congo Red Binding—Fresh solutions of Congo red (CR) in 10 mm CGH, 150 mm sodium sulfate (pH 7.0) were passed through a 0.2-μm filter immediately before use. The CR solutions were added to 5 μm of protein solutions (dialyzed at pH 5.0) to a final dye concentration of 10 μm, and the samples were incubated for 2 min. The absorption spectrum of each sample was recorded from 400 to 700 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences UV-visible spectrophotometer using 1-cm path length quartz cuvette and corrected for contributions of buffer and protein. The spectrum of CR alone was compared with that of CR solutions in the presence of protein. Prior to addition of protein, the dye absorbed at 490 nm, and after binding to fibrillar structures a red shift of the absorption band toward 540 nm was observed (24Glenner G.G. Eanes E.D. Page D.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1972; 20: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Red shift together with an increase in absorption was taken to be indicative of the formation of fibrillar structures. Readings were recorded in duplicate protein samples. Fibril Purification—After dialyzing the native protein into CGH buffer (pH 5.0), the sample was ultracentrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 2 h in a Beckman Coulter Optima TL-X ultracentrifuging system using a TLA 100 rotor. The supernatant was subsequently removed, and the fibril pellet was resuspended in minimal CGH buffer. Limited Proteolysis—HylP2 protein at pH 7.0 and HylP2 fibrillar film at pH 5.0 were subjected to limited proteolysis with α-chymotrypsin in protease to protein ratio of 1:500 (w/w), for 2 h, at 30 °C. The protease reaction was stopped by adding protease inhibitor EDTA/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 2 mm in the reaction mixture, and the samples were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. For proteolysis of HylP2 at pH 7.0 and fibrillar film at pH 5.0, proteinase K was used at protein to protease ratio of 100:1 (w/w) for 8-10 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the proteolyzed samples were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. HylP2 is an ∼110-kDa homotrimeric, α/β protein (20Mishra P. Akhtar S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7143-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that is devoid of disulfide bonds in its native folded state in the physiological medium. The first few residues from the N-terminal region of HylP2 are an α/β cap-like segment that is followed by α-helical coiled coils to residue 108. This flexible domain proceeds into a highly β-rich C-terminal portion of the protein consisting of 13 parallel β-sheets arranged perpendicular to the axis of the protein (Fig. 1A). The last few residues at the C terminus again taper as α-helical coils that do not interdigitate as helical coils of the N-terminal portion of HylP2. 4P. Mishra, V. Bhakuni, R. Prem Kumar, N. Singh, S. Sharma, P. Kaur, and T. P. Singh, unpublished data. pH and salts influence the electrostatic interactions in natively folded proteins and thereby significantly affect the structure, stability, and function of proteins (25Tan Y.J. Oliveberg M. Davis B. Fresht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 980-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). With the aim to probe pH-induced alterations on HylP2, we subjected the protein to pH changes. pH-dependent changes in secondary and tertiary structures of HylP2 were studied using far-UV-CD and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2A. The far-UV-CD spectrum shows a negative band centered around 218 nm suggesting the existence of an extended β-sheet conformation in HylP2 at pH 7.0. The intensity of the negative ellipticity band remains steady in pH range from 7.0 to 10.0 suggesting that there is no significant alteration in the secondary structure of the enzyme. However, a slight change (maximum of 15%) in the secondary structure of the enzyme was observed below pH 7.0, suggesting that the secondary structure of HylP2 is significantly resistant to fluctuations in pH. The changes in tertiary structure of HylP2 as a function of pH were studied, and the results are presented in the Fig. 2B. Because HylP2 had a single tryptophan residue at the 19th position in its primary amino acid sequence, which corresponded to the N-terminal region of HylP2 (Fig. 1A), any change in the fluorescence emission maximum of this tryptophan residue could be correlated only with the folding or unfolding of the N-terminal region of HylP2. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.0), this tryptophan moiety is buried in the hydrophobic environment as the N-terminal region of the enzyme is in folded conformation (20Mishra P. Akhtar S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7143-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the protein showed no significant differences for the wavelength of maximum emission (λmax = 330 nm), whereas on decreasing the pH from 7.0 to 4.0, a noticeable sigmoidal enhancement from 328 to 340 nm in the emission wavelength was observed. The buried tryptophan residues in all folded proteins show fluorescence emission maxima between 330 and 335 nm, whereas proteins in unfolded conformation show fluorescence emission maxima at about 350 nm (26Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The red shift of the λmax value from 328 to 340 nm at acidic pH conditions suggested that under these conditions the tryptophan moiety present in the enzyme was partially exposed to the hydrophilic solvent because of partial unfolding of the N-terminal domain. The studies presented above suggested that with fluctuations in pH (pH <6.0), HylP2 probably undergoes a single conformational transition where the native-like protein was converted into a quasi-native state having a slightly disorganized N-terminal domain and a native-like C-terminal domain architecture of protein. To confirm the existence of partially unfolded species with solvent-exposed hydrophobic clusters, we performed pH-dependent ANS binding studies on HylP2. ANS is a hydrophobic dye that binds to solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces of a polypeptide chain. In a native folded protein the hydrophobic amino acids were buried in the core of the protein, and ANS binding is not observed; hence, the emission wavelength maximum of free dye is observed to be at 514 nm (Fig. 2B, inset). However, on partial unfolding of the protein, ANS shows binding to the solvent-exposed hydrophobic amino acids, which led to a shift in the fluorescence emission maximum of the dye to 465 nm accompanied by an enhancement in the fluorescence intensity (27Fink A.L. Creighton T.E. Protein: Structures and Molecular Properties. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 140-142Google Scholar, 28Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas' A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 29Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). We monitored the affinity of protein for ANS binding at 465 nm as a function of pH. As observed in Fig. 2B, between pH 10.0 and 6.0, the increase in the fluorescence emission intensity of ANS was negligible. However, on decreasing the pH from 6.0 to 4.0, a large enhancement (about four times) in the ANS fluorescence intensity was observed. This suggested that although the hydrophobic regions of the enzyme remained encompassed in the core of HylP2 in the alkaline and physiological pH range, thereby not allowing the ANS molecules to bind to them, acidic conditions caused the exposure of hydrophobic patches in the enzyme because of the unfolding of the protein. Hence, the tryptophan and ANS fluorescence studies together reaffirmed that subjecting the protein to acidic conditions led to the stabilization of a partially folded intermediate of HylP2. Modifications in the quaternary structure were also monitored under pH conditions that were stabilizing the partially unfolded species of HylP2. Size-exclusion chromatography studies were then carried out at different pH values, and the results are shown in Fig. 2C. HylP2 at pH 7.0 had a retention volume of 13.07 ml, which corresponded to a molecular mass of about 110 kDa, which corresponded to the trimeric conformation of the protein. However, on decreasing the pH to 5.0 and below, a retention volume of 8.30 ml was observed that corresponded to the void volume of the gel filtration column and a molecular mass of about 600 kDa or more for the protein. This suggested that under acidic conditions, HylP2 underwent significant enhancement in its hydrodynamic radii probably because of aggregation of the enzyme. This was finally confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking. At pH 5.0, the cross-linked protein sample did not even enter the well in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2D), which suggested that the cross-linked protein had a very large molecular weight that was possible only when the protein was aggregated under these conditions. Overall the analysis presented here indicated that HylP2 populated under aggregating conditions (pH 5.0) had a partially unfolded N-terminal domain and a folded C-terminal domain indistinguishable from the native protein, and with time these protein molecules coalesced into a HylP2 aggregate form. Dye Binding—To assess the existence of fibrous texture in the aggregates of HylP2 formed at low pH (pH 5.0 and below), their tinctorial and ultrastructural properties were examined. The aggregates of HylP2 were characterized by monitoring its binding to thioflavin T and Congo red dyes and then morphologically analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Congo red, a diazo dye, is widely used to identify fibrils because it binds preferentially to the ordered, aggregated form of peptides/proteins but does not bind to their native unassembled forms (24Glenner G.G. Eanes E.D. Page D.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1972; 20: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We carried out Congo red binding to HylP2 to identify the existence of fibril-like features in the aggregates of HylP2 stabilized at pH 5.0. Fig. 3A shows the effect of binding of Congo red (to HylP2 dialyzed at pH 7.0 and 5.0) on the absorption spectra of the dye. Binding of Congo red to proteins is detected as a red shift in its absorbance spectrum from 490 to 520 nm. For the enzyme at pH 7.0, no shift in the absorption maximum and absorption intensity of the dye was observed. However, on incubation of the enzyme at pH 5.0 with Congo red, a red shift of about 20 nm in the absorption maxima, i.e. from 490 to 510 nm, of the dye was observed. Such a prominent red shift in the absorption maxima was attributed to the strong intercalation of the dye into the ordered, intermolecular β-pleated sheet structure of the HylP2 fibrils. Hence, this indicated that the aggregates of HylP2 formed at pH 5.0 had fibril-like characteristics. An increase in the absorption intensity at 510 nm of HylP2 at pH 5.0 suggested a decrease in the native form of the protein and an increase in the population of fibrillar species, respectively. ThT is a fluorescent dye and is known to bind to the linear array of β-strands in the amyloid fibrils. An enhancement in the fluorescence emission intensity of ThT on binding to ordered aggregates of protein is one of the most accepted methods to show the presence of fibril formation (23Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 31LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) under a given condition. Fig. 3B shows the changes in emission intensity of ThT at 480 nm on binding to HylP2 at pH 7.0 and 5.0. For enzyme at pH 7.0, the fluorescence intensity was s"
