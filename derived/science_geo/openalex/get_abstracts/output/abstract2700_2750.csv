https://openalex.org/W1563004580,"Flash photolysis of the membrane-bound cytochrome oxidase/carbon monoxide compound in the presence of oxygen at low temperatures and in the frozen state leads to the formation of three types of intermediates functional in electron transfer in cytochrome oxidase and reduction of oxygen by cytochrome oxidase. The first category (A) does not involve electron transfer to oxygen between -125 degrees and -105 degrees, and includes compounds which are spectroscopically similar for the completely reduced oxidase (Cu1+alpha3(2+)-O2) or for the ferricyanide-pretreated oxidase (Cu2+alpha3(3+)-O2). Oxygen is readily dissociated from compounds of type A. The second category (B) involves oxidation of the heme and the copper moiety of the reduced oxidase to form a peroxy compound (Cu2+alpha 3(3+)-O2=or Cu2+alpha3(2+)-O2H2) in the temperature range from -105 degrees to -60 degrees. Above -60 degrees, compounds of type B serve as effective electron acceptors from cytochromes a, c, and c1. The third category (C) is formed above -100 degrees from mixed valency states of the oxidase obtained by ferricyanide pretreatment, and may involve higher valency states of the heme iron (Cu2+alpha3(4+)-O2=). These compounds act as electron acceptors for the respiratory chain and as functional intermediates in oxygen reduction. The remarkable features of cytochrome oxidase are its highly dissociable oxy compound and its extremely effective electron donor reaction which converts this rapidly to tightly bound reduced oxygen and oxidized oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2101417661,"The role of the carbohydrate part of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was investigated by measuring the ability of hCG derivatives lacking various sugar residues to bind to rat Leydig cells and stimulate them to synthesize testosterone and cyclic adenosine 3’:5’-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Whereas sequential removal of the sialic acid, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose residues led to a progressive increase in the effective dose of the hormone required to stimulate steroidogenesis, it resulted in a marked loss in the ability of the hormone to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation. Low doses of the glycosidase-treated hormone derivatives were additive with hCG when their ability to stimulate testosterone synthesis was analyzed. Nevertheless, the glycosidase-treated derivatives were potent inhibitors of hCG-induced cyclic AMP accumulation, suggesting that removal of the sugars did not influence binding of the hormone to the cell as much as it reduced the ability of the bound hormone to activate adenyl cyclase. This hypothesis was further supported by our finding that the hCG derivatives were highly effective inhibitors of ‘Y-hGC binding to the intact cells. Removal of sialic acid and galactose enhanced the inhibition, whereas removal of all of the sugar residues only decreased the inhibition slightly. The degree of these effects was comparatively small. The possibility that steroidogenesis and cyclic AMP accumulation are altered independently by hCG stimulation is discussed. hCG’ is a glycoprotein hormone secreted during pregnancy and is capable of stimulating steroidogenesis and cyclic AMP formation in rat testicular tissues (1, 2). Although the sequence of the carbohydrate units in hCG has been established (3), its role in the mechanism by which hCG stimulates steroidogenesis is not known. Utilizing glycosidases to prepare hCG derivatives, lacking specific carbohydrate residues, we have studied the role of the monosaccharides in the mechanism of hCG action by quantifying the ability of the modified hormone derivatives to bind with rat testicular Leydig cells and stimulate them to synthesize testosterone and cyclic AMP. The results presented here show that removal of the carbohydrate portion of hCG reduces dramatically the ability of the hormone to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation without markedly altering the affinity of the hormone for the cells or reducing its ability to stimulate steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1496473446,"Effects of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase were studied in sarcoplasmic reticulum prepared from cardiac and slow and fast (white) skeletal muscle. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase failed to catalyze phosphorylation of fast skeletal muscle microsomes as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was without effect on calcium uptake by these microsomes. Treatment of cardiac microsomes obtained from dog, cat, rabbit, and guinea pig with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and ATP resulted in phosphorylation of a 22,000-dalton protein component in the amounts of 0.75, 0.25, 0.30, and 0.14 nmol of phosphorus/mg of microsomal protein, respectively. Calcium uptake by cardiac microsomes was stimulated 1.8- to 2.5-fold when microsomes were treated with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Protein kinases partially purified from bovine heart and rabbit skeletal muscle were both effective in mediating these effects on phosphorylation and calcium transport in dog cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Slow skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum also contains a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 22,000 that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase. Phosphorylation of this component ranged from 0.005 to 0.016 nmol of phosphorous/mg of microsomal protein in dog biceps femoris. A statistically significant increase in calcium uptake by these membranes was produced by the protein kinase. Increases in protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of a low molecular weight microsomal component and in calcium transport by sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac and slow skeletal muscle may be related to the relaxation-promoting effects of epinephrine seen in these types of muscle. Conversely, the absence of a relaxation-promoting effect of epinephrine in fast skeletal muscle may be associated with the lack of effect of cyclic AMP and protein kinase on calcium transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum of this type of muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1494587255,"One of the major components of rat liver mitochondria detected by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate is a 165,000 molecular weight polypeptide that makes up 15 to 20% of the total mitochondrial protein. This component appears to be a single molecular species. Evidence is presented here for the identification of this protein with the polypeptide chain of a urea cycle enzyme, carbamoylphosphate synthetase I (EC 2.7.2.5). The 165,000 molecular weight polypeptide was solubilized from mitochondria with Triton X-100 and purified to 90% homogeneity by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. This component co-migrated with carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity when mitochondrial proteins were separated by gel filtration or sucrose gradient centifugation. The identification of the 165,000 molecular weight polypeptide with this activity was also supported by the presence or absence of this protein in a variety of rat tissue mitochondria, in liver and kidney mitochondria from various ureotelic and nonureotelic species, and in fetal rat liver mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1486725534,"Human serum apolipoprotein A-I (apo-A-I), the major protein component of the human serum high density lipoproteins, was studied in aqueous solutions of differing ionic strength and pH by the techniques of sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and frontal analysis gel chromatography. The ultracentrifugal studies indicate the apo-A-I is a self-associating system that is dependent upon protein concentration, but relatively independent of the nature of the medium. The apparent weight average molecular weights obtained from solutions of initial apo-A-I concentration between 0.2 and 0.9 mg/ml were in the range of 3.0 to 16.7 x 10(4) (monomer molecular weight = 28,014). Of the several models of self-associated examined, that which gave the best theoretical fit was for the monomer-dimertetramer-octamer model. The self-association of apo-A-I in aqueous solutions was further documented by frontal analysis gel chromatography, which not only corroborated the ultracentrifugal results, but also indicated that the multiple species of apo-A-I in solution attain equilibrium rather rapidly. Besides having intrinsic importance, these results indicate that the solution properties of apo-A-I must be established before ligand binding studies are conducted and interpreted."

https://openalex.org/W1578995842,"The binding of the activated receptor-glucocorticoid complexes of cultured rat hepatoma cells to nuclei, chromatin, and DNA has been studied under cell-free conditions. A critical factor in determining the shape of the binding curve is shown to be an inhibitory material which is present in crude cytosol and which can be removed without destroying the receptor-steroid complex. These and other results argue that the apparent saturation observed in earlier experiments may have been due to the inhibitors. Thus, the actual number of acceptor sites in hepatoma tissue culture cell nuclei is much larger than previously estimated and their affinity for the complex is lower. Nuclear binding experiments indicate that the inhibitory material interacts with the receptor-steroid complex. The inhibitors appear to be macromolecular; but their effects cannot be mimicked by albumin or hemoglobin. The acceptor capacity at low ionic strength for binding receptor-glucocorticoid complexes increases when proceeding from nuclei to DNA. An analysis of the kinetics of association and dissociation and of the relative binding behavior of nuclei and DNA argues that the affinity of complex for nuclei is much greater than for DNA. DNA-associated histones reduce the amount of complex that binds to DNA. These and perhaps other chromosomal proteins may be responsible for the ordering of acceptor capacity. Evidence is presented that the difference in affinities of nuclear and DNA acceptors could also be due to chromosomal proteins. In nuclei, these proteins may thus both reduce the amount of complex binding by rendering regions of DNA less accessible and increase the binding affinity of some, or all, of those DNA binding sites which remain exposed."
https://openalex.org/W1537356591,"Alanine and glutamine formation and release were studied using the intact epitrochlaris preparation of rat skeletal muscle. Epinephrine reduced the release of alanine and glutamine in a concentration-dependent manner. Measurable inhibition was observed at 10(-9) M epinephrine, and maximal inhibition was obtained at 10(-5) M. Norepinephrine also reduced alanine and glutamine formation and release but the concentration required for maximal inhibition was approximately 100-fold greater than for epinephrine. Isoproterenol (beta agonist), but not phenylephrine (alpha agonist), reproduced the effects of epinephrine, and propranolol (beta antagonist), but not phentolamine (alpha antagonist), blocked the effect of the catecholamine. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate reproduced the effects of epinephrine and theophylline potentiated the effect of submaximal concentrations of the hormone. Glucagon and prostaglandin E2 had no observable effect on amino acid release. Insulin did not modify the inhibition of alanine and glutamine release produced by epinephrine. Alanine and glutamine formation from added precursor amino acids was unaffected by epinephrine or cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. Epinephrine reduced alanine formation in muscles obtained from diabetic rats or animals treated with thyroxine or cortisone. These findings indicate that physiological levels of catecholamines reduce alanine and glutamine formation and release from skeletal muscle. This effect is mediated by a beta-adrenergic receptor and the adenylate cyclase system and can be accounted for by an inhibition of muscle protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1579335674,"Protein phosphokinase activity from the cytosol (105,000 X g soluble fraction) of testes from sexually mature rats has been resolved be DEAE-cellulose chromatography in three forms of protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinases I and II and cAMP-independent protein kinase III. Adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-binding activity (cAMP-binding activity) was associated with protein kinases I and II but not with protein kinase III. Protein kinases I, II, and III exhibited different pH optima, cyclic nucleotide dependency, and relative substrate specificity. Protein kinases I and II were inhibited by a heat-stable protein inhibitor from rat skeletal muscle, whereas protein kinase III was not inhibited. According to previously established criteria (Traugh, J. A., Ashby, C.D., and Walsh D. A. (1974) Methods Enzymol. 38, 290-299) protein kinases I and II can be classified as cAMP-dependent holoenzymes consisting of regulatory and catalytic subunits. Protein kinase III is a cAMP-independent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1562630385,"Testicular and cauda epididymal sperm were obtained via catheters previously implanted in the rete testis and proximal vas deferens of bulls and were used to examine the relationships among sperm motility, cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) level, adenine nucleotide levels, and rates of glucose and oxygen consumption. Testicular, cauda epididymal, and ejaculated sperm contain cAMP-stimulated protein kinase, adenylate cyclase, and nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Treatment of the nonmotile testicular sperm with phosphodiesterase inhibitors resulted in a doubling of cellular cAMP concentration and a 25% increase in their glucose consumption. No change in motility, ATP level, or rate of oxygen consumption was observed. Sperm in neat cauda epididymal semen had flagellating tails but no progressive motility. Dilution of these sperm into glucose-containing buffer resulted in an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration and a decrease in ATP level with concomitant increases in ADP and AMP levels. These biochemical changes occurred within 30 s after dilution and apparently preceded the initiation of progressive motility by most cells. Since sperm in neat cauda epididymal semen became progressively motile when diluted with neat cauda epididymal plasma as well as accessory sex gland fluid or buffer, composition of the fluid surrounding the sperm is not responsible for the initiation of progressive motility upon dilution nor does cauda epididymal plasma contain an inhibitory factor. Perhaps release from contact immobilization provides the stimulation for the initial acquisition of progressive motility by cauda epididymal sperm. We conclude that during epididymal passage sperm develop from a cell physically unresponsive to changes in cAMP concentration to a form which initiates progressive motility upon changes in cAMP concentration."

This is compatible with the application of the immunosurveillance hypothesis to the natural development of leukemia in an outbred mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W1533928068,"The turnover of the plasma membrane proteins of hepatoma tissue culture cells was examined by three different methods--loss of polypeptides labeled in situ by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, loss of membrane polypeptides labeled with amino acid precursors, and loss from the membrane of fucose-labeled polypeptides. In both logarithmically growing and density-inhibited cells the proteins of the membrane are degraded with a half-life of about 100 hours. This is longer than the half-life of total cell protein, 50 to 60 hours, and longer than the doubling time of the cells, about 30 hours. Similar values for the rate of degradation of the membrane proteins were obtained by each of the three techniques. The same fucose-labeled polypeptides are present in the microsomal and the plasma membrane fractions of hepatoma tissue culture cells as analyzed by electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels. But the fucose-labeled polypeptides were lost from the microsomal fraction at a faster rate than from the plasma membrane. Autoradiographic and double labeling techniques using 125I and 131I, or [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine were used to measure the relative rates of degradation of the proteins in the plasma membrane. All of the leucine-labeled polypeptides and the iodinated polypeptides had similar rates of degradation. These results support a model for the biogenesis of the plasma membrane in which the proteins are incorporated and removed in large structural units."

https://openalex.org/W1570325544,"Three ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed by the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria and the ATPase reaction catalyzed by purified mitochondrial ATPase (F1), were studied with respect to kinetic properties, substrates specificity, and sensitivity to bicarbonate. The ATP-dependent transhydrogenase reaction (reduction of NADP+ by NADH) catalyzed by inner membrane vesicles displays typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics in both Tris-Cl and Tris-bicarbonate buffers, with Km (ATP) values of 0.035 mM and 0.054 mM respectively. The Vmax of transhydrogenase activity (25 nmol min-1 mg-1) is the same in Tris-bicarbonate or Tris-Cl buffer. ITP and GTP readily substitute for ATP in the transhydrogenase reaction. The ATP-P1 exchange reaction catalyzed by inner membrane vesicles displays typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics in both Tris-Cl and Tris-bicarbonate buffers with Km (ATP) values of 1.0 mM and 1.4 mM respectively. The Vmax of exchange (200 nmol min-1 mg-1) is the same in either buffer. ITP and GTP do not effectively replace ATP in the exchange reaction."

The effect are seen in wild-type strains and in three mutant strains with genetically altered period lengths. These results suggest the possible involvement of adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate in the control of circadian rhythmicity."

https://openalex.org/W1564794819,"The [3H]estradiol exchange assay was used to characterize the nuclear estrogen receptor from the chick oviduct. After diethylstilibestrol (DES) treatment (14 days), the oviduct nuclei contained estrogen receptors that manifested high affinity (Kd = 2 X 10(-9)M) and low capacity binding (4000 to 5000 sites/cell) for estradiol. DES and estradiol competed significantly for [3H]estradiol binding, while testosterone and progesterone were ineffective. These binding sites were found in the oviduct and liver but not in the spleen, kidney, or muscle. Following salt extraction from nuclei, the receptor had a sedimentation coefficient of 4 S when analyzed by centrifugation in high and low salt sucrose density gradients. The [3H]estradiol exchange assay was used to examine the relationships between nuclear-bound receptor and RNA polymerase initiation sites on oviduct chromatin. Within 20 min after a single injection of 2.5 mg of DES to withdrawn chicks, a maximum number of estradiol receptor-binding sites was detected in oviduct nuclei. Within 30 min after DES injection, the total number of RNA initiation sites also increased, reaching 100% of control values. Daily injections of DES to unstimulated chicks resulted in a gradual increase in the nuclear content of estradiol receptor, which reached a maximum at 6 days and thereafter declined gradually up to 18 days of hormone treatment. A maximum number of initiation sites for RNA synthesis was also attained at 4 to 6 days of DES treatment and thereafter declined. When DES was withdrawn after 14 to 18 days of hormone stimulation, the numbers of nuclear estradiol receptor sites and initiation sites for RNA synthesis both declined gradually, reaching half-maximal values in 3 days and approached control values after 7 to 8 days of withdrawal. The increase in the concentration of nuclear estradiol receptor sites and the number of initiation sites for RNA synthesis also showed a close correlation with the dosage of DES administration. Both attained maximum levels at 1.25 mg of DES with a half-maximal value of 0.5 mg. The close correlation between the concentration of nuclear-bound estradiol receptors and the number of initiation sites for RNA synthesis in vivo is at present only a temporal correlation but does raise the possibility that gene transcription in chick oviduct may depend upon the amount of estradiol receptor bound to the target cell nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1589411855,"Plasma membrane vesicles are isolated from Simian virus 40-transformed Balb/c mouse 3T3 (SV-3T3) cells. These membrane vesicles contain no significant contamination by mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or lysosomes as determined by marker enzyme analysis. The use of [U-14C] inosine as a transport substrate results in the accumulation of labeled ribose-1P as transport product by the plasma membrane vesicles. This suggests the action of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (the enzyme which mediates the phosphorolysis of inosine to ribose-1-P and hypoxanthine0 before, during, or after the transport step. Neither inosine nor significant amounts of hypoxanthine are found intravesicularly. The Km for inosine, the substrate in this reaction which leads to the accumulation of ribose-1-P by the plasma membrane vesicles, is 35 to 45 muM while the Vmax for ribose-1-P accumulation is 100 to 120 pmol/min/mg of plasma membrane protein..."
https://openalex.org/W1594778764,"Arion et al; (Arion, W. J., Wallin, B. K., Lange A. J., and Ballas, L. M. (1975) Mol. Cell. Biochem. 6, 75-83) propsed a model for glucose-6-phosphatase in which the substrate was transported across the microsomal membrane by a carrier before hydrolysis on the cisternal side. Evidence to support this model has been obtained by studying the inhibition of the enzyme by pyridoxal-P. Pyridoxal-P was a linear noncompetitive inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) in freshly isolated (intact) microsomes from rat liver. Pyridoxol-P was a much less effective inhibitor and no inhibition was observed with pyridoxamine-P. When microsomes were subjected to nitrogen cavitation, treatment with solium deoxycholate, or glutaraldehyde fixation, the Km of glucose-6-phosphatase for glucose-6 P decreased from approximately 6 mM to approximately 2.5 mM; the corresponding change in the Vmax ranged from-10% to +40%. The same procedures decreased the inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase by pyridoxal-P several-fold. No inhibition by pyridoxal-P was observed in a preparation of glucose-6-phosphatase purified approximately 20 fold (on the basis of Vmax) from micoromes. A nondialyzable inhibitor was apparently formed when intact microsomes were reacted with pyridoxal-P and NaBH4; this inhibition was also reversed by procedures which changed the kinetic properties of glucose-6-phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2057627675,Autoradiograms prepared from brains of chick embryos after injection of [3H]estradiol demonstrate the existence of target cells for estrogen in the medial preoptic and ventral hypothalamic regions as early as day 10 of incubation. Target cells also appear in telencephalic locations during later stages of embryonic development. These hormone-concentrating cells probably are the anatomical substrate for the formative action of sex steroids during embryonic life on certain brain functions such as control of sexual and aggressive behaviour and gonadotropin secretion.

https://openalex.org/W1524209514,"The molecular weights of the large genomic RNAs from Rous sarcoma and Moloney murine leukemia viruses were determined by a combination of sedimentation coefficients and retardation coefficients from gel electrophoresis. Six RNA standards, ranging from 0.7 X 10(6) to 5.3 X 10(6) daltons, were employed. Studies in the presence of varying concentrations of Mg2+ showed that the method provided valid molecular weights for RNAs of differing amounts of ordered structure. The molecular weight (X 10(-6)) of the high molecular weight RNA complexe from Rous sarcoma virus was 7.6 (+/-0.3) and from murine leukemia virus was 6.9 (+/-0.3). The molecular weights (X 10 (-6) of their Subunits were 3.3 (+/-0.1) and 2.8 (+/-0.2), respectively. Hence, the large complexes consisted of two, not three or more, subunits plus small associated RNAs. The high molecular weight RNA from cloned Rous sarcoma virus was heterogenous in molecular weight although the apparent molecular radius was constant; stuides were performed on subfractions of the RNA as well as on RNA from virus harvested at various time intervals. The preparations with lowest molecular weight approached a mass equal to twice that of the subunit, with hydrodynamic properties approaching those expected of normal single-stranded RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1596451199,"Abstract The incorporation of DL-3,4-dehydro[14C]proline into collagen and total protein of 3T3 cells occurred at approximately one-fifth the rate observed for L-[14C]proline. Addition of L-3,4-dehydroproline to the culture medium inhibited markedly the incorporation of [14C]glycine and L-[3H]lysine into the collagen of 3T3 cells, but there was only slight inhibition of the incorporation of the radiolabeled amino acids into total cellular proteins, indicating that the action of L-3,4-dehydroproline is specific for collagen. When 1 mM L-3,4-dehydroproline was added to the culture medium the [14C]hydroxyproline content was reduced 40% in the cell layer and 70% in the medium. The D isomer of 3,4-dehydroproline did not inhibit [14C]hydroxyproline formation. These findings indicate that L-3,4-dehydroline reduced the hydroxylation of the susceptible prolyl residues in the collagen molecule and the secretion of collagen from the cell. The reduction in the hydroxyproline content is probably related in part to a reduction in the activity of prolyl hydroxylase; when various mammalian cell cultures were exposed to 0.2 mM L-3,4-dehydroproline, the specific activity of prolyl hydroxylase was reduced markedly, while that of lysyl hydroproline, the specific activity of prolyl hydroxylase was reduced markedly, while that of lysyl hydroxylase was not affected. Under these conditions, cell growth and lactic dehydrogenase required protein synthesis. Removal of L-3,4-dehydroproline from the growth medium resulted in a time-dependent increase in the specific activity of prolyl hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1510422177,"C-1300 murine neuroblastoma cells release glycoproteins into the culture medium. The process was studied by prelabeling spinner cultures for 12 to 60 hours with [3H]glucosamine. Then, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium lacking radioactive isotope. Soluble material released into the medium during the subsequent 2-hour incubation was collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The released proteins were then separated by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The electrophoretograms of glycoproteins obtained from cultures labeled for different lengths of time were very similar; three major radioactive regions centered about molecular weights 87,000, 66,000, and 55,000 were present. When spinner cells were transferred to monolayer culture in the presence of N6,O2' dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (Bt2cAMP), differentiation (extension of neurites twice the diameter of the perikaryon) was observed. Monolayer cultures grown in the presence of Bt2cAMP and [3H]glucosamine for 12 hours released glycoproteins which gave a gel electrophoresis pattern similar to that obtained using spinner cultures. However, after 60 hours in the presence of Bt2cAMP and [3H]glucosamine, the released radioactive material consisted almost exclusively of glycoproteins of the 66,000 molecular weight class. Similar results were obtained if [3H]fucose was substituted for [3H]glucosamine, or if bromodeoxyuridine (which also induced differentiation) was substituted for Bt2cAMP. Similar experiments using radioactive amino acids were conducted with both spinner and monolayer cultures. Much of the released radioactive material was contained in the same three molecular weight classes as the glycoproteins released by spinner cells prelabeled with [3H]glucosamine, and this pattern did not vary with length of labeling period or type of culture. These results may imply that the glycosylation of released proteins is influenced by agents which can induce differentiation. The origin of this released material is discussed. [3H]Glucosamine-labeled glycoproteins of the molecular weight class centered about 55,000 (discussed above) were isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis. They co-migrated with authentic mouse brain microtubular protein as two closely spaced bands on a number of different electrophoretic systems. This protein fraction was also characterized as complexing with a monospecific antitubulin antibody."

The protein fraction of 50 S subunits was separated into 27 components by a combination of various methods including ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The individual proteins showed single bands in a variety of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems, and nearly all showed single spots on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. The molecular weights of the proteins were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An equimolar mixture of the purified proteins was combined with 23 S RNA and 5 S RNA to reconstitute active 50 S subunits by the procedure of Nomura and Erdmann (Nomura, M., and Erdmann, V. A. (1970) Nature 226, 1214-1218). Reconstituted 52 S subunits containing purified proteins were slightly more active than subunits reconstituted with an unfractionated total protein extract in poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis and showed comparable activity in various assays for ribosomal function. The reconstitution proceeded more rapidly with the mixture of purified proteins than with the total protein extract. Reconstituted 50 S subunits containing purified proteins co-sedimented with native 50 S subunits on sucrose gradients and had a similar protein compsoition. Initial experiments on the roles of the individual proteins in ribosomal structure and function were performed. B. stearothermophilus protein 13 was extracted from 50 S subunits under the same conditions as escherichia coli L7/L12, and the extraction had a similar effect on ribosomal function. When single proteins were omitted from reconstitution mixtures, in most cases the reconstituted 50 S subunits showed decreased activity in polypheylalanine synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1570779352,"The preparation of a four-subunit enzyme from yeast, capable of catalyzing the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c, is described. It is derived from proteins containing seven or five subunits by means of recycling exclusion chromatography in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Its catalytic properties are similar to those of the parent enzyme. Gel electrophoresis of this preparation in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate reveals three bands, migrating with RF values that correspond to molecular weights of 14.6, 12.3, and 10.6 X 10(3), with the largest exhibiting an apparent 2:1 stoichiometry relative to the other two. Visible spectra in the region of 390 to 630 nm do not show any detectable difference from that of the parent cytochrome oxidase, while its heme a and copper content are raised to values around 20 nmol or ng atoms/mg of protein, respectively, corresponding to minimal molecular weights of 50 X 10(3). The molecular weight determined by physical means equals 107 X 10(3). Thus the enzyme probably contains two copies of each subunit. After extensive dialysis to remove as much as possible of the sodium dodecyl sulfate used in its preparation, this enzyme remains in solution in phosphate buffer in the absence of any added detergent, while under similar conditions the seven-subunit complex precipitates completely. A similar preparation can also be obtained from beef heart. The significance of these findings is discussed with respect to the role of the large subunits in the function as well as the biogenesis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase complex."

https://openalex.org/W1565575002,"The interaction of a series of alkylamines with muscle pyruvate kinase was investigated by kinetic and physical studies in order to understand the mechanisms by which certain monovalent cations can activate the enzyme and to define several of the important conformational changes necessary for catalytic activity. Monomethylammonium ion interacts with pyruvate kinase to activate the enzyme. Dimethyland trimethylammonium ions do not activate, but are competitive inhibitors against activating cations. Tetramethylammonium ion neither activates nor inhibits pyruvate kinase activity. When the enzyme is in the presence of monomethylammonium ion or dimethylammonium ion, a conformational change is observed by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. This conformational change is similar to that observed with other activating cations and appears to be a necessary but no sufficient conformational change in the formation of an active complex. The interaction of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate with the pyruvate kinase-Mn2+ complex in the presence of these cations was studied by water proton relaxation rate measurements. The affinity of the enzyme-Mn2+ complex for phosphoenolpyruvate is decreased by a factor of 5 in the presence of any of the alkylamines compared to the affinity measured in the presence of K+ or NH4+. No change in the Km of phosphoenolpyruvate is observed however when it is measured in the presence of monomethylammonium ion, suggesting that the decrease in affinity for the substrate is not the reason for lack of enzymic activity. The conformation of the ternary enzyme-Mn2+-phosphoenolpyruvate complex about the bound Mn2+, as reflected by the enhancement values (epsilont) measured, differs depending upon the nature of the monovalent cation. The epsilon t values measured in the presence of the alkylamines are larger (epsilont - 5.7 +/- 0.2) than those measured in the presence of K+ or NH4+ (epsilont = 1.9 +/- 0.1)."
https://openalex.org/W1568965783,"Activation of membrane-associated thiamin triphosphatase from rat brain requires a divalent cation (Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+). The optimum concentration of Mg2+ necessary for maximal enzyme activity varies with substrate concentration; conversely, the maximal rate of hydrolysis attainbale by increasing thiamin triphosphate concentration is directly proportional to [Mg2+] for all levels of Mg2+ below that of the substrate. Under appropriate conditions, the Km of the thiamin triphosphatase for Mg2+ and for thiamin triphosphate are shown to be identical. Dissociation constants (Kd) for the binding of Mg2+ to thiamin triphosphate, thiamin diphosphate, and thiamin were determined; kinetic data re-expressed in terms of [Mg2+-thiamin triphosphate] conform to simple single substrate predictions, suggesting that the true enzyme substrate may be the Mg2+-thiamin triphosphate complex. Excess free Mg2+ inhibits thiamin triphosphatase activity competitively while excess free thiamin triphosphate in concentrations up to 10 times Km has no effect on the membrane-bound enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1479702604,"The DNA duplex corresponding to the entire length (126 nucleotides) of the precursor for an Escherichia coli tyrosine tRNA has been synthesized. Duplex [I] (Sekiya, T., Besmer, P., Takeya, T., and Khorana, H. G.(1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 634-641), corresponding to the nucleotide sequence 1-26, containing single-stranded ends and carrying one appropriately labeled 5'-phosphate group, was joined to duplex [II] (Loewen, P. C., Miller, R. C., Panet, A., Sekiya, T., and Khorana, H. G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 642-650) (nucleotide sequence 23-66 or 23-60) was phosphorylated with [gamma-33P]ATP at the 5'-OH ends. Duplex [III] (Panet, A., Kleppe, R., Kleppe, K., and Khorana, H. G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 651-657) (nucleotide sequence 57-94 (Fig. 2)) was also phosphorylated at 5'-ends with [gamma-33P]ATP and was joined to duplex [IV] (Caruthers, M. H., Kleppe, R., Kleppe, K., and Khorana, H. G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 658-666) (nucleotide sequence 90-126) which carried a 33P-labeled phosphate group on nucleotide 90. The joined product, duplex [III + IV] (nucleotide sequence 57-126) was characterized. The latter duplex was joined to the duplex [I + II] to give the total duplex. The latter contains singlestranded ends (nucleotides 1 to 6 and 121 to 126) which can either be filled in to produce the completely base-paired duplex or may be used to add the promoter and terminator regions at the appropriate ends."

https://openalex.org/W1606910080,"In continuing the work on the total synthesis of the gene for an Escherichia coli tyrosine suppressor tRNA (accompanying papers) and as a part of a study of the mechanism of transcription of this gene, a 23-nucleotide unit-long DNA corresponding to the previously determined (Loewen, P., Sekiya, T., and Khorana, H. G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 217) sequence has been synthesized. The synthesis was carried out by dividing the total duplex into the following five deoxyribooligonucleotide segments, all of which were chemically synthesized: (a) the undecanucleotide, d(A-G-T-G-A-T-G-G-T-G-G); (b)the undecanucleotide, d(T-C-A-C-T-T-T-C-A-A-A); (c) the undecanucleotide, d(G-G-A-C-T-T-T-T-G-A-A); (d) the dodecanucleotide, d(A-G-T-C-C-C-T-G-A-A-C-T); and (e) the heptanucleotide, d(A-G-T-T-C-A-G). All the five synthetic oligonucleotides were characterized by chromatographic and radioactive fingerprinting methods after labeling the 5'-ends with a 32P-phosphate group. Synthesis of the double-stranded DNA duplex was completed by joining 5'-phosphorylated segments 1, 3, and 4 in the presence of segments 2 and 5 using T4-polynucleotide ligase. The DNA duplex was characterized."

https://openalex.org/W1582550041,"The capacity of RNA subunits of Schmidt-Ruppin Rous sarcoma virus to bind (dT)n was studied by cesium sulfate density gradient centrifugation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two classes of subunits were observed. In agreement with previous reports, 60 to 70% of the purified subunits were capable of binding (dT)n. The remaining, nonbinding RNAs, although indistinguishable in size from whole subunits, were shown to be fragments that had lost the (rA)n terminus by random nucleolytic cleavage. This was deduced from the molecular weight distribution of the nonbinding RNAs from high molecular weight RNA. In addition, virtually all subunit RNA from early harvest virus, which contains a greater proportion of intact subunit, binds (dT)n."
