https://openalex.org/W2107915297,"As part of a World Health Organization-led effort to update the empirical evidence base for the leishmaniases, national experts provided leishmaniasis case data for the last 5 years and information regarding treatment and control in their respective countries and a comprehensive literature review was conducted covering publications on leishmaniasis in 98 countries and three territories (see ‘Leishmaniasis Country Profiles Text S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S16, S17, S18, S19, S20, S21, S22, S23, S24, S25, S26, S27, S28, S29, S30, S31, S32, S33, S34, S35, S36, S37, S38, S39, S40, S41, S42, S43, S44, S45, S46, S47, S48, S49, S50, S51, S52, S53, S54, S55, S56, S57, S58, S59, S60, S61, S62, S63, S64, S65, S66, S67, S68, S69, S70, S71, S72, S73, S74, S75, S76, S77, S78, S79, S80, S81, S82, S83, S84, S85, S86, S87, S88, S89, S90, S91, S92, S93, S94, S95, S96, S97, S98, S99, S100, S101’). Additional information was collated during meetings conducted at WHO regional level between 2007 and 2011. Two questionnaires regarding epidemiology and drug access were completed by experts and national program managers. Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence ranges were estimated by country and epidemiological region based on reported incidence, underreporting rates if available, and the judgment of national and international experts. Based on these estimates, approximately 0.2 to 0.4 cases and 0.7 to 1.2 million VL and CL cases, respectively, occur each year. More than 90% of global VL cases occur in six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widely distributed, with about one-third of cases occurring in each of three epidemiological regions, the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, and western Asia from the Middle East to Central Asia. The ten countries with the highest estimated case counts, Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica and Peru, together account for 70 to 75% of global estimated CL incidence. Mortality data were extremely sparse and generally represent hospital-based deaths only. Using an overall case-fatality rate of 10%, we reach a tentative estimate of 20,000 to 40,000 leishmaniasis deaths per year. Although the information is very poor in a number of countries, this is the first in-depth exercise to better estimate the real impact of leishmaniasis. These data should help to define control strategies and reinforce leishmaniasis advocacy."
https://openalex.org/W1978631832,"Respiratory complex II oxidizes succinate to fumarate as part of the Krebs cycle and reduces ubiquinone in the electron transport chain. Previous experimental evidence suggested that complex II is not a significant contributor to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in isolated mitochondria or intact cells unless mutated. However, we find that when complex I and complex III are inhibited and succinate concentration is low, complex II in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria can generate superoxide or H(2)O(2) at high rates. These rates approach or exceed the maximum rates achieved by complex I or complex III. Complex II generates these ROS in both the forward reaction, with electrons supplied by succinate, and the reverse reaction, with electrons supplied from the reduced ubiquinone pool. ROS production in the reverse reaction is prevented by inhibition of complex II at either the ubiquinone-binding site (by atpenin A5) or the flavin (by malonate), whereas ROS production in the forward reaction is prevented by malonate but not by atpenin A5, showing that the ROS from complex II arises only from the flavin site (site II(F)). We propose a mechanism for ROS production by complex II that relies upon the occupancy of the substrate oxidation site and the reduction state of the enzyme. We suggest that complex II may be an important contributor to physiological and pathological ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2059083151,"Diverse stresses including starvation and muscle disuse cause skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy are complex and not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45a protein (Gadd45a) is a critical mediator of muscle atrophy. We identified Gadd45a through an unbiased search for potential downstream mediators of the stress-inducible, pro-atrophy transcription factor ATF4. We show that Gadd45a is required for skeletal muscle atrophy induced by three distinct skeletal muscle stresses: fasting, muscle immobilization, and muscle denervation. Conversely, forced expression of Gadd45a in muscle or cultured myotubes induces atrophy in the absence of upstream stress. We show that muscle-specific ATF4 knock-out mice have a reduced capacity to induce Gadd45a mRNA in response to stress, and as a result, they undergo less atrophy in response to fasting or muscle immobilization. Interestingly, Gadd45a is a myonuclear protein that induces myonuclear remodeling and a comprehensive program for muscle atrophy. Gadd45a represses genes involved in anabolic signaling and energy production, and it induces pro-atrophy genes. As a result, Gadd45a reduces multiple barriers to muscle atrophy (including PGC-1α, Akt activity, and protein synthesis) and stimulates pro-atrophy mechanisms (including autophagy and caspase-mediated proteolysis). These results elucidate a critical stress-induced pathway that reprograms muscle gene expression to cause atrophy.

https://openalex.org/W2017001659,"The β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme BACE1 is a prime drug target for Alzheimer disease. However, the function and the physiological substrates of BACE1 remain largely unknown. In this work, we took a quantitative proteomic approach to analyze the secretome of primary neurons after acute BACE1 inhibition, and we identified several novel substrate candidates for BACE1. Many of these molecules are involved in neuronal network formation in the developing nervous system. We selected the adhesion molecules L1 and CHL1, which are crucial for axonal guidance and maintenance of neural circuits, for further validation as BACE1 substrates. Using both genetic BACE1 knock-out and acute pharmacological BACE1 inhibition in mice and cell cultures, we show that L1 and CHL1 are cleaved by BACE1 under physiological conditions. The BACE1 cleavage sites at the membrane-proximal regions of L1 (between Tyr(1086) and Glu(1087)) and CHL1 (between Gln(1061) and Asp(1062)) were determined by mass spectrometry. This work provides molecular insights into the function and the pathways in which BACE1 is involved, and it will help to predict or interpret possible side effects of BACE1 inhibitor drugs in current clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2106561568,"The effects and potential mechanisms of the vascular endothelial cell (EC)-enriched microRNA-15a (miR-15a) on angiogenesis remain unclear. Here, we show a novel finding that EC-selective miR-15a transgenic overexpression leads to reduced blood vessel formation and local blood flow perfusion in mouse hindlimbs at 1-3 weeks after hindlimb ischemia. Mechanistically, gain- or loss-of-miR-15a function by lentiviral infection in ECs significantly reduces or increases tube formation, cell migration, and cell differentiation, respectively. By FGF2 and VEGF 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assays, Real-time PCR, and immunoassays, we further identified that the miR-15a directly targets FGF2 and VEGF to facilitate its anti-angiogenic effects. Our data suggest that the miR-15a in ECs can significantly suppress cell-autonomous angiogenesis through direct inhibition of endogenous endothelial FGF2 and VEGF activities. Pharmacological modulation of miR-15a function may provide a new therapeutic strategy to intervene against angiogenesis in a variety of pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2150481905,"Spectroscopic studies on photosynthetic electron transfer generally are based upon the monitoring of dark to light changes in the electron transfer chain. These studies, which focus on the light reactions of photosynthesis, also indirectly provide information on the redox or metabolic state of the chloroplast in the dark. Here, using the unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we study the impact of heterotrophic/mixotrophic acetate feeding on chloroplast carbon metabolism by using the spectrophotometric detection of P700(+), the photooxidized primary electron donor of photosystem I. We show that, when photosynthetic linear and cyclic electron flows are blocked (DCMU inhibiting PSII and methylviologen accepting electrons from PSI), the post-illumination reduction kinetics of P700(+) directly reflect the dark metabolic production of reductants (mainly NAD(P)H) in the stroma of chloroplasts. Such results can be correlated to other metabolic studies: in the absence of acetate, for example, the P700(+) reduction rate matches the rate of starch breakdown reported previously, confirming the chloroplast localization of the upstream steps of the glycolytic pathway in Chlamydomonas. Furthermore, the question of the interplay between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic carbon metabolism can be addressed. We show that cyclic electron flow around photosystem I is twice as fast in a starchless mutant fed with acetate than it is in the WT, and we relate how changes in the flux of electrons from carbohydrate metabolism modulate the redox poise of the plastoquinone pool in the dark through chlororespiration."
https://openalex.org/W2142483864,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs to trigger either translation repression or mRNA degradation. miR-125b is down-regulated in human breast cancer cells compared with the normal ones except highly metastatic tumor cells MDA-MB-231. However, few functional studies were designed to investigate metastatic potential of miR-125b. In this study, the effects of miR-125b on metastasis in human breast cancer cells were studied, and the targets of miR-125b were also explored. Transwell migration assay, cell wound healing assay, adhesion assay and nude mice model of metastasis were utilized to investigate the effects of miR-125b on metastasis potential in vitro and in vivo. In addition, it was implied STARD13 (DLC2) was a direct target of miR-125b by Target-Scan analysis, luciferase reporter assay and western blot. Furthermore, activation of STARD13 was identified responsible for metastasis induced by miR-125b through a siRNA targeting STARD13. qRT-PCR, immunofluorescent assay and western blot was used to observe the variation of Vimentin and α-SMA in breast cancer cells. In summary, our study provided new insights into the function of miR-125b during the metastasis of breat cancer cells and also suggested the role of miR-125b in pro-metastasis by targeting STARD13."
https://openalex.org/W2054780472,"CLECSF8 is a poorly characterized member of the ""Dectin-2 cluster"" of C-type lectin receptors and was originally thought to be expressed exclusively by macrophages. We show here that CLECSF8 is primarily expressed by peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes and weakly by several subsets of peripheral blood dendritic cells. However, expression of this receptor is lost upon in vitro differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells or macrophages. Like the other members of the Dectin-2 family, which require association of their transmembrane domains with signaling adaptors for surface expression, CLECSF8 is retained intracellularly when expressed in non-myeloid cells. However, we demonstrate that CLECSF8 does not associate with any known signaling adaptor molecule, including DAP10, DAP12, or the FcRγ chain, and we found that the C-type lectin domain of CLECSF8 was responsible for its intracellular retention. Although CLECSF8 does not contain a signaling motif in its cytoplasmic domain, we show that this receptor is capable of inducing signaling via Syk kinase in myeloid cells and that it can induce phagocytosis, proinflammatory cytokine production, and the respiratory burst. These data therefore indicate that CLECSF8 functions as an activation receptor on myeloid cells and associates with a novel adaptor molecule. Characterization of the CLECSF8-deficient mice and screening for ligands using oligosaccharide microarrays did not provide further insights into the physiological function of this receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2030694711,"Although N-acetyl groups are common in nature, N-glycolyl groups are rare. Mammals express two major sialic acids, N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Although humans cannot produce Neu5Gc, it is detected in the epithelial lining of hollow organs, endothelial lining of the vasculature, fetal tissues, and carcinomas. This unexpected expression is hypothesized to result via metabolic incorporation of Neu5Gc from mammalian foods. This accumulation has relevance for diseases associated with such nutrients, via interaction with Neu5Gc-specific antibodies. Little is known about how ingested sialic acids in general and Neu5Gc in particular are metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract. We studied the gastrointestinal and systemic fate of Neu5Gc-containing glycoproteins (Neu5Gc-glycoproteins) or free Neu5Gc in the Neu5Gc-free Cmah(-/-) mouse model. Ingested free Neu5Gc showed rapid absorption into the circulation and urinary excretion. In contrast, ingestion of Neu5Gc-glycoproteins led to Neu5Gc incorporation into the small intestinal wall, appearance in circulation at a steady-state level for several hours, and metabolic incorporation into multiple peripheral tissue glycoproteins and glycolipids, thus conclusively proving that Neu5Gc can be metabolically incorporated from food. Feeding Neu5Gc-glycoproteins but not free Neu5Gc mimics the human condition, causing tissue incorporation into human-like sites in Cmah(-/-) fetal and adult tissues, as well as developing tumors. Thus, glycoproteins containing glycosidically linked Neu5Gc are the likely dietary source for human tissue accumulation, and not the free monosaccharide. This human-like model can be used to elucidate specific mechanisms of Neu5Gc delivery from the gut to tissues, as well as general mechanisms of metabolism of ingested sialic acids."

https://openalex.org/W2090584945,"Tendon overuse injuries and tendinitis are accompanied by catabolic processes and apoptosis of tenocytes. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of the destructive processes in tendon are not fully understood. Sirt-1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase, has been linked to transcriptional silencing and appears to play a key role in inflammation. The purpose of this study was to examine whether down-regulation of Sirt-1 using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) affects inflammatory and apoptotic signaling in tenocytes. Transient transfection of tenocytes with ASO against Sirt-1 induced expression of Bax and other proteins involved in apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase), acetylation of tumor suppressor p53, and mitochondrial degradation. Interestingly, Sirt-1 was found to interact directly with p53. In contrast, Sirt-1 activator resveratrol inhibited interleukin-1β (IL-1β)- and nicotinamide-induced NF-κB activation and p65 acetylation and suppressed the activation of IκB-α kinase. Resveratrol also reversed the IL-1β- or nicotinamide-induced up-regulation of various gene products that mediate inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2) and matrix degradation (matrix metalloproteinase-9) that are known to be regulated by NF-κB. Knockdown of Sirt-1 by using ASO abolished the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on inflammatory and apoptotic signaling including Akt activation and SCAX suppression. Down-regulation of histone deacetylase Sirt-1 by mRNA interference abrogated the effect of resveratrol on NF-κB suppression, thus highlighting the crucial homeostatic role of this enzyme. Overall, these results suggest for the first time that Sirt-1 can regulate p53 and NF-κB signaling via deacetylation, demonstrating a novel role for resveratrol in the treatment of tendinitis/tendinopathy."

https://openalex.org/W1998689894,"The two major mammalian sialic acids are N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). The only known biosynthetic pathway generating Neu5Gc is the conversion of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid into CMP-Neu5Gc, which is catalyzed by the CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase enzyme. Given the irreversible nature of this reaction, there must be pathways for elimination or degradation of Neu5Gc, which would allow animal cells to adjust Neu5Gc levels to their needs. Although humans are incapable of synthesizing Neu5Gc due to an inactivated CMAH gene, exogenous Neu5Gc from dietary sources can be metabolically incorporated into tissues in the face of an anti-Neu5Gc antibody response. However, the metabolic turnover of Neu5Gc, which apparently prevents human cells from continued accumulation of this immunoreactive sialic acid, has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we show that pre-loaded Neu5Gc is eliminated from human cells over time, and we propose a conceivable Neu5Gc-degrading pathway based on the well studied metabolism of N-acetylhexosamines. We demonstrate that murine tissue cytosolic extracts harbor the enzymatic machinery to sequentially convert Neu5Gc into N-glycolylmannosamine, N-glycolylglucosamine, and N-glycolylglucosamine 6-phosphate, whereupon irreversible de-N-glycolylation of the latter results in the ubiquitous metabolites glycolate and glucosamine 6-phosphate. We substantiate this finding by demonstrating activity of recombinant human enzymes in vitro and by studying the fate of radiolabeled pathway intermediates in cultured human cells, suggesting that this pathway likely occurs in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed degradative pathway is partially reversible, showing that N-glycolylmannosamine and N-glycolylglucosamine (but not glycolate) can serve as precursors for biosynthesis of endogenous Neu5Gc."
https://openalex.org/W2035827341,"Ubiquitin (Ub) modifications at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) play critical roles in the assembly of signaling and repair proteins. The Ub-interacting motif (UIM) domain of Rap80, which is a component of the BRCA1-A complex, interacts with Ub Lys-63 linkage conjugates and mediates the recruitment of BRCA1 to DSBs. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation also occurs at DSBs and promotes Ub-dependent recruitment of BRCA1, but its molecular basis is not clear. In this study, we identified that Rap80 possesses a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM), capable of binding specifically to SUMO2/3 conjugates, and forms a tandem SIM-UIM-UIM motif at its N terminus. The SIM-UIM-UIM motif binds to both Ub Lys-63 linkage and SUMO2 conjugates. Both the SIM and UIM domains are required for efficient recruitment of Rap80 to DSBs immediately after damage and confer cellular resistance to ionizing radiation. These findings propose a model in which SUMO and Ub modification is coordinated to recruit Rap80 and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites."
https://openalex.org/W2063645626,"The parasitic protozoan Leishmania alternates between an invertebrate and a mammalian host. Upon their entry to mammalian macrophages, Leishmania promastigotes differentiate into amastigote forms within the harsh environment of the phagolysosomal compartment. Here, we provide evidence for the importance of translational control during the Leishmania differentiation process. We find that exposure of promastigotes to a combined elevated temperature and acidic pH stress, a key signal triggering amastigote differentiation, leads to a marked decrease in global translation initiation, which is associated with eIF2α phosphorylation. Interestingly, we show that amastigotes adapted to grow in a cell-free medium exhibit lower levels of protein synthesis in comparison to promastigotes, suggesting that amastigotes have to enter a slow growth state to adapt to the stressful conditions encountered inside macrophages. Reconversion of amastigotes back to promastigote growth results in upregulation of global translation and a decrease in eIF2α phosphorylation. In addition, we show that while general translation is reduced during amastigote differentiation, translation of amastigote-specific transcripts such as A2 is preferentially upregulated. We find that A2 developmental gene regulation is triggered by temperature changes in the environment and that occurs mainly at the level of translation. Upon elevated temperature, the A2 transcript is stabilized through its association with polyribosomes leading to high levels of translation. When temperature decreases during amastigote to promastigote differentiation, the A2 transcript is not longer associated with translating polyribosomes and is being gradually degraded. Overall, these findings contribute to our better understanding of the adaptive responses of Leishmania to stress during its development and highlight the importance of translational control in promastigote to amastigote differentiation and vice-versa."

https://openalex.org/W1986919229,"Using proteomics and immunofluorescence, we demonstrated epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced recruitment of extrinsic V(1) subunits of the vacuolar (H(+))-ATPase (V-ATPase) to rat liver endosomes. This was accompanied by reduced vacuolar pH. Bafilomycin, an inhibitor of V-ATPase, inhibited EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation as indicated by a decrease in eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding 1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylation and p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation and kinase activity. There was no corresponding inhibition of EGF-induced Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activation. Chloroquine, a neutralizer of vacuolar pH, mimicked bafilomycin effects. Bafilomycin did not inhibit the association of mTORC1 with Raptor nor did it affect AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Rather, the intracellular concentrations of essential but not non-essential amino acids were decreased by bafilomycin in EGF-treated primary rat hepatocytes. Cycloheximide, a translation elongation inhibitor known to augment intracellular amino acid levels, prevented the effect of bafilomycin on amino acids levels and completely reversed its inhibition of EGF-induced mTORC1 activation. In vivo administration of EGF stimulated the recruitment of Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) but not mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to endosomes and lysosomes. This was inhibited by chloroquine treatment. Our results suggest a role for vacuolar acidification in EGF signaling to mTORC1."

However, the exact molecular mechanism of such a step between A. baumannii and the host cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the phosphorylcholine (ChoP)-containing outer membrane protein of A. baumannii binds to A549 cells through platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), resulting in activation of G protein and intracellular calcium. Upon A. baumannii expressing ChoP binding to PAFR, clathrin and β-arrestins, proteins involved in the direction of the vacuolar movement, are activated during invasion of A. baumannii. PAFR antagonism restricts the dissemination of A. baumannii in the pneumonia model. These results define a role for PAFR in A. baumannii interaction with host cells and suggest a mechanism for the entry of A. baumannii into the cytoplasm of host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2016532952,"The sialic acid (Sia) N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its hydroxylated derivative N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) differ by one oxygen atom. CMP-Neu5Gc is synthesized from CMP-Neu5Ac, with Neu5Gc representing a highly variable fraction of total Sias in various tissues and among different species. The exception may be the brain, where Neu5Ac is abundant and Neu5Gc is reported to be rare. Here, we confirm this unusual pattern and its evolutionary conservation in additional samples from various species, concluding that brain Neu5Gc expression has been maintained at extremely low levels over hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution. Most explanations for this pattern do not require maintaining neural Neu5Gc at such low levels. We hypothesized that resistance of α2-8-linked Neu5Gc to vertebrate sialidases is the detrimental effect requiring the relative absence of Neu5Gc from brain. This linkage is prominent in polysialic acid (polySia), a molecule with critical roles in vertebrate neural development. We show that Neu5Gc is incorporated into neural polySia and does not cause in vitro toxicity. Synthetic polymers of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc showed that mammalian and bacterial sialidases are much less able to hydrolyze α2-8-linked Neu5Gc at the nonreducing terminus. Notably, this difference was not seen with acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of polySias. Molecular dynamics modeling indicates that differences in the three-dimensional conformation of terminal saccharides may partly explain reduced enzymatic activity. In keeping with this, polymers of N-propionylneuraminic acid are sensitive to sialidases. Resistance of Neu5Gc-containing polySia to sialidases provides a potential explanation for the rarity of Neu5Gc in the vertebrate brain."
https://openalex.org/W2080767508,"Chronic HIV infection leads to the development of cognitive impairments, designated as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The secretion of soluble neurotoxic factors by HIV-infected macrophages plays a central role in the neuronal dysfunction and cell death associated with HAND. One potentially neurotoxic protein secreted by HIV-1 infected macrophages is cathepsin B. To explore the potential role of cathepsin B in neuronal cell death after HIV infection, we cultured HIV-1(ADA) infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and assayed them for expression and activity of cathepsin B and its inhibitors, cystatins B and C. The neurotoxic activity of the secreted cathepsin B was determined by incubating cells from the neuronal cell line SK-N-SH with MDM conditioned media (MCM) from HIV-1 infected cultures. We found that HIV-1 infected MDM secreted significantly higher levels of cathepsin B than did uninfected cells. Moreover, the activity of secreted cathepsin B was significantly increased in HIV-infected MDM at the peak of viral production. Incubation of neuronal cells with supernatants from HIV-infected MDM resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of apoptotic neurons, and this increase was reversed by the addition of either the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 or a monoclonal antibody to cathepsin B. In situ proximity ligation assays indicated that the increased neurotoxic activity of the cathepsin B secreted by HIV-infected MDM resulted from decreased interactions between the enzyme and its inhibitors, cystatins B and C. Furthermore, preliminary in vivo studies of human post-mortem brain tissue suggested an upregulation of cathepsin B immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and basal ganglia in individuals with HAND. Our results demonstrate that HIV-1 infection upregulates cathepsin B in macrophages, increases cathepsin B activity, and reduces cystatin-cathepsin interactions, contributing to neuronal apoptosis. These findings provide new evidence for the role of cathepsin B in neuronal cell death induced by HIV-infected macrophages."

Accumulating evidence implicates spontaneously arising cellular ICLs, induced by metabolic intermediates and oxidized lipids, as a formidable threat to genomic integrity (4.Niedernhofer L.J.

Indeed, the inability to repair these ICLs might directly contribute to developmental defects and tumor formation, as exemplified in the inherited disorder Fanconi anemia (FA) (5.Langevin F.

In addition, a variety of clinically important alkylating anticancer drugs induces cell death through ICL formation, and response to therapy has been directly linked to ICL repair capacity (8.Spanswick V.J.

Evidence suggests that a key step during processing of incised ICLs involves the trimming or degradation of the tethered oligonucleotide remaining after ICL incision. Indeed, this step has been directly visualized in a Xenopus in vitro ICL repair system that employs replication-competent cell extracts (17.Räschle M. Knipscheer P. Knipsheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T.

We have recently shown that the hSNM1A exonuclease might play an important role during this trimming step, as this protein acts in concert with XPF-ERCC1 to initiate ICL repair in vivo and displays biochemical activities consistent with such a role in vitro (14.Wang A.T.

Human SNM1A and XPF-ERCC1 collaborate to initiate DNA interstrand cross-link repair.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Purified hSNM1A is able to digest DNA-bearing site-specific ICLs produced by the non-distorting minor groove binding agent SJG-136 past the site of the lesion, leaving a single nucleotide covalently attached to the opposing strand (14.Wang A.T.

These tethered mononucleotides are established as good substrates for translesion synthesis polymerases to copy past (18.Ho T.V. Guainazzi A. Derkunt S.B. Enoiu M. Schärer O.D.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae a single, possibly founder member of this family, Pso2 (formerly known as Snm1), is present and is critical for normal ICL resistance (21.Henriques J.A. Moustacchi E.

Vertebrates possess three orthologs of Pso2, hSNM1A, hSNM1B/Apollo, and hSNM1C/Artemis. Biochemically, the three human proteins have been shown to exhibit either 5′-3′ exonuclease (hSNM1A and hSNM1B) (14.Wang A.T. Sengerová B. Cattell E. Inagawa T. Hartley J.M. Kiakos K.

Furthermore, hSNM1B was identified as a TRF2-interacting protein and, therefore, plays a role in telomere maintenance in association with the Shelterin complex, protecting leading strand telomeres and preventing non-homologous end-joining-mediated chromosome fusions (25.Lenain C.

Because disruption of non-homologous end-joining factors rescues the embryonic lethality in hSNM1B-disrupted mice, this suggests that the dysfunctional telomeres and other abnormal chromosomal structures that accumulate in hSNM1B-deficient cells prevent the development of viable mammals (36.Akhter S.

Indeed, a splice variant in hSNM1B that leads to production of a form of hSNM1B that is unable to interact with TRF2 leads to a form of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome where patients exhibit premature aging, bone marrow failure, and immunodeficiency (37.Touzot F.

Despite their importance in maintaining human genomic integrity, no detailed biochemical analysis of the human SNM1A and SNM1B factors has been carried out. Here we present a detailed characterization of the enzymatic properties of hSNM1A and hSNM1B/Apollo, identifying metal ion requirements, substrate preferences, and a striking, differential capacity for processing high molecular weight and damaged DNA. N-terminal-truncated hSNM1A (hSNM1A-(608–1040)) was purified as in a previous study (14.Wang A.T. Sengerová B. Cattell E. Inagawa T. Hartley J.M. Kiakos K. Burgess-Brown N.A. Swift L.P. Enzlin J.H.

Human SNM1A and XPF-ERCC1 collaborate to initiate DNA interstrand cross-link repair.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, hSNM1A-(608–1040) was purified from 24 liters of bacterial culture using expression from the pNH-TrxT plasmid containing an N-terminal His6 and thioredoxin TEV protease cleavable tag (accession number GU269914, (38.Savitsky P. Bray J. Cooper C.D. Marsden B.D. Mahajan P. Burgess-Brown N.A. Gileadi O. High throughput production of human proteins for crystallization. The SGC experience.J. Struct.

After cell lysis (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm TCEP, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) using a Emulsiflex-C5 cell breaker (Avestin) followed by sonication (2 × 15 min, 15 s on/15 s off) and centrifugation (38,000 × g, 1 h)), the lysate was separated using phosphocellulose P11 resin (Whatman), loaded at 150 mm NaCl, and eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 10% glycerol. The eluate was further purified on a His-Trap column (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm TCEP, elution gradient 10–300 mm imidazole) and in a S75 gel filtration step (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 5% glycerol). After removal of the tag with tobacco etch virus protease (1:20 ratio) at 4 °C overnight, the protein was rebound to a His-Trap column and eluted as above to remove cleaved tag followed by further purification using a heparin column (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 5% glycerol, elution gradient 150 mm-2 M NaCl) and an SP column (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 5% glycerol, elution gradient 50 mm 2 m NaCl). At each stage the presence of protein was confirmed on an InstantBlue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, and the identity of the final preparation was confirmed using electrospray ionization-TOF mass spectrometry or by tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. A truncated hSNM1B-(6–328) protein was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli. The protein was cloned into the expression vector pNIC-Zb, which uses a combination of a His10 sequence and the Z-basic tag (GenBankTM accession number GU452710) to promote solubility and efficient purification. The plasmid was introduced into BL21(DE3)-R3-pRARE2, the cells were grown in Terrific Broth (TB) medium containing kanamycin, and expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The proteins were extracted by sonication in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm TCEP) and loaded on a 5-ml HisTrap column at 4 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 volumes of wash buffer (20 m HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm TCEP) and eluted with Elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 300 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm TCEP). The eluted fraction was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S75 HR 16/60 column in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycine, 5% glycerol, 20 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm TCEP, at 1.2 ml/min. An inactive mutant version of hSNM1B-(6–328, D35A/H36A) in the vector pNIC-Zb was expressed and purified using an identical procedure. Antibodies used to confirm the identity of proteins were the anti-hSNM1A antibody from Abcam, Cambridge, UK (goat-polyclonal, catalogue number ab14805, used at 1:1000 dilution) and the anti-hSNM1B from Abgent Europe, Oxford, UK (rabbit-polyclonal, catalogue number ap5426c, used at 1:500 dilution). The substrates were constructed as shown in supplemental Table S1 using the sequences listed in supplemental Table S2. All oligonucleotides, including the fluorescein- and/or BHQ1-containing substrates were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). To make double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), RNA/DNA hybrids, or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and to ensure hairpin substrates were folded back, complementary strands were annealed by heating to 100 °C for 5 min followed by stepwise cooling to room temperature (20 °C). The methodology used to prepare and purify DNA oligonucleotide duplexes containing a single site-directed ICL has recently been published in detail (14.Wang A.T. Sengerová B. Cattell E. Inagawa T.

Measurement of DNA interstrand cross-linking in naked DNA using gel-based methods.Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 613: 283-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). If required, single-stranded DNA substrates were labeled at the 3′-end with [α-32P]dATP (1 μl; 0.37 MBq) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (20 units; Fermentas), and dsDNA substrates, after annealing where necessary, were labeled with [α-32P]dATP and Klenow fragment lacking 3′-exonuclease activity (5 units; New England Biolabs). Standard exonuclease assays were carried out in 10-μl reactions containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton-X, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, and the indicated amounts of enzyme. The reactions were started by the addition of substrate (amount indicated) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 2 μl of stop mixture (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and heating to 95 °C for 3 min. The samples were analyzed using denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer and 7 m urea. Gels were run at 525 V for 1.5 h. With radioactive substrate, gels were dried and exposed to a Kodak phosphorimaging screen and scanned using a Typhoon 9400 instrument (GE Healthcare); with fluorescently labeled substrates, gels were imaged using the fluorescence mode of the Typhoon 9400 instrument, with blue laser (488 nm) excitation and an emission filter set to 520 nm band-pass 40 (detecting light between 500–540 nm). Metal ion dependence experiments were carried out in buffer containing 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 mm MgCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2, or CaCl2 instead of the 10 mm MgCl2 of the standard reactions, keeping ionic strength constant by varying potassium chloride concentration. The substrate concentration chosen for comparing metal ion dependence of the two enzymes was 1000 nm, which exceeds the Km (10-fold) for the hSNM1A-catalyzed hydrolysis (see Fig. 3A). It is worth noting that at this substrate concentration the hSNM1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of dsDNA is not maximal, but an equivalent level of substrate was used for comparison purposes after a normalization experiment was carried out to determine the amounts of hSNM1A and hSNM1B that would result in an approximately equivalent level of hydrolysis (supplemental Fig. S2A). The chelator experiments were carried out as in the standard assay but supplemented with 0.1, 1, 5, 10, or 25 mm o-phenanthroline, EGTA, or EDTA. Oligonucleotide competition experiments were carried out in 10-μl reactions as for the standard assay, with three reactions started concurrently by the addition of dsDNA or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate (1000 nm). Reaction 1 was stopped after 5 min by the addition of stop mixture and boiling, reaction 2 was supplemented with an excess (16.67 μm) of unlabeled substrate and subsequently stopped at 60 min, and reaction 3 was stopped at 60 min, with all samples analyzed as described above. Plasmid digestion experiments were carried out in two stages. First, plasmid (325 ng, supplemental Fig. S7C) was either left untreated, gapped (nicked at five sites within a 52 base pair region) with Nb.BbvCI (5 units; New England Biolabs), or linearized with HindIII (10 units; New England Biolabs) in 10 μl for 90 min at 37 °C in 1× New England Biolabs reaction buffer 2. Second, reaction buffer (final composition 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol) and, in competition experiments unlabeled 21-mer dsDNA, were added and hSNM1A or hSNM1B were allowed to digest the plasmid for 1 h. Products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels containing 1× Tris borate EDTA (130 V, 150 min). Reactions were carried out with varying concentrations of substrate and enzyme in the reaction buffer as described above. Reactions, prewarmed to 37 °C, were initiated by the addition of radiolabeled substrate, sampled at 4 appropriate time intervals, and quenched with stop mixture. The amount of product was determined after gels were dried and scanned by quantification using the ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) software package. The gels were quantified, and the products were analyzed assuming that the product of length n − 1 (where substrate is n nucleotides long) is the result of one hydrolysis reaction cycle, the product of length n − 2 is the result of two hydrolysis cycles, and the product of length n − m is the result of m hydrolysis (40.Cheng C.H.

The substrate concentrations were chosen to range from Km/8 to 8-fold Km where possible, and the enzyme concentrations were adjusted appropriately to measure a linear part of the initial reaction rate. The final substrate concentrations ranged from 10 to 1,200 and from 1.25 to 1,200 nm to analyze hSNM1A hydrolysis of ds- and ssDNA, respectively, and from 10–12,000 nm and from 1.25–18,000 nm to analyze hSNM1B hydrolysis of ds and ssDNA. Enzyme concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 4.1 nm (hSNM1A on dsDNA and ssDNA), 6 to 88 nm (hSNM1B on dsDNA), and 6 to 131 nm (hSNM1B on ssDNA). Initial rates of reaction at the range of substrate concentrations, normalized to enzyme concentration, were determined, and kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1),v[E]=kcat[S](KM+[S])(Eq. 1) Curve-fitting was performed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software). All measurements were carried out in 96-well plates using a SpectraMax M2e fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices) in fluorescence top read mode using SoftMaxPro software (Molecular Devices) to control the settings. Emission spectra were measured with 6 readings taken from 500 to 600 nm (2 nm steps) with excitation set to 495 nm and cutoff at 515 nm. Time courses were measured, with 6 readings taken at 7-s intervals for 12 min, with excitation at 495 nm, emission at 525 nm, and cutoff set to 515 nm. Reactions were carried out with 1000 nm dsDNA substrate when hydrolysis of dsDNA by hSNM1A WT reached saturation (see Fig. 3A) and when initial rate could be reasonably assumed to be an estimate of the kcat of the reaction.

Twenty two subjects from a four-generation Chinese family with RP and thin cornea, congenital cataract and high myopia is reported in this study. All family members underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations. Patients of the family presented with bone spicule-shaped pigment deposits in retina, retinal vascular attenuation, retinal and choroidal dystrophy, as well as punctate opacity of the lens, reduced cornea thickness and high myopia. Peripheral venous blood was obtained from all patients and their family members for genetic analysis. After mutation analysis in a few known RP candidate genes, exome sequencing was used to analyze the exomes of 3 patients III2, III4, III6 and the unaffected mother II2. A total of 34,693 variations shared by 3 patients were subjected to several filtering steps against existing variation databases. Identified variations were verified in the rest family members by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Compound heterozygous c.802-8_810del17insGC and c.1091-2A>G mutations of the CYP4V2 gene, known as genetic defects for Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy, were identified as causative mutations for RP of this family."
https://openalex.org/W2010295998,"The outermost positions of mammalian cell-surface glycans are predominantly occupied by the sialic acids N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). To date, hydroxylation of CMP-Neu5Ac resulting in the conversion into CMP-Neu5Gc is the only known enzymatic reaction in mammals to synthesize a monosaccharide carrying an N-glycolyl group. In our accompanying paper (Bergfeld, A. K., Pearce, O. M., Diaz, S. L., Pham, T., and Varki, A. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287, jbc.M112.363549), we report a metabolic pathway for degradation of Neu5Gc, demonstrating that N-acetylhexosamine pathways are tolerant toward the N-glycolyl substituent of Neu5Gc breakdown products. In this study, we show that exogenously added N-glycolylgalactosamine (GalNGc) serves as a precursor for Neu5Gc de novo biosynthesis, potentially involving seven distinct mammalian enzymes. Following the GalNAc salvage pathway, UDP-GalNGc is epimerized to UDP-GlcNGc, which might compete with the endogenous UDP-GlcNAc for the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway. Using UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase-deficient cells, we confirm that conversion of GalNGc into Neu5Gc depends on this key enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate by mass spectrometry that the metabolic intermediates UDP-GalNGc and UDP-GlcNGc serve as substrates for assembly of most major classes of cellular glycans. We show for the first time incorporation of GalNGc and GlcNGc into chondroitin/dermatan sulfates and heparan sulfates, respectively. As demonstrated by structural analysis, N-glycolylated hexosamines were found in cellular gangliosides and incorporated into Chinese hamster ovary cell O-glycans. Remarkably, GalNAc derivatives altered the overall O-glycosylation pattern as indicated by the occurrence of novel O-glycan structures. This study demonstrates that mammalian N-acetylhexosamine pathways and glycan assembly are surprisingly tolerant toward the N-glycolyl substituent."
https://openalex.org/W1972292569,"One of the most important faculties of humans is to understand the behaviour of other conspecifics. The present study aimed at determining whether, in a social context, request gesture and gaze direction of an individual are enough to infer his/her intention to communicate, by searching for their effects on the kinematics of another individual's arm action. In four experiments participants reached, grasped and lifted a bottle filled of orange juice in presence of an empty glass. In experiment 1, the further presence of a conspecific not producing any request with a hand and gaze did not modify the kinematics of the sequence. Conversely, experiments 2 and 3 showed that the presence of a conspecific producing only a request of pouring by holding the glass with his/her right hand, or only a request of comunicating with the conspecific, by using his/her gaze, affected lifting and grasping of the sequence, respectively. Experiment 4 showed that hand gesture and eye contact simultaneously produced affected the entire sequence. The results suggest that the presence of both request gesture and direct gaze produced by an individual changes the control of a motor sequence executed by another individual. We propose that a social request activates a social affordance that interferes with the control of whatever sequence and that the gaze of the potential receiver who held the glass with her hand modulates the effectiveness of the manual gesture. This paradigm if applied to individuals affected by autism disorder can give new insight on the nature of their impairment in social interaction and communication."
https://openalex.org/W1995571036,"Chk1 plays a key role in regulating the replication checkpoint and DNA damage response. Recent evidence suggests that mammalian Chk1 regulates both the nuclear and cytoplasmic checkpoint events. However, mechanisms regulating cellular mobilization of Chk1 were not well understood. Here, we report the identification of regions of human Chk1 that regulate its protein cellular localization and checkpoint function. We demonstrate that the two highly conserved motifs (CM1 and CM2) at the C terminus of Chk1 function as a nuclear export signal and nuclear localization signal, respectively. Mutating five highly conserved residues within these two motifs of Chk1 resulted in its accumulation mainly in the cytoplasm. These cytoplasmic Chk1 mutants were less stable and exhibited significantly reduced phosphorylation by DNA damage treatment, yet they retained, at least partially, checkpoint function. Using an adenovirus-mediated gene targeting technique, we attempted to create an HCT116 cell line in which endogenous Chk1 is mutated so that it is expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm. However, we failed to obtain homozygous mutant cell lines. We found that even the heterozygous mutant cell lines showed cell survival defects accompanied by spontaneous cell death. Together, these results reveal novel regulatory mechanisms that couple protein cellular localization with the checkpoint response and cell viability of Chk1."
https://openalex.org/W2125742849,"A series of pseudo-peptides with general formula X-l-Glu-NH(2) (with X corresponding to an acyl moiety with a long aryl-alkyl side chain) have been synthesized, evaluated as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), and found to display remarkable nanomolar affinity. The loss in potency associated with a substitution of the P(2)' l-glutamate by a l-glutamine corroborates the importance of a carboxylate at this position. The binding mode of some of these inhibitors was characterized in solution and by x-ray crystallography in complex with various MMPs. The x-ray crystal structures reveal an unusual binding mode with the glutamate side chain chelating the active site zinc ion. Competition experiments between these inhibitors and acetohydroxamic acid, a small zinc-binding molecule, are in accord with the crystallographic results. One of these pseudo-dipeptides displays potency and selectivity toward MMP-12 similar to the best MMP-12 inhibitors reported to date. This novel family of pseudo peptides opens new opportunities to develop potent and selective inhibitors for several metzincins."
https://openalex.org/W2041397952,"Abnormal inflammations are central therapeutic targets in numerous infectious and autoimmune diseases. Dendritic cells (DCs) are involved in these inflammations, serving as both antigen presenters and proinflammatory cytokine providers. As an immuno-suppressor applied to the therapies of multiple sclerosis and allograft transplantation, fingolimod (FTY720) was shown to affect DC migration and its crosstalk with T cells. We posit FTY720 can induce an anergy-polarized phenotype switch on DCs in vitro, especially upon endotoxic activation. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (BMDC) activation model was employed to test FTY720-induced phenotypic changes on immature and mature DCs. Specifically, methods for morphology, nanostructure, cytokine production, phagocytosis, endocytosis and specific antigen presentation studies were used. FTY720 induced significant alterations of surface markers, as well as decline of shape indices, cell volume, surface roughness in LPS-activated mature BMDCs. These phenotypic, morphological and topographical changes were accompanied by FTY720-mediated down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12 and MCP-1. Together with suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production and CCR7 transcription in FTY720-treated BMDCs with or without LPS activation, an inhibitory mechanism of NO and cytokine reciprocal activation was suggested. This implication was supported by the impaired phagocytotic, endocytotic and specific antigen presentation abilities observed in the FTY720-treated BMDCs. In conclusion, we demonstrated FTY720 can induce anergy-polarization in both immature and LPS-activated mature BMDCs. A possible mechanism is FTY720-mediated reciprocal suppression on the intrinsic activation pathway and cytokine production with endpoint exhibitions on phagocytosis, endocytosis, antigen presentation as well as cellular morphology and topography."

https://openalex.org/W1984250382,"Although the activation of the A(1)-subtype of the adenosine receptors (A(1)AR) is arrhythmogenic in the developing heart, little is known about the underlying downstream mechanisms. The aim of this study was to determine to what extent the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel 3, functioning as receptor-operated channel (ROC), contributes to the A(1)AR-induced conduction disturbances. Using embryonic atrial and ventricular myocytes obtained from 4-day-old chick embryos, we found that the specific activation of A(1)AR by CCPA induced sarcolemmal Ca(2+) entry. However, A(1)AR stimulation did not induce Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Specific blockade of TRPC3 activity by Pyr3, by a dominant negative of TRPC3 construct, or inhibition of phospholipase Cs and PKCs strongly inhibited the A(1)AR-enhanced Ca(2+) entry. Ca(2+) entry through TRPC3 was activated by the 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) analog OAG via PKC-independent and -dependent mechanisms in atrial and ventricular myocytes, respectively. In parallel, inhibition of the atypical PKCζ by myristoylated PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor significantly decreased the A(1)AR-enhanced Ca(2+) entry in both types of myocytes. Additionally, electrocardiography showed that inhibition of TRPC3 channel suppressed transient A(1)AR-induced conduction disturbances in the embryonic heart. Our data showing that A(1)AR activation subtly mediates a proarrhythmic Ca(2+) entry through TRPC3-encoded ROC by stimulating the phospholipase C/DAG/PKC cascade provide evidence for a novel pathway whereby Ca(2+) entry and cardiac function are altered. Thus, the A(1)AR-TRPC3 axis may represent a potential therapeutic target."

Cutting edge: the membrane attack complex of complement is required for the development of murine experimental cerebral malaria.J. Immun. 2011; 186: 6657-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine which complement activation pathway (classical or alternative) leads to C5 activation in ECM, we followed the course of disease in C4−/− (11Wessels M.R. Butko P. Ma M. Warren H.B. Lage A.L. Carroll M.C. Studies of group B streptococcal infection in mice deficient in complement component C3 or C4 demonstrate an essential role for complement in both innate and acquired immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 11490-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and factor B−/− mice (12Matsumoto M. Fukuda W. Circolo A. Goellner J. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Wang X. Fujita S. Hidvegi T. Chaplin D.D. Colten H.R. Abrogation of the alternative complement pathway by targeted deletion of murine factor B.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8720-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We found that both complement mutant mice were fully susceptible to ECM; however, factor B−/− mice progressed to fatal ECM a day earlier than wild type mice (Fig. 1, A and B). The trend toward more severe disease in factor B−/− mice supports a protective role for complement as expected in most infectious disease settings. These results demonstrate that C5 activation in ECM occurs independent of the classical and alternative pathways and raised questions regarding the role of C5 convertases in ECM development. To assess this latter possibility, we performed ECM using C3−/− mice (13Circolo A. Garnier G. Fukuda W. Wang X. Hidvegi T. Szalai A.J. Briles D.E. Volanakis J.E. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. Genetic disruption of the murine complement C3 promoter region generates deficient mice with extrahepatic expression of C3 mRNA.Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Survival of C3−/− mice was greater than wild type mice (7/19 versus 0/18); however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.21, log rank test, Fig. 1C). Clinical scores were very similar between the two groups of mice throughout the course of disease but were significantly lower in C3−/− mice from day 7.5 onward (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fig. 1D). Wild type and C3−/− mice had similar levels of parasitemia, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and CNS infiltration of CD8+ T cells at the peak of disease (Fig. 1, E–G). Thus, despite a modest increase in survival, ECM is markedly more severe in C3−/− mice as compared with C5−/− mice (6Ramos T.N. Darley M.M. Hu X. Billker O. Rayner J.C. Ahras M. Wohler J.E. Barnum S.R. Cutting edge: the membrane attack complex of complement is required for the development of murine experimental cerebral malaria.J. Immun. 2011; 186: 6657-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and very similar to the disease course seen in wild type mice. These data suggest that C5 cleavage is occurring in C3−/− mice in the absence of C5 convertases leading to MAC-mediated immunopathology. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that inhibition of MAC formation through treatment with anti-C9 antibody reduces mortality and disease severity in wild type mice with ECM (6Ramos T.N. Darley M.M. Hu X. Billker O. Rayner J.C. Ahras M. Wohler J.E. Barnum S.R. Cutting edge: the membrane attack complex of complement is required for the development of murine experimental cerebral malaria.J. Immun. 2011; 186: 6657-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on this, we reasoned that if C5 was cleaved in C3−/− mice with ECM, then a similar anti-C9 antibody treatment regimen would also provide C3−/− mice with protection from disease. Indeed we found that treatment of C3−/− mice with anti-C9 antibody significantly reduced mortality (p = 0.014, log rank test) and improved clinical scores (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test) as compared with isotype control IgG-treated wild type mice (Fig. 2, A and B). To directly determine whether C5 is cleaved in ECM, we examined for the presence of C5a in serum of wild type and C3−/− mice at the peak of disease. We found that serum C5a levels in C3−/− mice were elevated, although not significantly, as compared with wild type mice (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that despite the absence of C5 convertases, C5 was cleaved and the MAC contributed to the progression and development of ECM in C3−/− mice comparable with that seen in wild type mice. We extended these observations by treating wild type mice with the complement inhibitor CR2-Crry, a chimeric recombinant protein that blocks the activity of both the C3 and the C5 convertases (18Atkinson C. Song H. Lu B. Qiao F. Burns T.A. Holers V.M. Tsokos G.C. Tomlinson S. Targeted complement inhibition by C3d recognition ameliorates tissue injury without apparent increase in susceptibility to infection.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2444-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that CR2-Crry is efficacious in reducing inflammation and cellular damage in a rodent model of spinal cord injury and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the animal model of multiple sclerosis (22Qiao F. Atkinson C. Song H. Pannu R. Singh I. Tomlinson S. Complement plays an important role in spinal cord injury and represents a therapeutic target for improving recovery following trauma.Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1039-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 3X. Hu, S. Tomlinson, and S. R. Barnum, manuscript in preparation. Wild type mice treated with CR2-Crry had an identical course of ECM as compared with PBS-treated controls (Fig. 2D). In addition, we performed ECM using sCrry/GFAP mice, which produce a CNS-specific, soluble form of the mouse complement convertase inhibitor Crry under the control of an astrocyte promoter (14Davoust N. Nataf S. Reiman R. Holers M.V. Campbell I.L. Barnum S.R. Central nervous system-targeted expression of the complement inhibitor sCrry prevents experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6551-6556PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble Crry production in these transgenic mice has been shown to be protective in numerous CNS disease settings (23Read R.W. Szalai A.J. Vogt S.D. McGwin G. Barnum S.R. Genetic deficiency of C3 as well as CNS-targeted expression of the complement inhibitor sCrry ameliorates experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis.Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 82: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Barnum S.R. Szalai A.J. Complement and demyelinating disease: no MAC needed?.Brain Res.

Immunol. 2006; 2: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). sCrry/GFAP mice succumbed to ECM identically to wild type mice (Fig. 2E). Together these data demonstrate that blocking C3 and C5 convertase activity, either in the cerebral vasculature or in the brain parenchyma, does not prevent disease development and provides additional experimental evidence for C5 convertase-independent activation of C5 in ECM. The host defense mechanisms of the complement system make an as yet undefined contribution to protection against P. falciparum infection. It is well established from numerous animal and clinical studies that complement is activated through the classical and alternative pathways during malaria infection (4Silver K.L. Higgins S.J. McDonald C.R. Kain K.C. Complement-driven innate immune response to malaria: fuelling severe malarial diseases.Cell Microbiol. 2010; 12: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, the parasite-specific molecule or molecules that activate complement remain poorly defined with the exception of the digestive vacuole released on rupture of parasitized erythrocytes (26Dasari P. Heber S.D. Beisele M. Torzewski M. Reifenberg K. Orning C. Fries A. Zapf A.L. Baumeister S. Lingelbach K. Udomsangpetch R. Bhakdi S.C. Reiss K. Bhakdi S. Digestive vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum released during erythrocyte rupture dually activates complement and coagulation.Blood. 2012; 119: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Intracellular sequestration of the malaria parasite throughout the majority of its life cycle severely limits the opportunity for complement-mediated opsonization and/or lysis. In contrast, recent studies demonstrating that C5-deficient mice are resistant to ECM suggest that the complement system contributes to, rather than protects against, malarial pathogenesis (5Patel S.N. Berghout J. Lovegrove F.E. Ayi K. Conroy A. Serghides L. Min-oo G. Gowda D.C. Sarma J.V. Rittirsch D. Ward P.A. Liles W.C. Gros P. Kain K.C.

Immun. 2011; 186: 6657-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The results we report here support and extend these observations and show that ECM develops in the absence of the early complement activation pathways and the canonical C5 convertases. There is ample evidence showing activation of the classical and alternative pathways in malaria infection in humans and primate and rodent models of malaria (4Silver K.L. Higgins S.J. McDonald C.R.

Complement-mediated killing of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic schizont with antibodies to the recombinant serine repeat antigen (SERA).Vaccine. 1998; 16: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In early animal model studies, depletion of complement in rats by cobra venom factor (CVF), which rapidly activates the alternative pathway, led to exacerbated disease, suggesting that complement may play a protective role in malaria infections (29Ward P.A. Sterzel R.B. Lucia H.L. Campbell G.H. Jack R.M. Complement does not facilitate plasmodial infections.J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1826-1828PubMed Google Scholar). This observation supports our findings with C4−/− and factor B−/− mice; however, the data need to be interpreted with caution as it is unclear whether the reported increased mortality in CVF-treated rats in that study was due to higher parasitemia alone or to CVF-mediated inflammation combined with elevated parasitemia. Our results do not suggest that activation of complement through either pathway is irrelevant to the disease outcome, but simply that neither pathway is critical for the development of ECM, and therefore these pathways do not represent likely therapeutic targets for modulating the outcome of malaria infection. The most intriguing finding we report here is the development of severe ECM in C3−/− mice. In the absence of C3, the C5 convertases (C4b2a3b for the classical pathway and C3bnBb for the alternative pathway) cannot be formed. Therefore if C5 is required for susceptibility to ECM, an alternative mechanism for C5 cleavage is required. Studies published almost three decades ago by Wetsel and Kolb (7Wetsel R.A. Kolb W.P. Expression of C5a-like biological activities by the fifth component of human complement (C5) upon limited digestion with noncomplement enzymes without release of polypeptide fragments.J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 2029-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cleavage of C5 by trypsin, plasmin, thrombin, and elastase generated C5a-like fragments and that these fragments activated neutrophils and were chemotactic. Recent studies have confirmed and extended these initial observations and shown that coagulation enzymes including factors Xa, IXa, and XIa can cleave both C3 and C5 to generate C3a and C5a (8Huber-Lang M. Sarma J.V. Zetoune F.S. Rittirsch D. Neff T.A. McGuire S.R. Lambris J.D. Warner R.L. Flierl M.A. Hoesel L.M. Gebhard F. Younger J.G. Drouin S.M. Wetsel R.A. Ward P.A. Generation of C5a in the absence of C3: a new complement activation pathway.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of factor Xa to serum generates the MAC, indicating that cleavage by what is now termed the extrinsic protease pathway provides a mechanism for activation of the terminal complement pathway in the absence of C5 convertases (10Amara U. Flierl M.A. Rittirsch D. Klos A. Chen H. Acker B. Brückner U.B. Nilsson B. Gebhard F. Lambris J.D. Huber-Lang M. Molecular intercommunication between the complement and coagulation systems.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 5628-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Our data showing C5a production in C3−/− mice during ECM suggest utilization of this mechanism. Given that the coagulation system is activated during malaria infection (reviewed in Refs. 33Ghosh K. Shetty S. Blood coagulation in falciparum malaria: a review.Parasitol. Res. 2008; 102: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 34Moxon C.A. Heyderman R.S. Wassmer S.C. Dysregulation of coagulation in cerebral malaria.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 166: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that plasminogen can be activated on binding to C7 (35Reinartz J. Hänsch G.M. Kramer M.D. Complement component C7 is a plasminogen-binding protein.J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 844-850PubMed Google Scholar) and the MAC (36Christiansen V.J. Sims P.J. Hamilton K.K. Complement C5b-9 increases plasminogen binding and activation on human endothelial cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it seems possible that a self-amplifying inflammatory complement/coagulation-based cascade contributes to cerebral malaria. These data support our previously published observations indicating that the complement terminal pathway is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of ECM (6Ramos T.N. Darley M.M. Hu X. Billker O. Rayner J.C. Ahras M. Wohler J.E. Barnum S.R. Cutting edge: the membrane attack complex of complement is required for the development of murine experimental cerebral malaria.J. Immun. 2011; 186: 6657-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that selective pressure on terminal pathway genes (C6 through C9) could be a mechanism for surviving malaria and/or cerebral malaria. C6 and C9 deficiencies are common in humans (37Skattum L. van Deuren M. van der Poll T. Truedsson L. Complement deficiency states and associated infections.Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 1643-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but C6 deficiency is highly prevalent in African Americans in the southeastern United States, with a frequency of almost 1 in 1600 (38Zhu Z. Atkinson T.P. Hovanky K.T. Boppana S.B. Dai Y.L. Densen P. Go R.C. Jablecki J.S. Volanakis J.E. High prevalence of complement component C6 deficiency among African Americans in the southeastern USA.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These individuals likely originated in West Africa and moved through the Caribbean and then into the southeastern United States (39Hobart M.J. Fernie B.A. Fijen K.A. Orren A. The molecular basis of C6 deficiency in the western Cape, South Africa.Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) based on the tracking of two loss-of-function mutations in C6. Individuals deficient in terminal pathway components are susceptible to meningococcal infections (37Skattum L. van Deuren M. van der Poll T. Truedsson L.

However, selective pressure in the face of malaria infection frequently maintains genetic mutations that can be life threatening (sickle cell anemia (41Malowany J.I. Butany J. Pathology of sickle cell disease.Semin. Diagn. Pathol. 2012; 29: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) or are associated with autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus (42Waisberg M. Tarasenko T. Vickers B.K. Scott B.L.

https://openalex.org/W1971662876,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential component for DNA synthesis upon growth stimulation. It has been shown that phosphorylation of PCNA at Tyr-211 by the EGF receptor (EGFR) protects PCNA from polyubiquitylation and degradation, whereas blocking phosphorylation induces ubiquitylation-mediated degradation of the chromatin-bound, but not the -unbound, PCNA, and suppresses cell proliferation. However, the ubiquitin E3 ligase linking growth signaling to the proteolysis of PCNA and the underlying regulatory mechanism remain to be identified. Here we show that, in the absence of Tyr-211 phosphorylation, PCNA is subject to polyubiquitylation at Lys-164 by the CUL4A E3 ligase, resulting in the degradation of PCNA. Mutation of Lys-164 to arginine prevents PCNA ubiquitylation and rescues the degradation of the K164R/Y211F PCNA double mutant. Activation of EGFR inhibits the interaction of PCNA with CUL4A, whereas inhibition of EGFR leads to increased CUL4A-PCNA interaction and CUL4A-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PCNA. Substitution of endogenous PCNA with the Y211F mutant PCNA conveys enhanced sensitization to EGFR inhibition. Our findings identify CUL4A as the ubiquitin ligase linking the down-regulation of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase to the nuclear DNA replication machinery in cancer cells."

Significance: Dalbergieae lectins are of interest for biotechnological applications. Legume lectins compose a large family of homologous carbohydrate-binding proteins that are found primarily in the seeds of legume plants. Despite similarities in their physicochemical properties and their relatively conserved primary sequences, Leguminosae lectins display considerable diversity in their carbohydrate binding specificities, not only in terms of the recognition of monosaccharides but also in terms of differential binding to complex carbohydrates (1.Sharon N. Lis H. Legume lectins. a large family of homologous proteins.FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Legume lectins are central to the study of the molecular basis and specificity of protein-carbohydrate interactions (2.Sharon N. Lis H. Lectins. Proteins with a sweet tooth. Functions in cell recognition.Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 59-75PubMed Google Scholar), and they also have technological implications for the understanding of cell-cell recognition, adhesion, tumor spread, bacterial and viral infection, and inflammation (3.Rüdiger H. Siebert H.C. Solís D. Jiménez-Barbero J. Romero A. von der Lieth C.W. Diaz-Mariño T. Gabius H.J. Medicinal chemistry based on the sugar code. Fundamentals of lectinology and experimental strategies with lectins as targets.Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 389-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the function of plant lectins remains elusive (4.Rüdiger H. Plant lectins. More than just tools for glycoscientists. Occurrence, structure, and possible functions of plant lectins.Acta Anat. 1998; 161: 130-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although they are generally proposed to play a role in defense mechanisms against pathogens and invertebrate or vertebrate predators (5.Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J. Lectins as plant defense proteins.Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) or in the establishment of symbiosis (6.Hirsch A.M. Role of lectins (and rhizobial exopolysaccharides) in legume nodulation.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action still remains unclear even though induced response mechanisms are proposed for many pathogen-mediated injuries in plants. The direct interference with viruses and microorganisms is rather exceptional, but the deleterious effects of plant lectins on both predatory invertebrates and animals are well documented (5.Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J. Lectins as plant defense proteins.Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The existence of hydrophobic sites within the structure of leguminous lectins, which bind phytohormones, suggests a possible role in certain aspects of hormonally regulated plant growth and development (7.Delatorre P. Rocha B.A. Souza E.P. Oliveira T.M. Bezerra G.A. Moreno F.B. Freitas B.T. Santi-Gadelha T. Sampaio A.H. Azevedo Jr., W.F. Cavada B.S. Structure of a lectin from Canavalia gladiata seeds. New structural insights for old molecules.BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Leguminous plant lectins, although differing in carbohydrate-binding specificity, have similar amino acid sequences (1.Sharon N. Lis H. Legume lectins. a large family of homologous proteins.FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and similar fold at the monomer level (8.Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Legume lectin structure.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The architecture of the so-called “legume lectin fold” is structurally related to a jelly roll motif characterized by a β-sandwich of 25–30 kDa that contains a carbohydrate-combining site, a tightly bound Ca2+, and a transition metal ion, usually Mn2+. Variability occurs both at the level of the quaternary fold, with a variety of dimeric and tetrameric arrangement (9.Srinivas V.R. Reddy G.B. Ahmad N. Swaminathan C.P. Mitra N. Surolia A. Legume lectin family, the “natural mutants of the quaternary state,” provide insights into the relationship between protein stability and oligomerization.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1527: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and at the level of the binding site. The floor of the binding site consists of few conserved key amino acids, but its perimeter depends on five loops with very variable size and sequence that control the carbohydrate specificity (8.Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Legume lectin structure.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 10.Sharma V. Surolia A.

Lectins isolated from legume seeds have been regarded as a paradigm for investigating the structural basis and thermodynamics of selective sugar recognition (12.Ambrosi M. Cameron N.R. Davis B.G.

The interaction between legume lectin and carbohydrate is generally characterized by a low affinity for monosaccharides (mm range). Longer oligosaccharides exhibit micromolar affinity, generally by generating a multivalent effect either by binding several sites of a multivalent lectin or by cross-linked neighboring lectins in solution (14.Dam T.K.

The large majority of leguminous lectins have been isolated and characterized from plants belonging to the Phaseoleae and Vicieae tribes of the Papilionoideae subfamily of Leguminosae (16.Cavada B.S. Moreira R.A. Oliveira J.T. Grangeiro T.B. Primary structures and functions of plant lectins.R. Bras. Fisol. Veg. 1993; 5: 193-201Google Scholar). In this context, it would be of interest to characterize the structure and fine specificity of other lectins in different tribes to extend our knowledge on protein-carbohydrate interactions. The Dalbergieae tribe is of particular interest because only one lectin has been structurally characterized, i.e. the agglutinin from Pterocarpus angolensis seed (PAL). 4The abbreviations used are: PALP. angolensis lectinConAconcanavalin ADGLD. grandiflora lectinITCisothermal titration calorimetryLacNAcN-acetyl-lactosaminePELaP. elegans lectin APSLP. sativum lectinTriMantrimannose αMan1–3(αMan1–6)ManRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycineFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl . Crystallography and thermodynamic studies demonstrated high affinity for both oligomannose N-glycans and for biantennary complex type, correlated with the presence of an unusually extended binding region close to the primary binding site (17.Buts L.

In this study, we characterize the lectin from Platypodium elegans Vogel, another member of the Dalbergieae tribe. The genus Platypodium comprises two species of leguminous trees. P. elegans Vogel is a natural species found in the Brazil cerrado and in transition areas between cerrado and seasonal forest (21.Lorenzi H. Árvores Brasileiras: Manual de Identificação e Cultivo de Plantas Arbóreas Nativas do Brasil. Plantarum, Nova Odessa, Brazil1998Google Scholar). We demonstrate here the presence of a mannose/glucose lectin (PELa) in P. elegans seeds. The cloning of the gene has been performed, resulting in the amino acid sequence determination of PELa. From the recombinant lectin, a complete study of the structure-specificity relationship has been performed, and we describe here the molecular basis of the unusual affinity of PELa for the asymmetric complex N-glycans. P. elegans seeds were purchased from Reserva de Reflorestamento Flora Tietê (São Paulo, Brazil) and were stored at room temperature or at −70 °C. Monosaccharides, disaccharides, sulfated polysaccharides (Fucoidan, Carrageenan), and glycoprotein (pork stomach mucin) were purchased from Sigma. Nonasaccharide-Asn 1 was prepared from egg yolk by enzymatic hydrolysis of its disialylated derivative (22.Kajihara Y. Suzuki Y. Yamamoto N. Sasaki K. Sakakibara T. Juneja L.R. Prompt chemoenzymatic synthesis of diverse complex-type oligosaccharides and its application to the solid-phase synthesis of a glycopeptide with Asn-linked sialyl-undeca- and asialo-nonasaccharides.Chemistry. 2004; 10: 971-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 10.0 mg (5.7 μmol) of nonasaccharide-Asn 1 were dissolved in 450 μl of phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6.8, 30 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). To the solution were added 50 μl of buffered BSA (10 mg BSA/ml, 20 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7). To this mixture 1 unit of lyophilized β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) was added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 days (TLC: 2-propanol, 1 m ammonium acetate, 1.5:1). After lyophilization, the residue was dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1 m NH4HCO3 and purified by gel filtration (Superdex 30, 1.6 × 60 cm, 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 1 ml min−1). The peak eluting at 80 min was lyophilized and desalted by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25, 2.5 × 70 cm, 5% ethanol in water, 0.5 ml min−1). The peak eluting at 427 min was lyophilized yielding 5.2 mg of heptasaccharide-Asn H (64.1%). The purity was confirmed by 360 MHz 1H NMR in D2O. The Fmoc-protected octasaccharide-Asn 2 was isolated by HPLC according to Kajihara (22.Kajihara Y. Suzuki Y. Yamamoto N. Sasaki K. Sakakibara T. Juneja L.R. Prompt chemoenzymatic synthesis of diverse complex-type oligosaccharides and its application to the solid-phase synthesis of a glycopeptide with Asn-linked sialyl-undeca- and asialo-nonasaccharides.Chemistry. 2004; 10: 971-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 15.0 mg (8.3 μmol) of Fmoc-Asn(octasaccharide) 2 were dissolved in 320 μl of HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0, 0.1 mg ml−1 BSA). 17 μl (0.9 units) of a suspension of jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase in 2.5 m (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.0, were dissolved in HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0, 0.1 mg ml−1 BSA). The solutions of oligosaccharide 2 and the enzyme were combined, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. After completion (LC-MS, C18, 20–35% MeCN (0.1% HCOOH)) the reaction was lyophilized. The residue was dissolved in 1 ml of 10% MeCN (0.1% HCOOH) and purified by RP-HPLC (NUCLEOGEL RP 100–10 (2.5 × 30 cm), 20–35% MeCN, 10 ml min−1) The peak eluting at 29.3 min was lyophilized to yield 10.3 mg of Fmoc-Asn(heptasaccharide) 3 (77.3%). The purity was confirmed by LC-MS (C18, 20–35% MeCN (0.1% HCOOH)). 9.0 mg (5.6 μmol) of Fmoc-Asn(heptasaccharide) 3 were dissolved in a mixture of water, methanol, and acetonitrile (10:3:5). Subsequently, 89 μl (44.5 μmol) of sodium hydroxide (0.5 m) were added, and the solution was stirred for 3 h at ambient temperature. After completion (TLC: 2-propanol, 1 m ammonium acetate, 1.5:1), 850 μl of ammonium bicarbonate (0.1 m) were added, and the mixture was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 30, 1.6 × 60 cm, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, 0.75 ml/min). The peak eluting at 108.2 min was lyophilized and desalted by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25 (2.5 × 71 cm), 5% ethanol in water, 0.5 ml min−1). The fractions eluting at 422 min were lyophilized. Yield was 7.1 mg of E (5.1 μmol, 91.4%); Rf (E) = 0.31 (2-propanol, 1 m ammonium acetate, 1.5:1); [α]d23 = +1.0 (0.1, water); C52H87N5O38 (1390.26), ESI-MS negative mode: Mcalc = 1389.50; Mfound = 1387.92 (M-H)−. The purity was confirmed by 360-MHz 1H NMR in D2O. 11.0 mg (7.7 μmol) of heptasaccharide-Asn H were dissolved in 380 μl of HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0, 0.4 mg ml−1 BSA). 15.2 μl (0.81 units) of a suspension of jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) in 2.5 m (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.0, were dissolved in 50 μl of HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0, 0.4 mg ml−1 BSA). The solution of oligosaccharide H was added to the buffered enzyme, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 days. After completion (ESI-MS), the reaction was lyophilized. The residue was dissolved in 0.3 ml of 0.1 m NH4HCO3 and purified by gel filtration (Superdex 30 (2.6 × 60 cm), 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 1.5 ml min−1). The peak eluting at 149 min was lyophilized and desalted by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25 (2.5 × 71 cm), 5% ethanol in water, 0.5 ml min−1). The elution at 451 min was lyophilized to yield 3.7 mg of pentasaccharide-Asn C (46.8%). The purity was checked by 360 MHz 1H NMR in D2O. The seeds were ground and later defatted in the presence of n-hexane. A protein extract was prepared from 1 g of the ground seeds with 10 ml of 0.15 m NaCl at room temperature for 3 h. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the precipitate was discarded. The hemagglutinating activity of the lectin was determined by a 2-fold serial dilution procedure using native rabbit or human erythrocytes as described previously (23.Moreira A. Perrone J.C. Purification and partial characterization of a lectin from Phaseolus vulgaris.Plant Physiol. 1977; 59: 783-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hemagglutination titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution exhibiting observable hemagglutination. Inhibition of agglutination by sugar was assayed by serially diluting the solution of sugar in the microtiter plate, followed by the addition of four agglutinin units of the lectin and, after 30 min, of erythrocyte suspension. The lowest concentration of sugar that visibly decreased the extent of agglutination was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration. For RNA isolation, 1 g of seeds was ground to a powder with a pestle under liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the ConcertTM plant RNA reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using the 3′-RACE kit from Invitrogen, mRNAs were converted into cDNA using reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT) adapter primer. Partial cDNA of P. elegans seed lectin (PELa) was then obtained by PCR using a gene-specific primer (PLAT2, 5′-CAYATHGGNATHGAYGTNAA-3′) in combination with the abridged adapter primer of the 3′-RACE kit. PLAT2 was designed for minimal degeneration from a highly conserved peptide region (HIGIDVN) corresponding to the metal-binding site of legume lectins. The partial cDNA obtained was cloned into pGEM®T-easy (Promega) and sequenced. Complete coding region of PELa was obtained using the 5′-RACE kit (Invitrogen). mRNAs were first converted into cDNA using the antisense gene-specific primer PLAT3 (5′-TGATATAGAGATCCCTCTGGA-3′), which annealed downstream from the stop codon of PELa, and cDNA was then amplified using PLAT3 and the anchor primer of the 5′-RACE kit, after a TdT tailing step, and as described by the manufacturer. The PCR fragment was purified, cloned into the pGEM®T-easy, and further sequenced. All PCRs were performed using the GoTaq® DNA polymerase (Promega). The complete coding DNA sequence of PELa was then subcloned into the pET-29a plasmid (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the 5′-RACE product as template and the sense PLAT4 (5′-GGAATTCCATATGCTACTGAATAGGGCAAAC-3′) and antisense PLAT5 (5′-GGCAAGCTTTCACATATCACGTGCAAGATAC-3′) primers, containing NdeI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively (underlined sequences). After digestion with NdeI and HindIII, the amplified fragment was introduced into the expression plasmid. The resulting plasmid was named pET-29a_PELa. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmid pET-29a_PELa were cultured in LB broth medium at 37 °C. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.5–0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were harvested after 4 h of incubation at 30 °C, washed, and suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). The cells were broken by cell disruption (Constant Cell Disruption System) at 1700 bars. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and filtration, the pellet was washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100. The final precipitate was denatured and solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, 10 mm DTT and, after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, had its protein concentration adjusted to 1 mg ml−1. 50 ml of the denatured protein solution at 1 mg ml−1 was slowly diluted in 950 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 240 mm NaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT. After 1 h at 10 °C and filtration, the fresh refolded protein was submitted to the purification step. The purification of PELa was performed on a d-mannose-Sepharose column (Sigma). PELa refolded was allowed to bind to the immobilized mannose in equilibrating buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). After washing with buffer A, PELa was eluted using buffer A supplemented with 200 mm d-mannose. The purified protein was washed and concentrated as desired using a Vivaspin (Sartorius) ultrafiltration device with a cutoff of 10 kDa and stored at 4 °C. The protein fractions were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the protein was stained with Brilliant Blue staining (Sigma). ITC experiments were performed with a VP-ITC isothermal titration microcalorimeter (Microcal; GE Healthcare). Experiments were carried out at 25 ± 0.1 °C. Protein was prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and the same buffer was used to prepare the oligosaccharide solutions. Protein (monomer) concentration used for ITC was 0.06 mm. Injections of 10 μl of each oligosaccharide solution at various concentrations (from 0.4 to 0.8 mm) were added automatically to the protein solution present in the calorimeter cell. Control experiments performed by injection of buffer into the protein solution yielded insignificant heat of dilution. Integrated heat effects were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a single site binding model (Origin 7.0) after subtracting the saturation heat evaluated at the end of the titration. The experimental data fitted to a theoretical titration curve gave the association constant (Ka) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). The other thermodynamic parameters such as changes in free energy (ΔG) and entropy (ΔS) were calculated from the equation ΔG = ΔH − TΔS = −RT lnKa, where T is the absolute temperature, and R is the molar gas constant (8.314 J·mol−1·K−1). All experiments were performed with c values of 10 < c < 100, with c being the Wiseman constant (24.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Rapid measurement of binding constants and heats of binding using a new titration calorimeter.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) defined as c = nKa [M] ([M] receptor concentration in calorimeter cell). Purified PELa sample was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and re-purified on a D-Salt polyacrylamide desalting column (Pierce). Alexa-labeled protein was used for glycan array screening with a standard procedure of the protein-glycan interaction core (H) of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. PELa was concentrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MnCl2 to 10 mg ml−1 with addition of TriMan or compound H at the final concentration of 1 mm. Crystallization conditions for PELa were screened using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method with a commercially available crystallization solution (Hampton Research Screens I and II, Hampton Research, Riverside, CA) at 20 °C. Drops were prepared by mixing a 1.0-μl sample solution and 1.0-μl reservoir solution, followed by equilibration against a 500-μl reservoir solution. Crystals of the PELa-TriMan and PELa-heptasaccharide complexes were obtained using crystallization conditions 42 (1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 12% v/v glycerol) and 48 (100 mm Bicine, pH 9, 10% PEG 20K and 2% dioxane) of the Crystal Screen II kit (Hampton Research), respectively. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen (100 K) after soaking them for a time as short as possible in 25 and 30% (v/v) glycerol in precipitant solution, respectively. Data sets to 2.2 and 1.6 Å were collected for the PELa-TriMan and PELa-heptasaccharide complexes at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France, on beamlines ID14-2 and BM30A, respectively, using an ADSC Q4R CCD (charge-coupled device) detector (Quantum Corp.).

Open table in a new tab Phasing information was obtained using a monomer of P. angolensis lectin (Protein Data Bank code 1N3O, with removal of water molecules) as a probe for molecular replacement for the orthorhombic crystal form of the PELa-TriMan complex using the program PHASER (25.McCoy A.J.

For the PELa-heptasaccharide complex, the crystal structure of the PELa-TriMan complex was used as template. Crystallographic refinement was carried out with the program REFMAC (26.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13851) Google Scholar), and manual model building was achieved using Coot (27.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17064) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics of both structures are given in Table 1. Coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank under code 3ZVX and 3ZYR, respectively. Molecular drawings were prepared using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA) and LIGPLOT (28.Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. LIGPLOT. A program to generate schematic diagrams of protein-ligand interactions.Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). Crude extract from P. elegans seeds agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes with a titer of 2098 hemagglutination units ml−1. Human erythrocytes with blood group A, B, and O were also tested, but no hemagglutination was observed. These results indicate the expression of at least one lectin in seeds with specificity for the oligosaccharides present in rabbit erythrocytes. Several monosaccharides and disaccharides were tested for their ability to inhibit PELa-induced rabbit erythrocyte agglutination as shown in Table 2. Glucose and its derivatives α-methylglucoside and GlcNAc demonstrated some inhibition, albeit at a rather large concentration. The most efficient compound is mannose, which could inhibit the agglutination at a concentration of 12 mm. Methyl-α-mannoside- and αMan-containing disaccharides are better ligands. These results indicate the presence of a mannose/glucose-binding lectin in the crude extract from P. elegans seeds.TABLE 2Inhibition of hemagglutination activity of P. elegans seeds crude extract by various sugarsSugarsMinimum inhibitory concentrationd-Mannose12.5 mmMethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside6.12 mmαMan1–2 Man1.56 mmαMan1–3 Man1.56 mmαMan1–6 Man12.5 mmd-Glucose50 mmMethyl-α-d-glucopyranoside12.5 mmMaltose50 mmN-Acetyl-d-glucosamine25 mmd-Galactose–aNo inhibition was observed at concentration of 100 mm.N-Acetyl-d-galactosamine–l-Fucose–d-Arabinose–Lactose–Lactulose–Fucoidan–Carrageenan–Pork stomach mucin–a No inhibition was observed at concentration of 100 mm. Open table in a new tab Total mRNAs were extracted from the seeds of P. elegans, and amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE and 5′-RACE) was performed using degenerated and specific primers. The specific degenerated primers were designed based on conserved peptide sequences known to be involved in binding to calcium and manganese in legume lectins (supplemental Figs. 1S and 2S and supplemental Table 1S). 5RNA and protein sequences have been deposited GenBank with codes JN133278 and AEK69351, respectively. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence indicates that the protein includes 261 amino acids with two predicted N-glycosylation sites (Asn-7 and Asn-127). PELa sequence shows similarities with other Man/Glc-specific legume lectins, such as those from P. angolensis (72% identity), Pterocarpus rotundifolius (82%), and Arachis hypogaea (70%) (ID numbers CAD19804, AAT57665, and AAA74572, respectively). Multiple alignment with a set of legume lectins with known crystal structures is displayed in Fig. 1. Sequence identities vary from 72% for the Man/Glc-specific lectin from P. angolensis to 39% for the Gal/GalNAc lectin from Erythrina corallodendron. The five loops that have been described to build the carbohydrate-binding sites (8.Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Legume lectin structure.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 10.Sharma V. Surolia A. Analyses of carbohydrate recognition by legume lectins. Size of the combining site loops and their primary specificity.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) are highlighted in Fig. 1. Sequences in these loops present strong similarities with P. angolensis lectin, but weaker similarities with other lectins, in agreement with the large differences in monosaccharide specificities. Production of recombinant PELa in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain resulted in the accumulation of the protein in inclusion bodies. A renaturation protocol, including solubilization by 8 m urea, was used to obtain the protein in the soluble form (supplemental Fig. 3S). Active PELa was obtained by affinity purification on a man"
https://openalex.org/W2090578499,"Human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is able to suppress or activate cellular immune responses to protect the host from invading pathogens. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes a viral IL-10 (ebvIL-10) in its genome that has retained the immunosuppressive activities of hIL-10 but lost the ability to induce immunostimulatory activities on some cells. These functional differences are at least partially due to the ∼1000-fold difference in hIL-10 and ebvIL-10 binding affinity for the IL-10R1·IL-10R2 cell surface receptors. Despite weaker binding to IL-10R1, ebvIL-10 is more active than hIL-10 in inducing B-cell proliferation. To explore this counterintuitive observation further, a series of monomeric and dimeric ebvIL-10·hIL-10 chimeric proteins were produced and characterized for receptor binding and cellular proliferation on TF-1/hIL-10R1 cells that express high levels of the IL-10R1 chain. On this cell line, monomeric chimeras elicited cell proliferation in accordance with how tightly they bound to the IL-10R1 chain. In contrast, dimeric chimeras exhibiting the highest affinity for IL-10R1 exhibited reduced proliferative activity. These distinct activity profiles are correlated with kinetic analyses that reveal that the ebvIL-10 dimer is impaired in its ability to form a 1:2 ebvIL-10·IL-10R1 complex. As a result, the ebvIL-10 dimer functions like a monomer at low IL-10R1 levels, which prevents efficient signaling. At high IL-10R1 levels, the ebvIL-10 dimer is able to induce signaling responses greater than hIL-10. Thus, the ebvIL-10 dimer scaffold is essential to prevent activation of cells with low IL-10R1 levels but to maintain or enhance activity on cells with high IL-10R1 levels. Human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is able to suppress or activate cellular immune responses to protect the host from invading pathogens. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes a viral IL-10 (ebvIL-10) in its genome that has retained the immunosuppressive activities of hIL-10 but lost the ability to induce immunostimulatory activities on some cells. These functional differences are at least partially due to the ∼1000-fold difference in hIL-10 and ebvIL-10 binding affinity for the IL-10R1·IL-10R2 cell surface receptors. Despite weaker binding to IL-10R1, ebvIL-10 is more active than hIL-10 in inducing B-cell proliferation. To explore this counterintuitive observation further, a series of monomeric and dimeric ebvIL-10·hIL-10 chimeric proteins were produced and characterized for receptor binding and cellular proliferation on TF-1/hIL-10R1 cells that express high levels of the IL-10R1 chain. On this cell line, monomeric chimeras elicited cell proliferation in accordance with how tightly they bound to the IL-10R1 chain. In contrast, dimeric chimeras exhibiting the highest affinity for IL-10R1 exhibited reduced proliferative activity. These distinct activity profiles are correlated with kinetic analyses that reveal that the ebvIL-10 dimer is impaired in its ability to form a 1:2 ebvIL-10·IL-10R1 complex. As a result, the ebvIL-10 dimer functions like a monomer at low IL-10R1 levels, which prevents efficient signaling. At high IL-10R1 levels, the ebvIL-10 dimer is able to induce signaling responses greater than hIL-10. Thus, the ebvIL-10 dimer scaffold is essential to prevent activation of cells with low IL-10R1 levels but to maintain or enhance activity on cells with high IL-10R1 levels. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) 2The abbreviations used are: hIL-10human IL-10ebvIL-10Epstein-Barr virus IL-10BicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycineRUresponse unitsSPRsurface plasmon resonanceNTN terminusABAB loopCDCD loopCTC terminus. is a dimeric immunomodulatory cytokine involved in the complex regulation of innate and adaptive immunity to self-antigens and foreign antigens (1Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R.

As a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, hIL-10 limits immune responses mounted against pathogens to prevent irreparable damage to the host. hIL-10 suppresses inflammation by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFNγ, IL-1, TNF, and IL-12) produced by numerous cell types and the expression of MHC class II and B7 on antigen-presenting cells (2Salek-Ardakani S.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a γ-herpesvirus carried by a high percentage of the human population as a life-long asymptomatic infection (16Young L.S. Rickinson A.B. Epstein-Barr virus. 40 years on.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). EBV induces infectious mononucleosis and is tightly linked to the emergence of B- and epithelial cell malignancies (17Young L.S. Murray P.G. Epstein-Barr virus and oncogenesis. From latent genes to tumors.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5108-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To successfully establish latent infections, EBV has evolved several immune evasion strategies that disrupt host antiviral immune responses (2Salek-Ardakani S. Arrand J.R. Mackett M. Epstein-Barr virus encoded interleukin-10 inhibits HLA-class I, ICAM-1, and B7 expression on human monocytes. Implications for immune evasion by EBV.Virology. 2002; 304: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One strategy used by EBV is to produce a “viral IL-10” protein (ebvIL-10) upon infection that shares 83% amino acid sequence identity with hIL-10 (18Moore K.W. Vieira P. Fiorentino D.F. Trounstine M.L. Khan T.A. Mosmann T.R.

Functional studies demonstrate that ebvIL-10 suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production like hIL-10 and also inhibits MHC class II expression on monocytes. However, unlike hIL-10, ebvIL-10 does not stimulate the proliferation of thymocytes and mast cells and does not enhance the expression of MHC class II on B-cells (10Go N.F. Castle B.E. Barrett R.

A single amino acid determines the immunostimulatory activity of interleukin 10.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that ebvIL-10 has been altered, relative to hIL-10, to efficiently disrupt host immune responses to EBV. The mechanistic basis for the distinct biological activities of hIL-10 and ebvIL-10 remains poorly understood. Cell binding studies have shown that ebvIL-10 exhibits ∼1000-fold lower affinity for IL-10R1 than hIL-10 (21Liu Y. de Waal Malefyt R. Briere F. Parham C. Bridon J.M. Banchereau J. Moore K.W. Xu J. The EBV IL-10 homologue is a selective agonist with impaired binding to the IL-10 receptor.J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 604-613PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced affinity of ebvIL-10 for IL-10R1 makes ebvIL-10 unable to induce signaling in cells with low levels of IL-10R1, which are still responsive to hIL-10 (22Ding Y. Qin L. Zamarin D. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Moore K.W. Bromberg J.S. Differential IL-10R1 expression plays a critical role in IL-10-mediated immune regulation.J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6884-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, as pointed out by Ding et al., once sufficient IL-10R1 levels are expressed on cells, there does not seem to be a strict correlation between affinity, receptor densities, and signaling responses (22Ding Y. Qin L. Zamarin D. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Moore K.W. Bromberg J.S. Differential IL-10R1 expression plays a critical role in IL-10-mediated immune regulation.J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6884-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For example, ebvIL-10 is more potent than hIL-10 in proliferating activated human B-cells (8Rousset F. Garcia E. Defrance T. Péronne C. Vezzio N. Hsu D.H. Kastelein R. Moore K.W. Banchereau J. Interleukin 10 is a potent growth and differentiation factor for activated human B lymphocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The EBV IL-10 homologue is a selective agonist with impaired binding to the IL-10 receptor.J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 604-613PubMed Google Scholar). To further define differences in ebvIL-10 and hIL-10 receptor engagement, a series of ebvIL-10·hIL-10 chimeric proteins were generated (Fig. 1), and their receptor binding and cell proliferative activities were determined. Here we show that the ebvIL-10 dimer engages IL-10R1 by a two-step binding mechanism, where the first binding event mimics an ebvIL-10 monomer interaction, which allows the molecule to discriminate between low and high levels of IL-10R1. In contrast, the hIL-10 dimer efficiently binds IL-10R1 by a simple one-step binding mechanism with high affinity. The distinct mechanism of IL-10R1 engagement by ebvIL-10 provides a biochemical/structural model for the complex biological activities of ebvIL-10 on various cell types. The ebvIL-10 or cIL-10 gene was mutated either by PCR amplification with primers containing mutated sequences or by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The variants of hIL-10 and ebvIL-10 were overexpressed using Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) or Rosetta2 (DE3), and purified as previously described for hIL-10 (23Yoon S.I. Walter M.R.

IL-10R1WZ and IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ were made by generating three different plasmids, 10R1WZB1, 10R2WZA2Avi, and WZA2Avi. 10R1WZB1 consists of IL-10R1 residues 21–234 (Uniprot code Q13651), a 13-residue linker, followed by the WinZip B1 coiled-coil domain described by Arndt et al. (27Arndt K.M. Pelletier J.N. Müller K.M. Plückthun A. Alber T. Comparison of in vivo selection and rational design of heterodimeric coiled coils.Structure. 2002; 10: 1235-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 10R2WZA2 consists of IL-10R2 residues 20–220, a 13-residue linker, the WinZip A2 coiled-coil (27Arndt K.M.

Comparison of in vivo selection and rational design of heterodimeric coiled coils.Structure. 2002; 10: 1235-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and a 15-residue AviTag (Avidity) sequence (28Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. A minimal peptide substrate in biotin holoenzyme synthetase-catalyzed biotinylation.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Finally, the WZA2Avi plasmid contains the WinZip A2 coiled coil followed by the 15-residue AviTag sequence (28Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. A minimal peptide substrate in biotin holoenzyme synthetase-catalyzed biotinylation.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Immediately before the coiled-coil in each plasmid, a glycine-cysteine-glycine sequence (GCG) is encoded in each plasmid, which forms a disulfide bond, to covalently couple the WinZip B1/A2 coils and associated receptors to one another. IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ and IL-10R1WZ were expressed by co-transfecting plasmids 10R1WZB1 + 10R2WZA2Avi or 10R1WZB1 + WZA2Avi in Drosophila S2 cells. All transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described by the manufacturers and included the hygromycin resistance vector, pCoHYGRO (Invitrogen), for selection using hygromycin for 3 weeks. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4 in serum-free Insect-XPRESS medium (BioWhittaker). IL-10R1WZ and IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ were purified using a hIL-10 affinity column as described previously (25Josephson K. McPherson D.T. Walter M.R. Purification, crystallization, and preliminary X-ray diffraction of a complex between IL-10 and soluble IL-10R1.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1908-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified IL-10R1WZ and IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ confirmed that the IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 chains are linked by disulfide bonds. Biotinylation of IL-10R1WZ and IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ was performed with biotin-protein ligase (birA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Avidity). 160 μl of 34 μm protein samples in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, were mixed with 3 μl of 1 mg/ml birA, 20 μl of 0.5 m Bicine, pH 8.3, and 20 μl of 100 mm ATP, 100 mm MgOAc, and 500 μm d-biotin. The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 2 h. Protein biotinylation was verified by Western blotting with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. Biotinylated IL-10R1WZ and IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ (IL-10R1WZ-Bt and IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ-Bt, respectively) were purified by a monomeric avidin column (column volume, 2 ml; Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, samples were loaded on the monomeric avidin column equilibrated with PBS, and biotinylated proteins were eluted with 2 mm biotin in PBS after column washing with PBS. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. BIAcore 2000 and 3000 instruments were used to determine the affinity of monomeric hIL-10 and ebvIL-10 chimeras for IL-10R1T213C-Bt, IL-10R1WZ-Bt, and IL-10R1·IL-20R1WZ-Bt. Streptavidin (Pierce) in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was immobilized at the level of 2000–3600 RU by amine-coupling chemistry on CM5 chips (Biacore), which had been activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.1 m 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-N-ethylcarbondiimide. IL-10R1T213C-Bt, IL-10R1WZ-Bt, and IL-10R1·IL-10R2WZ-Bt were captured on streptavidin-coupled CM5 chips to reach a final density of 77–236 RU, 178–212 RU, 262–307 RU, respectively. The control surfaces were coupled with streptavidin alone. IL-10M1 chimeras were injected in a random order at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Surfaces were regenerated by the injection of 2 m MgCl2 (pH 7.4) for 1 min followed by 20 mm EDTA for 1 min. Kinetic data were prepared by the method of double referencing as described by Rich and Myszka (29Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Advances in surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Using BiaEvaluation version 3.2 software, sensorgrams were globally fit to 1:1 binding models. A proliferation assay was performed using TF-1/IL-10R1 cells as previously described (26Yoon S.I. Logsdon N.J. Sheikh F. Donnelly R.P. Walter M.R. Conformational changes mediate interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) binding to IL-10 and assembly of the signaling complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35088-35096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, IL-10s were diluted in an assay medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μm streptomycin, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol) and dispensed into 96-well microplates. Subsequently, 5000 TF-1/IL-10R1 cells were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To assess viable cell density, alamarBlue (BIOSOURCE International) was added to each well containing a 100-μl cell culture, followed by incubation for 15 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Fluorescence intensity was measured by a POLARstar plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) at wavelengths of 544 nm for excitation and 590 nm for emission. Dose-response curves were fit using Prism software (Graphpad) to determine EC50 values. SPR data collection and analysis of IL-10 dimers was performed using a Biacore T-200 (GE Healthcare). The IL-10R1-FC used for SPR analysis of IL-10 dimers was described previously (31Logsdon N.J. Eberhardt M.K. Allen C.E. Barry P.A. Walter M.R. Design and analysis of rhesus cytomegalovirus IL-10 mutants as a model for novel vaccines against human cytomegalovirus.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e28127Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IL-10R1-FC (∼66 RU) was coupled to CM5 biacore chips using an anti-FC antibody coupling kit using the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). IL-10 dimers were injected over the IL-10R1-FC surface at 100 μl/min. The resulting sensorgrams were fit to 1:1, and bivalent analyte models, using the Biacore T-200 evaluation software version 1.0. Prior studies revealed high quality hIL-10/sIL-10R1 kinetic constants could be obtained using an engineered hIL-10 monomer (hIL-10M1 (26Yoon S.I. Logsdon N.J. Sheikh F. Donnelly R.P. Walter M.R. Conformational changes mediate interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) binding to IL-10 and assembly of the signaling complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35088-35096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays were performed by injecting hIL-10M1 over a biacore chip coupled with biotinylated IL-10R1 (sIL-10R1T213C-Bt) (Fig. 2). To compare hIL-10·IL-10R1 and ebvIL-10·IL-10R1 binding kinetics, an ebvIL-10 monomer was engineered (ebvIL-10M1), and IL-10R1 binding was determined using the same SPR assay (Fig. 2). The binding constants (Table 1), determined by global fitting of the sensorgrams, reveal that hIL-10M1 and ebvIL-10M1 exhibit essentially identical on-rates (kon) but markedly different off-rates (koff, 200-fold; Table 1). The off-rates correspond to half-lives (t½) of 44 min for the hIL-10M1·IL-10R1 complex, compared with 13 s for the ebvIL-10M1·IL-10R1 interaction. The rate constants were also used to determine equilibrium binding constants (KD = koff/kon) for the hIL-10M1·IL-10R1 (KD = 0.46 nm) and ebvIL-10M1·IL-10R1 (KD = 121 nm) interactions, which differ from one another by 263-fold. SPR analysis of hIL-10M1·IL-10R1 and ebvIL-10M1·IL-10R1 interactions were repeated using a coiled-coil domain to couple IL-10R1 (IL-10R1WZ-Bt) to the chip surface (Fig. 2).

Open table in a new tab Sequence differences between hIL-10 and ebvIL-10 are located in four regions of the molecule, corresponding to the N terminus (NT; 18 residues), AB loop (AB; 3 residues), CD loop (CD; 3 residues), and C terminus (CT; 3 residues) (Fig. 1). To identify residues responsible for the distinct IL-10R1 binding properties of ebvIL-10 and hIL-10, ebvIL-10M1 NT, AB, CD, and CT sequences were replaced with human IL-10 amino acids to generate four ebvIL-10M1·hIL-10M1 chimeras: ebvIL-10M1NT, ebvIL-10M1AB, ebvIL-10M1CD, and ebvIL-10M1CT (Fig. 1). The chimeras were purified and subjected to SPR analysis on the IL-10R1WZ-Bt surface. The binding studies reveal that ebvIL-10M1AB and ebvIL-10M1CD exhibit 11.5- and 6.7-fold higher affinity for IL-10R1 compared with ebvIL-10M1, whereas ebvIL-10M1NT and ebvIL-10M1CT exhibited increases of 3.2- and 1.8-fold, respectively (Table 2 and supplemental Table S1). Thus, sequence differences between ebvIL-10 and hIL-10 in the AB and CD loops play a larger role in IL-10R1 binding than residues located in the N and C termini (Table 2).TABLE 2Kinetic parameters and biological activity of monomeric IL-10 chimerasSPR analysisBioassay (TF-1 cells)R1WZ-Bt surfaceR1/R2WZ-Bt surfaceKdIncreaseKdIncreaseEC50Increasenm-foldnm-foldng/ml-foldebvIL-10M1941.0141.09.81.0NT293.26.32.29.71.0AB8.211.50.8217.10.7912.3CD146.73.54.03.33.0CT511.88.31.72.44.0T39M1420.7180.84.62.1E42Q561.77.02.02.93.4V43L224.31.97.41.26.3A87I156.32.55.62.63.8NT/AB1.467.10.3638.90.8411.7NT/A87I4.222.40.9315.12.05.0AB/A87I0.93101.10.2166.70.3329.8V43L/A87I2.537.60.3638.90.6515.2hIL-10M10.28335.70.11127.30.3726.4 Open table in a new tab Three single residue AB loop chimeras (ebvIL-10M1T39M, ebvIL-10M1E42Q, and ebvIL-10M1V43L) and one CD loop chimera (ebvIL-10M1A87I) were created to identify the contributions of specific residues within the loops to IL-10R1 binding (Fig. 1). Analysis of the chimeras by SPR revealed the V43L substitution in the AB loop and A87I substitution in the CD loop were responsible for most of the IL-10R1 affinity increases observed for the ebvIL-10M1AB and ebvIL-10M1CD chimeras. The single site ebvIL-10M1V43L and ebvIL-10M1A87I chimeras bound IL-10R1 4.3- and 6.3-fold tighter than ebvIL-10M1, which corresponds to ∼38 and ∼98% of the binding increases observed for ebvIL-10M1AB and ebvIL-10M1CD. This result is consistent with the A87I mutation being the single most important residue for receptor binding on cells (20Ding Y. Qin L. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Bromberg J.S. A single amino acid determines the immunostimulatory activity of interleukin 10.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Val-43 and Ala-87 pack into the hydrophobic core of the molecule and do not make direct contacts with IL-10R1. Although residue changes at positions Val-43 and Ala-87 in the ebvIL-10 sequence increase IL-10R1 binding affinity (KD values of 22 and 15 nm, respectively) more than other residue positions tested, these chimeras do not reconstitute “hIL-10M1-like” IL-10R1 binding properties (KD = 0.28 nm; Table 2). To further increase IL-10R1 affinity, four additional chimeras were constructed (ebvIL-10M1NT,AB, ebvIL-10M1NT,A87I, ebvIL-10M1AB,A87I, and ebvIL-10M1V43L,A87I) that contain two hIL-10 sequence regions in ebvIL-10M1 (Fig. 1). Analysis of these chimeras by SPR, on the IL-10R1WZ-Bt surface, once again demonstrated the importance of human AB and CD loop sequences (Fig. 1) for high IL-10R1 binding. The chimera with the greatest IL-10R1 affinity was ebvIL-10M1AB,A87I (KD = 0.93 nm; Table 2), which regained all but ∼3-fold of the binding energy observed for hIL-10M1. Binding parameters obtained for single segment replacements (e.g. ebvIL-10M1NT = 3.2-fold KD decrease and ebvIL-10M1A87I = 6.3-fold KD decrease) could be used to predict the binding parameters of the double segment replacement (e.g. ebvIL-10M1NT,A87I calculated KD decrease = 3.2 × 6.3 = 20.2-fold KD decrease versus observed KD decrease = 22.4; Table 2). Thus, residue changes in these chimeras are essentially independent. The greatest differences between observed and predicted IL-10R1 KD increases were observed for chimeras containing the AB loop region. Overall, these results reveal that ebvIL-10 alters IL-10R1 binding through a series of subtle sequence changes dispersed between the AB and CD loop of the molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2001216784,"Large conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels in inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea are essential for hearing. However, germ-line deletion of BKα, the pore-forming subunit KCNMA1 of the BK channel, surprisingly did not affect hearing thresholds in the first postnatal weeks, even though altered IHC membrane time constants, decreased IHC receptor potential alternating current/direct current ratio, and impaired spike timing of auditory fibers were reported in these mice. To investigate the role of IHC BK channels for central auditory processing, we generated a conditional mouse model with hair cell-specific deletion of BKα from postnatal day 10 onward. This had an unexpected effect on temporal coding in the central auditory system: neuronal single and multiunit responses in the inferior colliculus showed higher excitability and greater precision of temporal coding that may be linked to the improved discrimination of temporally modulated sounds observed in behavioral training. The higher precision of temporal coding, however, was restricted to slower modulations of sound and reduced stimulus-driven activity. This suggests a diminished dynamic range of stimulus coding that is expected to impair signal detection in noise. Thus, BK channels in IHCs are crucial for central coding of the temporal fine structure of sound and for detection of signals in a noisy environment.—Kurt, S., Sausbier, M., Rüttiger, L., Brandt, N., Moeller, C.

https://openalex.org/W2010177946,"N-glycosylation mediates many biological functions. Genetic defects in the N-glycosylation pathway cause >35 inherited human disorders called congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). As a result, some N-glycosylation sites are unoccupied. Serum transferrin is a diagnostic marker for these patients, but there are no corresponding cellular markers to assess glycosylation competence. Therefore, we engineered a green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct to measure N-glycosylation site occupancy. We designed an endoplasmic reticulum-retained GFP biomarker whose fluorescence is lost when it is N-glycosylated due to steric hindrance by the glycan. This marker is a highly sensitive indicator of N-glycosylation site occupancy. In CDG cells carrying the GFP construct, a 25% decrease of glycosylation efficiency induces a 5-fold increase in fluorescence, while cDNA complementation of the genetic defect results in a 5-fold decrease in fluorescence. This engineered GFP detects impaired N-glycosylation in multiple cell lines, including CHO cells, HeLa cells, normal and patient fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This marker is a highly sensitive tool to study N-glycosylation site occupancy. It can be used to screen for compounds that reverse poor N-glycosylation site occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W2052717612,"The O-GlcNAc modification involves the attachment of single β-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues to serine and threonine residues of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Interestingly, previous biochemical and structural studies have shown that O-GlcNAcase (OGA), the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from proteins, has an active site pocket that tolerates various N-acyl groups in addition to the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc. The remarkable sequence and structural conservation of residues comprising this pocket suggest functional importance. We hypothesized this pocket enables processing of metabolic variants of O-GlcNAc that could be formed due to inaccuracy within the metabolic machinery of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. In the accompanying paper (Bergfeld, A. K., Pearce, O. M., Diaz, S. L., Pham, T., and Varki, A. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287, 28865-28881), N-glycolylglucosamine (GlcNGc) was shown to be a catabolite of NeuNGc. Here, we show that the hexosamine salvage pathway can convert GlcNGc to UDP-GlcNGc, which is then used to modify proteins with O-GlcNGc. The kinetics of incorporation and removal of O-GlcNGc in cells occur in a dynamic manner on a time frame similar to that of O-GlcNAc. Enzymatic activity of O-GlcNAcase (OGA) toward a GlcNGc glycoside reveals OGA can process glycolyl-containing substrates fairly efficiently. A bacterial homolog (BtGH84) of OGA, from a human gut symbiont, also processes O-GlcNGc substrates, and the structure of this enzyme bound to a GlcNGc-derived species reveals the molecular basis for tolerance and binding of GlcNGc. Together, these results demonstrate that analogs of GlcNAc, such as GlcNGc, are metabolically viable species and that the conserved active site pocket of OGA likely evolved to enable processing of mis-incorporated analogs of O-GlcNAc and thereby prevent their accumulation. Such plasticity in carbohydrate processing enzymes may be a general feature arising from inaccuracy in hexosamine metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2021689359,"Tat systems transport folded proteins across energized membranes of bacteria, archaea, and plant plastids. In Escherichia coli, TatBC complexes recognize the transported proteins, and TatA complexes are recruited to facilitate transport. We achieved an abstraction of TatA from membranes without use of detergents and observed a co-purification of PspA, a membrane-stress response protein. The N-terminal transmembrane domain of TatA was required for the interaction. Electron microscopy displayed TatA complexes in direct contact with PspA. PspB and PspC were important for the TatA-PspA contact. The activator protein PspF was not involved in the PspA-TatA interaction, demonstrating that basal levels of PspA already interact with TatA. Elevated TatA levels caused membrane stress that induced a strictly PspBC- and PspF-dependent up-regulation of PspA. TatA complexes were found to destabilize membranes under these conditions. At native TatA levels, PspA deficiency clearly affected anaerobic TMAO respiratory growth, suggesting that energetic costs for transport of large Tat substrates such as TMAO reductase can become growth limiting in the absence of PspA. The physiological role of PspA recruitment to TatA may therefore be the control of membrane stress at active translocons."
https://openalex.org/W1994393417,"ClipR-59 is a membrane-associated protein and has been implicated in membrane signaling and vesicle trafficking. Recently, we have identified ClipR-59 as an Akt-interacting protein, and we have found that, by interacting with Akt, ClipR-59 modulates Akt subcellular compartmentalization and Akt substrate AS160 phosphorylation, thereby promoting Glut4 membrane translocation. Here, we have further investigated the regulatory effects of ClipR-59 on AS160 phosphorylation and subsequent adipocyte glucose transport. Our data showed that ClipR-59 interacted with AS160, which was mediated by the ankyrin repeats of ClipR-59 and regulated by insulin signaling. Moreover, the data also demonstrated that the interaction of ClipR-59 with AS160 was required for ClipR-59 to modulate Glut4 membrane translocation as ΔANK-ClipR-59, an AS160 interaction-defective mutant, failed to promote AS160 phosphorylation, Glut4 membrane translocation, and glucose transport induced by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Because ClipR-59 also interacts with Akt and enhances the interaction between Akt and AS160, we suggest that ClipR-59 functions as a scaffold protein to facilitate Akt-mediated AS160 phosphorylation, thereby regulating glucose transport."

The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, to remove the unbound proteins before 500-μl fractions were collected with a 0–50% of 1 m NaCl linear gradient over 20 column volumes at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fifty microliters of selected fractions were analyzed by 10% non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The fractions with target protein were diluted to reduce the salt concentration and rerun on Q-Sepharose to increase purity. Selected fractions were further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75) and were analyzed using 10% non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The fractions with target protein in pure form were concentrated by ultra-filtration (5-kDa cut-off). The amount of protein purified was estimated using RC DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Ten micrograms of pure protein was analyzed using 4–20% reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and 10–20% Tris-Tricine gel (Bio-Rad) to analyze the dimeric nature of the protein. Ten micrograms of purified protein was separated using 10–20% Tris-Tricine gel and immobilized on a PVDF membrane and subjected to Edman degradation method for sequencing. The trypsinized gel slices containing purified venom protein were subjected to LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry analysis as described previously (24.Vaiyapuri S. Wagstaff S.C. Harrison R.A. Gibbins J.M.

A mouse anti-serum specific to snaclecs in the venom of West African saw-scaled viper, Echis ocellatus was confirmed to also bind rhinocetin from B. g. rhinoceros venom and therefore was used to detect rhinocetin in subsequent flow cytometry and immunoblotting experiments.

S. Coller, Rockefeller University) were used in flow cytometry. The secondary antibody for immunoblotting (Cy3® goat anti-mouse IgG) was obtained from Invitrogen. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) diluted 10-fold in HEPES-buffered saline was incubated with various dilutions of the mouse anti-E. ocellatus snaclec serum and Cy3®-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG in a total of 50 μl of volume for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then fixed with 450 μl of 0.2% (v/v) formal saline followed by a further 10-fold dilution in 0.2% (v/v) formal saline before analyzing in the accuri® C6 flow cytometer (accuri® cytometers). A total of 5000 gated events were collected, and data were analyzed by calculating the median fluorescence of gated cells. Similar experiments were performed using FITC-labeled anti-human CD42b (GPIbα from BD Pharmingen) and monoclonal antibodies raised against the α2 subunit of integrin α2β1 (clone 6F1). FITC-labeled anti-human fibrinogen (Dako) and PECy5®-labeled anti-human CD62P (P-selectin) (BD Pharmingen) antibodies were used in similar manner to experiments mentioned above to analyze the fibrinogen binding and P-selectin exposure, respectively, on the platelet surface in the presence and absence of various concentrations of purified protein upon stimulation with different agonists. This assay was performed as described previously (30.Vaiyapuri S. Jones C.I. Sasikumar P. Moraes L.A. Munger S.J. Wright J.R. Ali M.S. Sage T. Kaiser W.J. Tucker K.L. Stain C.J. Bye A.P. Jones S.

Briefly, an equal volume of PRP and Fluo-4 NW dye (Invitrogen) were mixed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C.

The intensity of fluorescence was measured at 37 °C for 90 s using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission at 510 nm using a Fluostar Optima (BMG Labtech) spectrofluorimeter.

Briefly, the 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6)-labeled (Sigma Aldrich) human citrated blood was preincubated with vehicle or purified venom protein and perfused over a collagen-coated Vena8 BioChip (Cellix Ltd.) at a shear rate of 20 dynes/cm2. Z-stack images of thrombi were obtained every 30 s for up to 10 min using a Nikon eclipse (TE2000-U) microscope (Nikon Instruments). The fluorescence intensity and thrombus volume were calculated by analyzing the data using Slidebook5 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Cell culture plates (12 wells) were coated with 100 μg/ml of collagen or fibrinogen prepared in endothelial cell basal medium-2 (Lonza) without growth factors or fetal calf serum for 24 h at 37 °C. Unbound collagen was removed by washing with PBS three times before adding media with growth factors and fetal calf serum (at the concentrations recommended by manufacturer). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Lonza) were seeded at a density of ∼1 × 104/ml. The cells were left to grow for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Rhinocetin or vehicle control were added to selected wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Three different fields of view for each well were monitored, and images were captured for every 15 min until 36 h by a Nikon microscope DXM 1200. The images were processed by ImageJ software. Ten milligrams of B. g. rhinoceros venom was fractionated using a Q-Sepharose column (Fig. 1A), and selected fractions (from 9–26) were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). A protein with the apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa (indicated with arrows in Fig. 1B) was found to be partially purified in fractions 13–25 with differing concentrations.

A symmetrical peak was eluted from the column, and fractions 14–21 were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). This resulted in increased purity of the protein of interest. A final purification step was performed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75) (Fig. 1C), which resulted in the preparation of highly pure protein (Fig. 1D). The 21-kDa protein was purified to apparent homogeneity in fractions 30–40; these fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The total amount of protein obtained from 10 mg of venom was estimated as 1.35 mg, which is approximately equivalent to 13.5% of the total venom. The purified protein was found to be a single band in 10% non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Because most of the snaclecs reported so far were found as heterodimers (9.Clemetson K.J. Snaclecs (snake C-type lectins) that inhibit or activate platelets by binding to receptors.Toxicon. 2010; 56: 1236-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the purified protein was run under reducing conditions in 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The apparent molecular mass of the protein was reduced from ∼21 kDa to 12 kDa under reducing conditions. The reduced proteins migrated as a single species in reduced and non-reduced gradient SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1E). Using the greater resolution of 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels, however, revealed that the purified venom protein is a single protein of apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa under non-reducing conditions, which, in the presence of reducing agent, separated into two distinct species of ∼13.5 kDa and another 13 kDa (indicated with arrows on Fig. 1F). Consistent with the published convention of the naming of snaclecs, the higher molecular mass band was designated as α chain and the small molecular mass band was designated as the β chain. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein (for both chains) was obtained by Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequence of α chain was determined as DEGCLPGWSL, and β chain was determined as DQGCLPDWTL. The sequence of rhinocetin did not match any of the three previously predicted complete C-type lectin sequences obtained from the venom gland transcriptome of this snake (28.Francischetti I.M. My-Pham V. Harrison J. Garfield M.K. Ribeiro J.M.

LC-MS/MS data were obtained for the trypsin-digested purified protein chains. The data analysis predicted the α chain to be most closely related to bitiscetin, a snaclec from the venom of Bitis arietans and the β chain with the A1 chain of a C-type lectin from the venom of Macrovipera lebetina (data not shown). We required a snaclec-specific antibody to monitor the binding characteristics of rhinocetin in the following experiments and reasoned that because the snaclec sequences of the African vipers are remarkably similar (33.Harrison R.A. Oliver J. Hasson S.S. Bharati K. Theakston R.D.

We found that hTid-1, specifically hTid-1(S), interacts with MK5, a p38-regulated/activated protein kinase, and inhibits the protein kinase activity of MK5 that phosphorylates heat shock protein HSP27 in cultured HeLa cells. Thus, hTid-1(S) expression inhibits the phosphorylation of HSP27 known to play important roles in F-actin polymerization and actin cytoskeleton organization. The interplay between MK5/HSP27 signaling and hTid-1(S) expression was supported by the inhibition of HSP27 phosphorylation and MK5 activity in HeLa cells in response to hypoxia during which hTid-1(S) expression was down-regulated. We also found that overexpression of hTid-1(S) results in the inhibition of HSP27 phosphorylation, F-actin polymerization, and actin cytoskeleton organization in transduced HaCaT keratinocytes. This study further proposes that the loss of hTid-1(S) expression in the basal layer of skin epidermis correlates with the enhanced HSP27 phosphorylation, keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and excess actin cytoskeleton organization in lesional psoriatic skin."
https://openalex.org/W1975286680,"Background Pest impact on an agricultural field is jointly influenced by local and landscape features. Rarely, however, are these features studied together. The present study applies a “facilitated ecoinformatics” approach to jointly screen many local and landscape features of suspected importance to Andean potato weevils (Premnotrypes spp.), the most serious pests of potatoes in the high Andes. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated a comprehensive list of predictors of weevil damage, including both local and landscape features deemed important by farmers and researchers. To test their importance, we assembled an observational dataset measuring these features across 138 randomly-selected potato fields in Huancavelica, Peru. Data for local features were generated primarily by participating farmers who were trained to maintain records of their management operations. An information theoretic approach to modeling the data resulted in 131,071 models, the best of which explained 40.2–46.4% of the observed variance in infestations. The best model considering both local and landscape features strongly outperformed the best models considering them in isolation. Multi-model inferences confirmed many, but not all of the expected patterns, and suggested gaps in local knowledge for Andean potato weevils. The most important predictors were the field's perimeter-to-area ratio, the number of nearby potato storage units, the amount of potatoes planted in close proximity to the field, and the number of insecticide treatments made early in the season. Conclusions/Significance Results underscored the need to refine the timing of insecticide applications and to explore adjustments in potato hilling as potential control tactics for Andean weevils. We believe our study illustrates the potential of ecoinformatics research to help streamline IPM learning in agricultural learning collaboratives."

Yet, the heart needs to respond quickly to changing demands. During diastole, the heart fills with blood and the heart chambers expand. Upon activation, contraction of cardiac muscle expels blood into the circulation. Early in systole, parts of the left ventricle are being stretched by incoming blood, before contraction causes shrinking of the ventricle. We explore here the effect of stretch of contracting permeabilized cardiac trabeculae of the rat on the rate of inorganic phosphate (Pi) release resulting from ATP hydrolysis, using a fluorescent sensor for Pi with millisecond time resolution. Stretch immediately reduces the rate of Pi release, an effect observed both at full calcium activation (32 μmol/liter of Ca2+), and at a physiological activation level of 1 μmol/liter of Ca2+. The results suggest that stretch redistributes the actomyosin cross-bridges toward their Pi-containing state. The redistribution means that a greater fraction of cross-bridges will be poised to rapidly produce a force-generating transition and movement, compared with cross-bridges that have not been subjected to stretch. At the same time stretch modifies the Pi balance in the cytoplasm, which may act as a cytoplasmic signal for energy turnover. Background: Phosphate is released by the cardiac actomyosin ATPase during contraction. Results: Stretching active cardiac muscle decreases phosphate release within milliseconds. Conclusion: Mechanical stimuli such as stretch cause an immediate change in actomyosin ATPase kinetics. Significance: Stretch facilitates a powerful contraction by increasing cross-bridges in a pre-power stroke state, and changes cytoplasmic phosphate flux, which may influence energetic homeostasis. The contractile performance of the heart is linked to the energy that is available to it. Yet, the heart needs to respond quickly to changing demands.

At the same time stretch modifies the Pi balance in the cytoplasm, which may act as a cytoplasmic signal for energy turnover. The heart functions as an efficient machine, which converts the energy of ATP hydrolysis into work that pumps blood for a lifetime. To better understand the relationship between ATP hydrolysis and work production, we have measured with millisecond time resolution the rate of inorganic phosphate (Pi) release in permeabilized trabeculae of the rat heart. A fluorescent assay was used to measure Pi, the by-product of ATP hydrolysis by actomyosin. Experiments were done at both high (maximally activating) and lower, half-maximally activating [Ca2+], which is more relevant to in vivo function. During systole the volume of the ventricle decreases as working cardiomyocytes shorten, but there is regional variation within the ventricle wall, with some cardiomyocytes being stretched at the beginning of systole by the incoming blood or neighboring myocyte contraction (1.Ashikaga H. van der Spoel T.I.

The overall pattern of cardiac contraction depends on a spatial gradient of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation.Cell. 2001; 107: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We have measured the effects of stretch on force and Pi release rate by applying ramp stretches to isometrically contracting trabeculae obtained from rat hearts. In addition we monitored the time courses of mechanical behavior and Pi release during isometric conditions at the longer sarcomere length, and during subsequent sarcomere shortening to the initial sarcomere length. The results indicate that the effect of stretch on the rate of Pi release could not be attributed to the effect of sarcomere length, but that it was caused by the increased force. The same approach was successfully applied to skeletal muscle fibers (4.Bickham D.C. West T.G. Webb M.R. Woledge R.C. Curtin N.A. Ferenczi M.A. Millisecond-scale biochemical response to change in strain.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 2445-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and showed that stretch caused a rapid redistribution of myosin cross-bridges. We show here that the response to stretch in cardiac trabeculae has similarities to that seen in skeletal muscle. In addition we report here that the response of trabeculae to stretch depends on the level of activation by Ca2+, which is particularly relevant to cardiac function (5.Calaghan S.C. White E. The role of calcium in the response of cardiac muscle to stretch.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 59-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Results demonstrate that stretch had a dramatic effect on the Pi release rate, abruptly reducing it to less than 20% of the value prior to the stretch, both in maximally and half-maximally activated trabeculae. We also show that the effect of stretch on calcium sensitivity of Pi release lasts for tens of milliseconds, and is probably caused by long-lasting activation of thin filaments by stretch. We conclude that stretch of the active heart rapidly decreases the rate of Pi release derived from ATP hydrolysis. A consequence is that the stretched myocytes will be poised to deliver a powerful contraction to enhance blood flow at the beginning of the subsequent shortening phase. In addition, stretch will temporarily change the distribution of Pi in the cytoplasm, which may affect the signaling pathways controlling energy homeostasis or adaptive response to mechanical stress. We believe that this is the first time that Pi release has been measured in cardiac muscle. This technique has a major advantage over previous techniques used to measure ATPase rate in that it has a very high time resolution (on a millisecond scale). The high time resolution allows us to see that the cross-bridges respond nearly instantly to stretch in a biochemically measurable way. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (250–350 g) were killed by cervical dislocation, in accordance with Schedule 1 of the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The heart and aorta were rapidly explanted and rinsed free of blood in ice-cold oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution (composition in mmol/liter: 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 0.94 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 11.5 glucose, and equilibrated with 95% O2 + 5% CO2), containing heparin (12 units/ml). The heart was transferred to a Langendorff apparatus where the aorta was cannulated and the heart retrogradely perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution for several minutes. The heart was then placed on a cooled stage (5 °C) of a dissecting microscope in oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution and 30 mmol/liter of 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). 2The abbreviations used are: BDM2,3-butanedione monoximeNPEP3-1(2-nitrophenyl)SLsarcomere lengthMDCC-PBP(N-(2[1-maleimidyl]ethyl)-7-diethylamino-coumarin-3-carboxamide phosphate-binding proteinTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid.

The trabeculae measured 1–3 mm in length, 70–250 μm in width, and 50–250 μm in depth. T-shaped aluminum foil clips were gently attached to the ends of the isolated trabeculae to allow them to be mounted on the experimental apparatus. 2,3-butanedione monoxime P3-1(2-nitrophenyl) sarcomere length (N-(2[1-maleimidyl]ethyl)-7-diethylamino-coumarin-3-carboxamide phosphate-binding protein N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. Trabeculae were placed in a relaxing solution (see Table 1 for composition of solutions) containing 2% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 30 min. This permeabilization technique makes the cell membrane and intracellular membrane-bound structures such as mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) permeable to proteins and small ions, allowing direct access to the myofilament space. This removes all nonmyofilament ATPase activity, as well as sources of ATP generation. After permeabilization, trabeculae were either used immediately or stored in a relaxing solution containing 50% glycerol (v/v) at −20 °C for up to 5 days.TABLE 1Composition of solutions for activation by laser-flash photolysis of caged-ATPRelaxing solutionPre-rigorCa2+-free rigorCa2+ rigorLoading solutionTES6060606060MgCl2aConcentration corresponding to free [Mg2+], 2.0 mmol/liter.8.663.763.662.025.52CaEGTAbConcentration corresponding to free [Ca2+], 32 μm.00019.8519.88EGTA2020200.150.12Na2ATP5.430.11000Glutathione1010101010KpropcConcentration giving ionic strength, 150 mmol/liter.33.7161.6362.263.9442.8NPE-caged ATPdConcentration giving [MgATP], 1.5 mmol/liter after laser flash.00005MDCC-PBP00001.2a Concentration corresponding to free [Mg2+], 2.0 mmol/liter.b Concentration corresponding to free [Ca2+], 32 μm.c Concentration giving ionic strength, 150 mmol/liter.d Concentration giving [MgATP], 1.5 mmol/liter after laser flash. Open table in a new tab The trabeculae were mounted in a trough (30 μl in volume) built into a stainless-steel stage of a Zeiss ACM upright microscope. The stage is temperature-controlled and consists of six troughs, one of which is constructed from 0.5-mm thick quartz. The stage can be vertically displaced and rotated beneath the muscle allowing quick transfer between different solutions (6.He Z. Chillingworth R.K. Ferenczi M.A. The ATPase activity in isometric and shortening skeletal muscle fibers.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 453: 31-41Google Scholar). The T-shaped aluminum clips on either end of the trabeculae were attached to hooks passing through slits at either end of the trough and were glued in place with shellac dissolved in ethanol. One hook was attached to a force transducer and the other to a servo-motor. The sarcomere length was set as described below and the muscle dimensions were measured using a ×40 water immersion objective (Zeiss, Germany; 0.75 numerical aperture) mounted on the epifluorescence microscope. Cross-sectional area was calculated from width and depth measurements assuming an elliptical cross-section. All experiments were performed at 20 °C. The beam of a Helium-Neon laser (wavelength 632.8 nm, 1-mm diameter beam, Lambda Photometrics, Herts, UK; LGK 7627) illuminated the tissue to produce a diffraction pattern caused by the regular arrangement of sarcomeres. The diffracted light produces a zero order band and first-order bands on either side of the central spot. The sarcomere length is calculated using Bragg's law. The muscle length is slowly adjusted using a micrometer screw gauge to change the distance between the hooks, whereas monitoring the laser diffraction pattern, until the desired sarcomere length (SL) is reached. In this study the initial sarcomere length was set to 1.9 or 2.1 μm (see below). The muscle was taken through a series of solutions (Table 1) to place the muscle into a rigor state prior to activation with minimal force development: pre-rigor solution for 5 min, Ca2+-free rigor solution for 5 min, and Ca2+-rigor solution for 5 min. All solutions were made up to 150 mmol/liter of ionic strength, adjusted with potassium propionate, and pH 7.1, adjusted with potassium hydroxide, at 20 °C. The ionic strength and volume of chemical constituents in each experimental solution was calculated with the aid of a solution mixing program (7.Ferenczi M.A. Goldman Y.E. Simmons R.M. The dependence of force and shortening velocity on substrate concentration in skinned muscle fibres from Rana temporaria.J. Physiol. 1984; 350: 519-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Once in a rigor state the muscle was placed in a loading solution containing 1.0–1.2 mmol/liter of MDCC-PBP (see below) and 5 mmol/liter of P3-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyladenosine-5′-triphosphate (NPE-caged ATP) for 5 min and either 1 or 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+. The muscle was then transferred to the quartz trough, containing silicone oil (Dow Corning 200 Fluid 50cS, Coventry, UK). A pulse from a 347-nm frequency-doubled ruby laser (30-ns light pulses, 80–120 mJ; QSR 2, Lumonics, Rugby, UK) was focused on the muscle to an ellipse, ∼0.5 × 3 mm at the trabecula. A single pulse from the laser-photolyzed NPE-caged ATP liberating ∼1.5 mmol/liter of ATP (102 s−1 at 20 °C) into the myofilament space initiated contraction of the muscle (8.He Z.H. Chillingworth R.K. Brune M. Corrie J.E. Trentham D.R. Webb M.R. Ferenczi M.A. ATPase kinetics on activation of rabbit and frog-permeabilized isometric muscle fibers. A real time phosphate assay.J. Physiol. 1997; 501: 125-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This produces a rapid activation reducing damage caused by diffusion-limited nonhomogenous activation through the trabecula thickness (9.Moisescu D.G. Thieleczek R. Calcium and strontium concentration changes within skinned muscle preparations following a change in the external bathing solution.J. Physiol. 1978; 275: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition the muscle can be activated from rigor, ensuring that most of the cross-bridges are synchronized in the attached nucleotide-free state (10.Goldman Y.E. Hibberd M.G. Trentham D.R. Relaxation of rabbit psoas muscle fibres from rigor by photochemical generation of adenosine 5′-triphosphate.J. Physiol. 1984; 354: 577-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). With regards to the potential rise in temperature caused by the laser flash, calculations (8.He Z.H. Chillingworth R.K. Brune M. Corrie J.E. Trentham D.R. Webb M.R. Ferenczi M.A. ATPase kinetics on activation of rabbit and frog-permeabilized isometric muscle fibers. A real time phosphate assay.J. Physiol. 1997; 501: 125-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed that absorption of the laser flash energy would cause a rise in temperature of less than 3 °C and repeated exposure of isometrically contracting muscle to laser pulses showed no force rise associated with the flash, indicating that the temperature did not increase enough to affect the contractile process (11.Ferenczi M.A. Isometric tension provides an accurate measurement of the temperature of single glycerinated muscle fibres from the rabbit.J. Physiol. 1985; 369: 72Google Scholar). Silicone oil was used to reduce background fluorescence in the bathing solution as only the trabecula contained the fluorophore. For all experiments, the preparation was activated only once to avoid possible fiber deterioration by photodamage or force generation. In the current experiments muscles were activated in the presence of Ca2+ at a free concentration of either 32 or 1 μmol/liter. Force was measured by a force transducer (Kronex, Oakland, CA, type AE-801, frequency response 1.6 kHz) attached to one end of the muscle. The other end was attached to a servo-motor capable of making longitudinal movements of up to 0.1 mm within 500 μs. The motor consisted of a modified loudspeaker coil (RS Components, Corby, UK, 8 ohms, 40 mm diameter) operated in a position feedback mode (6.He Z. Chillingworth R.K. Ferenczi M.A. The ATPase activity in isometric and shortening skeletal muscle fibers.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 453: 31-41Google Scholar). Mechanical perturbations were applied 400 ms after the laser flash, once the force reached the isometric plateau. A ramp stretch was applied that increased sarcomere length by 7.5% of the sarcomere length over 300 ms. After the end of the ramp, the trabecula length was kept constant for 300 ms, following which a ramp release was applied, with the same magnitude and velocity but in the reverse direction as the ramp stretch. Stiffness per half-sarcomere was derived from the gradient of linear fits of force plotted against half-sarcomere length. Half-sarcomere length was determined from the motor movement assuming the initial sarcomere length at the start of the stretch was 1.9 μm and that a total length change of 7.5% was transmitted to the sarcomeres. The rate of Pi release and ATPase activity was calculated from the change in fluorescence of the MDCC-PBP. Fluorescence was collected using the ×40 objective described above and converted to an electrical signal by a photomultiplier tube (Thorn, type 9224 QB). The excitation light (4 milliwatt, 440-nm laser diode module (Laser2000, PPM16 (LD1504)G2)) was transmitted through an adjustable aperture and emission was recorded through a 460-nm interference filter (Glen Spectra, Stanmore, UK; DF10 0242 DTM, % T = 70, FWHM = 10 nm). A dichroic mirror (reflecting at 350–425 nm, >450 nm % T = 95) separated the excitation and emission beams. The fluorescence signal shows a transient downward signal immediately following the laser flash. This drop in fluorescence is caused by an aci-nitro intermediate formed during the photolysis of NPE-caged ATP. This aci-nitro intermediate has a high absorbance of light at 420 nm (12.McCray J.A. Herbette L. Kihara T. Trentham D.R. A new approach to time-resolved studies of ATP-requiring biological systems. Laser flash photolysis of caged ATP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) thus reducing fluorescence excitation and emission. The rate constant for aci-nitro decay (6.He Z. Chillingworth R.K. Ferenczi M.A. The ATPase activity in isometric and shortening skeletal muscle fibers.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 453: 31-41Google Scholar) at 20 °C is 120 s−1. Fluorescence signals were corrected for aci-nitro decay using an exponential with the appropriate amplitude to match that of the data. The artifact is short-lived and only affects the ATPase measurements in the first 100 ms after the laser flash, therefore it does not affect the response to stretches and releases as these were imposed long after it had subsided. The fluorescence signal was corrected for the volume change during stretch, as the number of sarcomeres optically sampled during the stretch phase decreased in proportion to the extent of stretch. The signal was normalized to the signal obtained once the MDCC-PBP was saturated and multiplied by the MDCC-PBP concentration. The following relationship was used to calculate [Pi] as the concentration of Pi bound to MDCC-PBP: [Pi] = (ΔF × [MDCC-PBP])/ΔFmax, where ΔF is the change in fluorescence and ΔFmax is the fluorescence signal when MDCC-PBP is saturated. The active component of MDCC-PBP (the fraction able to bind Pi, range 50–70% of total protein) is determined for each new preparation of the protein. The MDCC-PBP·Pi binding is 1:1 (mol:mol), so it is straightforward to calibrate the capacity for Pi to the maximum fluorescence change. Generally, 1–1.2 mmol/liter of active MDCC-PBP was added to each muscle preparation. The Pi released from the trabecula is the sum of Pi bound to MDCC-PBP and the increase in free Pi. The apparent dissociation constant of MDCC-PBP for Pi (Kd = 15.8 μmol/liter) was used to calculate the free [Pi] not bound to MDCC-PBP (13.Curtin N.A. West T.G. Ferenczi M.A. He Z.H. Sun Y.B. Irving M. Woledge R.C. Rate of actomyosin ATP hydrolysis diminishes during isometric contraction.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 538 (discussion 625–626): 613-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of free Pi during the protocol is kept low by MDCC-PBP (<10 μmol/liter) until saturation of MDCC-PBP, after which it begins to rise. Traces in the figures show the Pi release based on the measured fluorescence change and the Kd of MDCC-PBP for Pi. The rate of Pi release is calculated from the slope of the change in Pi (middle panel, Fig. 1), and is expressed as a rate constant (= Pi release rate/120 μmol/liter) where 120 μmol/liter is taken as the active site concentration for myosin, as explained below. Force and fluorescence were sampled at 10 kHz. In fast mammalian skeletal muscle fibers the myosin active site concentration is taken as 150 μmol/liter (6.He Z. Chillingworth R.K. Ferenczi M.A. The ATPase activity in isometric and shortening skeletal muscle fibers.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 453: 31-41Google Scholar), but is lower in rat trabeculae because of the extensive mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum. In myofibrils, the myosin concentration is calculated from the lattice geometry (14.Millman B. The filament lattice of striated muscle.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 359-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), with 294 myosin molecules per 1.6-μm long thick filament. At SL of 1.9 μm, the myosin head concentration is 306 μmol/liter of myofilament lattice. Microscopical reconstruction of the cross-section of trabeculae suggest that ∼58% of the trabecula cross-section is occupied by myofilament lattice (15.Mühlfeld C. Singer D. Engelhardt D. Richter J. Schmiedl A. Electron microscopy and microcalorimetry of the postnatal rat heart (Rattus norvegicus).Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2005; 141: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This would suggest a myosin head concentration of 177 μmol/liter of trabecula. We used a myosin head concentration in our preparations of 120 μmol/liter to account for a 48% swelling caused by permeabilization. Fig. 1 illustrates the protocol and shows that at both 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+ (i.e. pCa 6 and 4.5) force increased immediately upon photolytic release of ATP to reach an approximately steady isometric force. The force generated at 400 ms was taken as a measure of the isometric force level. At 1 μmol/liter of Ca2+ the isometric plateau was 25.7 ± 4.7 kN m−2 (n = 6), which was significantly lower (p = 0.006) than that at 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, 48.8 ± 5.2 kN m−2 (n = 9). Subtracting the corresponding passive tension measured in the presence of BDM, namely 2.6 kN m−2, gives the net isometric force generated by cross-bridges: 23.1 and 46.2 kN m−2 for 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+ at a SL of 1.9 μm. The slower force rise at 1 than at 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+ approaches statistical significance (p = 0.06) with times to reach half the plateau force, t½, of 77.5 ± 11.0 and 58.1 ± 11.0 ms, respectively. The difference in responses at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+ are shown in Table 2.TABLE 2Effect of activation levels at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+Effect of activation levels at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+Ratio of force levelsRatio of Pi release ratesFirst turnover11.04Isometric steady state0.50.63Force enhancement at end of stretch and Pi release during stretch1.381.13Isometric state after stretch0.680.94Force at end of release and Pi release during shortening0.560.74Isometric steady state after release0.450.48 Open table in a new tab Like force, the rate of Pi release increases most rapidly at the start of contraction. The fast phase of Pi release lasts approximately the time taken for 0.12 mmol/liter of Pi to be released, which corresponds to 1 turnover of all the myosin active sites. We cannot say whether this means that each cross-bridge undertakes a single turnover during force rise, or whether a smaller fraction of cross-bridges undertake multiple turnovers. The rate of Pi release in this period, 15.4 ± 1.4 s−1 (expressed relative to the myosin active site concentration), is independent of [Ca2+] (Figs. 1 and 3 and Table 2). During the isometric phase, the rate of Pi release is 5.15 ± 1.03 and 8.23 ± 0.50 s−1 at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, respectively (p < 0.05). Force rapidly increases during the stretch. At 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+ a short-lasting dip is observed ∼30 ms after the start of the stretch, and is followed by a linear rise in force. At 1 μmol/liter of Ca2+, a similar time course is observed, but the dip is not observed (Fig. 1). From ∼0.1 s after the beginning of the stretch, to the end of the stretch, force rises linearly with extension. The amplitude of the initial fast phase of force rise is calculated by subtracting the isometric force reached immediately before the stretch from the value at 0.1 s after the beginning of the stretch calculated from the linear regression of force versus time. The fast phases have an amplitude of 3.5 ± 3.1 and 3.2 ± 2.2 kN m−2 at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, respectively. Considering that the amplitude of the stretch applied to the trabeculae results in a 7.5% extension of the sarcomere (see ”Experimental Procedures“), the extension experienced during the fast phase of force rise corresponds to ∼12% of the total length change, namely an extension of ∼7 nm per half-sarcomere. The fast phase of force rise may thus indicate the force exerted by attached cross-bridges as they are being stretched. When the stretch exceeds ∼7 nm, these cross-bridges are brought beyond their attachment range and detach. The fast phase amplitudes and the rate of rise of force during stretch are independent of [Ca2+]. Stiffness was measured during the second phase of force rise when force rises linearly with extension (see ”Experimental Procedures“ for stiffness calculation). Stiffness of the trabeculae, taken as the force change per cross-sectional area divided by the length change per half-sarcomere, is 460 ± 162 and 490 ± 143 kN m−2 μm−1 at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, respectively. Following a rapid initial rise, stiffness remains constant during the stretch and is not affected by [Ca2+]. Force measured at the end of the stretch shows that stretch increased the isometric force 2.5-fold at 1 μmol/liter of Ca2+ and 1.7-fold at 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+. After the end of the stretch, force dropped to a new isometric plateau that was significantly higher than that prior to the stretch, a process known in skeletal muscle as force enhancement after stretch (16.Herzog W.

Biol. 2003; 206: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17.Pinniger G.J. Ranatunga K.W. Offer G. Cross-bridge and non-cross-bridge contributions to tension in lengthening rat muscle.

Force enhancement following stretch in a single sarcomere.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C1398-C1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which is attributed to stretch of parallel elastic components such as titin. The ratio of force relative to that prior to stretch was 2.0 at low [Ca2+], greater than the factor of 1.4 at saturating [Ca2+]. The force decay from the peak after the stretch at 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+ was fit by a single exponential process characterized by a rate constant of 59 s−1 (Fig. 2). At 1 μmol/liter of Ca2+, the force decay is described by a double exponential decay, with a fast component set to 59 s−1 as seen at 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, and a slower component of 10 s−1; the fast and slow decays represent 62.3 and 37.7% of the total force decay. The amplitude of the fast 59 s−1 force decay component represents 12 and 14% of the peak force attained at the end of the stretch at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, respectively. Thus, the amplitude of the fast component of force decay is largely independent of calcium concentration. Following the isometric phase at long length, the trabeculae are allowed to shorten, to return to the sarcomere length prior to the application of stretch. The release causes force to decrease rapidly to 6.1 ± 3.4 and 10.9 ± 1.7 kN m−2 at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, respectively. During the release, force falls toward a low value corresponding to the force-velocity relationship for the cardiac muscle. Following the release, force rises again, but more slowly than after photolytic release of ATP (t½ of 121 and 86 ms) to 16.0 ± 4.8 and 36.3 ± 3.0 kN m−2 at 1 and 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+, respectively. These force levels are about half the force attained during the initial force rise to an isometric plateau. The main features of the force changes seen at 32 μmol/liter of Ca2+"
https://openalex.org/W2040544660,"Widespread overharvesting of top consumers of the world’s ecosystems has “skewed” food webs, in terms of biomass and species richness, towards a generally greater domination at lower trophic levels. This skewing is exacerbated in locations where exotic species are predominantly low-trophic level consumers such as benthic macrophytes, detritivores, and filter feeders. However, in some systems where numerous exotic predators have been added, sometimes purposefully as in many freshwater systems, food webs are skewed in the opposite direction toward consumer dominance. Little is known about how such modifications to food web topology, e.g., changes in the ratio of predator to prey species richness, affect ecosystem functioning. We experimentally measured the effects of trophic skew on production in an estuarine food web by manipulating ratios of species richness across three trophic levels in experimental mesocosms. After 24 days, increasing macroalgal richness promoted both plant biomass and grazer abundance, although the positive effect on plant biomass disappeared in the presence of grazers. The strongest trophic cascade on the experimentally stocked macroalgae emerged in communities with a greater ratio of prey to predator richness (bottom-rich food webs), while stronger cascades on the accumulation of naturally colonizing algae (primarily microalgae with some early successional macroalgae that recruited and grew in the mesocosms) generally emerged in communities with greater predator to prey richness (the more top-rich food webs). These results suggest that trophic skewing of species richness and overall changes in food web topology can influence marine community structure and food web dynamics in complex ways, emphasizing the need for multitrophic approaches to understand the consequences of marine extinctions and invasions."
https://openalex.org/W2059567936,"Zbed4, a member of the BED subclass of Zinc-finger proteins, is expressed in cone photoreceptors and glial Müller cells of human retina whereas it is only present in Müller cells of mouse retina. To characterize structural and functional properties of Zbed4, enough amounts of purified protein were needed. Thus, recombinant Zbed4 was expressed in E. coli and its refolding conditions optimized for the production of homogenous and functionally active protein. Zbed4's secondary structure, determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, showed that this protein contains 32% α-helices, 18% β-sheets, 20% turns and 30% unordered structures. CASTing was used to identify the target sites of Zbed4 in DNA. The majority of the DNA fragments obtained contained poly-Gs and some of them had, in addition, the core signature of GC boxes; a few clones had only GC-boxes. With electrophoretic mobility shift assays we demonstrated that Zbed4 binds both not only to DNA and but also to RNA oligonucleotides with very high affinity, interacting with poly-G tracts that have a minimum of 5 Gs; its binding to and GC-box consensus sequences. However, the latter binding depends on the GC-box flanking nucleotides. We also found that Zbed4 interacts in Y79 retinoblastoma cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (SAFB1), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and cellular myosin 9 (MYH9), as shown with immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry studies as well as gel overlay assays. In addition, immunostaining corroborated the co-localization of Zbed4 with these proteins. Most importantly, in vitro experiments using constructs containing promoters of genes directing expression of the luciferase gene, showed that Zbed4 transactivates the transcription of those promoters with poly-G tracts."
https://openalex.org/W1984029124,"HLA-DR*04 was identified as a predictor of HIV-Associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), low CD4 T-cell responses to HIV, and low plasma HIV RNA levels in a U.S. cohort. We hypothesized that low CD4 T-cell activation leads to poor immune control of HIV in the CNS, predisposing to HAND, but also provided fewer target (activated CD4 T-cells) for HIV replication. To assess the consistency of these HLA Class II associations in a new cohort and extend analysis to HLA Class I, HLA types, neurocognitive, and virologic status were examined in a cohort of former plasma donors in China.178 HIV infected individuals in Anhui China, were HLA typed and underwent neurocognitive evaluations (using locally standardized norms), neuromedical, treatment and virologic assessments at baseline and at 12 months.HLA DR*04 was associated with a higher rate of baseline neurocognitive impairment (p = 0.04), neurocognitive decline (p = 0.04), and lower levels of HIV RNA in plasma (p = 0.05). HLA Class I alleles (B*27,57,58,A*03,33) that specify a CD8 T-cell response to conserved HIV sequences were neuroprotective, associated with less impairment at baseline (p = 0.037), at month 012 (p = 0.013) and less neurocognitive decline (p = 0.023) in the interval. Consistent with the theory that effective CD8 T-cell responses require CD4 T-cell support, the HLA DR*04 allele reduced the neuroprotective effect of the Class I alleles. The presence of HLA-DR*04 and the Alzheimer associated allele ApoE4 in the same individual had a synergistic negative effect on cognition (p = 0.003).Despite major background differences between U.S. and Anhui China cohorts, HLA DR*04 predicted neurocognitive impairment and lower plasma HIV RNA levels in both populations. HLA Class I alleles associated with CD8 T-cell control of HIV were associated with protection from HAND, but protection was reduced in the presence of HLA-DR*04."

However, the organizational principles underlying their genetic regulatory networks still await investigation. Here we performed Network Component Analysis (NCA) and Pathway Crosstalk Analysis (PCA) to construct a regulatory network in human lung cancer (A549) cells which were treated with 50 uM motexafin gadolinium (MGd), a metal cation-containing chemotherapeutic drug for 4, 12, and 24 hours. We identified a set of key TFs, known target genes for these TFs, and signaling pathways involved in regulatory networks. Our work showed that putative interactions between these TFs (such as ESR1/Sp1, E2F1/Sp1, c-MYC-ESR, Smad3/c-Myc, and NFKB1/RELA), between TFs and their target genes (such as BMP41/Est1, TSC2/Myc, APE1/Sp1/p53, RARA/HOXA1, and SP1/USF2), and between signaling pathways (such as PPAR signaling pathway and Adipocytokines signaling pathway). These results will provide insights into the regulatory mechanism of MGd-treated human lung cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053943865,"A general understanding of the complex phenomenon of protein evolution requires the accurate description of the constraints that define the sub-space of proteins with mutations that do not appreciably reduce the fitness of the organism. Such constraints can have multiple origins, in this work we present a model for constrained evolutionary trajectories represented by a Markovian process throughout a set of protein-like structures artificially constructed to be topological intermediates between the structure of two natural occurring proteins. The number and type of intermediate steps defines how constrained the total evolutionary process is. By using a coarse-grained representation for the protein structures, we derive an analytic formulation of the transition rates between each of the intermediate structures. The results indicate that compact structures with a high number of hydrogen bonds are more probable and have a higher likelihood to arise during evolution. Knowledge of the transition rates allows for the study of complex evolutionary pathways represented by trajectories through a set of intermediate structures."
