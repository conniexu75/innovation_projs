https://openalex.org/W2101241828,"To investigate the neural substrates that underlie spontaneous musical performance, we examined improvisation in professional jazz pianists using functional MRI. By employing two paradigms that differed widely in musical complexity, we found that improvisation (compared to production of over-learned musical sequences) was consistently characterized by a dissociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex: extensive deactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbital regions with focal activation of the medial prefrontal (frontal polar) cortex. Such a pattern may reflect a combination of psychological processes required for spontaneous improvisation, in which internally motivated, stimulus-independent behaviors unfold in the absence of central processes that typically mediate self-monitoring and conscious volitional control of ongoing performance. Changes in prefrontal activity during improvisation were accompanied by widespread activation of neocortical sensorimotor areas (that mediate the organization and execution of musical performance) as well as deactivation of limbic structures (that regulate motivation and emotional tone). This distributed neural pattern may provide a cognitive context that enables the emergence of spontaneous creative activity."
https://openalex.org/W2027720028,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the disease protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although normal TDP-43 is a nuclear protein, pathological TDP-43 is redistributed and sequestered as insoluble aggregates in neuronal nuclei, perikarya, and neurites. Here we recapitulate these pathological phenotypes in cultured cells by altering endogenous TDP-43 nuclear trafficking and by expressing mutants with defective nuclear localization (TDP-43-ΔNLS) or nuclear export signals (TDP-43-ΔNES). Restricting endogenous cytoplasmic TDP-43 from entering the nucleus or preventing its exit out of the nucleus resulted in TDP-43 aggregate formation. TDP-43-ΔNLS accumulates as insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates and sequesters endogenous TDP-43, thereby depleting normal nuclear TDP-43, whereas TDP-43-ΔNES forms insoluble nuclear aggregates with endogenous TDP-43. Mutant forms of TDP-43 also replicate the biochemical profile of pathological TDP-43 in FTLD-U/ALS. Thus, FTLD-U/ALS pathogenesis may be linked mechanistically to deleterious perturbations of nuclear trafficking and solubility of TDP-43.

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), encoded by the TARDBP gene on chromosome 1, is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein implicated in repression of gene transcription, inhibition of exon splicing, and interactions with splicing factors and nuclear bodies (1Ayala Y.M.

Since FTLD patients often develop motor neuron disease consistent with ALS and since ALS patients can also develop cognitive impairment and FTLD, the presence of TDP-43 neuropathology in both disorders provides a molecular link connecting FTLD and ALS as a clinicopathological spectrum of the same neurodegenerative disorder (i.e. TDP-43 proteinopathy) (3Davidson Y.

We showed previously that the presence of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in disease neurons is accompanied by a dramatic clearance of normal TDP-43 staining, suggesting a redistribution of TDP-43 from the entire nucleus to a focal point adjacent to the nucleus (4Neumann M.

Moreover, normal TDP-43 is found to be condensed as intranuclear inclusions mainly in familial FTLD with granulin (GRN) mutations and a rare disease linked to valosin-containing protein mutations (4Neumann M.

Here we model TDP-43 cytoplasmic, neuritic, and nuclear inclusions in cultured cells and demonstrate that perturbation of endogenous TDP-43 trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm leads to aggregate formation. Furthermore, the expression of mutant TDP-43 with defective nuclear localization (ΔNLS) or nuclear export signals (ΔNES) perturbs endogenous TDP-43 trafficking and recapitulates the unique TDP-43 pathologies that are signatures of the FTLD-U and ALS spectrum of disease. Our data implicate altered TDP-43 trafficking as a pathogenic mechanism underlying FTLD-U and ALS. Constructs—cDNA encoding human TDP-43 (accession number NM 007375) in the plasmid pENTR-221 was obtained from Invitrogen. The addition of a Myc epitope tag to the 5′-end of TDP-43 was achieved by PCR, using the primers 5′-AAGCTTGATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCGGAAGAGGATCTGTCTGAATATATTCGGGTAACC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGCTACATTCCCCAGCCAGAAGACTTAGA-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Following sequence analysis, the PCR product was then subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) using restriction sites HindIII and XbaI, creating pcDNA 3.1/Myc-TDP-43. N-terminal FLAG-tagged cDNA encoding the longest mouse isoform of TDP-43 (pEFFLAG-TDP-43-L; accession number AY 145556) was kindly provided by Dr. C. K. Shen (Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). Site-directed mutations (see below) were generated using the plasmids pcDNA 3.1/Myc-TDP-43 (for human TDP-43) and pEFFLAG-TDP-43-L (for mouse TDP-43) as templates. N-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged TDP-43 (GFP-TDP-43-WT) was generated by subcloning into the enhanced GFP (EGFP)-C1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Site-directed Mutagenesis of TDP-43—Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to create sets of missense mutations for the current study (ΔNLS1, K82A/R83A/K84A; ΔNLS2, K95A/K97A/R98A; ΔNLS1/2, K82A/R83A/K84A/K95A/K97A/R98A; ΔNES1, I239A/L243A; ΔNES2, L248A/I249A/I250A). The sequences of the mutagenized oligonucleotides were as follows: ΔNLS1, 5′-CAACTATCCAAAAGATAACGCAGCAGCAATGGATGAGACAGATGC-3′; ΔNLS2, 5′-GCTTCATCAGCAGTGGCAGTGGCAGCAGCAGTCCAGAAAACATCC-3′; ΔNES1, 5′-GCAGATGATCAGGCTGCGCAGTCTGCTTGTGGAGAGGAC-3′; ΔNES2, 5′-CTTTGTGGAGAGGACGCGGCGGCTAAAGGAATCAGCG-3′. All constructs were subjected to sequence analysis, and the position of each mutation is shown in Fig. 3B. Antibodies—Commercial antibodies used in this study were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-TDP-43 antibody raised to amino acids (aa) 1-260 (Protein Tech Group, Chicago, IL), human specific mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised to the same TDP-43 sequence (2E2-D3) (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan), anti-MAP2 mAb (AP14) (14Geisert Jr., E.E.

Anti-heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 mAb (4B10) and anti-heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 mAb (4F4) were generous gifts from Dr. G. Dreyfuss ((15Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Two polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits (Covance Research Products Inc., Denver, PA). The first was an N terminus-specific antibody raised against a synthetic peptide near the N terminus of human TDP-43 corresponding to amino acid residues 6-24. The other is a C terminus-specific TDP-43 antibody raised against an extreme C-terminal synthetic peptide, corresponding to amino acid residues 394-414 of human TDP-43. 3L. M. Igaz, L. K. Kwong, Y.

Cell Culture and Transfection—QBI-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamate. tsBN2 cells, a generous gift from Dr. Mary Dasso (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), were maintained at 33 °C (permissive temperature) or 39.5 °C (nonpermissive temperature) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamate as previously described (16Ohtsubo M.

Briefly, dissociated cells were plated at a density of 50,000-100,000 cells/cm2 in poly-l-lysine glass bottom culture dishes (MatTak, Ashland, MA) and maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mm l-glutamate. QBI-293 cells were transfected using the Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) system and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 5-7 days in vitro according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, naive QBI-293 cells were treated with 50 μm leptomycin B (18Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp.

Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.02 or 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, blocked with 5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and nuclei were detected using DAPI. To demonstrate the presence of TDP-43 aggregates, cells were extracted with 0.2% Triton X-100 prior to fixation to remove detergent-soluble pools of TDP-43. All cells were analyzed using a Nikon TE-2000-E (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured using a CoolSnap-HQ camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ). All micrographs show individual cells representative of the total cell population. Immunohistochemistry on tissue sections from FTLD-U cases using rabbit anti-TDP-43 antibody was conducted as previously described (4Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C.

Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4651) Google Scholar). Solubility and Biochemical Analysis—To examine the solubility profile of TDP-43, sequential extractions were performed. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in cold RIPA buffer, and sonicated. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate the RIPA-soluble samples. To prevent carry-overs, the resulting pellets were washed twice (i.e. resonicated and recentrifuged). Only the supernatants from the first centrifugation were analyzed. RIPA-insoluble pellets were then extracted with urea buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.5), sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C. Protease inhibitors were added to all buffers prior to use (1 mm PMSF and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), and proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% powdered milk and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), and blots were developed with Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Digital images were acquired using a Fuji Film Intelligent Darkbox II (Fuji Systems, Stamford, CT). Immunoprecipitation—Transfected and nontransfected cells were lysed in urea buffer as described above and then diluted 10-fold in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were preabsorbed with Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal TDP-43 antibody conjugated to Protein A/G-agarose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, and 10% sucrose), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot as described previously (4Neumann M.

Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4651) Google Scholar). TDP-43 is ubiquitously expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal cells as well as in the brain of multiple species (e.g. rats, mice, and humans) (Fig. 1A). Although TDP-43 predominately localizes to the nucleus of nonneuronal cells (QBI-293) and primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1B), low levels of TDP-43 are present in the cytoplasm. Pretreatment of cells with 0.02% Triton X-100, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane but not the nuclear membrane (19Peeples M.E. Virology. 1988; 162: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), enabled detection of cytoplasmic TDP-43 (Fig. 1C). To determine if TDP-43 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, we used a BHK21-derived cell line (tsBN2) that harbors a temperature-sensitive point mutation in the RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1) gene (16Ohtsubo M. Kai R. Furuno N. Sekiguchi T. Sekiguchi M. Hayashida H. Kuma K. Miyata T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. Ohtsubo M. Kai R. Furuno N. Sekiguchi T. Sekiguchi M. Hayashida H. Kuma K. Miyata T. Fukushige S.

Genet. 2005; 37: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature (33 °C), tsBN2 cells function normally, but at the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 °C), RCC1 rapidly loses its activity, nuclear Ran-GTP redistributes to the cytoplasm, and as a result, nuclear protein import is blocked. At 33 °C, the expression of endogenous TDP-43 localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2, A and B). However, at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5 °C, endogenous TDP-43 was detected in the cytoplasm in association with the clearance of nuclear TDP-43 and formation of punctuate cytoplasmic aggregates (Fig. 2, C and D). This was specific to tsBN2 cells, since no alteration in the nuclear localization of TDP-43 was observed in QBI-293 cells cultured at 33 or 39.5 °C (data not shown). Thus, inhibition of TDP-43 translocation into nuclei leads to the accumulation and sequestration of TDP-43 as cytoplasmic aggregates. Previous studies in post-mortem brain and spinal cord sections of FTLD-U and ALS cases showed a dramatic clearance of nuclear TDP-43 in neurons with TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates (4Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A.

To examine if formation of these aggregates leads to the sequestration of nuclear TDP-43 in the cytoplasm, we developed a cell model to study the translocation of nuclear TDP-43 to the cytoplasm. We identified a specific bipartite NLS sequence (i.e. two clusters of basic residues separated by a stretch of 9-12 residues), located at aa residues 82-98 in both human and mouse TDP-43, that is predicted to be required for nuclear targeting (Fig. 3B). To demonstrate that these sequences are required for TDP-43 entry into the nucleus, three defective ΔNLS mutants were generated: 1) ΔNLS1, basic aa Lys-Arg-Lys (residues 82-84) mutated to Ala-Ala-Ala; 2) ΔNLS2, basic aa Lys (residue 95) and Lys-Arg (residues 97 and 98) mutated to Ala; 3) ΔNLS1/2, both ΔNLS1 and ΔNLS2 mutated to Ala (Fig. 3B). WT-TDP-43 and the TDP-43 mutants were N-terminally Myc-tagged (designated as Myc-TDP-43-WT and Myc-TDP-43-NLS) to facilitate the identification of the transgenes independently from the endogenous protein. Transient transfection of Myc-TDP-43-WT into QBI-293 cells showed complete colocalization with endogenous TDP-43 at 24 and 72 h (Fig. 3, C-E). By contrast, transfection of all Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants resulted in cytoplasmic expression (Figs. 3, F-H, and S2), confirming that alteration in the basic residues within the specific bipartite NLS sequence impairs nuclear targeting of TDP-43. Similar cytoplasmic localization of all three Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants, as well as untagged TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants, was observed when expressed in HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary, or Neuro 2a cells (data not shown). Although endogenous TDP-43 was detectable in the nucleus of QBI-293 cells 24 h post-transfection with TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants (Figs. 3, F-H, and S1, A-C and G-I), it was virtually absent from the nucleus after 72 h (Figs. 3, I-K, and S1, D-F and J-L). To investigate this further, we co-expressed GFP-tagged WT-TDP-43 (GFP-TDP-43-WT) with either Myc-TDP-43-WT or Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS1. GFP-TDP-43-WT colocalized in the nucleus with Myc-TDP-43-WT (Fig. 4, A-C) and similarly localized to the nucleus when coexpressed with Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS1 at 24 h (Fig. 4, D-F). However, 72 h post-transfection, GFP-TDP-43-WT shifted to the cytoplasm and colocalized with Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS1 72 h post-transfection, thereby confirming the abnormal effects of TDP-43-ΔNLS on trafficking of WT endogenous TDP-43 between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 4, G-L). To further demonstrate the cytoplasmic sequestration of endogenous nuclear TDP-43 by TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants, we expressed FLAG-tagged mouse TDP-43 with the ΔNLS1/2 mutation (FLAG-TDP-43-ΔmNLS1/2) in QBI-293 cells and demonstrated cytoplasmic sequestration of endogenous human TDP-43 using a human-specific TDP-43 antibody (Fig. 4, M-R). Thus, nuclear depletion of TDP-43 in QBI-293 cells recapitulates the nuclear clearing of this protein in cells harboring TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions in ALS and FTLD-U cases (Fig. 3A). This nuclear clearance was specific to TDP-43, since no changes in the distribution of other nuclear proteins, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2, were observed (Fig. S2). The redistribution and sequestration of endogenous TDP-43 were also examined in primary hippocampal neurons transfected with Myc-TDP-43-WT or Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS1. Although Myc-TDP-43-WT localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5, A-C), transfection with Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS1 resulted in cytoplasmic and axonal accumulation of Myc-TDP-43 (Fig. 5, D-F). This was associated with the clearance of endogenous nuclear TDP-43 (Fig. 5, G-I) and neuritic aggregates of TDP-43 (Fig. 5J) that showed remarkable verisimilitude to TDP-43 pathology in disease neurons of FTLD-U cases (Figs. 3A and 5K) (22Sampathu D.M. Neumann M. Kwong L.K. Chou T.T. Micsenyi M. Truax A. Bruce J. Grossman M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1343-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Next, we asked if the expression of Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants and the sequestration of endogenous TDP-43 lead to the formation of insoluble aggregates composed of both proteins. Immunoblot analysis was conducted on cells transfected with Myc-TDP-43-WT or Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants harvested at 24 and 72 h post-transfection and sequentially extracted with RIPA and urea buffer. Both endogenous and Myc-TDP-43-WT were recovered exclusively in the RIPA fractions (Fig. 6A). Since Myc-TDP-43 migrated slower than endogenous TDP-43, each was detected separately in immunoblots. Although relatively low levels of nuclear Myc-TDP-43-WT were detected at both 24 and 72 h post-transfection, cytoplasmic expression of all three Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants were robust at 24 h, resulting in the partial accumulation of the mutant protein in the urea fractions (Fig. 6A). Moreover, darker exposure of the immunoblot revealed the presence of a high Mr smear and C-terminal fragments in the urea fractions that resemble the ubiquitinated TDP-43 high Mr smear as well as the C-terminal fragments seen in FTLD-U and ALS cases (4Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A.

N-terminal truncation of TDP-43 in these cells was confirmed with the use of antibodies specific for the N and C termini of TDP-43 (Fig. S3). By 72 h post-transfection, endogenous TDP-43 was also detected in the urea fractions along with the Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS mutants, consistent with sequestration of endogenous nuclear TDP-43 in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 6B). Again, high Mr smears and C-terminal fragments were also detected 72 h post-transfection. To demonstrate unequivocally that pathological TDP-43 in high Mr smears is ubiquitinated and a substrate for proteasomal degradation, Myc-TDP-43-WT or Myc-TDP-43-ΔNLS1/2 was cotransfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and incubated with or without lactacystin (LAC), a proteasome inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with TDP-43 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody revealed a ladder and high Mr smear of ubiquitinated TDP-43 species, the abundance of which was enhanced by LAC treatment (Fig. 6C). Endogenous TDP-43 was also ubiquitinated when cells transfected only with HA-tagged ubiquitin construct were treated with LAC, suggesting that normal TDP-43 is degraded by the proteasome. Finally, to visualize the presence of insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm, cells expressing TDP-43-ΔNLS1 were extracted with 0.2% Triton X-100, and two-color immunofluorescence revealed punctate cytoplasmic aggregates (Fig. S4). Thus, multiple complementary approaches enabled us to demonstrate that increased cytosolic TDP-43, either by direct expression in the cytoplasm or by abrogating nuclear import, leads to the sequestration of nuclear TDP-43 in the cytoplasm as insoluble aggregates that replicate the features of TDP-43 pathology in FLTD-U and ALS. Since TDP-43 also accumulates as intranuclear inclusions in FTLD-U and ALS, we asked if perturbation of nuclear TDP-43 by restricting its export leads to the formation of insoluble TDP-43 nuclear inclusions. Treatment of QBI-293 cells with leptomycin B (LMB), a Streptomyces spp. metabolite that specifically inhibits NES-dependent nuclear export (18Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), resulted in the rearrangement of endogenous nuclear TDP-43 and induced formation of small punctate TDP-43 nuclear inclusions (Fig. 7, A-D). This was correlated with the presence of urea-soluble but RIPA-insoluble endogenous TDP-43 in LMB-treated but not untreated cells (Fig. 7E). To further demonstrate that increased nuclear TDP-43 leads to formation of insoluble nuclear aggregates, we used bioinformatics to identify a leucine-rich NES located at aa 239-250 in human TDP-43 (Fig. 3B) and then determined if this predicted NES sequence is required for TDP-43 export from the nucleus. Two N-terminally Myc-tagged TDP-43 mutants with defective NES sequences were generated: 1) ΔNES1, hydrophobic aa Leu (residue 239) and Ile (residue 243) mutated to Ala; 2) ΔNES2, hydrophobic aa Leu-Ile-Ile (residues 248-250) mutated to Ala-Ala-Ala (Fig. 3B). Although expressed Myc-TDP-43-ΔNES was localized to the nucleus, fine granular intranuclear inclusions were detected in a subset of transfected cells at 24 and 72 h (Fig. 7, F-K). Immunoblot analyses confirmed the presence of insoluble nuclear aggregates composed of both endogenous TDP-43 and Myc-TDP-43-ΔNES, since both Myc-TDP-43-ΔNES and endogenous TDP-43 proteins were recovered from the urea fractions at 24 and 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 7, L and M). Thus, these data suggest that altered TDP-43 nuclear exporting sequences lead to the formation of insoluble nuclear aggregates containing both mutant and endogenous TDP-43. In this study, multiple approaches were used to demonstrate that disruption of TDP-43 nuclear trafficking and localization induced formation of insoluble aggregates that recapitulate features of pathological TDP-43 inclusions in human FTLD-U/ALS cases. First, the disturbance of endogenous TDP-43 distribution resulted in the formation of TDP-43 aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Second, overexpression of TDP-43 either in the cytoplasm or nucleus also led to the formation of insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Third, insoluble TDP-43 was ubiquitinated and N-terminally truncated. Finally, endogenous TDP-43 was sequestered within cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates. Thus, these and other data support the hypothesis that perturbation of the delicate balance in trafficking of TDP-43 between nucleus and cytoplasm can lead to the formation of TDP-43 aggregates that recapitulate features of TDP-43 signature lesions of FTLD-U and ALS. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the presence of functional NES and NLS sequences in TDP-43, since expression of mutant NES and NLS in TDP-43 restricted its distribution to the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. We found that both basic motifs within the NLS sequence are independently required for the import of TDP-43 into the nucleus, since alteration of basic residues in either motifs led to its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Similarly, both hydrophobic motifs within the NES sequence are also independently required for TDP-43 export, since modification of either motif prevented its exit to the cytoplasm. Moreover, expression of TDP-43-ΔNES led to the formation of nuclear inclusions composed of endogenous and mutant proteins. Under physiological conditions, low levels of TDP-43 are found in the cytoplasm, but expression of NLS mutants led to sequestration of endogenous TDP-43 in the cytoplasmic aggregates presumably by preventing newly synthesized TDP-43 being imported into the nucleus and/or by inhibiting the re-entry of existing cytoplasmic TDP-43 into the nucleus. Moreover, the accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates also recapitulated the biochemical signature of pathological TDP-43 in FTLD-U and ALS, including a high Mr smear of ubiquitinated TDP-43 and C-terminal TDP-43 fragments. Currently, it is unclear if this cleavage occurs in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, but it is tempting to speculate that TDP-43 C-terminal fragments serve as a nidus for the aggregation and sequestration of TDP-43 into nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inclusions. Further, since most TDP-43 inclusions are cytoplasmic, it is possible that increased trafficking of full-length TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm could occur through other pathogenic mechanisms, leading to the accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates. Since the cellular functions of TDP-43 are currently not well understood, greater insight into the cellular biology of TDP-43, under both physiological and pathogenic conditions, is needed to further our understanding of this newly identified neurodegenerative proteinopathy and to develop new and more effective therapies for these disorders. To that end, the data reported here are significant in that they implicate aberrant nuclear trafficking and altered solubility of TDP-43 in mechanisms underlying FTLD-U and ALS. We thank C.

https://openalex.org/W2136559804,"A Boolean network model of the cell-cycle regulatory network of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces Pombe) is constructed solely on the basis of the known biochemical interaction topology. Simulating the model in the computer, faithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along the cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation models, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory circuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state space, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in circuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a strongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network represents an auto-excited system with external damping."
https://openalex.org/W2069401448,"Background Classic work on visual short-term memory (VSTM) suggests that people store a limited amount of items for subsequent report. However, when human observers are cued to shift attention to one item in VSTM during retention, it seems as if there is a much larger representation, which keeps additional items in a more fragile VSTM store. Thus far, it is not clear whether the capacity of this fragile VSTM store indeed exceeds the traditional capacity limits of VSTM. The current experiments address this issue and explore the capacity, stability, and duration of fragile VSTM representations. Methodology/Principal Findings We presented cues in a change-detection task either just after off-set of the memory array (iconic-cue), 1,000 ms after off-set of the memory array (retro-cue) or after on-set of the probe array (post-cue). We observed three stages in visual information processing 1) iconic memory with unlimited capacity, 2) a four seconds lasting fragile VSTM store with a capacity that is at least a factor of two higher than 3) the robust and capacity-limited form of VSTM. Iconic memory seemed to depend on the strength of the positive after-image resulting from the memory display and was virtually absent under conditions of isoluminance or when intervening light masks were presented. This suggests that iconic memory is driven by prolonged retinal activation beyond stimulus duration. Fragile VSTM representations were not affected by light masks, but were completely overwritten by irrelevant pattern masks that spatially overlapped the memory array. Conclusions/Significance We find that immediately after a stimulus has disappeared from view, subjects can still access information from iconic memory because they can see an after-image of the display. After that period, human observers can still access a substantial, but somewhat more limited amount of information from a high-capacity, but fragile VSTM that is overwritten when new items are presented to the eyes. What is left after that is the traditional VSTM store, with a limit of about four objects. We conclude that human observers store more sustained representations than is evident from standard change detection tasks and that these representations can be accessed at will."

A novel anti-HIV peptide, termed sifuvirtide, was designed based on the three-dimensional structure of the HIV-1 gp41 fusogenic core conformation. Here we report its in vitro anti-HIV potency, its mechanism of action, as well as the results from Phase Ia clinical studies. We demonstrated that sifuvirtide inhibited HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited high potency against infections by a wide range of primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates from multiple genotypes with R5 or X4 phenotypes. Notably, sifuvirtide was also highly effective against T20-resistant strains. Unlike T20, sifuvirtide could efficiently block six-helix bundle formation in a dominant negative fashion. These results suggest that sifuvirtide has a different mechanism of action from that of T20. Phase Ia clinical studies of sifuvirtide (FS0101) in 60 healthy individuals demonstrated good safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles. A single dose regimen (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg) by subcutaneous injection once daily at abdominal sites was well tolerated without serious adverse events. Pharmacokinetic studies of single and multiple administration of sifuvirtide showed that its decay half-lives were 20.0 ± 8.6 h and 26.0 ± 7.9 h, respectively.

Currently, over 33 millions people worldwide are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 3The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; NHR, N-terminal heptad repeat; 6-HB, six-helix bundle structure; CHR, C-terminal heptad repeat; SFT, sifuvirtide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. 3The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; NHR, N-terminal heptad repeat; 6-HB, six-helix bundle structure; CHR, C-terminal heptad repeat; SFT, sifuvirtide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. and around 20 million people have died from AIDS (www.unaids.org). Due to lack of effective vaccines, development of novel anti-HIV drugs is critical to save lives of people with HIV infection. So far, 31 anti-HIV drugs and combinations have been approved for clinical use, and most of them belong to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (www.fda.gov). Application of these drugs in various combinations, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy, has significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of HIV/AIDS (1Palella Jr., F.J. Delaney K.M. Moorman A.C. Loveless M.O. Fuhrer J. Satten G.A. Aschman D.J. Holmberg S.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (8458) Google Scholar). However, more and more HIV/AIDS patients have failed to respond to highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens because of the emergence of variants resistant to the current treatment regimens (2Hogg R.S. Bangsberg D.R. Lima V.D. Alexander C. Bonner S. Yip B. Wood E. Dong W.W. Montaner J.S. Harrigan P.R. PLoS. Med. 2006; 3: e356Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Pillay D. Taylor S. Richman D.D. Rev. Med. Virol. 2000; 10: 231-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of new classes of anti-HIV drugs is urgently needed. The envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 that mediates the attachment and fusion of the viral envelope and the cellular membrane represents a major target for the development of novel antiretroviral therapeutics (4Este J.A. Telenti A. Lancet. 2007; 370: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Moore J.P. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10598-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is a trimer, each of which consists of two non-covalently associated subunits gp120 and gp41 (6Hunter E. Swanstrom R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 187-253PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion is triggered by the binding of gp120 on the virus initially with the CD4 molecule and subsequently with a chemokine receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) on the surface of the target cell (8Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar, 9Doms R.W. Moore J.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F9-F14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions result in a cascade of conformational changes that lead to the formation of a pre-hairpin intermediate of gp41 in which the hydrophobic N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) are exposed and allows the fusion peptides to insert into the target cell membrane (5Moore J.P. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10598-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 7Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). This transient gp41 intermediate then refolds into a stabilized trimer of hairpins, also called six-helix bundle structure (6-HB), which brings the close proximity of the viral envelope and the target cell membrane and results in the completion of the fusion process. Crystallographic and NMR studies show that the core of the hairpin consists of a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of NHR with the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) wrapped on the outside in an anti-parallel fashion (10Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 11Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). In addition, this structure feature has been found in the fusion-mediating subunits of other enveloped viral glycoproteins such as the S2 subunit of SARS corona virus, the GP2 subunits of Ebola virus, the HA2 subunit of influenza virus, the F1 subunits of the paramyxovirus simian virus 5 and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I, and the TM subunits of retroviruses simian immunodeficiency virus, HIV-2, Moloney murine leukemia virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus-1 (13Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Inhibitors capable of disrupting the fusion process hold great promise for clinical antiviral therapeutics. Extensive efforts are being made to develop novel peptide-based as well as small molecule inhibitors targeting the discrete regions of the prehairpin intermediate during the fusion step (14Leonard J.T. Roy K. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 911-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Liu S. Wu S. Jiang S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In general, two major classes of such inhibitors have been described. The first one targets the NHR trimeric coiled-coil either by competitive binding with viral intrinsic CHR or by forming a heterotrimeric NHR with mutated NHR whereby disrupting the subsequent binding with native CHR (15Liu S. Wu S. Jiang S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol.

Drugs. 2006; 15: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For examples, the peptides derived from the CHR such as T20 and its derivative T-1249 demonstrated potent anti-HIV activity in infected individuals, and T20 has been approved for clinical use. A series of mutated NHR peptides highlighted by N36Mut(e,g), where all residues at positions e and g of the helical wheel of the NHR trimeric coiled-coil were mutated, also demonstrated improved anti-HIV activity (16Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Small molecule inhibitors targeting the deep pocket formed by the adjacent NHR monomers are also being investigated (15Liu S. Wu S. Jiang S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Debnath A.K. Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2006; 15: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The second class targets the CHR of gp41. A representative of this class is a recombinant 5-helix protein in which only one of the N-helices in the presumably 6-HB structure is exposed (18Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In addition, a recombinant NHR trimeric coiled-coil formed through artificial disulfide bridges such as NCCG-gp41 and N35CCG-N13 has also been shown to potently inhibit HIV fusion in in vitro assays (19Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that different classes of inhibitors targeting the NHR and CHR, and other classes of antiretroviral drugs, can be synergistic in suppressing viral replications both in vitro and in vivo (20Gustchina E. Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on the three-dimensional structural information of HIV-1 gp41, we have designed a novel anti-HIV peptide, designated sifuvirtide (SFT) (see Fig. 1). This peptide inhibitor has been engineered with different sequence and/or location in relationship to C34, T20, and T-1249. It is 36 amino acid residues in length and shares some sequence and structure features with the native CHR peptide. However, of these 36 residues, sifuvirtide is different from C34 in 16 residues and from T20 in 22 residues. Here, we report its in vitro anti-HIV-1 potency, its mechanism of action, and the results from Phase Ia clinical studies. Trial Participants, Informed Consent, and Institutional Review Board—A clinical Phase Ia study (FS0101) was designed to evaluate sifuvirtide for its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles in 60 healthy individuals. Subjects were healthy Chinese male volunteers aged 20–40 years with body weight of >45 kg and body mass index of 20.0–27.0 kg/m2. Furthermore, subjects were in good healthy condition and were not addicted to smoking or drinking. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Before the study began, the protocol and the informed-consent provisions were reviewed and approved by the independent institutional review board at the study site. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides (sifuvirtide, C34, T20, and N36) were synthesized on a solid phase support, purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and verified for purity by mass spectrometry and amino acid composition. Concentrations of the peptides were determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar-extinction coefficient ϵ (280 nm) of 5500 m–1·cm–1 and 1490 m–1·cm–1 based on the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues (all the peptides tested contain Trp and/or Tyr), respectively. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed as previously described (21He Y. Liu S. Jing W. Lu H. Cai D. Chin D.J. Debnath A.K. Kirchhoff F. Jiang S. J. Biol.

Briefly, an N-peptide (N36) was incubated with the equal molar concentration of C-peptide (C34 or T20) or sifuvirtide at 37 °C for 30 min. The final peptide concentration was 10 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. The isolated N- and C-peptides as well as sifuvirtide were also tested. CD spectra of these individual peptides and peptide mixtures were acquired on a Jasco spectropolarimeter (Model J-715, Jasco Inc., Japan) at room temperature using a 5.0 nm band with, 0.1 nm resolution, 0.1-cm path length, 4.0-s response time, and a 50 nm/min scanning speed. The spectra were corrected by subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent. The α-helical content was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation (–33,000 degrees cm2 dmol–1) according to previous studies (22Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Radigen L. Jiang S. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation was monitored at 222 nm by applying a thermal gradient of 2 °C/min in the range of 4–98 °C. To determine the reversibility, the peptide mixtures were cooled to 4 °C and kept in the CD chamber at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by monitoring of thermal denaturation as described above. The melting curve was smoothened, and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values was calculated using Jasco software utilities. Native-PAGE—Native-PAGE was carried out to determine the 6-HB formation between the N- and C-peptides as described previously (24Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, an N-peptide (N36) was mixed with a C-peptide (C34 or T20) or sifuvirtide at a final concentration of 40 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixture was loaded onto 10 × 1.0-cm precast 18% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) at 25 μl/per well with an equal volume of Tris-glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen). Gel electrophoresis was carried out with 125 V of constant voltage at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged with a FluorChem 8800 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Inhibition of Sifuvirtide on the 6-HB Formation—Inhibitory activity of sifuvirtide on the 6-HB formation was measured by a modified ELISA-based method as previously described (25Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 96-well polystyrene plate (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) was coated with a 6-HB-specific monoclonal antibody NC-1 IgG (4 μg/ml in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.8). A tested peptide (sifuvirtide, C34 or T20) at graded concentrations was mixed with C34-biotin (0.25 μm) and incubated with N36 (0.25 μm) at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then added to the NC-1-coated plate, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min and washing with a washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) three times. Then streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen) and the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) were added sequentially. Absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured using an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC). The percent inhibition by the peptides and the IC50 values were calculated as previously described (26Jiang S.B. Lin K. Neurath A.R. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1557-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Peptide-Lipid Binding Measured by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposome were prepared as described (27Liu S. Jing W. Cheung B. Lu H. Sun J. Yan X. Niu J. Farmar J. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9612-9620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 mg of POPC stock solution was dried under a stream of nitrogen and stored under vacuum overnight to completely remove trace amounts of organic solvent. The dried lipid film was suspended by vortexing in 2 ml of PBS buffer. The resultant multilamellar vesicle suspension was freeze-thawed for 5 cycles and then successively extruded through two stacked polycarbonate filters (0.1 μm) 13 times using an Avanti miniextruder. Binding of sifuvirtide, C34, or T20 to POPC LUVs was measured using a high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) as previously described (27Liu S. Jing W. Cheung B. Lu H. Sun J. Yan X. Niu J. Farmar J. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9612-9620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Solutions were degassed under vacuum prior to use. LUVs of POPC were injected into the chamber containing a peptide solution or buffer only (as a control). The heats generated in control experiments by injecting lipid vesicles into buffer without a peptide were subtracted from the heats produced in the corresponding peptide-lipid binding experiments. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using MicroCal Origin software (version 7.0). Peptide-Lipid Binding Measured by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra of the peptides sifuvirtide, C34, or T20 (10 μm) presented in PBS and POPC LUVs (2 mm), respectively, were obtained on a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer, with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and emission was scanned from 300 to 450 nm at a scan rate of 10 nm/s. Spectra were baseline-corrected by subtracting blank spectra of the corresponding solutions without peptide. Cell-Cell Fusion Assay—A dye transfer assay was used for detection of HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion as previously described (28Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In brief, H9/HIV-1IIIB-infected cells were labeled with a fluorescent reagent, Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and then incubated with MT-2 cells (ratio = 1:5) in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of peptides. The fused and unfused calcein-labeled HIV-1-infected cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with an eyepiece micrometer disc. The percent inhibition of cell-cell fusion and the IC50 values were calculated as described before (28Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Measurement of Anti-HIV-1 Activity of SFT and T20—The inhibitory activity of sifuvirtide on infection by various T20-resistant virus isolates and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain (HIV-1IIIB) was determined as previously described (28Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 104 MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1 isolates at 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture-infective dose) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of sifuvirtide at graded concentrations overnight. Then the culture supernatants were removed, and fresh media were added without sifuvirtide. On the fourth day post-infection, 100 μl of culture supernatants was collected from each well, mixed with equal volumes of 5% Triton X-100, and assayed for p24 antigen by ELISA. The inhibitory activity of sifuvirtide against primary HIV-1 isolates was determined as previously described (28Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors using a standard density gradient (Histopaque-1077, Sigma) centrifugation. The cells were plated in 75-cm2 plastic flasks and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The nonadherent cells were collected and resuspended at 5 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg of phytohemagglutinin/ml, and 100 units of interleukin-2/ml, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 days. The phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cells were infected with the corresponding primary HIV-1 isolates at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 in the absence or presence of sifuvirtide at graded concentrations. Culture media were changed every 3 days. The supernatants were collected 7 days post-infection and tested for p24 antigen by ELISA. The percent inhibition of p24 production and IC50/ IC90 values were calculated. Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic Studies—Sixty healthy male volunteers were enrolled in three studies. In the safety and tolerability study of single dose administration, a total of 40 subjects were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous injection dose of sifuvirtide daily in five dose cohorts. These included: 5 mg (n = 10), 10 mg (n = 8), 20 mg (n = 8), 30 mg (n = 8), and 40 mg (n = 6). Safety was evaluated by adverse events, laboratory test, abdominal ultrasound, electrocardiogram and chest x-ray, and physical examination. In the pharmacokinetic study of single dose administration, a total of 12 subjects were randomized to receive a single, subcutaneous injection once daily dose of 10, 20, and 30 mg of sifuvirtide in a3 × 3 cross-over design. Blood samples were taken at the following time points: 30, 5 min pre-dose, and 5, 15, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 36, 48, and 72 h post-dose. In the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study of multiple dose administration, a total of 12 subjects received multiple subcutaneous injection once daily doses of 30 mg of sifuvirtide (once daily dose ×7 days). On Days 1 and 7, blood samples were taken at the following time points: 30–5 min pre-dose, and 5, 15, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h post-dose. On Day 7, samples were taken at 36, 48, and 72 h post-dose. Serum concentrations of sifuvirtide were measured by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Structure-based Design of SFT—The prototypic peptide is derived from the gp41 CHR sequence of HIV-1 subtype E (117WIEWEREISNYTNQIYEILTESQNQQDRNEKDLLE151). Based on the three-dimensional structural information of HIV-1 gp41 and computer modeling analysis, sifuvirtide (Fig. 1) was engineered to favor its stability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral potency. The residues that are important for activity or stability were maintained unchanged. Charged glutamic acid and lysine residues were introduced into the sifuvirtide to favor the formation of ion pairs (salt bridges) at the i and i+4 positions of the helical conformation. Glu119 was substituted by threonine to cover the hydrophobic pocket. Furthermore, a serine was added to the N terminus of the peptide, because addition of this residue to the N-terminal of an α-helix is expected to increase its stability. After a series of the above-mentioned alterations, the resulting peptide sifuvirtide is composed of 36 residues in length and shares some sequence and structure features with the native CHR peptide. Of these 36 residues, sifuvirtide is different from C34 in 16 residues and from T20 in 22 residues (Fig. 1). Biophysical Characterization of SFT—To study the secondary structure of sifuvirtide, we have measured its CD spectra in the presence or absence of peptide N36. Under the experimental conditions, the CD spectra of sifuvirtide, C34, N36, and T20 did not show a minimum at 222 nm (Fig. 2A), suggesting that these peptides alone have minimum α-helical conformation. The CD spectrum for sifuvirtide is similar to that of C34 and T20 and is typical of peptide with a random coil conformation (29Kliger Y. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CD spectra of sifuvirtide in the presence of N36 display a double minimum at 208 and 222 nm, suggesting that the interaction between sifuvirtide and N36 induces the formation of secondary α-helical structure. Similarly, mixing of peptides C34 and N36 also led to the formation of α-helical complexes manifested by an almost overlapping CD profile with that of sifuvirtide (Fig. 2A). Quantization of the CD data indicated a helical content of 93% for sifuvirtide and 85% for C34 peptide in the presence of N36. T20, on the other hand, does not form α-helical complexes with N36 peptide demonstrated by the lack of minimum at 208 and 222 nm. The result indicated that sifuvirtide binds to N36 in a comparable manner of C34 by forming a typical α-helix, which is in great contrast to that of T20. We then monitored the changes in CD spectra of sifuvirtide/N36 complexes over increasing temperatures from 4 to 98 °C to study the binding affinity of sifuvirtide to N36. Fig. 2B shows the CD thermal denaturation curve of sifuvirtide/N36 in comparison with that of C34/N36 complexes. The sifuvirtide/N36 complexes are found to have a significantly higher level of α-helical content and be more heat-stable than that of C34/N36. The melting temperature (Tm) of sifuvirtide/N36 complexes was ∼72 °C, whereas that of C34/N36 was ∼62 °C (Fig. 2B, inset). The increment of 10 °C suggests higher affinity between sifuvirtide and N36 and higher stability of sifuvirtide/N36 complex compared with C34/N36. Such biophysical characters of sifuvirtide are consistent with our initial aim of peptide design, which is to increase the stability, α-helical propensity, as well as binding capacity to the N-helices. However, T20 cannot form α-helical structure with N36 under our experimental conditions, consistent with previous reports (30Liu S. Lu H. Niu J. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11259-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Unlike T20, SFT Is Able to Form 6-Helix Bundle with N36—We previously developed a native-PAGE-based method to visualize the 6-HB formed by N36/C34 and used it to characterize the antiviral activity of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors (24Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Liu S. Lu H. Niu J. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11259-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this study, native-PAGE was used to study the interaction between sifuvirtide and N36 and its potential in forming the 6-helix bundle. As shown in Fig. 3, N36 (lane 1) exhibited no band, because it carries net positive charges and may migrate up and off the gel. C34 (lane 2), sifuvirtide (lane 4), and T20 (lane 6) each displayed a band in the lower part of the gel. Like C34, sifuvirtide was able to form 6-HB with N36 reflected by the up-shift of a peptide band comparing to sifuvirtide or C34 alone. In contrast, no such changes were found for T20 after mixing with N36, suggesting that T20 and N36 do not form similar complexes like that of sifuvirtide or C34. These findings are consistent with our observations from CD studies (see above). To further analyze the interaction between sifuvirtide with N36, we studied whether sifuvirtide can inhibit the formation of 6-HB between C34-biotin and N36 in solution by our antibody-based ELISA method (25Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both sifuvirtide and C34 were able to disrupt the formation of 6-HB in a dose-dependant manner, whereas T20 failed to do so (Fig. 4). In addition, sifuvirtide demonstrates significant higher potency in disrupting the formation of 6-HB than C34, manifested by its IC50 value of 0.12 μm compared with 0.31 μm of C34 (Fig. 4). Unlike T20, SFT Cannot Interact with Lipid Membrane—Previous studies suggest that the CHR helices located in the outer layer of the 6-HB may interact with the lipid membranes and participate in the formation of fusion pore (31Shu W. Ji H. Lu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1839-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using the POPC LUV liposome system in an isothermal titration calorimetry assay, we measured the heats generated from the interaction of a peptide (sifuvirtide, C34, or T20) with lipid vesicles. As shown in Fig. 5A (upper panel), large heat release was detected when POPC LUVs was added into a solution containing T20. The calculated binding c"
https://openalex.org/W2046002256,"There are about 100 single point mutations of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) which are reported (http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/Als/index.aspx) to be related to the familial form (fALS) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These mutations are spread all over the protein. It is well documented that fALS produces protein aggregates in the motor neurons of fALS patients, which have been found to be associated to mitochondria. We selected eleven SOD1 mutants, most of them reported as pathological, and characterized them investigating their propensity to aggregation using different techniques, from circular dichroism spectra to ThT-binding fluorescence, size-exclusion chromatography and light scattering spectroscopy. We show here that these eleven SOD1 mutants, only when they are in the metal-free form, undergo the same general mechanism of oligomerization as found for the WT metal-free protein. The rates of oligomerization are different but eventually they give rise to the same type of soluble oligomeric species. These oligomers are formed through oxidation of the two free cysteines of SOD1 (6 and 111) and stabilized by hydrogen bonds, between beta strands, thus forming amyloid-like structures. SOD1 enters the mitochondria as demetallated and mitochondria are loci where oxidative stress may easily occur. The soluble oligomeric species, formed by the apo form of both WT SOD1 and its mutants through an oxidative process, might represent the precursor toxic species, whose existence would also suggest a common mechanism for ALS and fALS. The mechanism here proposed for SOD1 mutant oligomerization is absolutely general and it provides a common unique picture for the behaviors of the many SOD1 mutants, of different nature and distributed all over the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2085692706,"The rise of electronic publishing, preprint archives, blogs, and wikis is raising concerns among publishers, editors, and scientists about the present day relevance of academic journals and traditional peer review. These concerns are especially fuelled by the ability of search engines to automatically identify and sort information. It appears that academic journals can only remain relevant if acceptance of research for publication within a journal allows readers to infer immediate, reliable information on the value of that research.Here, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of journals, through the work of editors and reviewers, at evaluating unpublished research. We find that the distribution of the number of citations to a paper published in a given journal in a specific year converges to a steady state after a journal-specific transient time, and demonstrate that in the steady state the logarithm of the number of citations has a journal-specific typical value. We then develop a model for the asymptotic number of citations accrued by papers published in a journal that closely matches the data.Our model enables us to quantify both the typical impact and the range of impacts of papers published in a journal. Finally, we propose a journal-ranking scheme that maximizes the efficiency of locating high impact research."
https://openalex.org/W1987416014,"Aggregation of the amyloid-beta-42 (Abeta42) peptide in the brain parenchyma is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the prevention of Abeta aggregation has been proposed as a therapeutic intervention in AD. However, recent reports indicate that Abeta can form several different prefibrillar and fibrillar aggregates and that each aggregate may confer different pathogenic effects, suggesting that manipulation of Abeta42 aggregation may not only quantitatively but also qualitatively modify brain pathology. Here, we compare the pathogenicity of human Abeta42 mutants with differing tendencies to aggregate. We examined the aggregation-prone, EOFAD-related Arctic mutation (Abeta42Arc) and an artificial mutation (Abeta42art) that is known to suppress aggregation and toxicity of Abeta42 in vitro. In the Drosophila brain, Abeta42Arc formed more oligomers and deposits than did wild type Abeta42, while Abeta42art formed fewer oligomers and deposits. The severity of locomotor dysfunction and premature death positively correlated with the aggregation tendencies of Abeta peptides. Surprisingly, however, Abeta42art caused earlier onset of memory defects than Abeta42. More remarkably, each Abeta induced qualitatively different pathologies. Abeta42Arc caused greater neuron loss than did Abeta42, while Abeta42art flies showed the strongest neurite degeneration. This pattern of degeneration coincides with the distribution of Thioflavin S-stained Abeta aggregates: Abeta42Arc formed large deposits in the cell body, Abeta42art accumulated preferentially in the neurites, while Abeta42 accumulated in both locations. Our results demonstrate that manipulation of the aggregation propensity of Abeta42 does not simply change the level of toxicity, but can also result in qualitative shifts in the pathology induced in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2082135766,"While the role of magnetic cues for compass orientation has been confirmed in numerous animals, the mechanism of detection is still debated. Two hypotheses have been proposed, one based on a light dependent mechanism, apparently used by birds and another based on a “compass organelle” containing the iron oxide particles magnetite (Fe3O4). Bats have recently been shown to use magnetic cues for compass orientation but the method by which they detect the Earth's magnetic field remains unknown. Here we use the classic “Kalmijn-Blakemore” pulse re-magnetization experiment, whereby the polarity of cellular magnetite is reversed. The results demonstrate that the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus uses single domain magnetite to detect the Earths magnetic field and the response indicates a polarity based receptor. Polarity detection is a prerequisite for the use of magnetite as a compass and suggests that big brown bats use magnetite to detect the magnetic field as a compass. Our results indicate the possibility that sensory cells in bats contain freely rotating magnetite particles, which appears not to be the case in birds. It is crucial that the ultrastructure of the magnetite containing magnetoreceptors is described for our understanding of magnetoreception in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2051027814,"To test whether natural variation in Arabidopsis could be used to dissect out the genetic basis of responses to drought stress, we characterised a number of accessions. Most of the accessions belong to a core collection that was shown to maximise the genetic diversity captured for a given number of individual accessions in Arabidopsis thaliana. We measured total leaf area (TLA), Electrolyte Leakage (EL), Relative Water Content (RWC), and Cut Rosette Water Loss (CRWL) in control and mild water deficit conditions. A Principal Component Analysis revealed which traits explain most of the variation and showed that some accessions behave differently compared to the others in drought conditions, these included Ita-0, Cvi-0 and Shahdara. This study relied on genetic variation found naturally within the species, in which populations are assumed to be adapted to their environment. Overall, Arabidopsis thaliana showed interesting phenotypic variations in response to mild water deficit that can be exploited to identify genes and alleles important for this complex trait."
https://openalex.org/W1993927625,"Environmental pollutants which alter endocrine function are now known to decrease vertebrate reproductive success. There is considerable evidence for endocrine disruption from aquatic ecosystems, but knowledge is lacking with regard to the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, we show for the first time that birds foraging on invertebrates contaminated with environmental pollutants, show marked changes in both brain and behaviour. We found that male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) exposed to environmentally relevant levels of synthetic and natural estrogen mimics developed longer and more complex songs compared to control males, a sexually selected trait important in attracting females for reproduction. Moreover, females preferred the song of males which had higher pollutant exposure, despite the fact that experimentally dosed males showed reduced immune function. We also show that the key brain area controlling male song complexity (HVC) is significantly enlarged in the contaminated birds. This is the first evidence that environmental pollutants not only affect, but paradoxically enhance a signal of male quality such as song. Our data suggest that female starlings would bias their choice towards exposed males, with possible consequences at the population level. As the starling is a migratory species, our results suggest that transglobal effects of pollutants on terrestrial vertebrate physiology and reproduction could occur in birds."
https://openalex.org/W1965330300,"The effect of dietary fats on human health and disease are likely mediated by changes in gene expression. Several transcription factors have been shown to respond to fatty acids, including SREBP-1c, NF-kappaB, RXRs, LXRs, FXR, HNF4alpha, and PPARs. However, it is unclear to what extent these transcription factors play a role in gene regulation by dietary fatty acids in vivo.Here, we take advantage of a unique experimental design using synthetic triglycerides composed of one single fatty acid in combination with gene expression profiling to examine the effects of various individual dietary fatty acids on hepatic gene expression in mice. We observed that the number of significantly changed genes and the fold-induction of genes increased with increasing fatty acid chain length and degree of unsaturation. Importantly, almost every single gene regulated by dietary unsaturated fatty acids remained unaltered in mice lacking PPARalpha. In addition, the majority of genes regulated by unsaturated fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid, were also regulated by the specific PPARalpha agonist WY14643. Excellent agreement was found between the effects of unsaturated fatty acids on mouse liver versus cultured rat hepatoma cells. Interestingly, using Nuclear Receptor PamChip(R) Arrays, fatty acid- and WY14643-induced interactions between PPARalpha and coregulators were found to be highly similar, although several PPARalpha-coactivator interactions specific for WY14643 were identified.We conclude that the effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids on hepatic gene expression are almost entirely mediated by PPARalpha and mimic those of synthetic PPARalpha agonists in terms of regulation of target genes and molecular mechanism. Use of synthetic dietary triglycerides may provide a novel paradigm for nutrigenomics research."
https://openalex.org/W1966567158,"Insulin resistance plays a central role in type 2 diabetes and obesity, which develop as a consequence of genetic and environmental factors. Dietary changes including high fat diet (HFD) feeding promotes insulin resistance in rodent models which present useful systems for studying interactions between genetic background and environmental influences contributing to disease susceptibility and progression. We applied a combination of classical physiological, biochemical and hormonal studies and plasma 1H NMR spectroscopy-based metabonomics to characterize the phenotypic and metabotypic consequences of HFD (40%) feeding in inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6, 129S6, BALB/c, DBA/2, C3H) frequently used in genetic studies. We showed the wide range of phenotypic and metabonomic adaptations to HFD across the five strains and the increased nutrigenomic predisposition of 129S6 and C57BL/6 to insulin resistance and obesity relative to the other strains. In contrast mice of the BALB/c and DBA/2 strains showed relative resistance to HFD-induced glucose intolerance and obesity. Hierarchical metabonomic clustering derived from 1H NMR spectral data of the strains provided a phylometabonomic classification of strain-specific metabolic features and differential responses to HFD which closely match SNP-based phylogenetic relationships between strains. Our results support the concept of genomic clustering of functionally related genes and provide important information for defining biological markers predicting spontaneous susceptibility to insulin resistance and pathological adaptations to fat feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2043722716,"Background Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) recognize complexes of peptide ligands and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules presented at the surface of Antigen Presenting Cells (APC). Detection and isolation of CTL's are of importance for research on CTL immunity, and development of vaccines and adoptive immune therapy. Peptide-MHC tetramers have become important reagents for detection and enumeration of specific CTL's. Conventional peptide-MHC-tetramer production involves recombinant MHC production, in vitro refolding, biotinylation and tetramerization; each step followed by various biochemical steps such as chromatographic purification, concentration etc. Such cumbersome production protocols have limited dissemination and restricted availability of peptide-MHC tetramers effectively precluding large-scale screening strategies involving many different peptide-MHC tetramers. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed an approach whereby any given tetramer specificity can be produced within 2 days with very limited effort and hands-on time. The strategy is based on the isolation of correctly oxidized, in vivo biotinylated recombinant MHC I heavy chain (HC). Such biotinylated MHC I HC molecules can be refolded in vitro, tetramerized with streptavidin, and used for specific T cell staining-all in a one-pot reaction without any intervening purification steps. Conclusions/Significance We have developed an efficient “one-pot, mix-and-read” strategy for peptide-MHC tetramer generation, and demonstrated specific T cell straining comparable to a commercially available MHC-tetramer. Here, seven peptide-MHC tetramers representing four different human MHC (HLA) class I proteins have been generated. The technique should be readily extendable to any binding peptide and pre-biotinylated MHC (at this time we have over 40 different pre-biotinylated HLA proteins). It is simple, robust, and versatile technique with a very broad application potential as it can be adapted both to small- and large-scale production of one or many different peptide-MHC tetramers for T cell isolation, or epitope screening."
https://openalex.org/W2047221000,"Background Proline residues affect protein folding and stability via cis/trans isomerization of peptide bonds and by the Cγ-exo or -endo puckering of their pyrrolidine rings. Peptide bond conformation as well as puckering propensity can be manipulated by proper choice of ring substituents, e.g. Cγ-fluorination. Synthetic chemistry has routinely exploited ring-substituted proline analogs in order to change, modulate or control folding and stability of peptides. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to transmit this synthetic strategy to complex proteins, the ten proline residues of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were globally replaced by (4R)- and (4S)-fluoroprolines (FPro). By this approach, we expected to affect the cis/trans peptidyl-proline bond isomerization and pyrrolidine ring puckering, which are responsible for the slow folding of this protein. Expression of both protein variants occurred at levels comparable to the parent protein, but the (4R)-FPro-EGFP resulted in irreversibly unfolded inclusion bodies, whereas the (4S)-FPro-EGFP led to a soluble fluorescent protein. Upon thermal denaturation, refolding of this variant occurs at significantly higher rates than the parent EGFP. Comparative inspection of the X-ray structures of EGFP and (4S)-FPro-EGFP allowed to correlate the significantly improved refolding with the Cγ-endo puckering of the pyrrolidine rings, which is favored by 4S-fluorination, and to lesser extents with the cis/trans isomerization of the prolines. Conclusions/Significance We discovered that the folding rates and stability of GFP are affected to a lesser extent by cis/trans isomerization of the proline bonds than by the puckering of pyrrolidine rings. In the Cγ-endo conformation the fluorine atoms are positioned in the structural context of the GFP such that a network of favorable local interactions is established. From these results the combined use of synthetic amino acids along with detailed structural knowledge and existing protein engineering methods can be envisioned as a promising strategy for the design of complex tailor-made proteins and even cellular structures of superior properties compared to the native forms."
https://openalex.org/W2025859775,"Background IdeS, a proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes, cleaves immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies with a unique degree of specificity. Pathogenic IgG antibodies constitute an important clinical problem contributing to the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune conditions and acute transplant rejection. To be able to effectively remove such antibodies is therefore an important clinical challenge. Methodology/Principal Findings IdeS was found to specifically and efficiently cleave IgG in human blood in vitro (20 µg of IdeS caused a complete degradation of IgG in one ml of human whole blood in 15 minutes) and to clear IgG from the blood stream of rabbits in vivo (no IgG was detected six hours following an intravenous injection of 5 mg of IdeS) without any side effects. In a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), polyclonal IgG antibodies against platelet surface antigens were used to induce a lethal disease. These profoundly thrombocytopenic animals were treated and cured by a single injection of IdeS. Conclusions/Significance Novel information is provided concerning the IgG-cleaving activity of IdeS in vitro and in vivo. The highly specific and rapid elimination of IgG in vivo, the dramatic effect in a mouse model of ITP, and the lack of side effects in the treated animals, indicate that IdeS could also be used to treat IgG-driven diseases in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2012775549,"The thiazolidinedione anti-diabetic drugs increase activation of endothelial nitric-oxide (NO) synthase by phosphorylation at Ser-1177 and increase NO bioavailability, yet the molecular mechanisms that underlie this remain poorly characterized. Several protein kinases, including AMP-activated protein kinase, have been demonstrated to phosphorylate endothelial NO synthase at Ser-1177. In the current study we determined the role of AMP-activated protein kinase in rosiglitazone-stimulated NO synthesis. Stimulation of human aortic endothelial cells with rosiglitazone resulted in the time- and dose-dependent stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity and NO production with concomitant phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase at Ser-1177. Rosiglitazone stimulated an increase in the ADP/ATP ratio in endothelial cells, and LKB1 was essential for rosiglitazone-stimulated AMPK activity in HeLa cells. Infection of endothelial cells with a virus encoding a dominant negative AMP-activated protein kinase mutant abrogated rosiglitazone-stimulated Ser-1177 phosphorylation and NO production. Furthermore, the stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase and NO synthesis by rosiglitazone was unaffected by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ inhibitor GW9662. These studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is able to acutely stimulate NO synthesis in cultured endothelial cells by an AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism, likely to be mediated by LKB1.

We demonstrate that rosiglitazone rapidly stimulates eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 and NO synthesis in an AMPK-dependent, PPARγ-independent manner. We propose that this mechanism underlies, at least in part, the rapid effects of thiazolidinediones on vascular function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cryopreserved HAECs and cell culture medium were obtained from TCS Cellworks (Botolph Claydon, Buckinghamshire, UK).

After treatment as indicated, the medium was aspirated and HAEC monolayers washed thoroughly with serum-free RPMI 1640 and overlaid with 1 × 105 U937 cells/well in serum-free RPMI 1640. The cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C, the medium removed, and monolayers washed three times (1 ml/well serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) to remove non-adherent U937 cells. Cells were fixed in 0.5 ml/well 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 5% (w/v) sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and the number of adhered U937 cells per field of confluent HAECs counted on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope with a ×20 objective.Nucleotide Extraction and Analysis—Neutralized perchloric acid extracts were prepared as described previously (30Salt I.P. Johnson G. Ashcroft S.J.H. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were separated by HPLC using a variation of the method of Uesugi et al.

Briefly, nucleotides were separated on a stainless steel column packed with octadecylsilane attached to a Varian Prostar HPLC system equilibrated with 0.1 m triethylamine phosphate buffer (pH 8) and methanol (96:4, v/v). Elution was monitored at A259. The elution positions of ADP and ATP were determined using standard solutions.Analysis of mRNA Expression—HAECs were incubated in serum-free large vessel cell medium for 4 h prior to preincubation for 1 h at 37 °C in KRH buffer. The medium was removed and cells incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μm GW9662 in KRH buffer for 1 h. Rosiglitazone (10 μm) was subsequently added as indicated and HAECs incubated for a further 2 h. Total RNA was prepared from cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and reverse transcribed to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). Primers specific for human CD36 (forward, 5′-CTGTGACCGGAACTGTGGGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAAGATGGCACCATTGGGCTG-3′) and 18 S ribosomal RNA (forward, 5′-AAACGGCTACCACATCCAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGCTCCCAAGATCCAACTAC-3′) were used to amplify the cDNA by reverse transcription PCR.Statistics—Unless stated otherwise, results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences were determined using a two-tailed Student's t test, with p < 0.05 as significant.RESULTSWe examined the ability of rosiglitazone to modulate NO production and AMPK activity in HAECs. Stimulation of HAECs with rosiglitazone (200 μm) stimulated the rate of NO synthesis within 30 min and reached a maximum 2.1-fold increase at 60 min (Fig. 1A). The increase in the rate of NO synthesis was sustained for 24 h. Under identical conditions, AMPK activity was maximally stimulated 3.5-fold within 30 min and activation was sustained for 24 h (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of NO by rosiglitazone was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B) such that NO synthesis was significantly stimulated by 2 μm rosiglitazone and was stimulated maximally by 20 μm rosiglitazone (2.1-fold). Stimulation of AMPK activity was also dose-dependent, such that 2 μm rosiglitazone significantly stimulated AMPK activity, reaching a maximum 2.4-fold increase in AMPK activity at 200 μm (Fig. 1B). The principal therapeutic actions of the thiazolidinediones are thought to be alterations in gene expression mediated by PPARγ (12Calnek D. Mazzella L. Roser S. Roman J. Hart C.M. Arterioscler.

Preincubation of HAECs with the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (5 μm) was without effect on both basal or rosiglitazone-stimulated AMPK activity and NO synthesis (Fig. 1B). Preincubation of HAECs with GW9662 did, however, prevent rosiglitazone (10 μm, 2 h)-stimulated expression of CD36 mRNA, indicating that GW9662 effectively inhibits PPARγ-mediated transcription in HAECs under these conditions (supplemental Fig. S1).Activation of AMPK requires phosphorylation at Thr-172 by an AMPK kinase. Two AMPK kinases have been isolated to date, LKB1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) (32Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J.

It has been proposed that LKB1 activity is constitutive, such that AMP binding to AMPK inhibits dephosphorylation at Thr-172, permitting phosphorylation and activation by LKB1 (36Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Using a phospho-Thr-172-specific anti-AMPK antibody, we demonstrated that rosiglitazone also stimulates phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C), in close agreement with the AMPK assay data (Fig. 1, A and B). We next determined whether LKB1 activity was necessary for rosiglitazone-stimulated AMPK activity. HeLa cells do not express endogenous LKB1; therefore we determined the effect of rosiglitazone on AMPK activity and AMPK Thr-172 phosphorylation in HeLa cells stably expressing wild type (LKB1-WT) or kinase-inactive mutant LKB1 (LKB1-KD) (24Sapkota G.P.

Rosiglitazone-stimulated AMPK activity and AMPK Thr-172 phosphorylation were apparent within 15 min in cells expressing LKB1-WT, but no effect of rosiglitazone was apparent in HeLa cells expressing LKB1-KD (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, we measured the concentrations of AMP, ADP, and ATP in extracts from rosiglitazone-stimulated HAECs by HPLC. Using this method, the AMP concentration was too low to measure accurately, but the ADP/ATP ratio was rapidly and significantly stimulated by 20 μm rosiglitazone and was stimulated maximally by 200 μm rosiglitazone (1.26-fold, Fig. 2C). This effect of rosiglitazone was sustained for 24 h as the ADP/ATP ratio increased from 0.12 ± 0.01 under basal conditions to 0.185 ± 0.005 after 24 h of incubation with 100 μm rosiglitazone. To determine whether rosiglitazone was able to directly increase LKB1 activity (independent of adenine nucleotide ratios), we determined the activity of LKB1 after stimulation of HAECs with rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone had no significant effect on LKB1 activity as assessed by its ability to activate recombinant AMPK kinase domain. Basal LKB1 activity was 1.51 ± 0.06 nmol 32P-incorporated/min/mg protein. In the presence of rosiglitazone, LKB1 activity was 1.62 ± 0.51 nmol/min/mg.FIGURE 2The effect of rosiglitazone on LKB1-mediated AMPK activity and ADP/ATP. HeLa cells stably expressing LKB1-WT or LKB1-KD were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline 24 h prior to incubation with 100 μm rosiglitazone for the indicated durations and AMPK assayed (A) or AMPK Thr-172 phosphorylation assessed in cell lysates (B).

HAECs infected with Ad.α1DN exhibited significantly attenuated rosiglitazone (1 h)-stimulated NO production (Fig. 4A) compared with control virus-infected cells. In HAECs incubated with rosiglitazone for 24 h there was a non-significant reduction in NO synthesis in cells infected with Ad.α1DN compared with control virus-infected cells. Insulin has previously been demonstrated to stimulate NO synthesis by protein kinase B-mediated phosphorylation and activation of eNOS, independent of AMPK (19Morrow V.A. Foufelle F. Connell J.M.C.

https://openalex.org/W1967518777,"To understand the tumor-suppressing mechanism of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, we investigated its molecular relationship with p53. Using the pREP4-luc episomal reporter, we first demonstrated that p53 utilizes the chromatin remodeling activity of the SWI/SNF complex to initiate transcription from the chromatin-structured promoter. Among the components of the SWI/SNF complex, we identified BAF60a as a mediator of the interaction with p53 by the yeast two-hybrid assay. p53 directly interacted only with BAF60a, but not with other components of the SWI/SNF complex, such as BRG1, SRG3, SNF5, or BAF57. We found out that multiple residues at the amino acid 108–150 region of BAF60a were involved in the interaction with the tetramerization domain of p53. The N-terminal fragment of BAF60a containing the p53-interacting region as well as small interfering RNA for baf60a inhibited the SWI/SNF complex-mediated transcriptional activity of p53. The uncoupling of p53 with the SWI/SNF complex resulted in the repression of both p53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by the regulation of target genes. These results suggest that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is involved in the suppression of tumors by the interaction with p53."

This protein is composed of an N-terminal signal peptide sequence followed by nine tandemly arranged epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a spacer region, three cysteine-rich repeat motifs, and one CUB domain at the C terminus. However, little is known about its domain and biological function. Here, we generated a comprehensive panel of domain deletion constructs and a new genetic mouse model with targeted disruption of Scube1 (Scube1Δcub/Δcub) to investigate the domain function and biological significance. A number of cell-based assays were utilized to define the critical role of the spacer region for membrane association and establish that the EGF-like repeats 7–9 are sufficient for the formation of SCUBE1-mediated homophilic adhesions in a calcium-dependent fashion. Biochemical and molecular analyses showed that the C-terminal cysteine-rich motifs and CUB domain could directly bind and antagonize the bone morphogenetic protein activity. Furthermore, genetic ablation of this C-terminal region resulted in brain malformation in the Scube1Δcub/Δcub embryos.

These genes coding for polypeptide molecules of about 1000 amino acids share an organized protein domain structure of at least 5 recognizable motifs: an N-terminal signal peptide sequence, 9 tandem repeats of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 3The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; proBMP, prepro precursor of BMP; E, embryonic day; NTD, neural tube closure defect. -like modules, a large N-glycosylated spacer region followed by three repeated stretches of 6-cysteine residues with unique and regular spacing, and one CUB domain at the C terminus (see Fig. 1A). Our previous study demonstrated that the signal peptide sequence is sufficient to direct the expressed SCUBE1 protein into the secretory pathway and results in a secreted and surface-associated protein (1Yang R.B.

SCUBE genes have been shown to be expressed predominantly in a variety of developing tissues, including gonads, the central nervous system, dermomyotome, digital mesenchyme, and limb buds during mouse embryogenesis (2Grimmond S.

However, direct functional studies of the roles of the SCUBE genes during mammalian development are still lacking. In addition to its embryonic expression, SCUBE1 was found to be expressed in the endothelium and platelets (1Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G.

Our recent study showed that SCUBE1 is stored in the platelet α-granules and exposed to the cell surface upon platelet stimulation and activation (6Tu C.F. Su Y.H. Huang Y.N. Tsai M.H. Li L.T. Chen Y.L. Cheng C.J. Dai D.F. Yang R.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Yet, the molecular function for such targeted exposure of SCUBE1 on the cell surface has not been addressed. Here, we investigated the domain and biological functions of SCUBE1 by utilizing a series of SCUBE1 domain-specific deletion constructs and employing a new genetic mouse model with targeted disruption of the Scube1 gene. Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that the N-terminal EGF-like repeats participate in the formation of adhesions in a Ca2+-dependent fashion and the EGF-like repeats 7–9 are sufficient for reciprocal and lateral interactions between SCUBE1 in homophilic adhesions. Moreover, gene-targeting study indicated that SCUBE1 is required during the early stages of central nervous system development, possibly through modulating the activity of members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of proteins via its C-terminal 6-cysteine repeat motifs and the CUB domain. Cell Culture, Construction of Expression Plasmids, and Transfection—A2058 melanoma cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T and GP2–293 retrovirus packaging cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The epitope-tagged version of the SCUBE1 mutant was constructed as described (1Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Two days after transfection, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples underwent immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blot analysis as described (1Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J.

Cell Aggregation Assay—A2058 stable cells were detached by trypsin (0.01%)-EDTA (2.5 mm) treatment and suspended in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, either containing 5 mm CaCl2 or Ca2+ free, at 1 × 106 cells/ml in polystyrene tubes. Then, tubes were incubated on a rotating platform (10 rpm) at 37 °C for 1 h. The extent of cell aggregation was viewed microscopically and photographed. For quantitation, cell clusters of more than four cells were counted as being aggregated. The data are shown as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments in duplicate. Luciferase Activity Assays—Human HepG2 cells (3 × 105 cells per well) were seeded into 24-well plates and transfected on the following day with 0.4 μg of the BMP-inducible luciferase reporter I-BRE-Luc and 0.01 μg of the Renilla luciferase reporter vector used as an internal control. The transfected responding cells (HepG2) were stimulated with conditioned media derived from the signaling cells (HEK-293T) transfected with the BMP2 expression plasmid alone or in a combination of various SCUBE1 deletion constructs. Luciferase activity was measured following 24-h incubation by the use of the dual reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI). Data are expressed as relative luciferase activity (firefly luciferase activity divided by Renilla luciferase activity). Targeted Disruption of the Scube1 Gene in Mice—The targeting vector obtained from the MICER website was digested with ClaI (see Fig. 8A). The ES cell line R1, established from a hybrid of two 129 substrain (129X1/SvJ and 129S1) F1 male blastocysts (7Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), was transfected with linearized targeting vector, and selection involved use of puromycin. Of a total of 251 ES cell clones, we obtained 13 correctly targeted ES clones verified by Southern blot and/or PCR analysis. The correctly targeted ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice. The targeted allele was backcrossed with C57BL/6 females for at least three generations before phenotyping experiments. Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Embryos were dissected from pregnant mice at the indicated time, fixed, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For SCUBE1 immunohistology, sections were probed with a monoclonal antibody specifically against the CUB domain of SCUBE1 (6Tu C.F. Su Y.H. Huang Y.N. Tsai M.H. Li L.T. Chen Y.L. Cheng C.J. Dai D.F. Yang R.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays—Sections were stained with rabbit anti-mouse Ki-67 antibody (DakoCytomation) for active cell proliferation and counterstained with hematoxylin to detect all nuclei. Detection of apoptotic cells involved the terminal dUTP nick-end labeling reaction kit (Roche Applied Science) and counterstaining by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Molecular Dissection of the SCUBE1 Domain Responsible for Secretion and Cell Surface Association—We previously showed that overexpression of SCUBE1 in HEK-293T cells resulted in a secreted glycoprotein tethered on the cell surface (1Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the structure responsible for the surface targeting and membrane association was not precisely defined. To delineate the domain required for the secretion and cell surface anchorage, we then generated a comprehensive panel of mutated SCUBE1 expression constructs (D1–D7) with specific deletions of the EGF-like repeats, spacer region, cysteine-rich repeats, or CUB domain (Fig. 1A). The FLAG epitope tag was added at the N terminus for easy detection of these mutated SCUBE1 forms. The SCUBE1 deletion proteins were expressed by means of transient expression in HEK-293T cells. Two days after transfection, the conditioned media and cell lysates were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, all SCUBE1 deletion constructs produced corresponding recombinant proteins in HEK-293T cells (bottom panel). Furthermore, immunoblotting of the conditioned media from transfected cells showed an effective secretion of all expression products, except for the SCUBE1-D2 mutant protein, which lacks the spacer region (Fig. 1B, top panel). Adding back this region restored the secretion of the D2 mutant into the conditioned culture medium (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the spacer region, located between the EGF-like domains and the cysteine-rich repeats, is capable of directing the expressed SCUBE1 protein through the secretory pathway for secretion, at least when overexpressed in HEK-293T cells. The same set of transfected cells was detached and stained with anti-FLAG antibody to determine their surface expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). Flow cytometric analysis showed SCUBE1-D2, -D4, -D5, and -D6 deletion mutants defective in membrane association, but SCUBE1-FL, -D1, -D3, and -D7 mutant protein, which all contain the spacer region, was expressed on the cell surface. Together, our results support the concept that the spacer region has at least two functions: to target SCUBE1 for secretion and anchor the molecule on the cell surface. Establishment of Cell Lines Expressing a Series of SCUBE1 EGF-like Repeat Deletion Mutants—Our previous study showed that the preformed SCUBE1 protein stored in the platelet α-granules could be translocated to the surface upon platelet activation (6Tu C.F. Su Y.H. Huang Y.N. Tsai M.H. Li L.T. Chen Y.L. Cheng C.J. Dai D.F. Yang R.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of such targeted exposure of SCUBE1 on the cell surface remained elusive. Because certain EGF-like repeats mediate homophilic or heterophilic protein-protein interactions (8Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we next examined by suspension cell aggregation assay whether the N-terminal EGF-like repeats of SCUBE1 play a role on cell-cell interaction. To further evaluate the relative contribution of the EGF-like repeats in the adhesion function of SCUBE1, we first constructed four deletion mutants consisting of the EGF-like modules 1–9 (E1–9), 4–9 (E4–9), 7–9 (E7–9), or only E7–9 deletion (ΔE7–9) into a retrovirus vector, pLNCX-eB7 (10Su Y.C.

In addition, an HA epitope tag was added at the N terminus for easy detection, and the mutant constructs were further fused to the B7 extracellular and transmembrane domain (B7TM) to effectively target the chimeric protein on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). The melanoma A2058 cells lacking endogenous SCUBE1 expression were infected with recombinant retroviral particles and selected in G418 to obtain four independent A2058/SCUBE1-E1–9, -E4–9, -E7–9, or -ΔE7–9 stable transfectant cell lines. Western blot analysis with the anti-HA antibody demonstrated the SCUBE1 EGF-like repeat deletion mutant proteins to be produced at comparable levels with the expected molecular masses (Fig. 2B). Most importantly, flow cytometry using the anti-HA or ant-SCUBE1 antibody confirmed that all of these SCUBE1 EGF-like repeat mutants expressed by A2058 cells were transported to the cell surface (Fig. 2C). The EGF-like Repeats 7–9 Are Sufficient, but Not Necessary, for Reciprocal (trans) or Lateral (cis) Interactions between SCUBE1 Molecules—To examine the involvement of SCUBE1 EGF-like repeats in intercellular adhesion, we evaluated the aggregating properties of the SCUBE1 EGF-like repeat mutant stable transfectant cell lines by cell aggregation assay. Monolayer cultures of the parental (control) or transfected stable cell lines were dissociated into single cells and allowed to aggregate in suspension culture. When the suspensions were gently shaken, A2058 cells expressing SCUBE1 EGF-like repeat mutants tended to aggregate (Fig. 3). The parental A2058 cells aggregated poorly in suspension (<3%), but a good proportion (∼8–20%) of the SCUBE1 EGF-like repeat mutant-transfected clones aggregated after 1 h of shaking (Fig. 3). The chelating of calcium by Ca2+-binding EGF-like domains is important for the structural integrity and function of several other EGF-like domain-containing proteins (11Downing A.K. Knott V.

Because six of nine EGF-like modules (i.e. repeats 1–3 and 7–9) contain Ca2+-binding consensus sequences (1Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G.

When the same cell lines were dissociated with gentle pipetting in the presence of 5 mm EDTA or allowed to aggregate in the absence of Ca2+, no apparent aggregation was observed during 1 h of incubation for either the parental or EGF-like repeat deletion transfectants (Fig. 3A). To further address the specificity of the EGF-like repeats, the recombinant GST fusion protein fragment containing the EGF-like repeats (GST-E4–9) or spacer region (GST-Spacer) was added into the cell aggregation assay to block the cell-cell interactions. Soluble EGF-like repeat protein GST-E4–9 clearly blocked A2058-SCUBE1-E7–9-mediated cell aggregation assay, whereas GST alone or recombinant spacer region protein (GST-Spacer) could not block SCUBE1-induced cell aggregation (Fig. 4). We previously showed that human SCUBE1 proteins are capable of forming oligomeric complexes when overexpressed in HEK-293T cells (1Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To further determine the relative contribution of which EGF-like repeat modules involved in lateral (cis) intracellular oligomerization, we transiently co-expressed three deletion constructs, HA-tagged SCUBE1-E1–9, -E4–9, -E7–9, or -ΔE7–9 with FLAG. SCUBE1-D2 containing only the EGF-like repeats 1–9 in HEK-293T cells. Immunoprecipitation of HA.SCUBE1-E1–9, -E4–9, -E7–9, or -ΔE7–9 resulted in the co-precipitation of FLAG.SCUBE1-D2 (Fig. 5). Therefore, the EGF-like repeats 7–9 are also sufficient, but not necessary, for homophilic lateral SCUBE1 interactions within the same cells. Molecular Analysis of the C-terminal Six-cysteine Repeat Motif and CUB Domain—Recent genetic analysis identified that the zebrafish orthologue of the mammalian SCUBE2 gene acts upstream of hedgehog ligands or through a parallel pathway (13Hollway G.E.

In addition, a nonsense mutation in the ty97 allele encodes a truncated null protein lacking the cysteine-rich repeat motif and the CUB domain, implying that this C-terminal region is essential for SCUBE2 function (13Hollway G.E. Maule J. Gautier P. Evans T.M. Keenan D.G. Lohs C. Fischer D. Wicking C. Currie P.D. Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Kawakami A. Nojima Y. Toyoda A.

From this genetic evidence, the SCUBE2 protein is postulated to play a critical role for transport or stability of hedgehog signaling in the extracellular environment (15Woods I.G. Talbot W.S. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e66Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), function as an endocytic receptor during reception of the hedgehog signal (13Hollway G.E. Maule J. Gautier P. Evans T.M. Keenan D.G. Lohs C. Fischer D. Wicking C. Currie P.D. Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), or modulate the long range action of BMP-dependent signaling in the neural tube and somites (14Kawakami A. Nojima Y. Toyoda A.

Biol. 2005; 15: 480-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the exact biochemical and molecular mechanism underlying the SCUBE2 action remains unclear. To further explore the molecular function of the C-terminal region of SCUBE1, we generated one additional deletion mutant, SCUBE1-ty97 (Q623 to stop codon), mimicking the ty97 mutant allele in the zebrafish Scube2 gene by removing the 6-cysteine repeat motif and the CUB domain (Fig. 6A). Since one previous report demonstrated that BMP activity can be attenuated by the co-expression of SCUBE2 in the zebrafish (14Kawakami A. Nojima Y. Toyoda A. Takahoko M. Satoh M. Tanaka H. Wada H. Masai I. Terasaki H. Sakaki Y. Takeda H. Okamoto H. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 480-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether the SCUBE1 C-terminal domain could directly interact with BMP2 protein and form a complex. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged BMP2 expression plasmid alone or in combination with a series of FLAG-tagged SCUBE1 domain deletion constructs (Fig. 6A). Two days after transfection, cell lysates underwent immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody to determine the protein association. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody resulted in a specific coimmunoprecipitation of the SCUBE1-D4 or -D5 deletion protein (Fig. 6B), which suggests that SCUBE1 could form a complex with BMP2 through its C-terminal CUB domain. To further evaluate whether the interaction between SCUBE1-D4/-D5 and BMP2 affects the long range signaling of BMP2, we co-cultured the conditioned media derived from HEK-293T cells co-transfected with BMP2 alone or in combination with SCUBE1 deletion constructs (signaling cells) added to the responding cells, HepG2 cells containing the BMP-inducible promoter luciferase reporter construct I-BRE-Luc (16Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6646-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). As expected, BMP2 alone produced by the signaling cells could act as a long range signaling molecule by inducing an increase of ∼10-fold in luciferase activity (Fig. 7B). Although the BMP2 proteins co-expressed with the SCUBE1-FL, -ty97, -D5, or -D6 triggered the BMP-mediated transcriptional activation equally well, co-expression with the SCUBE1-D4 mutant resulted in a marked attenuation of the BMP response (Fig. 7B). Because the proteolytic processing of the large prepro precursor of BMP (proBMP) and its subsequent secretion into the extracellular environment are the required steps in the formation of the biologically active BMP ligand, we next investigated whether the inhibition of BMP2 signaling by SCUBE1-D4 occurs in the intracellular or extracellular space. HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing proBMP2 alone or in combination with various SCUBE1 deletion constructs. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates and condition medium from these cultures revealed all deletion mutants with no effect on total proBMP2 synthesis (Fig. 7C), whereas only the SCUBE1-D4 mutant potently inhibited the secretion of mature BMP2 into the culture medium. Targeted Disruption of the Scube1 Gene in Mice Produces a Neural Tube Closure Defect over the Midbrain—To further evaluate the biological function of the C-terminal domain of SCUBE1 in vivo, we disrupted the mouse Scube1 gene at the end of exon 16 by use of an insertional targeting vector obtained from a public resource (17Adams D.J. Biggs P.J. Cox T. Davies R. van der Weyden L. Jonkers J. Smith J. Plumb B. Taylor R. Nishijima I. Yu Y. Rogers J. Bradley A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This vector was expected to result in the duplication of exons 11–16 and disruption of splicing to produce a mutant transcript coding for a truncated protein lacking the functional 6-cysteine repeat motifs (exons 16–19) and the CUB domain (exons 20 and 21) (Fig. 8A). The correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clones and chimeric mice carrying germ line transmission of the mutant allele of Scube1 were confirmed by Southern blot (Fig. 8B) and genomic PCR analyses with one primer pair designed from the vector backbone and the other designed from outside the targeting construct (Fig. 8A). In addition, the expression of the mutant transcript in hetero- or homozygous mutant mice was confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR analysis and direct sequencing of the PCR product (data not shown). Most importantly, the Scube1Δcub/Δcub mutant mice lacked the expression of the functional C-terminal region, because SCUBE1 immunoreactivity was not seen in the mutant brain sections stained with a monoclonal antibody specific against the CUB domain (6Tu C.F. Su Y.H. Huang Y.N. Tsai M.H. Li L.T. Chen Y.L. Cheng C.J. Dai D.F. Yang R.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8C). However, immunohistochemistry stained with the N terminus-specific monoclonal antibody could still detected the immunoreactivity in the mutant neural tissues, including forebrain (f), hindbrain (h), and cranial ganglia (asterisks), suggesting the targeted allele is not a true null allele (see supplemental Fig. S1). Instead, a truncated form of SCUBE1 containing the N-terminal fragment is expressed in the mutant animal, as the protein fragment can be detected using an antibody specific for the N terminus. Thus, this allele is designated as Scube1Δcub/Δcub on the basis of the lack of the CUB immunoreactivity (Fig. 8C). Mice heterozygous for the Scube1 mutation have a wild-type phenotype and normal fertility. However, a fraction of the Scube1Δcub/Δcub newborn pups died shortly after birth and manifested a phenotypic defect showing acrania and lack of brain tissue (Fig. 9A). In addition, mutant embryos recovered from E12.5 to E17.5 were alive (determined by active heart beating and/or limb movement) with exposed and progressively degenerating brain tissue (Fig. 10B and data not shown).FIGURE 10Exencephaly in Scube1-mutant mice as a result of an early neural tube closure defect.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 130-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Also, early studies revealed a chemotype IV peptidoglycan similar to that of Escherichia coli with both diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-Ala and DAP-DAP crosslinking (2Wietzerbin J. Das B.C. Petit J.F. Lederer E. Leyh Bouille M. Ghuysen J.M. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Until very recently, little additional study of the peptidoglycan of M. tuberculosis has occurred. These recent studies have focused on substituents on the peptide carboxyl groups (3Mahapatra S. Yagi T. Belisle J.T. Espinosa B.J. Hill P.J. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2747-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and on whether the peptidoglycan chains are parallel or perpendicular to the plasma membrane (4Dmitriev B.A. Ehlers S. Rietschel E.T. Brennan P.J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The structure of the mycolic acids was determined in detail some time ago (5Minnikin, D. E. (1982) in The Biology of the Mycobacteria (Ratledge, C., and Stanford, J. L., eds) Vol. I, pp. 95–184, Academic Press, LondonGoogle Scholar); however, notably lacking in these studies was the structure of the arabinogalactan polymer, although the esterification of the mycolic acids at C5 of some arabinofuranosyl residues was established (6Azuma I. Yamamura Y. Misaki A. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 331-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Amar-Nagasch C. Vilkas E. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1970; 52: 145-151PubMed Google Scholar). Also some linkage and ring form information on the arabinosyl and galactosyl residues was determined by methylation analysis (8Misaki A. Seto N. Azuma I. J. Biochem. 1974; 76: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Vilkas E. Amar C. Markovits J. Vliegenthart J.G.F. Kamerling J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biken J. 1971; 14: 379-387PubMed Google Scholar).The primary structure of AG is very complex and is not composed of a simple repeating unit as is the case for most bacterial polysaccharides. Elucidation of the structure was fundamentally advanced by the isolation and characterization of per-O-alkylated oligosaccharide alditols (11Daffe M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis revealed a linear galactan to which arabinan side chains were attached and also allowed elucidation of the detailed structure of the hexa-arabinoside non-reducing end of the arabinan. The data were consistent with many different structures of the complete arabinan, and two possibilities were proposed for further study (11Daffe M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the same time period, the linker disaccharide (12McNeil M. Daffe M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18200-18206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the reducing end of AG and the exact location of the mycolic acids at the non-reducing end of the arabinan were determined (13McNeil M. Daffe M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A follow-up study extended the structure of the arabinan at the non-reducing end from the hexa-arabinoside to include the last 17–22 arabinosyl residues (14Besra G.S. Khoo K.-H. McNeil M. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4257-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but until very recently, additional progress on the structure of AG has been lacking. Now three fundamental advances have occurred, which allow the structure to be further refined. First, AG has been found to be nonessential in the related Corynebacteria genus, which permits structural studies of the AG produced by mutants of AG biosynthetic enzymes (15Alderwick L.J. Seidel M. Sahm H. Besra G.S. Eggeling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15653-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Alderwick L.J. Radmacher E. Seidel M. Gande R. Hitchen P.G.

In this regard, elegant studies by Besra et al. (16Alderwick L.J. Radmacher E. Seidel M. Gande R. Hitchen P.G. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sahm H. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32362-32371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have shown that in Corynebacterium glutamicum, three arabinan chains are attached to the galactan. These researchers knocked out the gene of the arabinosyl transferase, Emb, that extends the arabinan after a different arabinosyl transferase, AftA (15Alderwick L.J. Seidel M. Sahm H. Besra G.S. Eggeling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15653-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) attaches the first arabinosyl unit. Methylation of the cell wall core of the emb knock-out strain yielded galactan substituted with what turned out to be three terminal Araf units (attached by the still active arabinosyl transferase AftA) in the form of a methyl rhamnoside unit at the reducing end. Mass spectrometry revealed that the single Araf units are attached at positions 8, 10, and 12 of the galactan; this showed the presence and location of three arabinan chains per galactan.Additionally, in recent times, an endogenous arabinase, which releases large oligo-arabinosides, has been purified sufficiently for structural studies (17Lee A. Wu S.W. Scherman M.S. Torrelles J.B. Chatterjee D. Mc-Neil M.R. Khoo K.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15817-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Shi L.B. Berg S. Lee A. Spencer J.S.

Use of this enzyme, combined with the third major recent advance, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), allowed the sequencing of large oligo-arabinosides (17Lee A. Wu S.W. Scherman M.S. Torrelles J.B. Chatterjee D. Mc-Neil M.R. Khoo K.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15817-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that in M. tuberculosis, a non N-acetylated galactosamine residue (GalNH2) (19Draper P. Khoo K.H. Chatterjee D. Dell A. Morris H.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is located on the interior branched arabinosyl residue (17Lee A. Wu S.W. Scherman M.S. Torrelles J.B. Chatterjee D. Mc-Neil M.R. Khoo K.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15817-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two fundamental structural issues remain: the presence and location of alkali labile groups on AG, and the structure of the interior region of the arabinan. These two issues are addressed in this report, leading to a model of the complete primary structure of AG.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Cultures—M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) was grown in GAS medium and M. smegmatis (ΔembC mutant, Ref. 20Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was grown in 7H9 medium (with 0.2% glycerol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin), both at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested in late log phase.Preparation of AG—Harvested cells were disrupted mechanically using a French press at 1500 psi followed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet thus obtained was resuspended in 30 ml of Milli-Q water containing 2% SDS and stirred gently at room temperature overnight followed by centrifugation (25,000 × g). The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of Milli-Q water containing 2% SDS and stirred gently at 100 °C for 1 h. This was followed by centrifuging at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was repeatedly washed with water (three times) each time followed by centrifugation as above. After three water washes, the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 80% acetone/Milli-Q water and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to remove SDS. This was again followed by two water washes and, after freeze-drying, the material thus obtained was used as mycolyl arabinogalactan peptidoglycan complex (mAGP) for further experiments.Endogenous Arabinase Treatment and Purification of Arabinans—The mAGPs (of both M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. smegmatis (Δemb C mutant) were treated with partially purified endogenous arabinase (21Dong X. Bhamidi S. Scherman M. Xin Y. McNeil M.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) at 37 °C, for 12 h, followed by extraction with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3). Surprisingly, the chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) was shown to be a good solvent system for solubilizing the resulting oligo-arabinans. This fraction was dried and treated with chloroform/methanol/water (8:4:3), and the arabinan in these circumstances was in the aqueous phase. Then the aqueous fraction from this Folch extract was passed through a P-2 column (Biogel, 1 × 25 cm column) eluted with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, and the fractions were analyzed for arabinose content by GC/MS of the alditol acetate derivatives. In the case of the arabinan purified from M. tuberculosis cell wall, it was found that the arabinans with a GalNH2 eluted slightly earlier than arabinan without this sugar and thus could be separated. The purified arabinan containing fractions were again passed through a P-2 column (1 × 15 cm column) and were eluted this time with water for the purpose of desalting. The purified fractions from P-2 column were used directly for MALDI-TOF MS or exchanged with D2O for NMR analysis.NMR Analysis—NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm, gradient-enhanced HCN probe (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). During one-dimensional and two-dimensional experiments, data were recorded at 298 K. All data were processed using Varian VnmrJ 1.1D software. One-dimensional double-pulsed field gradient spin echo total correlation spectroscopy (22Stott K. Stonehouse J. Keeler J. Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 4199-4200Crossref Scopus (692) Google Scholar) (1D-DPFGSE TOCSY) NMR spectra were acquired with four different mixing times of 0, 30, 80, and 150 ms. The signal at 4.92 ppm that we have assigned to the H2 proton was selected in these experiments. Two-dimensional proton-detected heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra were acquired in phase-sensitive mode with 256 increments (complex, States-TPPI) at sixteen signal-averaging transients per increment. The total cycle time per transient including relaxation delay was 1.7 s. The spectral windows were 7K Hz in the proton directly detected dimension and 17K Hz in the carbon indirectly detected dimension. Forward linear prediction was used in the indirect dimension, and zero-filling was applied to both dimensions. The data were weighted with cosine-squared functions before Fourier transformation. The final two-dimensional spectrum was 2K complex points in F2 by 1K complex points in F1. Two-dimensional gradient-enhanced proton-detected multiple bond correlation (gHMBC) NMR spectra were acquired in absolute value mode with 512 increments and 64 signal-averaging transients per increment. The total cycle time per transient including relaxation delay was 1.9 s. The spectral windows were 7K Hz in the proton directly detected dimension and 30K Hz in the carbon indirectly detected dimension. Forward linear prediction was used in the indirect dimension, and zero-filling was applied to both dimensions. The data were weighted with sinebell-squared functions before Fourier transformation. The final two-dimensional spectrum was 4K real points in F2 by 1K real points in F1.GC/MS Analysis of Succinates—Succinates were detected and quantified by GC/MS of their octyl succinate derivatives obtained from 1 mg of mAGP after octanolysis with 3 m HCl in 1-octanol (100 μl) at 120 °C for 30 min as reported earlier (23Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Zhang N.N. Marques A.M. Treumann A. Rithner C.D. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol.

The octyl derivatives were dissolved in hexanes prior to injection on a DB-5 column at an initial temperature of 60 °C held for 1 min. The temperature was increased to 330 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min. The retention times and mass spectra were compared with those of standard succinic acid and were quantified by comparison with the areas of the internal standards, malonic acid and glutaric acid (as octyl esters), which were also subjected to octanolysis per the procedure.MALDI-TOF MS—Samples (5 μg) were peracetylated with 100 μl of acetic anhydride in the presence of 50 μl of pyridine at room temperature overnight. After removal of the solvents, they were extracted three times using 1:1 chloroform/water, the final chloroform layer was dried, and the residue dissolved in 10 μl of chloroform prior to MALD-TOF MS. 1 μl of the acetylated AG sample in chloroform was mixed with 1 μl of matrix, dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and allowed to air-dry on the MALDI target plate. The acetylated AG samples were analyzed by an Ultraflex-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) in positive ion, reflector mode using a 25 kV accelerating voltage. External calibration was performed using an 8 standard calibration mixture on a spot adjacent to the sample. To observe the weaker high mass peaks (>4000 Da), the laser power was incrementally increased at the expense of the resolution of lower mass species. Thus the spectra were collected in suitable mass ranges corresponding to the laser power increases.RESULTSSuccinyl Residues Are Present on AG Arabinan—The cell wall core, mAGP, was prepared from M. tuberculosis and from M. smegmatis embC– (a lipoarabinomannan-free strain, Ref. 20Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) under non-basic and non-acidic conditions. These preparations of mAGP were treated with partially purified endogenous α-1,5-endoarabinanase (21Dong X. Bhamidi S. Scherman M. Xin Y. McNeil M.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the solubilized oligo-arabinans were purified by sizing chromatography. In the case of M. tuberculosis arabinan, the galactosaminylated arabinan eluted slightly earlier than the non-galactosaminylated arabinan. The arabinan fractions were then acetylated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The arabinase, although capable of cleaving any α-1,5 bond, has been shown to preferentially cleave in the positions indicated in Fig. 1A (17Lee A. Wu S.W. Scherman M.S. Torrelles J.B. Chatterjee D. Mc-Neil M.R. Khoo K.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15817-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The enzyme preparation lacks the ability to cleave the β-terminal arabinosyl residues, and, indeed, no activity other than the endo-α-1,5 activity has been detected (17Lee A. Wu S.W. Scherman M.S. Torrelles J.B. Chatterjee D. Mc-Neil M.R. Khoo K.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15817-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) including any galactanase activity. 3X. Dong, D. Chatterjee, K. H. Khoo, S. Bhamidi, and M. R. McNeil, unpublished observations. The resulting spectra showed the M+Na+ (and M+K+) ions from the expected Ara18 product, previously found using soluble AG (17Lee A. Wu S.W. Scherman M.S. Torrelles J.B. Chatterjee D. Mc-Neil M.R. Khoo K.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15817-15828Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but importantly, also showed ions that were 58 amu heavier, consistent with some arabinans substituted with succinyl esters (Fig. 1, B and C).Careful examination of the MALDI-TOF MS spectra revealed that although one succinyl group was most common, up to three succinyl groups per released arabinan fragment could be found on oligo-arabinans from both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). Careful analysis of the arabinan fragments from M. tuberculosis substituted with a GalNH2 led to the realization that none of these were succinylated, as shown in Fig. 1D.Direct analysis to confirm the presence of succinyl groups in AG was performed by octanolysis of the mAGP of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis to yield dioctyl esters of any succinyl groups present (Fig. 2A). GC/MS analysis (Fig. 2, C and D and the standard in Fig. 2B) confirmed the presence of succinate in mAGP from both species. Quantitation of the ratio of succinyl to arabinosyl groups showed a ratio of 1:41 (S.D., ±2.4 for four determinations) for M. tuberculosis H37Rv and 1:29 for M. smegmatis (S.D., ±2.0 for two determinations). For a clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis (CSU20) the ratio was 1:30 (S.D., ±0.4 for two determinations). The significance of the variations is not known, nor were studies to compare succinylation versus growth phase performed. However the data suggest that approximately one of the three arabinosyl chains contains one (or sometime more) succinyl groups.FIGURE 2Identification of the succinyl residues in mycobacterial mAGP.

One-dimensional 1H NMR analysis of the endogenous arabinase-released oligo-arabinans from the cell wall of M. tuberculosis (the non-galactosaminylated fraction from the sizing column) showed two multiplets at 2.5 and 2.65 ppm (labeled b and c in Fig. 3), which were assigned to the methylene groups of succinate, consistent with the MALDI-TOF MS and GC/MS data. Detailed NMR studies were then performed using HSQC and gHMBC to determine which arabinosyl residue and to which position on that arabinosyl residue the succinyl groups were attached. This procedure followed in general terms previous work locating succinyl groups on lipoarabinomannan (24Delmas C. Gilleron M. Brando T. Vercellone A. Gheorghiu M. Riviere M. Puzo G. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC spectrum allowed the identification of the succinyl methylene carbon resonances at 32.2 and 31 ppm, corresponding to the 1H signals at 2.5 and 2.65, respectively (Fig. 4C). The two-dimensional 1H-13C gHMBC spectrum revealed two and three bond couplings between the methylene proton resonances at 2.5 and 2.65 ppm to two carbonyl groups (Fig. 4D). The two carbonyl resonances at 176 and 181 ppm are assigned to the ester and carboxylic groups of the succinyl group, respectively, based on their chemical shifts (24Delmas C. Gilleron M. Brando T. Vercellone A. Gheorghiu M. Riviere M. Puzo G. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further, the carbonyl ester resonance at 176 ppm showed a cross peak with a proton resonance at 4.92 ppm (Fig. 4D and peak a in Fig. 3). This proton was found to correlate with a non-anomeric carbon resonance at 80 ppm by HSQC (Fig. 4B), corresponding to the carbon substituted by the quantitatively major succinyl group. 1D-DPFGSE TOCSY was used to identify the entire spin system of the succinylated arabinosyl residue and thereby to identify the position of the succinyl group (Fig. 4E). Thus the peak at 4.92 ppm was selectively excited, and then four different spin-lock mixing times were used to examine the propagation of coherence through this signal spin-coupled network. We recognized that because of the weak H2/H1 coupling (24Delmas C. Gilleron M. Brando T. Vercellone A. Gheorghiu M. Riviere M. Puzo G. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), this propagation would likely not be observed at shorter mixing times. The experiment showed that a single signal arose at 4.38 ppm for the shortest mixing time (Fig. 4F), suggesting that the proton at 4.92 ppm was on position 2. We would have expected two signals from the strong H3/H2 and H3/H4 coupling if the proton was at position 3 whereas it being at position 5 is not possible because position 5 is always substituted with an arabinosyl residue. At longer mixing times, signals at 4.28 (H4), 3.83 (H5), and 3.94 (H5′) appeared progressively as expected for the more remote couplings. Also a weak signal for H1 at 5.12 ppm arises at the longest mixing time. Hence, we conclude that the succinyl is on position 2 of an arabinosyl residue. The H3 signal at 4.38 was shown to be correlated to C3 at 82 ppm (Fig. 4B); this downfield position taken together with data from known standards revealed that C3 is substituted with a glycosyl residue (24Delmas C. Gilleron M. Brando T. Vercellone A. Gheorghiu M. Riviere M. Puzo G. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), thereby showing that the arabinosyl is 3,5-linked. These assignments are illustrated in Fig. 4A. Mass spectrometry was then used to determine which of the two possible 3,5-linked arabinosyl residues was succinylated, the one in the interior region of the arabinan or the one near the non-reducing end.FIGURE 3The one-dimensional NMR spectrum of the mixture of endogenous arabinase solubilized non-galactosaminylated oligo-arabinans from M. tuberculosis.

This result is readily interpreted as the succinyl residues located interior of the non-reducing Ara7 unit, i.e. on the interior branched 3,5-Araf residue (Fig. 5C). Thus Ara7 as released by the enzyme in a single cleavage contains very few succinyl groups in contrast to the larger Ara18–21 oligo-arabinosides. Ara7 (and Ara8) can also be produced from the interior region of the arabinan by multiple enzyme cleavages (the only way Ara9–12 are produced), which explains why the small amount of succinylation is seen for Ara7 and Ara8, although our data does not absolutely rule out some succinylation on the exterior 3,5-Araf residue. The lack of succinylation of Ara7 combined with the fact that Ara18 may have up to 3 succinyl residues leads to the identification of the quantitatively minor positions of succinylation shown with the gray residues in Fig. 5C.FIGURE 5Location of the succinyl groups in mycobacterial arabinan by mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W2069458216,"Dopamine receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors and are subdivided into D1-type (D1 and D5) and D2-type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors. The D4 receptor has a remarkable polymorphism in its third intracellular loop, which is under intensive investigation and which has been associated with, among other conditions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we demonstrate that KLHL12, a BTB-Kelch protein, specifically binds to this polymorphic region of the D4 receptor through its Kelch domain. Moreover, we show that KLHL12 also interacts with Cullin3 and thereby functions as an adaptor to target the D4 receptor to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. By ubiquitination assays in eukaryotic cells, we further demonstrate that overexpression of KLHL12 strongly promotes ubiquitination of the D4 receptor. In addition, we show that also other dopamine receptor subtypes undergo basal ubiquitination, but this is not affected by KLHL12. These data are the first to show ubiquitination of dopamine receptors and the first to identify a protein specifically interacting with the D4 polymorphism, thereby building up an E3 ligase complex with substrate specificity toward the D4 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1967511357,"Manα6(Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-R is the core structure of the major processed protein N-glycans produced by insect cells. Ultimately, this paucimannose type structure is produced by an unusual β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, which removes the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue from the upstream intermediate, Manα6(GlcNAcβ2Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-R. Because the N-glycan processing pathways leading to the production of this intermediate are probably identical in insects and higher eukaryotes, the presence or absence of this specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase is a key factor distinguishing the processing pathways in these two different types of organisms. Recent studies have shown that the fused lobes (fdl) gene encodes the specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase of Drosophila melanogaster. However, there are conflicting reports on the identity of the gene encoding this enzyme in the lepidopteran insect, Spodoptera frugiperda. One has suggested that a gene alternatively designated SfGlcNAcase-3 or SfHex encodes this function, whereas another has suggested that this gene encodes a broad-spectrum β-N-acetylglucosaminidase that functions in glycan and chitin degradation. In this study we resolved this conflict by molecularly cloning an S. frugiperda fdl ortholog (Sf-fdl) and demonstrating that it encodes a product with the substrate specificity expected of the processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Moreover, we showed that the endogenous levels of specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity were significantly reduced in S. frugiperda cells engineered to express a double-stranded RNA derived from the Sf-fdl gene. These results indicate that Sf-fdl encodes the specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase of S. frugiperda and validate our previous suggestion that the broad-spectrum β-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoded by the SfGlcNAcase-3/SfHex gene is more likely to be involved in N-glycan and/or chitin degradation.

Insects and other lower eukaryotes such as nematodes and plants occupy an interesting evolutionary niche in glycobiology because they produce N-glycoproteins but typically process their N-linked glycans less extensively than mammals (1Marz, L., Altmann, F., Staudacher, E., and Kubelka, V. (1995) in Glycoproteins (Montreuil, J., Vliegenthart, J. F. G., and Schachter, H., eds) pp. 543–564, Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., AmsterdamGoogle Scholar, 2Marchal I. Jarvis D.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This difference between lower and higher eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation pathways is biotechnologically significant because insects and plants are used to produce recombinant mammalian glycoproteins for many different biomedical research applications (3O'Reilly D.R.

Our research focuses on insects, and we believe the evolutionary status and widespread use of insect-based systems for recombinant glycoprotein production demands a much deeper understanding of their protein N-glycosylation pathways. Insect and mammalian protein N-glycosylation pathways each begin with the co-translational transfer of N-glycan precursors to nascent proteins (1Marz, L., Altmann, F., Staudacher, E., and Kubelka, V. (1995) in Glycoproteins (Montreuil, J., Vliegenthart, J. F. G., and Schachter, H., eds) pp. 543–564, Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., AmsterdamGoogle Scholar, 8Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). These precursors are subsequently trimmed and elongated by enzymes localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of insect and mammalian cells to produce a common intermediate with the structure Manα6(GlcNAcβ2Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-R. In mammalian cells, this intermediate is elongated by various glycosyltransferases to produce complex N-glycans, which often have terminal sialic acid residues. In contrast, insect cells usually fail to elongate this same intermediate and convert it instead to paucimannose N-glycans with the core structure Manα6(Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-R. An unusual β-N-acetylglucosaminidase is responsible for the production of these structures (9Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This enzyme specifically removes the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue from the α3 branch of Manα6(GlcNAcβ2Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-R, simultaneously eliminating the intermediate required for N-glycan elongation and producing the core paucimannose glycan typically found on insect cell-derived N-glycoproteins. This same enzyme is also responsible for the production of core paucimannose N-glycans in nematodes (10Zhang W. Cao P. Chen S. Spence A.M. Zhu S. Staudacher E. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gutternigg M. Kretschmer-Lubich D. Paschinger K. Rendic D. Hader J. Geier P. Ranftl R. Jantsch V. Lochnit G. Wilson I.B. J. Biol.

Thus, the presence of a processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase is a key difference between the protein N-glycosylation pathways of lower and higher eukaryotes. In a seminal study on this topic, Altmann et al. (9Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IPLB-Sf21AE, a cell line derived from the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera frugiperda (12Vaughn J.L. Goodwin R.H. Thompkins G.J. McCawley P. In Vitro. 1977; 13: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), has a membrane-associated β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity that can specifically cleave the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue from the α3 branch of a biantennary N-glycan in vitro. Subsequently, it was shown that cell lines derived from Estigmene acrea, another lepidopteran insect, produce hybrid and complex N-glycans containing terminal N-acetylglucosamine or galactose residues because they lack this intracellular β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity (13Wagner R. Geyer H. Geyer R. Klenk H.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these studies strongly supported the idea that the N-glycosylation pathway of at least some insect cells includes a processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, as described above. However, unequivocal proof of this concept awaited the isolation of an insect gene encoding this enzyme together with evidence that the gene product has the exquisite substrate specificity of the N-glycan processing enzyme. The first proof of this kind was provided by a more recent study from the Altmann group (14Leonard R. Rendic D. Rabouille C. Wilson I.B. Preat T. Altmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4867-4875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in which they demonstrated that the Drosophila melanogaster fused lobes (Dm-fdl) 2The abbreviations used are: Dm, D. melanogaster; AcMNPV, A. californica nucleopolyhedrovirus; FDL, fused lobes; GnGn, GlcNAcβ2Manα6 (GlcNAcβ2Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; GnM, GlcNAcβ2Manα6 (Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; MGn, Manα6(GlcNAcβ2Manα3) Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; MM, Manα6(Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; PA, pyridylamine; Sf, S. frugiperda; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference. 2The abbreviations used are: Dm, D. melanogaster; AcMNPV, A. californica nucleopolyhedrovirus; FDL, fused lobes; GnGn, GlcNAcβ2Manα6 (GlcNAcβ2Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; GnM, GlcNAcβ2Manα6 (Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; MGn, Manα6(GlcNAcβ2Manα3) Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; MM, Manα6(Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA; PA, pyridylamine; Sf, S. frugiperda; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference. gene encodes the specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase in this organism. Importantly, this study demonstrated that the Dm-fdl gene product has several features distinguishing it from degradative hexosaminidases and chitinases, which also have β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities. These features include its specificity for the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue linked to the α3 branch of N-glycan substrates and its inability to degrade chito-oligosaccharides. Furthermore, it was shown that flies with no functional fdl gene produced a higher proportion of N-glycans with terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues linked to the α3 branch as compared with wild type. These findings together with the finding that the D. melanogaster hexosaminidase genes (hexo1 and hexo-2) encode enzymes that can cleave chito-oligosaccharides, but not N-glycans, strongly suggested that Dm-FDL is the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase responsible for N-glycan processing in this fly. The properties of Dm-FDL also were consistent with the idea that it is the fly ortholog of the lepidopteran insect N-glycan processing enzyme first detected by Altmann et al. (9Altmann F. Schwihla H.

Subsequently, two laboratory groups independently reported molecular cloning of genes encoding β-N-acetylglucosaminidases from Sf9 cells, which are a clonal derivative of the IPLB-Sf21AE cell line (15Tomiya N.

SfGlcNAcase-1 was clearly distinct from the other two, which were nearly identical to each other and likely allelic variants of the same gene. Further analysis of the SfGlcNAcase-1 and SfGlcNAcase-3 gene products showed that they had high sequence homology to known hexosaminidases and that each also had β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity when assayed against relevant substrates. However, neither had the tight α3 branch specificity of the processing enzyme activity originally described by Altmann et al. (9Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J. Biol.

In fact, each could remove the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues from either the α3 or the α6 branch of various N-glycan substrates, and each also could release N-acetylglucosamine monomers from a chito-oligosaccharide substrate. Accordingly, we concluded that none of these S. frugiperda genes encoded the N-glycan processing enzyme but more likely encoded broad-spectrum β-N-acetylglucosaminidases involved in N-glycan and chitin degradation. In a similar study, Tomiya et al. (15Tomiya N. Narang S. Park J. Abdul-Rahman B. Choi O. Singh S. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Betenbaugh M.J. Palter K.B. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19545-19560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) also molecularly cloned two allelic variants of an Sf9 cell β-N-acetylglucosaminidase gene, which they termed Sfhex. Further analysis of the Sfhex gene product, which is identical to the gene product we designated SfGlcNAcase-3, confirmed that the SfGlcNAcase-3/SfHex gene product lacks the α3 branch specificity of the processing enzyme activity originally described by Altmann et al. (9Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, because this enzyme had a 2–5-fold higher preference for the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue on the α3 branch of an N-glycan substrate, Tomiya et al. (15Tomiya N. Narang S. Park J. Abdul-Rahman B. Choi O. Singh S. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Betenbaugh M.J. Palter K.B. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19545-19560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) concluded that the SfGlcNAcase-3/SfHex gene encodes the processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase of Sf9 cells. In the present report we provide data that resolve the discrepancy in the conclusions drawn from these two previous reports. Briefly, we molecularly cloned a new β-N-acetylglucosaminidase cDNA from Sf9 cells, which turned out to be the S. frugiperda ortholog of the Dm-fdl gene. This gene, which we have designated Sf-fdl, encodes a membrane-associated product that specifically cleaves the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue from the α3 branch of N-glycan substrates, which has virtually no activity against chito-oligosaccharide substrates and which has precisely the same pH profile as the activity originally identified by Altmann et al. (9Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) in IPLB-Sf21AE cell microsomes. Furthermore, Sf9 cells engineered to express an Sf-fdl-specific double-stranded RNA had significantly lower levels of specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. These results indicate that the specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity originally detected by Altmann et al. (9Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) is encoded by the Sf-fdl gene. The definitive identification of this new gene and the demonstration that it can be used to suppress a key, endogenous N-glycan processing activity sets the stage for an effort to create a transformed Sf9 cell line lacking this activity, which would be an improved host for recombinant glycoprotein production by baculovirus expression vectors. Cells and Cell Culture—Sf9 cells, which are a subclone of the IPLB-Sf21-AE cell line derived from S. frugiperda ovaries (12Vaughn J.L. Goodwin R.H. Thompkins G.J. McCawley P. In Vitro. 1977; 13: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), were routinely maintained as shake flask cultures in either TNM-FH medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) or ESF 921 serum-free medium (Expression Systems, Woodland, CA) as described previously (16Aumiller J.J. Hollister J. Jarvis D.L. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning of an fdl Gene Homolog from Sf9 Cells—The Apis mellifera, Bombyx mori, and Tribolium castaneum genomic databases were searched using tBLASTn (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar) with the derived amino acid sequence of Dm-FDL isoform C (accession number NM_165909) as the query. Exons encoding fragments of putative processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidases were joined in silico using an online splice site prediction algorithm available through the NetGene2 Server (18Brunak S. Engelbrecht J. Knudsen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and the predicted amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX version 1.83 (19Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35414) Google Scholar) with the default settings. Highly conserved amino acid sequences were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers (SPDEG and ASPDEG; Fig. 1 and Table S1), which were then used for PCRs (20Innis, M. A., and Gelfand, D. H. (1990) in PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis, M. A., Gelfand, D. H., Sninsky, J. J., and White, T. J., eds) Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar) with Sf9 genomic DNA or cDNA as the templates. The methods used to isolate genomic DNA, total RNA, and cDNA from Sf9 cells and to degenerate PCR conditions are given in the supplemental data. The degenerate PCRs yielded specific amplification products of about the expected size (420 bp), which were recovered, purified, and directly sequenced using the degenerate PCR primers specified above. The resulting nucleotide sequences were assembled using ContigExpress (Vector NTI Advance 10.3.0; Invitrogen). These data were used to design gene-specific primers for primary and nested 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions, which are described in the supplemental data. These reactions yielded the full-length, putative Sf-fdl gene sequence shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Subsequently, the Sf-fdl open reading frame was amplified from Sf9 cell genomic DNA and cDNA, and accuracy of the amplification products was checked by sequencing, as described in the supplemental data. Isolation of Recombinant Baculoviruses Encoding Native or GST-tagged Soluble Domains of β-N-Acetylglucosaminidases—Baculovirus transfer plasmids encoding the relevant full-length, untagged N-acetylglucosaminidases or their GST-tagged soluble domains were produced by using PCR to amplify the appropriate nucleotide sequences, as described in the supplemental data, and error-free clones were identified by sequencing. The transfer plasmids encoding the native proteins were used to produce recombinant baculoviruses by the BaculoDirect™ method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, whereas those encoding the GST-tagged soluble domains were used to produce viruses by a standard allelic transplacement method (3O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 4Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin 1555. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar) with Bsu36I-digested BacPAK6 viral DNA (21Kitts P.A. Possee R.D. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 810-817PubMed Google Scholar) as the target for homologous recombination. Each recombinant baculovirus vector was plaque-purified, amplified in Sf9 cells, and titered by plaque assay on Sf9 cells, as described previously (4Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin 1555. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses encoding the native β-N-acetylglucosaminidases were designated AcSfGlcNAcase-3 (16Aumiller J.J. Hollister J. Jarvis D.L. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), AcDm-FDL, and AcSf-FDL, whereas those encoding the N-terminal GST-tagged ectodomains of these enzymes were designated AcGSTSfGlcNAcase-3, AcGSTDm-FDL, and AcGSTSf-FDL, respectively. The parental virus used to produce these viruses, which also served as a negative control for some of the experiments included in this study, was Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Insect Cells—Sf9 cells were seeded into 100 ml of ESF 921 medium in 250-ml DeLong flasks (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and allowed to grow to a density of about 1.5–2.0 × 106 cells/ml at 28 °C and 125 rpm in a model 4580 rotary platform shaker-incubator (Forma Scientific, Inc., Marietta, OH). The cells were then infected with the appropriate baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of about 1 plaque-forming unit/cell and incubated for another 72 h under the same conditions. Isolation of Purified Microsomal Fractions—The isolation of microsomal fractions from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells has been described previously (16Aumiller J.J. Hollister J. Jarvis D.L. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Microsomes were solubilized in β-N-acetylglucosaminidase assay buffer (100 mm citrate phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X-100, total protein concentrations were determined using a commercial bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and samples containing equal amounts of total protein were assayed for β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity as described below. Glutathione Affinity Chromatography—The GST-tagged ectodomains of the various β-N-acetylglucosaminidases examined in this study were purified from the extracellular fraction of Sf9 cells infected with AcGSTSfGlcNAcase-3, AcGSTDm-FDL, or AcGSTSf-FDL as described in the supplemental data. The purity of the final affinity-purified protein preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining (supplemental Fig. S3A), and GST-tagged protein content was measured by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a GST-specific antiserum (supplemental Fig. S3B). β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase Activity Assays—Enzyme activity assays were performed using either solubilized microsomal fractions or affinity-purified recombinant proteins isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. For the microsomal membrane assays, microsomes were prepared and extracted as described above, and samples containing equal amounts of total protein were assayed in a total volume of 100 μl containing 20 pmol of various pyridylamine (PA)-tagged glycan substrates, which were generously provided by Drs. Friedrich Altmann and Iain Wilson of the Glycobiology group in the Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna. The enzymatic activity of the affinity-purified recombinant proteins was assayed under identical conditions, except the amounts of purified protein used for these assays were equalized by immunoblotting rather than by total protein assays. The substrates used in this study included GlcNAcβ2Manα6 (GlcNAcβ2Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA (GnGn), GlcNAcβ2Manα6(Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA (GnM), and Manα6(GlcNAcβ2Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA (MGn). After being incubated for various times at 37 °C, each reaction was diluted to 150 μl with water, and the products were analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (22Altmann F. Kornfeld G. Dalik T. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GnGn, GnM, MGn, and also Manα6(Manα3)Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc-PA (MM) were used as standards for the chromatographic analyses. RNA Interference—In general, the RNA interference approach used in this study involved transforming Sf9 cells with an immediate early expression plasmid encoding an inverted repeat derived from a portion of the Sf-fdl coding sequence, with the inverted repeat separated by a D. melanogaster white gene intron, as originally described by Lee and Carthew (23Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Methods. 2003; 30: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A detailed description of the construction of this expression plasmid is given in the supplemental data. Ultimately, a sequence-verified Sf-fdl inverted repeat and white gene intron cassette was inserted into pIE1HR3 (24Jarvis D.L. Weinkauf C. Guarino L.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to produce a plasmid designated pIE1HR3SfFdlRNAi. This plasmid was then used along with pIE1Neo to co-transfect Sf9 cells using a modified calcium phosphate method, as described previously (4Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin 1555. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar), and neomycin-resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution, as described previously (25Harrison R.L. Jarvis D.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 388: 299-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of specific, processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the parental and transformed cells were compared by HPLC analysis of the products obtained by reacting microsomal membrane preparations with GnGn, as described above. Isolation and Characterization of an fdl Gene Homolog from Sf9 Cells—Our effort to isolate an fdl gene homolog from Sf9 cells was informed and facilitated by the availability of genome sequence data from several insect species and also by our previous efforts to isolate the gene encoding the processing β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity from this cell line. tBLASTn analyses of the A. mellifera, B. mori, and T. castaneum genomes with the predicted amino acid sequence of Dm-FDL as the query yielded putative exons from each species encoding peptides related to Dm-fdl (data not shown). We subsequently used a splice site prediction algorithm to join the relevant exons and identify open reading frames encoding at least partial, putative β-N-acetylglucosaminidases from each insect species. Importantly, a ClustalW alignment revealed that these open reading frames encoded amino acid sequences that were conserved in the Dm-fdl gene product but not in the SfGlcNAcase-1 or SfGlcNAcase-3 gene products identified in our previous study (Fig. 1; Ref. 16Aumiller J.J. Hollister J. Jarvis D.L. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These conserved sequences (boxed in Fig. 1) were used to design degenerate oligonucleotides for high fidelity PCRs with Sf9 cDNA or genomic DNA as the templates. These PCRs yielded an amplification product of about the expected size (420 bp) that appeared to be specific because it was not observed in control reactions in which either one of the degenerate oligonucleotides was excluded (data not shown). This product was directly sequenced, and the derived translation product was found to be highly similar to the corresponding fragments of the known D. melanogaster and putative A. mellifera, B. mori, and T. castaneum FDL proteins. Accordingly, we used the nucleotide sequence of this amplification product to design gene-specific primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions. The 5′-RACE reactions yielded a specific 1.4-kilobase amplification product that overlapped with the sequence of the original degenerate PCR product, extended it by 1180 bp in the 5′ direction, and included a potential translational initiation site (data not shown). The 3′-RACE reactions yielded a specific 1.0-kilobase amplification product that also overlapped with the sequence of the original degenerate PCR product, extended it by 734 bp in the 3′ direction, and encoded a translational termination site. A contiguous nucleotide sequence of 2319 bp was assembled by joining the sequences of the degenerate amplimer, the 5′-RACE product, and the 3′-RACE product. The accuracy of this sequence was confirmed by PCR with gene-specific primers using both Sf9 cDNA and genomic DNA as the templates followed by direct sequencing of the products as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Silico Analysis of the Sf9 Cell fdl Gene Homolog—The full-length Sf-fdl nucleotide sequence and derived amino acid sequence of the Sf-FDL polypeptide are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The nucleotide sequence includes a single long ope"
https://openalex.org/W2052665644,"Dendritic cells (DC) are a heterogeneous cell population that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. CD8α DC play a prominent, and sometimes exclusive, role in driving amplification of CD8+ T cells during a viral infection. Whether this reliance on a single subset of DC also applies for CD4+ T cell activation is unknown. We used a direct ex vivo antigen presentation assay to probe the capacity of flow cytometrically purified DC populations to drive amplification of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following infection with influenza virus by different routes. This study examined the contributions of non-CD8α DC populations in the amplification of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in cutaneous and systemic influenza viral infections. We confirmed that in vivo, effective immune responses for CD8+ T cells are dominated by presentation of antigen by CD8α DC but can involve non-CD8α DC. In contrast, CD4+ T cell responses relied more heavily on the contributions of dermal DC migrating from peripheral lymphoid tissues following cutaneous infection, and CD4 DC in the spleen after systemic infection. CD4+ T cell priming by DC subsets that is dependent upon the route of administration raises the possibility that vaccination approaches could be tailored to prime helper T cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2068930226,"Background Geographic spread of highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1, the bird flu strain, appears a necessary condition for accelerating the evolution of a related human-to-human infection. As H5N1 spreads the virus diversifies in response to the variety of socioecological environments encountered, increasing the chance a human infection emerges. Genetic phylogenies have for the most part provided only qualitative evidence that localities differ in H5N1 diversity. For the first time H5N1 variation is quantified across geographic space. Methodology and Principal Findings We constructed a statistical phylogeography of 481 H5N1 hemagglutinin genetic sequences from samples collected across 28 Eurasian and African localities through 2006. The MigraPhyla protocol showed southern China was a source of multiple H5N1 strains. Nested clade analysis indicated H5N1 was widely dispersed across southern China by both limited dispersal and long distance colonization. The UniFrac metric, a measure of shared phylogenetic history, grouped H5N1 from Indonesia, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam with those from southeastern Chinese provinces engaged in intensive international trade. Finally, H5N1's accumulative phylogenetic diversity was greatest in southern China and declined beyond. The gradient was interrupted by areas of greater and lesser phylogenetic dispersion, indicating H5N1 migration was restricted at some geopolitical borders. Thailand and Vietnam, just south of China, showed significant phylogenetic clustering, suggesting newly invasive H5N1 strains have been repeatedly filtered out at their northern borders even as both countries suffered recurring outbreaks of endemic strains. In contrast, Japan, while successful in controlling outbreaks, has been subjected to multiple introductions of the virus. Conclusions The analysis demonstrates phylogenies can provide local health officials with more than hypotheses about relatedness. Pathogen dispersal, the functional relationships among disease ecologies across localities, and the efficacy of control efforts can also be inferred, all from viral genetic sequences alone."

Downstream effects include NF-κB activation. Here we report that ankyrin B (Ank-B), expressed in most mammalian cells, plays a pivotal role in the function of the Na,K-ATPase/IP3R signaling microdomain. In studies performed on a monkey kidney cell line, we show that Ank-B co-precipitates with both Na,K-ATPase and IP3R. We identify the N terminus tail of the Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunit and the N-terminal portion 1-604 of the IP3R as novel binding sites for Ank-B. Knockdown of Ank-B with small interfering RNA reduced the expression of Ank-B to 15-30%. This down-regulation of Ank-B attenuated the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP3R, reduced the number of cells responding to pm doses of ouabain with calcium oscillations, altered the calcium oscillatory pattern, and abolished the ouabain effect on NF-κB. In contrast, Ank-B down-regulation had no effect on the ion transporting function of Na,K-ATPase and no effect on the distribution and apparent mobility of Na,K-ATPase in the plasma membrane.

Na,K-ATPase is an energy transducing ion-pump expressed in all mammalian cells. Recent studies have revealed a new role for Na,K-ATPase as a signal transducer. Ouabain, an analogue of digitalis and a highly specific ligand of Na,K-ATPase, has been shown by several groups to trigger intracellular signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility, heart contractility, and blood pressure (1Schoner W.

Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP3R is mediated by the N terminus tail of the catalytic α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase and the N-terminal portion 1-604 of the IP3R (6Zhang S. Malmersjo S. Li J.

Here we have addressed the question of whether a scaffolding protein may support the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP3R and, if so, what the functional role of this protein can be. Ankyrins belong to a ubiquitously expressed intracellular scaffolding protein family that includes Ank-B, Ank-G, and Ank-R (7Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1565-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ankyrins associate with a diverse set of membrane, cytoskeletal, and cytoplasmic proteins and tether them into specialized membrane signaling domains. Both Ank-B and Ank-G have been reported to interact with Na,K-ATPase, but Ank-B is the only ankyrin isoform that has been reported to interact with IP3R (8Lencesova L. O'Neill A. Resneck W.G.

Thus, Ank-B is a likely protein to be a partner of an Na,K-ATPase/IP3R signaling microdomain. Previous studies performed with a pulldown technique have suggested that ankyrin may bind to the second cytoplasmic domain of Na,K-ATPase (11Woroniecki R. Ferdinand J.R. Morrow J.S. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: 358-364Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we have examined whether Ank-B may bind directly to the N-terminal tail of the catalytic α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase and the N-terminal portion 1-604 of the IP3R, i.e. the sites for Na,K-ATPase/IP3R interaction. We found this to be the case. To test the functional role of Ank-B in ouabain/Na,K-ATPase/IP3R signaling, a cell line derived from fetal monkey kidneys, COS-7, was used. This cell line has previously been shown to respond to ouabain with slow calcium oscillations (4Miyakawa-Naito A. Uhlen P. Lal M. Aizman O. Mikoshiba K. Brismar H. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50355-50361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Zhang S. Malmersjo S. Li J. Ando H. Aizman O. Uhlen P. Mikoshiba K. Aperia A. J. Biol.

With use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) we specifically knocked down Ank-B and compared the calcium and NF-κB response to ouabain in wild type and Ank-B-silenced cells. Cells transfected with control siRNA were used as an additional control. The signaling response to ouabain was found to be altered in Ank-B-silenced cells. Determination of the plasma membrane expression of Na,K-ATPase and of its ion transporting function indicated that the effect of Ank-B silencing on Na,K-ATPase signaling was not due to internalization of the protein. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells, a cell line derived from fetal monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) kidney (ECACC no. 87021302) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Plasmid DNA and synthetic siRNA duplexes were transfected using either Effectene or HiPerFect according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). siRNA optimal concentration was determined by titration to 10 nm. siRNAs were fluorescence-tagged with Label IT® Cy™3 labeling kit (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were used for experiments 2 days after transfection unless otherwise stated. Measurement of Cell Viability and Proliferation—A WST-1 assay (Chemicon International) was used to measure cell viability in Ank-B siRNA and rat siRNA-transfected cells as described previously (3Li J. Zelenin S. Aperia A. Aizman O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was used to determine cells proliferation. The cell proliferation kit (GE Healthcare) was used according to manufacturer's protocol. DNA Plasmid Constructs and siRNA—A full-length human Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit (hNa,K-ATPase α1) was constructed and cloned into pEGFP-C2 vector. This construct was modified to obtain cDNA that encodes hNa,K-ATPase α1 with truncation of first five N-terminal residues (MGKGV), which are cleaved during the posttranslational modification of the enzyme (14Pressley T.A.

The monkey ankyrin B-targeted sequence is based on the sequence of Ank-B from Macaca mulatta, the closest available monkey Ank-B sequence in the data base (XM_001094169): AAC CTG GAC AAA GTC GTG GAA. For controls, we used siRNA generated by changing three nucleotides (bold) from targeted sequence AAC CTG TAC GAA CTC GTG GAA or siRNA based on rat Ank-B sequence (XM_227735): CGG GCA CAC TGT GGT GAA GAA. siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Qiagen. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from siRNA-transfected cells using Aurum Total RNA mini kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligonucleotide (dT) primers (Promega). PCR primers were designed according to the sequence from monkey Ank-B (XM_001094169) (forward, 5′-CAC AAG GCT CCT GTT GAT GAT GTC AC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAA TGT TAG TGA CAT CTG GAG AGG C-3′), and PCR was carried out with standard protocol. Purification of Recombinant GST-fused Proteins and in Vitro Binding Analysis—The GST-fused fragment of N-terminal Na,K-ATPase α1, GST-fused fragment corresponding to residues 1-604 of IP3R, and GST alone were produced in Escherichia coli BL21. Bacteria were sonicated in the buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed with buffer A + 200 mm NaCl 4 times. 30 μl of 50% slurry Sepharose beads with bound purified GST-fused proteins or GST alone were incubated with 400 ng of purified human Ank-B (a generous gift from Dr. Vann Bennett) in buffer B (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with buffer B + 1 m NaCl four times. Proteins were eluted with 25 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blotting or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Antibodies and Chemicals—For immunoprecipitation, the following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 (Upstate Biotechnology, clone 6H), mouse monoclonal anti IP3R3 (BD Transduction Laboratories; clone 2), mouse monoclonal anti-Ank-B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; clone 2.2), and control mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). For Western blot analysis the following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti Na,K-ATPase α1 (Upstate Biotechnology; clone 6H), rabbit polyclonal Pan IP3Rs (Chemicon), mouse monoclonal anti Ank-B (a gift from Dr. Vann Bennett, Duke University), mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone C4), and secondary antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were incubated with 20 pm ouabain for 30 min, washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed on ice in cold buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics)), sonicated, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Supernatant protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein solutions were normalized to an equivalent amount of total protein. The protein solution (800 μg) was incubated with 3 μg of anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 antibody, anti-IP3R3 antibody, anti-Ank-B antibody, or IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were then incubated with 30 μl of 50% slurry of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C with end-to-end mixing. The next day the beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 37 °C for 15 min. Western Blotting—Proteins solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer were resolved in 7 or 12% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (136 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20) and immunoblotted using the corresponding primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T, and the protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using chemiluminescent substrate ECL (GE Healthcare). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells cultured on 60-mm dishes were exposed to EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) at a final concentration 1.5 mg/ml in PBS at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle shaking. After washing twice with PBS and once with PBS containing 100 mm glycine to quench unreacted biotin, the cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, protein concentration was equilibrated according to Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Biotinylated proteins (650 μg) were captured with 100 μl of 50% slurry streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with end-to-end mixing. The supernatant was then collected as the unbound fraction (unbound) and resolved together with an equal volume of cell lysate obtained before adding streptavidin (total) by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Rubidium Uptake—The Na,K-ATPase activity was determined by measuring ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake as described previously (15Cheng X.J. Fisone G. Aizman O. Aizman R. Levenson R. Greengard P. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C893-C901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase-dependent 86Rb+ uptake was calculated as the difference between 86Rb+ uptake in the absence of ouabain (total uptake) and in the presence of 1 mm ouabain (ouabain-insensitive uptake). Ratiometric Imaging of Intracellular Calcium—COS-7 cells were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) (5 μm in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Loaded cells were pretreated with ouabain (20 pm) for 20 min at 37 °C. Ratiometric imaging of intracellular calcium was performed in the presence of ouabain using a heated Petri dish holder mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope with a 40×/0.8 dipping objective. Loaded cells were excited at wavelength 340 and 380 nm, and emission fluorescence was detected with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-ER C4742-95) via an image intensifier unit (Hamamatsu C9016). Ratio images were recorded every 8-20 s for 45 min. One dish was used for each experiment. On each dish 15-20 cells, generally within the same cluster, were analyzed. Oscillating cells were defined as cells that display at least two well defined Ca2+ peaks. Spectral analysis of Ca2+ oscillations was performed using MATLAB (6Zhang S. Malmersjo S. Li J. Ando H. Aizman O. Uhlen P. Mikoshiba K. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21954-21962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—FRAP is a well established method used to study the mobility of proteins (16Scott L. Zelenin S. Malmersjo S. Kowalewski J.M. Markus E.Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out using a Zeiss 510LSM laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63×/0.9 dipping objective. A 488-nm laser line was used for both bleaching and imaging. COS-7 cells were transfected with siRNA 1 day after plating and with plasmid coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to Na,K-ATPase (GFP-Na,K-ATPase) the following day. The cells were used for experiments 2 days after the last transfection. Bleaching of a plasma membrane section was performed with 100% laser power for 10 s, and fluorescence recovery images were recorded with 3% laser power every 5 s for 10 min. Images were analyzed by using Image Examiner (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and ImageJ (NIH). On each cell the same size and shape of area was bleached. This area was then used for calculation of average fluorescence intensity. Data were corrected for bleaching and normalized against the initial intensity. NF-κB Activity—NF-κB translocation to nucleus was used as an index of NF-κB activation. Non-transfected wild type (WT), rat siRNA, and Ank-B siRNA-transfected COS-7 cells were treated with 10 pm ouabain for 24 h. The subcellular localization of NF-κB was determined using TransAM™ NF-κB p65 kit (Active Motif) following the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear extracts were harvested from cells as described previously (5Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and then added to the wells (96-well plate) with immobilized oligonucleotide containing NF-κB consensus. The activated NF-κB bound to oligonucleotide was detected using an antibody against the NF-κB p65 subunit. Secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added, and chemiluminescence was recorded with a luminometer. Nuclear extracts from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) + chloride-stimulated Jurkat cells were used as a positive control. To demonstrate binding specificity, an NF-κB wild type consensus oligonucleotide and a mutated consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide were used. NF-κB subcellular localization was also studied using immunocytochemistry as described previously (5Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are given as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed in most of experiments using Student's t test when appropriate; the data from densitometric quantification of Ank-B down-regulation, calcium response measurement (% of responding cells), and NF-κB activity measurement were processed using one-way analysis of variance followed by the post hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Ank-B Binds Directly to the N-terminal Domain of Na,K-ATPase and N-terminal Portion 1-604 of the IP3R—To test if Ank-B may be associated with the Na,K-ATPase/IP3R signaling microdomain in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitation assays were performed. Ank-B co-precipitated with the catalytic α1-subunit of Na,K-ATPase (Na,K-ATPase α1) and with IP3R. IP3R co-precipitated with Ank-B and Na,K-ATPase α1 (Fig. 1). Because Na,K-ATPase and IP3R interact via the N-terminal tail of Na,K-ATPase α1 and the first 604 amino acids of the IP3R N terminus, we tested if Ank-B may bind directly to the Na,K-ATPase α1 N terminus and the 1-604 portion of the IP3R. Purified Ank-B was incubated with purified GST-tagged Na,K-ATPase α1 (6-100) or with purified GST-tagged IP3R (1-604). Fig. 2 and 3 show that Ank-B binds directly to both peptides.FIGURE 2Purified Ank-B binds to the N-terminal domain of Na,K-ATPase.

Because this study was carried out on monkey-derived COS-7 cells from C. aethiops, the siRNA duplexes were based on the sequence of Ank-B from M. mulatta, the closest available monkey Ank-B sequence in the data base. Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection the expression of Ank-B mRNA (data not shown) and protein were reduced. The protein level in Ank-B siRNA-transfected cells ranged between 15 and 30% that detected in mismatch and rat siRNA-transfected and non-transfected wild type cells (Fig. 4). The Ank-B silencing had no effect on cell viability, cell proliferation, or morphology (data not shown). Notably, Na,K-ATPase α1-IP3R interaction was dramatically diminished in Ank-B-silenced cells but not in the mismatch and rat siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5). Because similar negative results were obtained with rat and mismatch siRNA, we used rat siRNA as the control siRNA in the subsequent experiments.FIGURE 5Na,K-ATPase interaction with IP3R is attenuated in Ank-B down-regulated cells. A and C, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) using IP3R or Na,K-ATPase α1 antibody indicates that the power of interaction between Na,K-ATPase α1 and IP3R was reduced in monkey Ank-B siRNA (Ank-B siRNA)-transfected cells compared with rat and mismatch siRNA-transfected cells. The densities of co-immunoprecipitated IP3R and Na,K-ATPase bands were adjusted based on the input densities; the density of the rat (B) or mismatch (D) siRNA-transfected cells was taken as 100%. Input represents 5% of total cell lysate. The experiment was repeated three times.

The association between Na,K-ATPase and IP3R is a prerequisite for this effect to occur. Partial disruption of the Na,K-ATPase/IP3R interaction with an inhibitory peptide was found to reduce the number of cells responding with calcium oscillations (6Zhang S. Malmersjo S. Li J. Ando H. Aizman O. Uhlen P. Mikoshiba K. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21954-21962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of Ank-B in the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP3R, we compared the calcium response to ouabain in wild type, control siRNA, and monkey Ank-B siRNA-transfected cells. We used a concentration of 20 pm ouabain. This concentration does not give any detectable inhibition of pump activity and is in the range of the physiological ouabain concentration (17Schoner W. Scheiner-Bobis G. Am. J. Cardiovasc. Drugs. 2007; 7: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The number of responding cells was significantly lower in monkey Ank-B siRNA-transfected cells than in wild type cells and rat siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). The calcium spike frequency was significantly different in cells where Ank-B had been down-regulated (4.9 ± 1.5 mHz) as compared with wild type and rat siRNA-transfected cells (7 ± 1.5 and 6.7 ± 1.3 mHz, respectively). Ank-B Silencing Abolishes NF-κB Activation by Ouabain—NF-κB activation is an important downstream effect of the ouabain/Na,K-ATPase/IP3R signaling pathway (3Li J. Zelenin S. Aperia A. Aizman O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 21954-21962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test whether Ank-B can modulate the NF-κB response to ouabain, control and Ank-B-silenced cells were exposed to a non-inhibitory dose of ouabain or to a vehicle for 24 h. The translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was studied either by subcellular fractionation and detection of activated NF-κB or with immunofluorescent labeling of NF-κB in fixed cells. In both non-transfected wild type cells and control siRNA-transfected cells we observed a significant translocation of NF-κBto the nucleus after ouabain treatment. In contrast, no changes in the subcellular distribution of NF-κB in Ank-B-silenced cells were observed (Fig. 7, A and B). Ank-B Silencing Does Not Affect the Ion-transporting Capacity and Plasma Membrane Distribution of Na,K-ATPase—To test whether silencing of Ank-B has an effect on the ion transporting function of Na,K-ATPase, we compared ouabain-sensitive Rb+ uptake in Ank-B-silenced cells and in control cells. Ouabain-sensitive Rb+ uptake was similar in both groups (Table 1).TABLE 1Na,K-ATPase activity in control siRNA and monkey Ank-B-silenced cells (Ank-B siRNA) Cells were treated with ouabain 30 min.

The fraction of the Na,K-ATPase α1 that was distributed in the plasma membrane in Ank-B-silenced cells and in control siRNA-transfected cells was similar (Fig. 8, A and B). Plasma Membrane Na,K-ATPase Mobility in Control and Ank-B-silenced Cells—To test whether the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and Ank-B has an effect on the mobility of Na,K-ATPase within the plasma membrane, we measured the FRAP of green fluorescent protein-labeled Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit in COS-7 cells. On each experimental day cells transfected with control, and Ank-B siRNA were studied in parallel. The recovery pattern of Na,K-ATPase is seen in Fig. 9A, and recovery curves showing a characteristic membrane diffusion behavior are shown in Fig. 9B. The diffusion rate was similar for control siRNA-transfected and Ank-B-silenced cells. From the recovery curves the mobile pool (i.e. the diffusible fraction of Na,K-ATPase molecules) can be calculated (16Scott L. Zelenin S. Malmersjo S. Kowalewski J.M. Markus E.Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Choquet D. Triller A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The mobile pool was defined as the percentage of recovery reached 6 min after bleaching. In control siRNA-transfected cells the mobile pool of Na,K-ATPase averaged 65 ± 3%. In Ank-B-silenced cells the mobile pool was similar, 66 ± 2%. Fig. 9C shows values of Na,K-ATPase mobile pool measured for each single cell. We have previously demonstrated the existence of a signaling microdomain that contains Na,K-ATPase and IP3R and induces Ca2+ oscillations and activation of NF-κB. Here we show that Ank-B is an active partner of this signaling microdomain. We show that Ank-B serves to stabilize the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP3R and that Ank-B is required for the stabilization of the signaling function of the Na,K-ATPase/IP3R complex. Calcium signaling from the Na,K-ATPase/IP3R complex is triggered by the interaction between the N terminus of Na,K-ATP"
https://openalex.org/W1996177366,"Background While cannabinoids have been shown to ameliorate liver fibrosis, their effects in chronic pancreatitis and on pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings The activity of the endocannabinoid system was evaluated in human chronic pancreatitis (CP) tissues. In vitro, effects of blockade and activation of cannabinoid receptors on pancreatic stellate cells were characterized. In CP, cannabinoid receptors were detected predominantly in areas with inflammatory changes, stellate cells and nerves. Levels of endocannabinoids were decreased compared with normal pancreas. Cannabinoid-receptor-1 antagonism effectuated a small PSC phenotype and a trend toward increased invasiveness. Activation of cannabinoid receptors, however, induced de-activation of PSC and dose-dependently inhibited growth and decreased IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion as well as fibronectin, collagen1 and alphaSMA levels. De-activation of PSC was partially reversible using a combination of cannabinoid-receptor-1 and -2 antagonists. Concomitantly, cannabinoid receptor activation specifically decreased invasiveness of PSC, MMP-2 secretion and led to changes in PSC phenotype accompanied by a reduction of intracellular stress fibres. Conclusions/Significance Augmentation of the endocannabinoid system via exogenously administered cannabinoid receptor agonists specifically induces a functionally and metabolically quiescent pancreatic stellate cell phenotype and may thus constitute an option to treat inflammation and fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2013462355,"Background Increased variability in sexually selected ornaments, a key assumption of evolutionary theory, is thought to be maintained through condition-dependence. Condition-dependent handicap models of sexual selection predict that (a) sexually selected traits show amplified variability compared to equivalent non-sexually selected traits, and since males are usually the sexually selected sex, that (b) males are more variable than females, and (c) sexually dimorphic traits more variable than monomorphic ones. So far these predictions have only been tested for metric traits. Surprisingly, they have not been examined for bright coloration, one of the most prominent sexual traits. This omission stems from computational difficulties: different types of colours are quantified on different scales precluding the use of coefficients of variation. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on physiological models of avian colour vision we develop an index to quantify the degree of discriminable colour variation as it can be perceived by conspecifics. A comparison of variability in ornamental and non-ornamental colours in six bird species confirmed (a) that those coloured patches that are sexually selected or act as indicators of quality show increased chromatic variability. However, we found no support for (b) that males generally show higher levels of variability than females, or (c) that sexual dichromatism per se is associated with increased variability. Conclusions/Significance We show that it is currently possible to realistically estimate variability of animal colours as perceived by them, something difficult to achieve with other traits. Increased variability of known sexually-selected/quality-indicating colours in the studied species, provides support to the predictions borne from sexual selection theory but the lack of increased overall variability in males or dimorphic colours in general indicates that sexual differences might not always be shaped by similar selective forces."

To further understand the roles of Ndel1 in cytoskeletal dynamics, we performed a tandem affinity purification of Ndel1-interacting proteins. We isolated a novel Ndel1 molecular complex composed of the IF vimentin, the molecular motor dynein, the lissencephaly protein Lis1, and the cis-Golgi-associated protein αCOP. Ndel1 promotes the interaction between Lis1, αCOP, and the vimentin-dynein complex. The functional result of this complex is activation of dynein-mediated transport of vimentin. A loss of Ndel1 functions by RNA interference fails to incorporate Lis1/αCOP in the complex, reduces the transport of vimentin, and culminates in IF accumulations and altered neuritogenesis. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of vimentin transport during neurite extension that may have implications in diseases featuring transport/trafficking defects and impaired regeneration.

We isolated a novel Ndel1 molecular complex composed of the IF vimentin, the molecular motor dynein, the lissencephaly protein Lis1, and the cis-Golgi-associated protein αCOP. Ndel1 promotes the interaction between Lis1, αCOP, and the vimentin-dynein complex. The functional result of this complex is activation of dynein-mediated transport of vimentin. A loss of Ndel1 functions by RNA interference fails to incorporate Lis1/αCOP in the complex, reduces the transport of vimentin, and culminates in IF accumulations and altered neuritogenesis. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of vimentin transport during neurite extension that may have implications in diseases featuring transport/trafficking defects and impaired regeneration. The cytoskeleton constitutes a highly organized structure formed by the interconnection of three filamentous networks (microtubules (MTs), 3The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; IF, intermediate filament; NF, neuronal IF; DISC1, Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia protein 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; DIC, dynein intermediate; DHC, dynein heavy chain; COP, coat protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; IF, intermediate filament; NF, neuronal IF; DISC1, Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia protein 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; DIC, dynein intermediate; DHC, dynein heavy chain; COP, coat protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein. intermediate filaments (IFs), and microfilament) and their associated proteins (7Chang L.

Named according to their intermediate diameter (10 nm), IFs constitute the largest family of cytoskeletal proteins. Up to 60 genes encoding for IFs are expressed in a tissue-specific and spatio-temporal manner in mammals (7Chang L. Goldman R.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 12Lariviere R.C. Julien J.P. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). After synthesis in the cytoplasm, a fraction of soluble IF proteins is rapidly incorporated into the polymeric filamentous network, referred to as the “insoluble” fraction (7Chang L. Goldman R.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 12Lariviere R.C. Julien J.P. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In parallel, individual IF subunits, dimers, or small oligomers that constitute the “soluble” fraction translocate rapidly along MTs via molecular motors in structures termed particles (13Helfand B.T. Chang L. Goldman R.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 445-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Helfand B.T. Chang L. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This model is particularly relevant for the assembly of the IF vimentin (15Prahlad V. Yoon M. Moir R.D. Vale R.D.

The neurofilament proteins (NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H) are the most abundant IFs in mature central nervous system neurons (12Lariviere R.C. Julien J.P. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that Ndel1, the mammalian homologue of the Aspergillus nidulans NudE, a protein implicated in nuclear distribution during hyphal growth, binds directly to the key subunit NF-L, thereby regulating NF assembly (5Nguyen M.D. Shu T. Sanada K. Lariviere R.C. Tseng H.C. Park S.K. Julien J.P. Tsai L.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ndel1 also interacts with the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia protein 1 (DISC1) to regulate MT dynamics during neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma PC-12 cells and during neuronal migration in the developing cortex. Interestingly, Ndel1 associates with the molecular motors dynein/dynactin (20Sasaki S. Shionoya A. Ishida M. Gambello M.J. Yingling J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hirotsune S.

Whether Ndel1 associates with the dynein-vimentin complex during neurite outgrowth and regulates vimentin dynamics remains elusive. Using a proteomic approach of tandem affinity purification, we now identify Ndel1 as a key component in the vimentindynein complex in cells and discover that this complex is formed during neurite extension. Nde11 participates in the formation of a quint-partite complex by promoting interaction between the lissencephaly protein Lis1, the vesicular protein αCOP, and the vimentin-dynein complex. The results of this complex are activation of dynein-mediated transport of vimentin and functional consequences on neurite outgrowth. Ndel1 Complex Purification—The purification procedure was performed as previously described (30Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant retroviruses expressing a bicistronic messenger RNA containing open reading frames of FLAG-HA-tagged human Ndel1 and interleukin-2 receptor-α were constructed and transduced into suspension HeLa cells. The infected HeLa cells were selected twice using anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody-conjugated magnetic beads, and the resulting FLAG-HA-Ndel1-stable cell lines were grown in suspension. Soluble extract was made from 40 liters of cells. The Ndel1 complex was tandem-purified in detergent-free buffers by using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) and then anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody-conjugated beads. FLAG-HA double purified material was separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The various protein bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Harvard Medical School Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility. Western Blots and Immunoprecipitations—Total protein extracts of CAD cells were obtained by homogenization in SDS-urea β-mercaptoethanol (0.5% SDS, 8 m urea in 7.4 phosphate buffer). Soluble fractions were prepared in Triton X-100 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1% Triton), HEPES (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm dithiothreitol) or E1A lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). The protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad). Proteins (20–50 μg) were fractionated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. Membranes were incubated with antibodies against Ndel1 (210 and 211) (3Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H.

The Western blots were revealed by chemiluminescence (Renaissance, Western blot kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantifications were corrected with levels of actin or α-tubulin and performed with the Labscan program (Image Master, two-dimensional software, v. 3.10, Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Two-hybrid Interactions—Cloning of human cDNA for full-length (amino acid residues 1–345) of Ndel1 in pPC97 vector (pDBLeu, Invitrogen) for expression as a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein was described previously (5Nguyen M.D. Shu T.

Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (5Nguyen M.D. Shu T. Sanada K. Lariviere R.C. Tseng H.C. Park S.K. Julien J.P. Tsai L.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Immunofluorescence, and Live Imaging—Cultures of CAD cells were performed as described previously (3Shu T.

Following transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium, CAD cells stop proliferating and exhibit morphological characteristics and molecular signatures of primary neurons such as expression of class III β-tubulin and enzymatically active tyrosine hydroxylase (31Qi Y. Wang J.K. McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, CAD cells were washed once in 37°c PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then blocked with PBS, 5% skimmed milk (or 3% bovine serum albumin), 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. After fixation, cells were incubated with primary antibody (vimentin, Ndel1, Tubulin) diluted in the blocking buffer for 1 h at 37°c or overnight in a cold room. Following three washes with PBS, secondary antibodies (Alexa 488, 594, Cy2, Cy3) diluted in blocking buffer were added to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C or 2 h at 25 °C. The cells were finally washed three times with PBS followed by a wash with water before mounting with Immuno-Mount. Pictures were taken with a C-1 eclipse Nikon confocal microscope. For live imaging, 24 h after plating, CAD cells were first transfected with a construct encoding a random sequence without homology to any known mRNA (control) or Ndel1 RNAi, and an RFP-centrin construct to mark the cells that have integrated the control or Ndel1 RNAi (see supplemental Fig. S2). After 24 h, when Ndel1 RNAi efficiently knocks down the levels of Ndel1 protein (3Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2004; 44: 263-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Nguyen M.D. Shu T. Sanada K. Lariviere R.C. Tseng H.C. Park S.K. Julien J.P. Tsai L.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the same cells were transfected a second time with a GFP-vimentin construct. 6–8 h after the second transfection, live imaging of GFP-vimentin dots (a pattern distinct of the soluble pool of IF subunits) was performed. A picture was taken every 30 s for a total of 10 min per cell; up to 56 cells were recorded during four independent experiments for a total of 190 vimentin dots. Note that beyond 10 h of post-transfection, the GFP-vimentin subunits were readily found in filamentous form (supplemental Fig. S2). To quantify the movements of GFP-vimentin, only uni-nuclear cells that expressed one RFP-centrin dot (one centrosome), had Ndel1 depletion, and expressed mobile GFP-vimentin dots (non filamentous) were taken. Clear and distinct moving vimentin dots were picked randomly and far apart from any GFP-vimentin aggregates to avoid eventual blockage of transport. Dots with no lateral, ascendant, and descendant movements were considered immobile. Generation, Characterization of siRNA Sequences, and RNAi Vectors—RNAi sequences were selected based on the criteria proposed previously (32Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Complementary hairpin sequences or oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized and cloned into pSilencer 2.0 under promoter U6 (Ambion). The sequence for Ndel1 comprises bp 276–294 (GCAGGTCTCAGTGTTAGAA) (3Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H.

All RNAi constructs were tested in 3T3, COS-7, and CAD cells by both Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Sucrose and Glycerol Gradients—High speed supernatants were made from spinal cord and nerve homogenates of 4-month-old wild-type littermates or cell lysates in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) or a modified version of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer without detergents plus protease inhibitors and fractionated on sucrose gradients. 200 μl of homogenates was overlaid onto a 12-ml, 5–20% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C in TiSW41 swing buckets in a Beckman L8–70M Ultra-centrifuge. Sucrose gradients were previously made in Beckman Ultra-Clear tubes using a gradient maker Hoeffer 15 as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). During all centrifugations, gradients loaded with standards (1 mg) such as bovine serum albumin, catalase, or thyroglobulin were processed simultaneously. Following centrifugation, 12 fractions of 1 ml were collected for each sample. Glycerol gradients were performed according to a previous study (3Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2004; 44: 263-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Novel Ndel1 Interacting Partners in Cells—A proteomicbased tandem affinity purification for Ndel1 was employed to determine fine molecular complexes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and rearrangement. Briefly, Ndel1 was tagged at the N terminus with two affinity tags (FLAG and HA epitopes) and stably expressed in HeLa cells in suspension. Exogenous Ndel1 was expressed at a physiological level, i.e. 1.2-fold the level of endogenous Ndel1 (data not shown). Following several detergent-free fractionations and co-immunoprecipitations (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 30Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), the soluble cytoplasmic fraction was isolated and Ndel1 interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. From the screen, some of the proteins recovered were: endogenous Ndel1, dynein intermediate (DIC), and heavy chains (DHC), the lissencephaly gene product, Lis1, the IF vimentin, and the trafficking-associated protein αCOP (Fig. 1A).

Because the soluble fraction was isolated, the IFs obtained were likely in a non-filamentous form, and αCOP was not membrane-associated. It is noteworthy that, under our experimental conditions, Erk and importins, which have been shown to associate with dynein and vimentin (26Perlson E. Hanz S. Ben-Yaakov K. Segal-Ruder Y. Seger R.

It is noteworthy that we cannot rule out the possibility that Ndel1 and vimentin, Ndel1 and αCOP, and αCOP and vimentin may interact directly in other systems. Formation of the Novel Ndel1 Complex in Neuronal Cells Extending Neurites—To validate the existence of the quint-partite complex Ndel1-vimentin-dynein-Lis1-αCOP in cells, we performed additional co-immunoprecipitations on soluble lysates of differentiating neuroblastoma CAD cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) transfected with a random RNAi sequence (used as a control) and undergoing neurite outgrowth. Lis1 and αCOP co-immunoprecipitated with Ndel1 in differentiating CAD cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, vimentin, Lis1, Ndel1, and αCOP also co-immunoprecipitated with DIC (Fig. 2B). Finally, Ndel1, Lis1, and vimentin co-immunoprecipitated with αCOP (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed the existence of the quint-partite complex in neuronal cells undergoing neurite outgrowth. To define the role of Ndel1 in the formation of the complex during neurite outgrowth, we knocked down the levels of Ndel1 protein in CAD cells extending neurite using a specific RNAi sequence (3Shu T.

https://openalex.org/W2051985718,"We have recently identified Star-PAP, a nuclear poly(A) polymerase that associates with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase Ialpha (PIPKIalpha) and is required for the expression of a specific subset of mRNAs. Star-PAP activity is directly modulated by the PIPKIalpha product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P(2)), linking nuclear phosphoinositide signaling to gene expression. Here, we show that PI-4,5-P(2)-dependent protein kinase activity is also a part of the Star-PAP protein complex. We identify the PI-4,5-P(2)-sensitive casein kinase Ialpha (CKIalpha) as a protein kinase responsible for this activity and further show that CKIalpha is capable of directly phosphorylating Star-PAP. Both CKIalpha and PIPKIalpha are required for the synthesis of some but not all Star-PAP target mRNA, and like Star-PAP, CKIalpha is associated with these messages in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that CKIalpha, PIPKIalpha, and Star-PAP function together to modulate the production of specific Star-PAP messages. The Star-PAP complex therefore represents a location where multiple signaling pathways converge to regulate the expression of specific mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2082263082,"Background While many of the phenotypic differences between human and chimpanzee may result from changes in gene regulation, only a handful of functionally important regulatory differences are currently known. As a first step towards identifying transcriptional pathways that have been remodeled in the human lineage, we focused on a transcription factor, FOXO1a, which we had previously found to be up-regulated in the human liver compared to that of three other primate species. We concentrated on this gene because of its known role in the regulation of metabolism and in longevity. Methodology Using a combination of expression profiling following siRNA knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation in a human liver cell line, we identified eight novel direct transcriptional targets of FOXO1a. This set includes the gene for thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), the expression of which is directly repressed by FOXO1a. The thioredoxin-interacting protein is known to inhibit the reducing activity of thioredoxin (TRX), thereby hindering the cellular response to oxidative stress and affecting life span. Conclusions Our results provide an explanation for the repeated observations that differences in the regulation of FOXO transcription factors affect longevity. Moreover, we found that TXNIP is down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee, consistent with the up-regulation of its direct repressor FOXO1a in humans, and with differences in longevity between the two species."
https://openalex.org/W2094733407,"The phytopathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum encodes type III effectors, called GALA proteins, which contain F-box and LRR domains. The GALA LRRs do not perfectly fit any of the previously described LRR subfamilies. By applying protein sequence analysis and structural prediction, we clarify this ambiguous case of LRR classification and assign GALA-LRRs to CC-LRR subfamily. We demonstrate that side-by-side packing of LRRs in the 3D structures may control the limits of repeat variability within the LRR subfamilies during evolution. The LRR packing can be used as a criterion, complementing the repeat sequences, to classify newly identified LRR domains. Our phylogenetic analysis of F-box domains proposes the lateral gene transfer of bacterial GALA proteins from host plants. We also present an evolutionary scenario which can explain the transformation of the original plant LRRs into slightly different bacterial LRRs. The examination of the selective evolutionary pressure acting on GALA proteins suggests that the convex side of their horse-shoe shaped LRR domains is more prone to positive selection than the concave side, and we therefore hypothesize that the convex surface might be the site of protein binding relevant to the adaptor function of the F-box GALA proteins. This conclusion provides a strong background for further functional studies aimed at determining the role of these type III effectors in the virulence of R. solanacearum."
https://openalex.org/W2116186444,"We identified and examined a candidate gene for local directional selection in Europeans, TRPV6, and conclude that selection has acted on standing genetic variation at this locus, creating parallel soft sweep events in humans. A novel modification of the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) test was utilized, which compares EHH for a single allele across populations, to investigate the signature of selection at TRPV6 and neighboring linked loci in published data sets for Europeans, Asians and African-Americans, as well as in newly-obtained sequence data for additional populations. We find that all non-African populations carry a signature of selection on the same haplotype at the TRPV6 locus. The selective footprints, however, are significantly differentiated between non-African populations and estimated to be younger than an ancestral population of non-Africans. The possibility of a single selection event occurring in an ancestral population of non-Africans was tested by simulations and rejected. The putatively-selected TRPV6 haplotype contains three candidate sites for functional differences, namely derived non-synonymous substitutions C157R, M378V and M681T. Potential functional differences between the ancestral and derived TRPV6 proteins were investigated by cloning the ancestral and derived forms, transfecting cell lines, and carrying out electrophysiology experiments via patch clamp analysis. No statistically-significant differences in biophysical channel function were found, although one property of the protein, namely Ca2+ dependent inactivation, may show functionally relevant differences between the ancestral and derived forms. Although the reason for selection on this locus remains elusive, this is the first demonstration of a widespread parallel selection event acting on standing genetic variation in humans, and highlights the utility of between population EHH statistics."
https://openalex.org/W1979686863,"Since 1990 non communicable diseases and injuries account for the majority of death and disability-adjusted life years in Latin America. We analyzed the relationship between the global burden of disease and Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) conducted in Latin America that were published in the five leading medical journals.We included all RCTS in humans, exclusively conducted in Latin American countries, and published in any of the following journals: Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine. We described the trials and reported the number of RCTs according to the main categories of the global burden of disease. Sixty-six RCTs were identified. Communicable diseases accounted for 38 (57%) reports. Maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions accounted for 19 (29%) trials. Non-communicable diseases represent 48% of the global burden of disease but only 14% of reported trials. No trial addressed injuries despite its 18% contribution to the burden of disease in 2000.A poor correlation between the burden of disease and RCTs publications was found. Non communicable diseases and injuries account for up to two thirds of the burden of disease in Latin America but these topics are seldom addressed in published RCTs in the selected sample of journals. Funding bodies of health research and editors should be aware of the increasing burden of non communicable diseases and injuries occurring in Latin America to ensure that this growing epidemic is not neglected in the research agenda and not affected by publication bias."
https://openalex.org/W2034328727,"Converging evidence indicates that action observation and action-related sounds activate cross-modally the human motor system. Since olfaction, the most ancestral sense, may have behavioural consequences on human activities, we causally investigated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) whether food odour could additionally facilitate the human motor system during the observation of grasping objects with alimentary valence, and the degree of specificity of these effects.In a repeated-measure block design, carried out on 24 healthy individuals participating to three different experiments, we show that sniffing alimentary odorants immediately increases the motor potentials evoked in hand muscles by TMS of the motor cortex. This effect was odorant-specific and was absent when subjects were presented with odorants including a potentially noxious trigeminal component. The smell-induced corticospinal facilitation of hand muscles during observation of grasping was an additive effect which superimposed to that induced by the mere observation of grasping actions for food or non-food objects. The odour-induced motor facilitation took place only in case of congruence between the sniffed odour and the observed grasped food, and specifically involved the muscle acting as prime mover for hand/fingers shaping in the observed action.Complex olfactory cross-modal effects on the human corticospinal system are physiologically demonstrable. They are odorant-specific and, depending on the experimental context, muscle- and action-specific as well. This finding implies potential new diagnostic and rehabilitative applications."
https://openalex.org/W2051292939,"Animals use odors as signals for mate, kin, and food recognition, a strategy which appears ubiquitous and successful despite the high intrinsic variability of naturally-occurring odor quantities. Stimulus generalization, or the ability to decide that two objects, though readily distinguishable, are similar enough to afford the same consequence [1], could help animals adjust to variation in odor signals without losing sensitivity to key inter-stimulus differences. The present study was designed to investigate whether an animal's ability to generalize learned associations to novel odors can be influenced by the nature of the associated outcome. We use a classical conditioning paradigm for studying olfactory learning in honeybees [2] to show that honeybees conditioned on either a fixed- or variable-proportion binary odor mixture generalize learned responses to novel proportions of the same mixture even when inter-odor differences are substantial. We also show that the resulting olfactory generalization gradients depend critically on both the nature of the stimulus-reward paradigm and the intrinsic variability of the conditioned stimulus. The reward dependency we observe must be cognitive rather than perceptual in nature, and we argue that outcome-dependent generalization is necessary for maintaining sensitivity to inter-odor differences in complex olfactory scenes."
https://openalex.org/W2027442998,"Chronic lung infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with the diversification of the persisting clone into niche specialists and morphotypes, a phenomenon called ‘dissociative behaviour’. To explore the potential of P. aeruginosa to change its morphotype by single step loss-of–function mutagenesis, a signature-tagged mini-Tn5 plasposon library of the cystic fibrosis airway isolate TBCF10839 was screened for colony morphology variants under nine different conditions in vitro. Transposon insertion into 1% of the genome changed colony morphology into eight discernable morphotypes. Half of the 55 targets encode features of primary or secondary metabolism whereby quinolone production was frequently affected. In the other half the transposon had inserted into genes of the functional categories transport, regulation or motility/chemotaxis. To mimic dissociative behaviour of isogenic strains in lungs, pools of 25 colony morphology variants were tested for competitive fitness in an acute murine airway infection model. Six of the 55 mutants either grew better or worse in vivo than in vitro, respectively. Metabolic proficiency of the colony morphology variant was a key determinant for survival in murine airways. The most common morphotype of self-destructive autolysis did unexpectedly not impair fitness. Transposon insertions into homologous genes of strain PAO1 did not reproduce the TBCF10839 mutant morphotypes for 16 of 19 examined loci pointing to an important role of the genetic background on colony morphology. Depending on the chosen P. aeruginosa strain, functional genome scans will explore other areas of the evolutionary landscape. Based on our discordant findings of mutant phenotypes in P. aeruginosa strains PAO1, PA14 and TBCF10839, we conclude that the current focus on few reference strains may miss modes of niche adaptation and dissociative behaviour that are relevant for the microevolution of complex traits in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2045533605,"As the K+ recycling pathway for renal Na+ reabsorption, renal tubular K+ channels participate in the fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Previously, we showed that the Kir5.1/Kir4.1 heteromer, which is a heteromeric assembly of two inwardly rectifying K+ channels, composes the principal basolateral K+ channels in distal renal tubules and that two motifs in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the Kir4.1 subunit regulate its functional expression. In this study, by using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a new isoform of membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted domain structure 1 (MAGI-1a-long) as a scaffolding protein for the basolateral K+ channels. MAGI-1a-long interacted with the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motif of Kir4.1 by its fifth PDZ domain, and a high salt diet, which could suppress mineralocorticoid secretion, facilitated the interaction. The phosphorylation of serine 377 in the PDZ-binding motif disrupted the interaction, and the disruption of the interaction altered the intracellular localization of the channels from the basolateral side to perinuclear components.

Kidney is the essential organ for the fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, and the derangement of its function results in life-threatening diseases, including hypertension, the most common disease in industrialized societies (1Wang Y.

The process of the Na+ reabsorption in distal renal tubules is the result of coordinated electrolyte transports across the renal epithelia (5Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S.

In the epithelia, Na+ efflux occurs actively via basolateral Na+/K+-ATPases, whereas apical pathways passively mediate Na+ influx. Different pathways mediate the apical Na+ influx in each segment of the tubules as follows: Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporters in the thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop (TAL), 2The abbreviations used are: TAL, thick ascending limb; DCT, distal convoluted tubule; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HEK, human embryonic kidney; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PKA, protein kinase A; RT, reverse transcription; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; WT, wild type; CT, carboxyl terminus; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: TAL, thick ascending limb; DCT, distal convoluted tubule; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HEK, human embryonic kidney; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PKA, protein kinase A; RT, reverse transcription; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; WT, wild type; CT, carboxyl terminus; GFP, green fluorescent protein. Na+-Cl- cotransporters in the distal convoluted tubules (DCT), and Na+ channels in the connecting tubules and the collecting ducts. Because Na+/K+-ATPases induce intracellular K+ influx with simultaneous Na+ efflux in these segments, K+ excretion, i.e. K+ recycling, is essential for the continuance of Na+ reabsorption (7Giebisch G. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 436-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the Kir5.1/Kir4.1 heteromer, which is a heteromeric assembly of two inwardly rectifying K+ channels, composes the principal pathway for the basolateral K+ recycling in the distal portion of TAL and the DCT (8Tanemoto M.

This study reports that an isoform of membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted domain structure 1 (MAGI-1a) functions as a scaffolding protein for the channels that compose the basolateral K+ recycling pathway. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Cloning—The CT of rat Kir4.1, which is a fragment of 105 amino acid residues, was fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and 500,000 clones of a rat kidney cDNA library were screened by using the Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system (Takara Bio Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of several clones showed high homology to the sequence of the CT domain of mouse MAGI-1a. The full-length of rat MAGI-1a isoforms, MAGI-1a-long and MAGI-1a-short, was cloned by PCR from rat kidney cDNA with the primer pairs of 5′-ATGTCGAAAGTGATCCAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCATGGAGTCATGCCAGGGAAGG-3′. For expression analysis of MAGI-1a isoforms in rat tissues, we performed PCR on Rat MTC Panel I (Clontech) using the primer pairs of 5′-ATGTCGAAAGTGATCCAGAA-3′ and 5′-CCGAGGGTCTAACCATGATG-3′. Construct of Fusion Proteins and Deletion/Point Mutants—Mammalian cell expression vectors that contain green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Kir4.1 (GFP-Kir4.1), its deletion/point mutants, and MAGI-1a isoforms were constructed as described previously (11Tanemoto M. Abe T. Ito S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2608-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Polyhistidine-tagged CT81 segments with and without mutation were constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments into the expression vector pcDNA4/HisMaxC (Invitrogen). Transient Expression in Mammalian Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen) and were transfected with the expression vectors by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MDCK cells were plated on polycarbonate Millicell transwell filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to transfection. The further analysis of expressed proteins was usually conducted at 48–72 h after transfection as described previously (13Tanemoto M. Fujita A. Higashi K. Kurachi Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies—A polyclonal anti-MAGI-1 antibody was raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptide SFTADSGDQDEPTLQEATL that corresponds to amino acids 258–267 of MAGI-1a-long (amino acids 39–58 of MAGI-1a-short). A polyclonal anti-K+-channel Kir4.1 antibody (Sigma), BD Living Colors™ Av peptide antibodies (Takara Bio Clontech), Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG (Fab′)2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were purchased. Protein Precipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—Protein precipitation and immunoblotting analysis were performed as described previously (8Tanemoto M. Kittaka N. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 587-592Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The antibody-pretreated protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was used for immunoprecipitation. The protein A-Sepharose pretreated with preimmune rabbit IgG was used for negative control. Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for polyhistidine-tagged fragments precipitation. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting and detected by SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). The intensity of the detected bands was calculated using NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Immunohistochemical Analysis—Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized in accordance with the regulations of the Animal Care Committee of our institute, and then perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). After dehydration, the kidney was embedded in paraffin, and thin sections of 3–5-μm thickness were obtained. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were immunostained and then observed using a confocal microscope (model LSM 5 PASCAL, Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd., Jena, Germany) as described previously (10Tanemoto M. Abe T. Onogawa T. Ito S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1148-F1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, after incubation in blocking buffer containing 5% normal goat serum, the sections were incubated with the anti-Kir4.1 antibody followed by incubation with an excess (1:20 dilution) of Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG (Fab′)2 to saturate the epitopes of the primary antibody. After being washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were subsequently incubated with the anti-MAGI-1 antibody followed by incubation with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG at 1:100 dilution. The sections were observed by a confocal microscope after extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The saturation of the first primary antibody was confirmed by the preliminary experiment that did not detect any labeling with FITC by subsequent incubation with control rabbit IgG. Salt Loading for Animals—At 8 weeks of age, the diet of rats was switched from a 0.3% NaCl to an 8% NaCl (high salt)-containing diet for 2 weeks. Control rats were fed with a 0.3% NaCl diet throughout the experiments. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown Analysis—GST fusion proteins of several CT segments of MAGI-1a were constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X3 (Amersham Biosciences), and each fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GFP-Kir4.1 resolved as described above was incubated with these purified GST fusion proteins and then analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (13Tanemoto M. Fujita A. Higashi K. Kurachi Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein Kinase A (PKA) Phosphorylation—Experiments involving PKA stimulation were performed using a cAMP mixture containing 5 μm forskolin, 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP, and 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The cAMP mixture was applied for 10 min until just before further preparation. For the inhibition of PKA, a PKA-specific blocker, N-(2([3-(4-bromophenyl)-2-propenyl]amino)-ethyl)-5-iso-quinolinesulfonamide (H89) (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was applied at a concentration of 1.0 μm from 3 min prior the application of the mixture (14Chijiwa T.

Electrophysiological Recordings—Channel activity was analyzed with the patch clamp method in whole-cell configuration as described previously (8Tanemoto M. Kittaka N. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 587-592Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In brief, the resistance of patch electrodes, when filled with the pipette solution (140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4)) was adjusted to 1–2 megohms. Currents were elicited on GFP-Kir4.1-transfected HEK293T cells by voltage steps in the bath solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3) using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were analyzed by pCLAMP 9 (Axon Instruments), and barium (3 mm)-sensitive components of the currents were recorded as K+ currents. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from MDCK cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with (dT)12–18 primer by using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen). MAGI-1a expression was detected by PCR using a primer pair 5′-CCAGTAATTGGGAAATCACACC-3′ and 5′-CCGCCTCAGAAACAGACGGAC-3′, which spans introns to distinguish these sequences from the genomic DNA. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Cytological Observation—Cytological observation was performed as described previously (11Tanemoto M. Abe T. Ito S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2608-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Especially in experiments with MDCK cells, formation of tight junction between cells after confluent growth was confirmed by the expression of a typical protein of tight junction, ZO-1, on the top of a lateral wall. Immunostaining was performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 1% normal goat serum. Statistical Analysis—The intensity of the bands in immunoblotting analysis was expressed as means ± S.D. Comparison was performed by the paired two-tailed Student's t test. Probability values of p < 0.01 were considered to be statistically significant. Identification of MAGI-1a as a Scaffolding Protein for Kir4.1 in the Kidney—Two isoforms of MAGI-1a were identified from rat kidney cDNA (supplemental Fig. S1). The longer one, named MAGI-1a-long (GenBank™ accession number AY598952), had two short inserts to the reported MAGI-1a (before and after the second WW domain). The shorter one, named MAGI-1a-short (GenBank™ accession number AY598951), had two splice-out portions from MAGI-1a-long (in the amino terminus and between PDZ2 and PDZ3) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). As a consequence of the splice-out, MAGI-1a-short lacked the amino-terminal PDZ domain (so-called PDZ0) and the guanylate kinase domain (Fig. 1B). Analysis by PCR on rat tissue cDNA revealed that the kidney expressed both MAGI-1a-long and MAGI-1a-short, and MAGI-1a-short was expressed only in the kidney among the tissues examined (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2). Expression of MAGI-1a-long-Kir4.1 Complex in Renal Distal Tubules—Using the anti-MAGI antibody, which specifically recognized MAGI-1a-short and MAGI-1a-long expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A), we confirmed the expression of both MAGI-1a isoforms in the kidney (Fig. 2B). The antibody detected two bands in the lysate from the membrane fraction of rat kidney (Fig. 2B, left panel), the identical size of MAGI-1a-short (lower band) and the predicted size of MAGI-1a-long (upper band). The antibody pre-absorption by the antigenic peptide reduced the detection and almost eliminated these bands (Fig. 2B, right panel). Using the antibody, we next examined the intrarenal interaction between MAGI-1a isoforms and Kir4.1. In the immunoprecipitant with the anti-Kir4.1 antibody, a single band was detected from the rat kidney lysate by the anti-MAGI-1 antibody (left panel in Fig. 2C). The size of the band indicated that the isoform coprecipitated with Kir4.1 was MAGI-1a-long. The immunoprecipitant with the anti-MAGI-1 antibody also contained Kir4.1 (right panel in Fig. 2C). The mutual coprecipitation of MAGI-1a-long and Kir4.1 indicated their intrarenal interaction. The intrarenal MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction was further supported by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3A). The immunoreactivity against the anti-MAGI-1 antibody was detected in the tubules that expressed Kir4.1, and coimmunostaining with the anti-Kir4.1 antibody showed the colocalization of MAGI-1a isoforms with Kir4.1 on the basolateral side in these tubules. The expression of MAGI-1a isoforms on the basolateral side was confirmed by the single staining with the anti-MAGI-1 antibody (supplemental Fig. S3). Effects of High Salt Diet on Intrarenal MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 Interaction—We next examined the effect of high salt diet (salt load), which could suppress mineralocorticoid secretion, on the intrarenal MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction (Fig. 3B). The salt load increased the interaction, although it did not increase the amount of Kir4.1 expressed in the kidney. More Kir4.1 was coprecipitated with the same amount of MAGI-1a-long in the kidney of the salt-loaded animals than the control (relative amount: 1.65 ± 0.17, p = 0.005). Interacting Domains of MAGI-1a-long and Kir4.1—Using GST pulldown, we analyzed the regions for the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction. The CT domain of MAGI-1a-long that was identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening could interact with Kir4.1 (Fig. 4A). Sequential deletion of the domain from the CT end showed that the deletion of the fifth PDZ domain (PDZ5) disrupted the interaction, which indicates that the PDZ5 domain is essential for MAGI-1a-long to interact with Kir4.1. The deletion of the PDZ-binding motif in Kir4.1 disrupted the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction (Fig. 4B). A single mutation of serine 377, the critical residue in the motif, to alanine (S377A) or aspartic acid (S377D) also disrupted the interaction. These results indicated that the PDZ-binding motif of Kir4.1 was essential for the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction and confirmed that the interaction was PDZ-dependent. Regulation of the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 Interaction—The PDZ dependence of the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction was further confirmed in HEK293T cells. In HEK293T cells, as well as in the GST pulldown, the Kir4.1 with wild-type (WT) CT portion could interact with MAGI-1a-long, but the deletion of the PDZ-binding motif in Kir4.1 disrupted the mutual interaction between MAGI-1a-long and Kir4.1 (Fig. 5A). In the GST pulldown analysis, the induction of a phosphorylated state-mimicking mutation in serine 377 (S377D) disrupted the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction, which indicated that serine 377 phosphorylation affected the interaction. Because serine 377 of Kir4.1 is a putative site for phosphorylation by PKA, we further examined the effects of PKA phosphorylation on the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5B). The interaction was disrupted during 10 min of incubation with the cAMP mixture, whereas a PKA-specific inhibitor, H89, overcame this disruption. Compared with the amount of Kir4.1 coprecipitated with MAGI-1a-long after simultaneous inhibition with H89, the amount after PKA stimulation was significantly low (0.13 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the current amplitude of Kir4.1 assessed by patch clamp did not change during the 10-min cAMP mixture application, which sufficiently disrupted the PDZ-dependent interaction with MAGI-1a-long; the amplitude after the 10-min application relative to that before the application was 0.96 ± 0.05 (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylation of Serine 377 in the PDZ-binding Motif—We further examined PKA phosphorylation on the CT81 amino acid residues of Kir4.1 (CT81 segment) (Fig. 6A). Whereas Ni-NTA-agarose precipitated the same amount of the WT and S377A polyhistidine-tagged CT81 segments, the WT segment instead of the S377A segment was more efficiently serine-phosphorylated by the cAMP mixture application in the H89-inhibitory manner. Compared with the intensity of phosphoserine on the WT segment, the intensity on the S377A segment was statistically significantly weak (0.25 ± 0.19, p = 0.004), and the reduction in the intensity by simultaneous H89 inhibition was significant only in the WT segment (WT, 0.29 ± 0.05, p < 0.001; S377A, 0.15 ± 0.05, p = 0.305). These results indicated that the serine 377 in the PDZ-binding motif was the residue that was PKA-phosphorylated. The motif with unphosphorylated but not phosphorylated serine 377 could interact with the PDZ5 of MAGI-1a (schematically summarized in Fig. 6B). In the absence of extra activation for PKA, the intensity of phosphoserine on the WT segment changed widely in each experiment (ranging from 0.33 to 1.13). However, the intensity without the extra activation was generally weaker than the intensity with the extra activation (0.72 ± 0.34, p = 0.201). Effect of Kir4.1 Phosphorylation on Intracellular Localization—We further examined the effect of phosphorylation on the intracellular localization of Kir4.1 in renal tubular cells by using a cell line derived from the renal tubule, MDCK cells. RT-PCR analysis by using a specific primer pair for MAGI-1 revealed the expression of MAGI-1 isoform(s) in MDCK cells (Fig. 7A). In MDCK cells, Kir4.1 showed the predominant localization on the basolateral side, but the induction of a phosphorylation-mimicking single mutation at serine 377 (S377D) induced the perinuclear localization (Fig. 7B). These results indicated that the PDZ-dependent interaction with MAGI-1 isoform(s), which is disrupted by the phosphorylation of serine 377 in the PDZ-binding motif, participated in the basolateral localization of Kir4.1 in renal tubular cells. In this study, we revealed that a scaffolding protein, MAGI-1a-long, interacts with Kir4.1 on the basolateral side of distal renal tubules. The interaction is affected by dietary amount of NaCl and regulated by phosphorylation of the PDZ-binding motif of Kir4.1. Previously, we showed that Kir4.1 is a subunit of the basolateral K+ channels (a pathway of basolateral K+ recycling for Na+ reabsorption) in distal renal tubules (8Tanemoto M. Kittaka N. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 587-592Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Lourdel S. Paulais M. Cluzeaud F. Bens M. Tanemoto M. Kurachi Y. Vandewalle A. Teulon J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 538: 391-404Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and that the PDZ-binding motif of this subunit participates in the proper expression of the channels (10Tanemoto M. Abe T. Onogawa T. Ito S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1148-F1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Tanemoto M. Abe T. Ito S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2608-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, our findings in this study indicate that MAGI-1a-long participates in the basolateral localization of the K+ channels in these tubules; this is similar to the PDZ-dependent localization of other membrane proteins by scaffolding proteins (15Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We detected the expression of MAGI-1 isoforms in the renal tubules but not in the glomerulus. The intrarenal interaction of MAGI-1a-long with Kir4.1, which is not expressed in the glomerulus but in distal renal tubules (10Tanemoto M. Abe T. Onogawa T. Ito S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1148-F1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Ito M. Inanobe A. Horio Y. Hibino H. Isomoto S. Ito H. Mori K. Tonosaki A. Tomoike H. Kurachi Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), confirmed the tubular expression of MAGI-1 isoforms. In a previous report, another MAGI-1-specific antibody also detected tubular but not intraglomerular expression of MAGI-1 (17Laura R.P. Ross S. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, there are several reports that show intraglomerular expression of MAGI-1 (18Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nishimura W. Iizuka T. Hirabayashi S. Tanaka N. Hata Y. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 185: 358-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hirabayashi S. Mori H. Kansaku A. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Shimizu F. Kawachi H. Hata Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1528-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these previous reports, the antibodies that were raised against other members of scaffolding proteins (19Nishimura W. Iizuka T. Hirabayashi S. Tanaka N. Hata Y. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 185: 358-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hirabayashi S. Mori H. Kansaku A. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Shimizu F. Kawachi H. Hata Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1528-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or that recognized several proteins with sizes different from MAGI-1 (18Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar) were used, because they could detect MAGI-1. Therefore, intraglomerular immunoreactivity with these antibodies could be against some other proteins, such as a synaptic scaffolding molecule, but not MAGI-1 (21Kawajiri A. Itoh N. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Yamaga M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is also possible that isoform(s) of MAGI-1 without the amino-terminal portion are expressed in the glomerulus, because we raised the anti-MAGI-1 antibody against an amino acid sequence on the amino-terminal portion of MAGI-1a in this study. In the renal tubules, the MAGI-1 expression was detected on the luminal side in addition to the basolateral side where MAGI-1a-long was colocalized with Kir4.1. Because MAGI-1a-short is the renal MAGI-1 isoform that did not interact with Kir4.1, it would be the isoform expressed on the luminal side. Although we could not clarify the precise localization of the isoforms, they probably have different intracellular localizations, i.e. MAGI-1a-short on the luminal side and MAGI-1a-long on the basolateral side. The PDZ0 and guanylate kinase domain, the domains that only MAGI-1a-long contains, might be responsible for the different localization (15Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The different localization would make it possible for MAGI-1a-long but not MAGI-1a-short to interact with Kir4.1 in vivo in the kidney. The mechanism for in vivo interaction of Kir4.1 with the basolaterally expressed MAGI-1a-long but not the luminally expressed MAGI-1 isoforms has not been clarified. However, we propose two possible mechanisms. (i) PDZ5 of the luminally expressed MAGI-1 isoforms is preoccupied in vivo by other proteins (18Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dobrosotskaya I.Y. James G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). (ii) The basolateral K+ channels are specifically delivered to the basolateral side by the mechanism that is not clarified yet (12Brown D. Breton S. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 816-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). The MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction was disrupted by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is thought to take place on the serine 377 in the PDZ-binding motif, and only the PDZ-binding motif with the unphosphorylated serine 377 could interact with the PDZ5 of MAGI-1a-long (Fig. 6B). Either the phosphorylation or the amino acid mutation (to alanine or aspartic acid, which mimics the phosphorylated serine (24Beguin P. Nagashima K. Nishimura M. Gonoi T. Seino S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4722-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Lin Y.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 942-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)) of the serine 377 disrupted the interaction. In line with our findings, phosphorylation of PDZ-binding motifs in other proteins also changes their interaction with scaffolding proteins and affects their intracellular localization (26Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the PKA phosphorylation disrupted the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction, it did not change the channel activity of Kir4.1 for a short duration. We previously showed that the PDZ-dependent interaction with scaffolding protein(s) facilitates the localization of the K+ channels on the intracellular compartments just beneath the cell surface but not on the extracellular surface (10Tanemoto M. Abe T. Onogawa T. Ito S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1148-F1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Tanemoto M. Abe T. Ito S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2608-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because of this intracellular localization, the PKA phosphorylation would not change the channel activity for a short duration. The phosphorylation would regulate the process of intracellular localization that affects the channels ready to be expressed on the cell surface. The channels on the compartments just beneath the cell surface could be functional on demand (7Giebisch G. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 436-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Serine residues in the CT portion of Kir4.1 other than serine 377, such as serine 343, could be PKA-phosphorylated (28Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and might affect the interaction. Less phosphorylation on a S377A-mutated segment under PKA inhibition than PKA stimulation might reflect PKA phosphorylation of these residues (14Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the difference is too small (p = 0.305) to be considered as the different phosphorylation state of any residues, and serine 377 in the PDZ-binding motif is thought to be the residue that is responsible for the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the interaction. In this study, the activity of PKA, which would have changed widely in vitro according to the condition of the cells without extra activation for it, disrupted the MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction in HEK293T cells. Therefore, the intracellular signal cascades that affect the activity of PKA in vivo could regulate the activity of the basolateral K+ recycling in distal renal tubules. However, in distal renal tubules, several kinases that can phosphorylate serine residues, such as SGK1, are known to be expressed (29Alvarez de la Rosa D. Coric T. Todorovic N. Shao D. Wang T. Canessa C.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 455-466Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Vitari A.C. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These kinases might phosphorylate Kir4.1 more efficiently under the conditions that are suitable for their activity. The phosphorylation by these kinases would affect the activity of the basolateral K+ recycling and regulate the renal Na+ reabsorption in vivo in the kidney (29Alvarez de la Rosa D. Coric T. Todorovic N. Shao D. Wang T. Canessa C.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 455-466Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Vitari A.C. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, in this study, the animal fed with the diet that could reduce the activity of SGK1 (31Hou J. Speirs H.J. Seckl J.R. Brown R.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) had the increased intrarenal MAGI-1a-long/Kir4.1 interaction. Although the results of this study suggest the MAGI-1 isoform(s) participate in the localization of the basolateral K+ channel in distal renal tubules and MDCK cells, other scaffolding proteins that contain PDZ domain(s) might participate in the localization. On the basolateral side of MDCK cells and mouse distal renal tubules, the dystrophin-associated protein complex that contains several scaffolding proteins with PDZ domain(s), including α-syntrophin, is reported to exist (32Loh N.Y. Newey S.E. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2715-2724PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kachinsky A.M. Froehner S.C. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because α-syntrophin has the PDZ domain that can interact with the PDZ-binding motif of Kir4.1 (34Connors N.C. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Kofuji P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28387-28392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), these proteins might also contribute to the localization of the basolateral K+ channels in distal renal tubules. The contribution of these scaffolding proteins for the localization of the K+ channels remains to be clarified by their direct interaction in distal renal tubules. In conclusion, MAGI-1a-long functions as a scaffolding protein for the distal renal tubular basolateral K+ channels (Fig. 8). Phosphorylation of the channels impedes the channel scaffolding by MAGI-1a-long and could decrease the basolateral K+ recycling. These findings suggest that the regulatory pathway for the activity of kinases in renal tubules participates in the distal renal tubular Na+/K+ regulation. Download .zip (.32 MB) Help with zip files"
https://openalex.org/W2158138924,"Information from exogenous donor DNA can be introduced into the genome via homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. These pathways are stimulated by double strand breaks and by DNA damage such as interstrand cross-links. We have employed triple helix-forming oligonucleotides linked to psoralen (pso-TFO) to introduce a DNA interstrand cross-link at a specific site in the genome of living mammalian cells. Co-introduction of duplex DNA with target region homology resulted in precise knock in of the donor at frequencies 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than with donor alone. Knock-in was eliminated in cells deficient in ERCC1-XPF, which is involved in recombinational pathways as well as cross-link repair. Separately, single strand oligonucleotide donors (SSO) were co-introduced with the pso-TFO. These were 10-fold more active than the duplex knock-in donor. SSO efficacy was further elevated in cells deficient in ERCC1-XPF, in contrast to the duplex donor. Resected single strand ends have been implicated as critical intermediates in sequence modulation by SSO, as well as duplex donor knock in. We asked whether there would be a competition between the donor species for these ends if both were present with the pso-TFO. The frequency of duplex donor knock in was unaffected by a 100-fold molar excess of the SSO. The same result was obtained when the homing endonuclease I-SceI was used to initiate HDR at the target site. We conclude that the entry of double strand breaks into distinct HDR pathways is controlled by factors other than the nucleic acid partners in those pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1982702194,"The light-emitting Vibrios provide excellent material for studying the interaction of cellular communication with growth rate because bioluminescence is a convenient marker for quorum sensing. However, the use of bioluminescence as a marker is complicated because bioluminescence itself may affect growth rate, e.g. by diverting energy.The marker effect was explored via growth rate studies in isogenic Vibrio harveyi (Vh) strains altered in quorum sensing on the one hand, and bioluminescence on the other. By hypothesis, growth rate is energy limited: mutants deficient in quorum sensing grow faster because wild type quorum sensing unleashes bioluminescence and bioluminescence diverts energy. Findings reported here confirm a role for bioluminescence in limiting Vh growth rate, at least under the conditions tested. However, the results argue that the bioluminescence is insufficient to explain the relationship of growth rate and quorum sensing in Vh. A Vh mutant null for all genes encoding the bioluminescence pathway grew faster than wild type but not as fast as null mutants in quorum sensing. Vh quorum sensing mutants showed altered growth rates that do not always rank with their relative increase or decrease in bioluminescence. In addition, the cell-free culture fluids of a rapidly growing Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) strain increased the growth rate of wild type Vh without significantly altering Vh's bioluminescence. The same cell-free culture fluid increased the bioluminescence of Vh quorum mutants.The effect of quorum sensing on Vh growth rate can be either positive or negative and includes both bioluminescence-dependent and independent components. Bioluminescence tends to slow growth rate but not enough to account for the effects of quorum sensing on growth rate."
https://openalex.org/W2011944299,"Negative frequency-dependence, which favors rare genotypes, promotes the maintenance of genetic variability and is of interest as a potential explanation for genetic differentiation. Density-dependent selection may also promote cyclic changes in frequencies of genotypes. Here we show evidence for both density-dependent and negative frequency-dependent selection on opposite life-history tactics (low or high reproductive effort, RE) in the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Density-dependent selection was evident among the females with low RE, which were especially favored in low densities. Instead, both negative frequency-dependent and density-dependent selection were shown in females with high RE, which were most successful when they were rare in high densities. Furthermore, selection at the individual level affected the frequencies of tactics at the population level, so that the frequency of the rare high RE tactic increased significantly at high densities. We hypothesize that these two selection mechanisms (density- and negative frequency-dependent selection) may promote genetic variability in cyclic mammal populations. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether the origin of genetic variance in life-history traits is causally related to density variation (e.g. population cycles)."
https://openalex.org/W2083044668,"HIF-1α is originally identified as a transcription factor that activates gene expression in response to hypoxia. In metazoans, HIF-1α functions as a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis and regulates adaptive responses to change in oxygen tension during embryogenesis, tissue ischemia, and tumorigenesis. Because Hif-1α-deficient mice exhibit a number of developmental defects, the precise role of HIF-1α in early cardiac morphogenesis has been uncertain. Therefore, to clarify the role of HIF-1α in heart development, we investigated the effect of knockdown of HIF-1α in Xenopus embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotide microinjection techniques. Knockdown of HIF-1α resulted in defects of cardiogenesis. Whole mount in situ hybridization for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) showed the two separated populations of cardiomyocytes, which is indicative of cardia bifida, in HIF-1α-depleted embryos. Furthermore, the depletion of HIF-1α led to the reduction in cTnI expression, suggesting the correlation between HIF-1α and cardiac differentiation. We further examined the expression of several heart markers, nkx2.5, gata4, tbx5, bmp4, hand1, and hand2 in HIF-1α-depleted embryos. Among them, the expression of nkx2.5 was significantly reduced. Luciferase reporter assay using the Nkx2.5 promoter showed that knockdown of HIF-1α decreased its promoter activity. The cardiac abnormality in the HIF-1α-depleted embryo was restored with co-injection of nkx2.5 mRNA. Collectively, these findings reveal that HIF-1α-regulated nkx2.5 expression is required for heart development in Xenopus."
https://openalex.org/W2160142939,"The nuclear receptor CAR (constitutive active/androstane receptor) is a drug-sensing transcription factor, regulating the hepatic genes that encode various drug-metabolizing enzymes. We have now characterized the novel regulatory mechanism by which the signal molecule EGR1 (early growth response 1) determines CAR-mediated activation of the human CYP2B6 (cytochrome P450 2B6) gene. The CYP2B6 enzyme metabolizes commonly used therapeutics and also activates pro-drugs. The CAR directly binds to the distal enhancer element of the CYP2B6 promoter, which is essential in converging to its drug-sensing function onto promoter activity. However, this binding alone is not sufficient to activate the CYP2B6 promoter; the promoter requires EGR1 to enable CAR to activate the CYP2B6 promoter. Upon stimulation by protein kinase C, EGR1 directly binds to the proximal promoter and coordinates the nearby HNF4α (hepatocyte-enriched nuclear factor 4α) with CAR at the distal enhancer element to activate the promoter. Thus, synergy of drug activation and the stimulation of cellular signal are necessary for CAR to activate the CYP2B6 gene.

The liver is endowed with a defense mechanism against toxicity and carcinogenicity caused by xenobiotics, including therapeutic drugs. The underlying defense mechanism is xenobiotic-induced activation of various genes that encode xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and proteins, such as CYPs (cytochromes P450) and transporters, increasing hepatic capability of xenobiotic metabolism and excretion. The nuclear receptor CAR (constitutive active/androstane receptor) plays key roles in the regulation of these genes (1Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although CAR is primarily characterized as a xenobiotic-activated nuclear receptor, its ability to regulate the transcription critically depends on the status of endogenous stimuli. Recent studies have begun to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which these cellular signals regulate the CAR-mediated trans-activation. For example, insulin and growth factors are known to repress the CAR-mediated induction of the CYP gene. The insulin response forkhead transcription factor 1, acting as co-repressor, directly binds to CAR and represses CAR-mediated transcription (2Kodama S. Koike C. Negishi M. Yamamoto Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor inhibits the nuclear translocation of CAR to repress the induction of the CYP gene in mouse primary hepatocytes (3Koike C. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor ECT2 (epithelial cell transforming gene 2) represses drug-induced nuclear translocation of CAR in the mouse liver (4Hosseinpour F. Timsit Y. Koike C. Matsui K. Yamamoto Y. Moore R. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for how xenobiotics and endogenous cell signals cross-talk to activate the nuclear receptor is extremely complex and remains elusive. A good example for this complexity is the phenomenon in which co-treatment with CAR ligand TCPOBOP and the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) 2The abbreviations used are: OA, okadaic acid; TCPOBOP, 1,4-bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene; PBREM, phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module; OAREKI, OA response element; DR, direct repeat; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); CITCO, 6-(4-chloropheny)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; mCAR, mouse CAR; hCAR, human CAR; RT, reverse transcription; PB, phenobarbital. synergistically activates the human CYP2B6 gene in Ym17 cells (HepG2 cells that stably express V5His-tagged mouse CAR) (5Swales K.

Human CYP2B6 is a clinically important enzyme that metabolizes many commonly used therapeutics and activates anti-cancer pro-drugs, such as cyclophosphamid and ifosfamide (6Rodriguez-Antona C. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 7Schwartz P.S. Chen C.S. Waxman D.J. Cancer Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Two distinct DNA sequences within the CYP2B6 promoter are required for CAR to synergistically activate the promoter activity: the distal phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) and the proximal OA response element now called OAREKI (5Swales K. Kakizaki S. Yamamoto Y. Inoue K. Kobayashi K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3458-3466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Inoue K. Borchers C.H. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The PBREM is well characterized as being the CAR response enhancer to which CAR directly binds to activate PBREM (DR4)-bearing genes in response to xenobiotics (9Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 10Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). OAREKI consists of a 52-bp DNA sequence and is activated by OA treatment; the activation mechanism of this process remains unknown. We have now dissected the 52-bp sequence into three distinct motifs (DR1, E-box, and CACCC) and identified HNF4α (hepatocyte-enriched nuclear factor 4α) and EGR1 (early growth response 1) as the transcription factors that regulate the DR1 and CACCC motifs, respectively. Moreover, EGR1 is characterized as being the OA-induced factor and is required to enable CAR to cross-talk with HNF4α in activating the CYP2B6 promoter. EGR1 is known to be induced by various endogenous stimuli, such as the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated protein kinase C (PKC) pathway (11Worden B. Yang X.P. Lee T.L. Bagain L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22222-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Treatment with the PKC activator PMA has resulted in the induction of EGR1 in HepG2 cells, and the co-treatment with PMA and TCPOBOP has resulted in the synergic up-regulation of the CYP2B6 gene. Thus, the direct CAR binding to PBREM needs to be coordinated with the EGR1-mediated signal transduction for CAR to activate the CYP2B6 gene. Thus, the present characterization of EGR1 as being the essential factor required for CAR to activate transcription has significant pharmacological implications in drug therapy as well as introducing a new concept of CAR biology. Reagents—TCPOBOP and Me2SO were purchased from Sigma; OA was from Calbiochem; CITCO and PMA were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) was from GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp. The plasmids pGL3basic and pcDNA3.1-V5-His-TOPO were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and Invitrogen, respectively. Normal rabbit IgG and antibodies against HNF4α (H-171) (for supershift assay) and EGR1 ((588)X) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); antibody against HNF4α (for ChIP assay) was from Perseus Proteomics Inc. (Tokyo, Japan); V5 antibody was from Invitrogen. Cloning and Plasmids—–1.8 kb and –1.6 kb promoters of the CYP2B6 gene, PBREM/–307 and PBREM/–213, were cloned into basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic as described previously (5Swales K. Kakizaki S. Yamamoto Y. Inoue K. Kobayashi K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3458-3466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants were constructed in the contest of –1.8 kb promoter or PBREM/–307 using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Cedar Creek, TX) and proper primers; ΔOAREKI, ΔDR1, and ΔCA delete the region of –268/–217, –227/–217, and –268/–244, respectively. The cDNAs encoding human HNF4α and EGR1 were amplified from HepG2 and Caco-2 RNAs, respectively, and were cloned into the pcDNA3.1-V5-His-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen). All other plasmids were previously constructed in this laboratory. Cell Cultures—HepG2-derived Ym17 and Yh18 cells were produced previously (5Swales K. Kakizaki S. Yamamoto Y. Inoue K. Kobayashi K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3458-3466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These and HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplement with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and 2 mm glutamine. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with the same amount of fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were harvested from four confluent 145-cm2 dishes for each treatment using the procedure described previously (13Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cell-based Transfection Assays—Cells were plated on a 24-well plate at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well. About 24 h postplating, cells were transfected with a given plasmid or co-transfected with a combination of multiple plasmids using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) for 24 h prior to drug treatments. The doses of TCPOBOP, OA, and CITCO were 250, 10, and 250 nm, respectively. After an additional 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested for luciferase assays using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For PMA experiments, cells were treated with Me2SO or TCPOBOP for 24 h prior to adding PMA (150 nm). At various time points after adding PMA, cells were harvested for subsequent luciferase assays. Gel Shift Assays—Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the DR1 (–229/–217) and CACCC (–253/–242) sequence (5′-GATCTGGACTTTGATAT-3′ and 5′-GATCCACCCACACATT-3′, respectively) were used as probes. The underlined sequences indicate additional sequences that were filled in with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. 2–5 μg of nuclear proteins were used for each reaction. For the competition assay, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probes was added into reaction mixture. The sequence of mutant probes for DR1 and CACCC were 5′-GATCTGGACTTAGATAT-3′ and 5′-GATCCAGGCACACATTC-3′, respectively. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of a given antibody for 1 h on ice prior to adding probes. Real Time PCR—Preparation of total RNA and the subsequent synthesis of first strand cDNA were performed using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), respectively, and were subjected to real time PCR analysis using the 7900HT fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). For CYP2B6 mRNA, probe (Hs00167937_g1 from Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix were used to perform PCR amplification. Forward and reverse primers used for EGR1 mRNA were 5′-CCGCAGAGTCTTTTCCTGACA-3′ and 5′-CCACAAGGTGTTGCCACTGT-3′, respectively, and PCR amplification was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The levels of CYP2B6 and EGR1 mRNAs were normalized by β-actin mRNA that was measured using a predeveloped Taqman assay for human β-actin (Applied Biosystems). Western Blot—Two hundred μg of nuclear proteins prepared from drug-treated Ym17 cells were applied on 20 μlofSP Sepharose™ XL Reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaMoO4, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After washing the resin with equilibrating buffer three times, bound proteins were eluted into 30 μl by increasing NaCl to 0.5 m, separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford MA). These membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-EGR1 antibody (1:5000 dilutions) in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Subsequently, they were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein bands were visualized by ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). siRNA Knockdown—siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Ym17 cells plated on a 6-well plate at a density of 1.4 × 106 cells/well were transfected with 200 pmol of ON-TARGET Plus SMART pool EGR1 (catalog number L-006526-00) or ON-TARGET Plus siCONTROL™ nontargeting pool (catalog number D-001810-10) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were subjected to treatment with drugs for an additional 48 h. Total RNAs and nuclear extracts were for real time PCR and gel shift assays to verify siRNA knockdown of both EGR1 mRNA and protein. The same total RNAs were also used in real time PCR for the CYP2B6 mRNA. ChIP Assays—ChIP assay was performed as described in our previous report (8Inoue K. Borchers C.H. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnologies, Charlottesville, VA). Briefly, Ym17 cells were crosslinked in serum-free minimal essential medium containing 1% of formaldehyde, washed by cold PBS, and were homogenized in wash buffer containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40. Cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were sonicated to sheared chromatin in SDS lysis buffer and were centrifuged to lysates. After it was precleared by shaking with protein A, the lysate was incubated with 5 μg of either antibody or normal IgG and was added by protein A to precipitate immunocomplexes. From decross-linked and protease-digested immunocomplexes, DNA was purified by the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was amplified by PCR using LA Taq polymerase (Takara, Otsu Shiga, Japan). The amplicon (–338 to –99 region) was resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. Defining OAREKI—Our previous characterization of the OA response activity and subsequent sequence motif analysis delineated to OA response element (now called OAREKI) to the –268/–217 region of the CYP2B6 promoter (Fig. 1). The 5′- and 3′-regions of OAREKI constitute the CA-rich and DR1 motifs, respectively, which are flanked by the E-box. For further functional characterization of OAREKI, two primary constructs of the CYP2B6 promoter were used: –1.8 kb CYP2B6-Luc containing both PBREM and OAREKI and PBREM/–307 CYP2B6-Luc in which the –1682/–308 region was internally deleted in the context of –1.8 kb CYP2B6-Luc (Fig. 1). Similar to the –1.8 kb promoter, PBREM/–307 was synergistically activated by co-treatment with TCPOBOP and OA in Ym17 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Although PBREM/–307 exhibited lower basal promoter activity compared with the –1.8 kb promoter (Fig. 2A), PBREM/–307 was synergized at the same rate (43–48-fold) as the –1.8 kb promoter (Fig. 2B). Deletion of OAREKI abrogated OA response activity and synergy in both the –1.8 kb and PBREM/–307 promoters (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, these deletion promoters diminished their ability to be activated by TCPOBOP, although they retained some degree of the activation. To examine whether CAR is required for OA to activate the CYP2B6 promoter, similar experiments were performed using HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Since HepG2 cells lack CAR, no activation by TCPOBOP was observed. Both –1.8 kb and PBREM/–307 promoters were activated by OA 2-fold in HepG2 cells, although the rates of OA activation were lower compared with those observed in Ym17 cells. These results indicated that the synergistic activation of the CYP2B6 promoter can be regulated by the two elements PBREM and OAREKI and that OAREKI is the element responsible for regulating the activation by OA. In addition, OAREKI can be activated by OA in the absence of CAR, whereas the low activation rates by OA in HepG2 cells imply that some form of cross-talk between CAR and OAREKI is involved in the regulation of OA activation.FIGURE 2OAREKI required for CAR to activate the CYP2B6 promoter. The –1.8 kb promoter, its deletion mutant (–1.8 kb ΔOAREKI), PBREM/–307, or its deletion mutant (PBREM/–307ΔOAREKI) was co-transfected with phRL-SV40 into Ym17 (A and B) or HepG2 (C and D) cells. The cells were treated with Me2SO (DMSO), 250 nm TCPOBOP (TC), 10 nm OA, or TCPOBOP plus OA (OA&TC) and were harvested for measuring luciferase activity. Reporter activity was calculated by dividing firefly luciferase with Renilla luciferase activities (A and C). -Fold activation was calculated by taking control activity (Me2SO) as 1 (B and D).

Chem. 2002; 277: 18510-18516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Removal of the –227/–217 from PBREM/–307 resulted in the complete elimination of the promoter activity, no response to TCPOBOP and OA and no synergy (Fig. 3A). This DR1 motif formed a specific protein-DNA complex with nuclear protein prepared from Ym17 cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, supershift by HNF4α antibody of this complex formed between the –229/–217 probe and nuclear protein confirmed that HNF4α was the protein that bound to the DR1 (Fig. 3B). ChIP assays confirmed that HNF4α occupied the OAREKI of the CYP2B6 promoter before co-treatment with TCPOBOP and OA and remained occupied after the co-treatment (Fig. 3C). Two insights became evident; HNF4α was required for both TCPOBOP and OA to activate PBREM/–307, and OA treatment did not increase HNF4α binding to the DR1 probe. These results indicated that HNF4α is essential for the activation and synergy of the CYP2B6 promoter but is not the OA response transcription factor. Although HNF4α is considered as a constitutively activated nuclear receptor, the present results showed that this receptor requires an additional regulation to activate the promoter activity. Identifying EGR1 as the OA Response Factor—When the CA-rich region (–268/–244) was deleted, PBREM/–307 retained the ability to be activated by TCPOBOP, but OA was no longer able to activate this deletion promoter (Fig. 4A). Following gel shift assays using various fragments representing the CA-rich region and the nuclear extracts from Ym17 cells, the –253/–242 (CACCCACACATT) was found to specifically bind with a nuclear protein (Fig. 4B). This protein binding to the –253/–242 probe appeared only after OA treatment and remained after TCPOBOP and OA co-treatment. Based on the nucleotide sequence CACCCACACA, various transcription factors, such as SP1, AP1, Kruppel-like factors, and EGR1, were selected (16Meester-Smoor M.A. Molijn A.C. Zhao Y. Groen N.A. Groffen C.A. Boogaard M. van Dalsum-Verbiest D. Grosveld G.C. Zwarthoff E.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 38: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) and tested for their binding to the –253/–242 probe; only the EGR1 antibody supershifted the specific band (Fig. 4B). No supershift occurred with anti-KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor 4) antibody (Fig. 4B) and also with KLF9, KLF3, SP1, and AP1 (data not shown). EGR1 mRNA and protein levels were induced after OA treatment (Fig. 4, C and D), and concomitantly, the binding of ERG1 to the endogenous CYP2B6 promoter was increased in ChIP assays (Fig. 4E). Thus, EGR1 was clearly shown to be the OA response transcription factor. Unlike HNF4α, EGR1, however, plays no role in promoter activation by TCPOBOP. Defining EGR1 Function—Various experiments were employed to confirm that EGR1 is, in fact, the OA response transcription factor responsible for the synergistic activation of the endogenous CYP2B6 gene. First, siRNA was used to knock down EGR1 in Ym17 cells, proving the effective attenuation of both drug induction and synergy of the CYP2B6 gene (Fig. 5A). siRNA treatment dramatically reduced the EGR1 mRNA levels as well as the levels of EGR1 protein as observed with gel shift assays (Fig. 5, B and C). Second, OA treatment was replaced by epitotic expression of EGR1 to mimic the synergistic activation of the CYP2B6 gene. In the presence of pcDNA3.1, TCPOBOP induced the CYP2B6 gene ∼40-fold, whereas transfection of pcDNA3.1-EGR1 exhibited the ∼13-fold induction of the gene. Moreover, pcDNA3.1-EGR1 was transfected, the induction of the CYP2B6 gene was synergized up to 450-fold after TCPOBOP treatment (Fig. 5D). This synergistic induction of the CYP2B6 gene was directly reflected upon the synergistic activation of the CYP2B6 promoter by EGR1 and TCPOBOP (Fig. 5E). Co-transfection of pcDNA3.1-EGR1 synergistically up-regulated CAR-mediated activation of the CYP2B6 promoter in HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). These EGR1-mediated inductions and synergistic activations were reminiscent of that by OA and TCPOBOP (Figs. 4A and 5A). Thus, EGR1 is the OA response transcription factor required for the synergistic activation of the CYP2B6 gene following co-treatment with TCPOBOP. Using CAR, HNF4α, and EGR1, we attempted to reconstitute the synergistic activation of the CYP2B6 promoter. For this purpose, untagged mouse CAR (mCAR) was used as a substitute for TCPOBOP treatment, since, unlike the V5 His-tagged mCAR that is stably expressed in Ym17 cells, untagged mCAR possesses a high constitutive activity and does not need TCPOBOP to activate the CYP2B6 promoter. Instead of HepG2 cells, COS-1 cells, which do not express endogenous HNF4α, were employed as the host cells; the levels of endogenous EGR1 in COS-1 cells are as low as those observed in HepG2 cells. Under these conditions, reconstitution experiments were performed by expressing only CAR, HNF4α, or EGR1 and by co-expressing them in various combinations (Fig. 6). mCAR, HNF4α, or EGR1 exhibited practically no activation activity of the –1.8 kb promoter. HNF4α plus EGR1 and mCAR plus HNF4α activated the –1.8 kb promoter ∼10-fold, whereas mCAR plus EGR1 exhibited no activation activity. Subsequently, the co-expression of mCAR, HNF4α, and EGR1 all together synergized the promoter activity over 130-fold (Fig. 6). This synergistic activation depended on the presence of both PBREM and OAREKI, as indicated by the fact that neither the –1.6 kb (which lacks PBREM), the –1.8 kb (ΔOAREKI), nor the PBREM/–213 (in which PBREM is directly placed the front of the CYP2B6 –213 bp promoter) could respond to these transcription factors. In addition to mCAR, human CAR (hCAR) was also capable of synergizing the –1.8 kb promoter; epitotic expression of EGR1 synergistically activated the –1.8 kb promoter after co-treatment with the hCAR ligand CITCO (18Maglich J.M. Parks D.J. Moore L.B. Collins J.L. Goodwin B. Billin A.N. Stoltz C.A. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. J. Biol.

In addition, this activity of CAR appeared to be specific to the nuclear receptor, since human PXR failed to synergize the promoter activity in the presence of HNF4α and EGR1 (Fig. 7C).FIGURE 7EGR1 co-regulates CAR but not PXR. A, Yh18 (HepG2 cells stably expressing human CAR) were co-transfected with –1.8 kb promoter, phRL-SV40, and pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-EGR1 and were treated with Me2SO (DMSO) or CITCO (250 nm) for 48 h and assayed for luciferase activity. -Fold luciferase reporter activation was calculated by taking the control activity (pcDNA3.1 with Me2SO) as 1. B, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with –1.8 kb promoter, phRL-SV40, and various combinations of pcDNA3.1, pCR3-hCAR, pcDNA3.1-HNF4α, and pcDNA3.1-EGR1. The total amounts of plasmids transfected into cells were adjusted by adding supplementary pcDNA3.1. -Fold activation was calculated by taking the control activity (pcDNA3.1) as 1.

Instead a relatively nonspecific protein phosphatase inhibitor OA, the specific PKC activator PMA was employed to examine whether the PKC signal pathway could synergize CAR-mediated activation of the CYP2B6 promoter. PMA treatment increased the EGR1 mRNA level in a time-dependent manner, reaching its peak at 1 h after treatment in Ym17 cells (Fig. 8A). Gel shift and supershift assays showed that PMA induces the EGR1 protein and the binding to the –253/–242 probe (Fig. 8B). Although CYP2B6 mRNA was barely increased at any time points following treatment with PMA alone, a dramatic increase of mRNA was observed after co-treatment with PMA and TCPOBOP, starting at 2 h and reaching a peak at 10 h after co-treatment (Fig. 8C). At 24 h, TCPOBOP alone, PMA alone, and PMA plus TCPOBOP induced CYP2B6 mRNA 16-, 7-, and 1500-fold, respectively (Fig. 8C), revealing the strong ability of PMA to synergize drug induction of the CYP2B6 gene. Indeed, the –1.8 kb promoter was also synergistically activated by co-treatment with PMA and TCPOBOP; the ability of PMA to synergize the promoter activity was as strong as that of OA (Fig. 8D). These results indicated that PKC signal can synergize the CAR-activated transcription of the CYP2B6 gene. Until now, CAR has been understood to regulate gene transcription by directly binding to its enhancer elements or by indirectly interacting with other transcription factors. In this mechanism of gene transcription, transduction of a drug-induced signal to the CAR protein either directly or indirectly should be sufficient. Here we have demonstrated that although the signal activating CAR is essential, by itself it is not sufficient for regulating the CYP2B6 gene. The drug-activated CAR requires an additional endogenous cell signal to regulate the CYP2B6 gene; the endogenous signal we have now found for the regulation is an early growth signal via the PKC-EGR1 pathway. EGR1 directly binds to the proximal region of the CYP2B6 promoter and coordinates cross-talk of HNF4α with the drug-activated CAR that directly binds to the distal enhancer element. Contrary to the fact that both CAR and HNF4α are characterized as the constitutively activated nuclear receptors, their activities appear to be confined within tight regulations. Our present study has unequivocally shown that PBREM/–307 is the minimal promoter that can be synergistically activated in the presence of CAR, HNF4α, and EGR1, delineating the xenobiotic activation activity of the CYP2B6 gene to two distinct elements PBREM and OAREKI and these three transcription factors. Although all three transcription factors are essential for the CYP2B6 gene to be activated, each factor appears to play a different role in this activation. HNF4α is the constitutive factor to govern the basal transcription activity of the CYP2B6 promoter, since the CYP2B6 promoter was slightly activated by co-expression of HNF4α and EGR1 or CAR but not by that of CAR and EGR1 in COS-1 cells. On the other hand, CAR and EGR1 are the regulated factors. CAR and its enhancer PBREM act as the xenobiotic sensors and are required for xenobiotic activation of the CYP2B6 gene. EGR1 is not a xenobiotic-sensing factor and is regulated by endogenous signals, such as PKC. Apparently, EGR1 may enable the xenobiotic sensor CAR to allow communicating with HNF4α, completing the process of xenobiotic activation of the CYP2B6 promoter. A number of xenobiotics, classically represented by phenobarbital, do not bind to CAR for activation. This regulatory mechanism that requires additional factors, such as EGR1 and HNF4α, for CAR activation may endow hepatocytes with tightness as well as flexibility toward xenobiotic responsiveness. In the CYP2B6 promoter, CAR directly binds to the –1.7 kb upstream PBREM, whereas the binding site of HNF4α resides at the –229/–217 bp within OAREKI. Our previous ChIP study demonstrated that CAR indirectly interacts with OAREKI following co-treatment with OA and TCPOBOP, suggesting that the interaction of CAR with OAREKI is the most critical step in CAR-mediated promoter regulation (5Swales K.

Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since there is no CAR binding site within OAREKI and gel shift assays confirmed it (5Swales K. Kakizaki S. Yamamoto Y. Inoue K. Kobayashi K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3458-3466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Inoue K. Borchers C.H. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the interaction of CAR with OAREKI is of an indirect nature, through a DNA-binding protein. This protein may be HNF4α, since GST pull-down assays showed CAR binding to HNF4α, and DR1-based DNA affinity chromatography co-purified CAR with HNF4α. 3K. Inoue and M. Negishi, unpublished data. Although further work is necessary to prove this point, it will not be surprising to find that HNF4α is, in fact, the protein that mediates the indirect interaction of CAR with OAREKI. CAR-mediated induction by drugs such as phenobarbital (PB) is a liver-specific phenomenon, and HNF4α, the hepatocyte-enriched transcription factor, is a most critical transcription factor that generally determines liver development and function. The roles of HNF4α have repeatedly been shown also in the area of xenobiotic metabolism (23Kamiya A. Inoue Y. Gonzalez F.J. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Saborowski M. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Eloranta J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Dispos. 2007; 35: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because both PBREM and OAREKI are essential for CAR to activate the CYP2B6 promoter and CAR interacts with both, it is necessary for the receptor to co-regulate them. Apparently, the binding of EGR1 to the CACCC site facilitates the interaction of CAR with OAREKI (probably via HNF4α) to complete the process of promoter activation; solving the exact molecular mechanism of this process will be the key subject of future investigations. In conclusion, PKC activation signals HepG2 cells to increase EGR1, allowing CAR to confer its ability to sense xenobiotics and induce transcription of the CYP2B6 gene. In fact, PKC is previously suggested to be the signal that regulates the EGR1-mediated activation of the PDGFA gene in human head and neck cancer cells (11Worden B. Yang X.P. Lee T.L. Bagain L. Yeh N.T. Cohen J.G. Van Waes C. Chen Z. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7071-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Due to the extreme complexity of these signaling mechanisms that differ among the various cell systems, however, it is uncertain whether PKC can dictate the CAR-mediated transcription in human liver. An intriguing question raised is whether xenobiotics initiate EGR1 signal simultaneously when they activate CAR or the initiation of EGR1 is totally independent from xenobiotic action. Conversely, it is also an interesting question whether an enzyme activity of CYP2B6 is involved in an early growth response of hepatocytes. Our present discovery of the PKC-EGR1 as being the key signal necessary for CAR to activate the CYP2B6 gene has opened a new concept in CAR biology and its pharmacological and toxicological implications in understanding human susceptibility to xenobiotic exposure and efficacy of drug therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2014687101,"VILIP-1, a member of the neuronal Ca++ sensor protein family, acts as a tumor suppressor gene in an experimental animal model by inhibiting cell proliferation, adhesion and invasiveness of squamous cell carcinoma cells. Western Blot analysis of human tumor cells showed that VILIP-1 expression was undetectable in several types of human tumor cells, including 11 out of 12 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. The down-regulation of VILIP-1 was due to loss of VILIP-1 mRNA transcripts. Rearrangements, large gene deletions or mutations were not found. Hypermethylation of the VILIP-1 promoter played an important role in gene silencing. In most VILIP-1-silent cells the VILIP-1 promoter was methylated. In vitro methylation of the VILIP-1 promoter reduced its activity in a promoter-reporter assay. Transcriptional activity of endogenous VILIP-1 promoter was recovered by treatment with 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5′-Aza-dC). Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, potently induced VILIP-1 expression, indicating that histone deacetylation is an additional mechanism of VILIP-1 silencing. TSA increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in the region of the VILIP-1 promoter. Furthermore, statistical analysis of expression and promoter methylation (n = 150 primary NSCLC samples) showed a significant relationship between promoter methylation and protein expression downregulation as well as between survival and decreased or absent VILIP-1 expression in lung cancer tissues (p<0.0001). VILIP-1 expression is silenced by promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation in aggressive NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors and its clinical evaluation could have a role as a predictor of short-term survival in lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2101058121,"The coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (RPS) of Streptococcus oralis and related species are recognized by lectin-like adhesins on other members of the oral biofilm community and by RPS-specific antibodies. The former interactions involve beta-GalNAc or beta-Gal containing host-like motifs in the oligosaccharide repeating units of these polysaccharides, whereas the latter involves features of these molecules that are immunogenic. In the present investigation, the molecular and corresponding structural basis for the serotype specificity of S. oralis ATCC 10557 RPS was determined by engineering the production of this polysaccharide in transformable Streptococcus gordonii 38. This involved the systematic replacement of genes in the rps cluster of strain 38 with different but related genes from S. oralis 10557 and structural characterization of the resulting polysaccharides. The results identify four unique genes in the rps cluster of strain 10557. These include wefI for an alpha-Gal transferase, wefJ for a GalNAc-1-phosphotransferase that has a unique acceptor specificity, wefK for an acetyl transferase that acts at two positions in the hexasaccharide repeating unit, and a novel wzy associated with the beta1-3 linkage between these units. The serotype specificity of engineered polysaccharides correlated with the wefI-dependent presence of alpha-Gal in these molecules rather than with partial O-acetylation or with the linkage between repeating units. The findings illustrate a direct approach for defining the molecular basis of polysaccharide structure and antigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2027174545,"The first contact a virus makes with cells is an important determinant of its tropism. Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) is highly dependent on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) for cell binding. Its first contact is therefore likely to involve a GAG-binding virion glycoprotein. We have previously identified two such proteins, gp70 and gp150. Gp70 binds strongly to GAGs. However, deleting it makes little difference to MuHV-4 cell binding or GAG-dependence. Deleting gp150, by contrast, frees MuHV-4 from GAG dependence. This implies that GAGs normally displace gp150 to allow GAG-independent cell binding. But the gp150 GAG interaction is weak, and so would seem unlikely to make an effective first contact. Since neither gp70 nor gp150 matches the expected profile of a first contact glycoprotein, our understanding of MuHV-4 GAG interactions must be incomplete. Here we relate the seemingly disconnected gp70 and gp150 GAG interactions by showing that the MuHV-4 gH/gL also binds to GAGs. gH/gL-blocking and gp70-blocking antibodies individually had little effect on cell binding, but together were strongly inhibitory. Thus, there was redundancy in GAG binding between gp70 and gH/gL. Gp150-deficient MuHV-4 largely resisted blocks to gp70 and gH/gL binding, consistent with its GAG independence. The failure of wild-type MuHV-4 to do the same argues that gp150 is normally engaged only down-stream of gp70 or gH/gL. MuHV-4 GAG dependence is consequently two-fold: gp70 or gH/gL binding provides virions with a vital first foothold, and gp150 is then engaged to reveal GAG-independent binding."
https://openalex.org/W2148886011,"We previously identified a RING-IBR protein, RBCK1, as a protein kinase C (PKC) β- and ζ-interacting protein, and its splice variant, RBCK2, lacking the C-terminal half including the RING-IBR domain. RBCK1 has been shown to function as a transcriptional activator whose nuclear translocation is prevented by interaction with the cytoplasmic RBCK2. We here demonstrate that RBCK1, like many other RING proteins, also possesses a ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity and that its E3 activity is inhibited by interaction with RBCK2. Moreover, RBCK1 has been found to undergo efficient phosphorylation by PKCβ. The phosphorylated RBCK1 shows no self-ubiquitination activity in vitro. Overexpression of PKCβ leads to significant increases in the amounts of intracellular RBCK1, presumably suppressing the proteasomal degradation of RBCK1 through self-ubiquitination, whereas coexpression with PKCα, PKCϵ, and PKCζ shows no or little effect on the intracellular amount of RBCK1. Taken together, the E3 activity of RBCK1 is controlled by two distinct manners, interaction with RBCK2 and phosphorylation by PKCβ. It is possible that other RING proteins, such as Parkin, BRCA1, and RNF8, having the E3 activity, are also down-regulated by interaction with their RING-lacking splice variants and/or phosphorylation by protein kinases.

Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and was shown to interact with not only PKCβ but also PKCζ. RBCK1 consists of a ubiquitin-like sequence (1Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a coiled-coil region, an novel zinc finger motif (2Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), another coiled-coil region, and a RING-IBR domain (3Marín I. Ferrús A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), arranged from the N to C terminus (see Fig. 1A). RBCK1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in normal rat tissues. RBCK1 possesses a transcriptional activity, and its RING-IBR domain interacts with DNA fragments containing a TGG-rich sequence, indicating that RBCK1 is a “transcriptional factor.” The RING finger motif occurring around the middle of the whole sequence (RING1) is essential for the transcriptional activity of RBCK1, which is enhanced by coexpression with protein kinase A and significantly repressed by coexpression with extracellular signal-regulated kinase activator kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) (4Tatematsu K. Tokunaga C. Nakagawa N. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RBCK1 is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (5Tatematsu K. Yoshimoto N. Koyanagi T. Tokunaga C. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Yoshida M. Okajima T. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22937-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), possessing a classical Leu-rich nuclear export signal as well as the nuclear localization signal. These intracellular localization signals, thus, allow the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of RBCK1 (5Tatematsu K. Yoshimoto N. Koyanagi T. Tokunaga C. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Yoshida M. Okajima T.

Furthermore, intranuclear RBCK1 colocalizes with a promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and a CREB-binding protein (CBP) present in the nuclear bodies. The transcriptional activity of RBCK1 is up-regulated by interaction with CBP, whereas the CBP-enhanced activity is down-regulated by interaction with PML (5Tatematsu K. Yoshimoto N. Koyanagi T.

RBCK2, lacking the C-terminal half of RBCK1 including the RING-IBR domain, was also identified as an alternative splice variant of RBCK1 (6Tokunaga C. Tatematsu K. Kuroda S. Nakagawa N. Kikkawa U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RBCK2 functions as an anchoring protein for the parental RBCK1 and represses its transcriptional activity by tethering it within the cytoplasm (7Yoshimoto N. Tatematsu K. Koyanagi T. Okajima T. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another splice variant of RBCK1, named HOIL-1, was recently reported to be a ubiquitin ligase E3 (8Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y. Tokunaga F. Kanie M. Rouault T.A. Morishima I. Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism-related gene product, Parkin, also a RING-IBR protein, shows an E3 activity (9Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that RBCK1 functions not only as a transcriptional factor but also as a ubiquitin ligase E3. In the ubiquitin-proteasome system, E3 plays a crucial role in the recognition of specific substrate protein and facilitates polyubiquitination of the substrate proteins by the help of ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2. The polyubiquitinated substrate proteins are sorted to the proteasome for degradation (10Driscoll J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4789-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conventional regulation of E3 activity is based on the modification of specific substrates. For example, the phosphorylated forms of IκBα and β-catenin are able to interact with an FWD1 subunit of the SCF complex (an E3 enzyme), which initiates polyubiquitination of IκBα and β-catenin (11Hatakeyama S.

On the other hand, there are only a few E3-interacting proteins that have so far been found to modulate the E3 activity. The E3 activities of MDM2 and the SCF complex are enhanced by phosphorylation with glycogen synthase kinase-3 (13Kulikov R. Boehme K.A. Blattner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7170-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and modification of the Cul1 subunit by Nedd8 (14Gazdoiu S. Yamoah K. Wu K. Escalante C.R. Tappin I. Bermudez V. Aggarwal A.K.

In this paper we demonstrate that RBCK1, reported previously as a transcriptional factor (1Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mammalian expression plasmids for N-terminal FLAG- and HA-tagged ubiquitin (FLAG-ubiquitin and HA-ubiquitin), pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-ubiquitin, and pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-ubiquitin, respectively, were gifts from Dr. Keiji Tanaka. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells (∼1 × 107 cells in 100-mm dish) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under humidified air with 5% CO2. The cells were transfected with plasmids by electroporation or a FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). The transfected cells were cultured for 60 h, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in 1 ml of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 tablet of Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) per 50 ml).

Some membranes were stripped in Western blot stripping solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and then reprobed by using an anti-β-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:1000) (Sigma) as a primary antibody and an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) as a secondary antibody (dilution, 1:3000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method with an ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacture's protocol. Cycloheximide Chase Assay—HEK293 cells (∼5 × 105 cells in a 12-well plate) were transfected with 0.5 μg of pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1 by FuGENE 6 reagent, cultured for 40 h, and treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 4, 8, and 24 h. MG132 (50 μm) was added to the medium to see the effect of proteasomal degradation. The cells were washed twice with PBS and suspended in 50 μl of the lysis buffer, and the lysate was subjected to Western blot analysis. The relative amount of FLAG-RBCK1 was estimated by chemiluminescence using a Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). Pulse-Chase Assay—HEK293 cells (∼5 × 105 cells in 12-well plates) were transfected by FuGENE 6 reagent with 0.5 μg of pHT2-RBCK1 and either 2 μg of pTB701-FLAG-RBCK2, 0.5 μg of pTB701-HA-PKCβ, or 0.5 μg of pTB701-HA-PKCζ, cultured for 40 h, incubated with 5 μm HaloTag-tetramethylrhodamine ligand (Promega) for 15 min to allow the pulse labeling of HT-RBCK1, and washed twice with PBS. After the incubation for the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with PBS and suspended in 30 μl of lysis buffer. The cleared lysate (10 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the HaloTag-tetramethylrhodamine ligand-labeled HT-RBCK1 was visualized with a fluoro-image analyzer FLA-3000G (FUJI FILM, Tokyo, Japan). In Vitro Ubiquitin Ligase Assay—GST-RBCK1 was purified from Escherichia coli BL21 expressing GST-RBCK1 by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) column (5 × 10 mm). The ubiquitination reaction of GST-RBCK1 (1 μg) or the immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged RBCK1 was carried out with E1 (100 ng, Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA) and UbcH7 (400 ng, Boston Biochem) in 15 μl of the reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg of ubiquitin/HA tagged-ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 5 μg of creatine kinase (Calbiochem)) for 60 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by boiling with Laemmli sample buffer. The samples including ubiquitin were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-ubiquitin mouse monoclonal antibody P4D1 (dilution, 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a primary antibody and an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (dilution, 1:3000) (GE Healthcare) as a secondary antibody. HA-tagged ubiquitin was also detected using an anti-HA rat polyclonal antibody (dilution, 1:1000) (Roche Diagnostics) and an HRP-conjugated anti-rat IgG goat antibody (dilution, 1:1000) (GE Healthcare Bio-Science). The same membrane was reprobed by using an anti-RBCK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (5Tatematsu K. Yoshimoto N. Koyanagi T. Tokunaga C. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Yoshida M. Okajima T. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22937-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as a primary antibody and an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG donkey antibody (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) as a secondary antibody (dilution, 1:5000). Phosphatase Treatment of RBCK1—The immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged RBCK1 (25 μl as semi-dried beads) was mixed with 75 μl of the dephosphorylation reaction mixture (4 units of protein phosphatase 2A (Promega), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and subjected to the in vitro ubiquitin ligase assay. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of FLAG-RBCK1 mRNA—HEK293 cells (about 1 × 107 cells) were cotransfected with the indicated amounts (see Fig. 2B) of pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1 and pTB701-FLAG-RBCK2 and cultured for 40 h. Total RNA was purified by using Gene Elute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma) according to manufacturer's protocol, and the possible contamination of plasmids was eliminated by the on-column DNA digestion with the mixture of DNase I (Sigma) and DNase digest buffer (Sigma). Total RNA (100 ng) was amplified by using FullVelocity SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix (Stratagene) with the sense (nucleotides 750-770 of RBCK1) and antisense (nucleotides 905-929 of RBCK1) primers. PCR was carried out with 25 cycles of a 2-step reaction (denaturing at 95 °C, annealing and elongation at 60 °C), and the PCR products were separated by using 4% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis followed by the staining with ethidium bromide. In Vivo 32P-Labeling—HEK293 cells (∼1 × 106 cells in a 60-mm dish) were transfected with 3 μg of pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1 by electroporation, cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), washed twice with PBS, incubated for 6 h with phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.1% FBS, and labeled with phosphate-free DMEM containing 4.3 MBq of [32P]orthophosphate and 10% FBS (dialyzed) for 12 h. The cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of the lysis buffer, and cleared lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis using an anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed using a Cyclone Phospho Imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vivo Phosphorylation Analysis of RBCK1 with Phos-Tag Acrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—In the Mn2+-Phos-tag-modified acrylamide gel (18Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Takiyama K. Koike T. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), the phosphorylated proteins migrate slower than non-phosphorylated protein by the interaction of phosphate groups with Mn2+-Phos-tag. HEK293T cells overexpressing either FLAG-RBCK1 or FLAG-RBCK1 (ST mutant) were treated with or without 1 μm okadaic acid in culture medium for 30 min. The cell lysates were subjected to the Mn2+-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide gel including 50 μm MnCl2 and 50 μm Phos-tag acrylamide (NARD Institute, Ltd. Hyogo, Japan)) and analyzed by Western blotting using an HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—RBCK1 was excised from GST-RBCK1 using PreScission Protease™ (GE Healthcare) and purified by passing through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Either RBCK1 (0.5 μg), UbcH7 (0.5 μg), or E1 (0.5 μg) was mixed with PKCβII (Sigma) in the phosphorylation reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma), and 25 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2.3 × 1016 Bq/mol)) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were boiled with Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by autoradiography. Identification of the Phosphorylation Site in RBCK1 by Mass Spectrometry—The RBCK1 phosphorylated in vitro by PKCβII was digested in-solution by endoproteinase Glu-C or in-gel by the combination of trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C or trypsin alone. The digested products of RBCK1 were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. In-solution digestion was carried out as follows. A solution containing 2 μg of RBCK1 was reduced with DTT (final concentration, 10 mm) for 1 h at 56 °C and then alkylated with iodoacetamide (final concentration, 40 mm) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, the solution was diluted with the same volume of 100 mm NH4HCO3 and added with endoproteinase Glu-C (0.1 μg/μl). Digestion was performed overnight, and the peptide solution was dried up to 10 μl under reduced pressure. The peptide mixture was purified using ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) containing C18 reversed-phase resins according to the manufacturer's protocol. In-gel digestion was carried out as follows. The phosphorylated RBCK1 was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The stained band was excised from the gel, cut into pieces, washed twice with 50 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, and dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile. The protein sample was reduced with 10 mm DTT in 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 1 h at 56 °C and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, the gel pieces were washed twice for 5 min alternately with 100 mm NH4HCO3 and acetonitrile and then completely dried up under reduced pressure. Appropriate volumes of trypsin solution (25 ng/μl trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3) were added to the dried gel pieces. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the supernatant containing digested peptides was transferred to a new tube. The remaining peptides in gel pieces were eluted with the solution containing 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 5% (v/v) formic acid. The recovered peptides from the gels were combined into the same tube and were dried up to 10 μl under reduced pressure. The trypsin-digested sample was further diluted with 100 mm NH4HCO3 and added with endoproteinase Glu-C (0.1 μg/μl). The second digestion was also performed overnight, and the peptide solution was dried up to 10 μl under reduced pressure. The peptide mixture was purified using ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore) containing C18 reversed-phase resins according to the manufacturer's protocol. The eluted peptide solution was placed on a MALDI target plate, mixed with a matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid; Sigma), and analyzed by an oMALDI-Qq-TOF MS/MS QSTAR Pulsar i (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) in the linear positive ion mode. The spectral data were analyzed for peptide identification by peptide mass fingerprinting using a MASCOT Version 1.9 (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) with NCBInr data base. Immunocytochemical Analysis—HEK293 (∼5 × 104 cells in a 35-mm glass-bottom dish) cells transfected with either pTB701-HA-PKCβ or TB701-HA-PKCβKN were cultured for 72 h, washed twice with PBS, fixed with 100% (v/v) methanol at -20 °C for 20 min, washed twice again with PBS, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Endogenous RBCK1 was visualized with an anti-RBCK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (5Tatematsu K. Yoshimoto N. Koyanagi T. Tokunaga C. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Yoshida M. Okajima T. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22937-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as a primary antibody (dilution, 1:50) and a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody (GE Healthcare) as a secondary antibody (dilution, 1:500). Overexpressed HA-PKCβ was detected with an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 as a primary antibody (dilution, 1:400) and a Cy2-labeled anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (GE Healthcare) as a secondary antibody (dilution, 1:500). Fluorescence of the cells was observed under an LSM 5 Pascal confocal laser scan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Interaction of RBCK1 with Ubiquitinated Proteins and Self-ubiquitination Activity—UIP28, a mouse orthologue of RBCK1, was reported to interact with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcM4/UbcH7 (E2) (19Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HOIL-1, a splice variant of human RBCK1, was also shown to work as ubiquitin ligase (E3) for IRP2 (8Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y. Tokunaga F. Kanie M. Rouault T.A. Morishima I. Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, the novel zinc finger motif of RBCK2 was found to interact with ubiquitinated proteins (2Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar); the motif is shared by RBCK1 (see Fig. 1A). We, therefore, investigated whether RBCK1 interacts with a substrate protein for polyubiquitination, as reported for Parkin (9Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar) and other E3 proteins (20Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R.

Both HA-ubiquitin and FLAG-RBCK1 were coexpressed in HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates containing RBCK1, the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was significantly increased after 3 h of the MG132 treatment (Fig. 1B, top panel). Because self-ubiquitinated RBCK1 was hardly observed in the immunoprecipitates (middle panel), the major portion of the ubiquitinated proteins observed in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates was considered to be other ubiquitinated proteins bound to RBCK1 rather than the self-ubiquitinated RBCK1. Nevertheless, the amount of RBCK1 was also increased several fold by the incubation with MG132 for 8 h (middle panel), suggesting that RBCK1 itself is degraded as well by proteasome. To confirm self-ubiquitination of RBCK1 within the cells, a 6-fold amount of the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates used in Fig. 1B was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, RBCK1 was indeed found to be mono- and slightly di-ubiquitinated. When the RING1-disrupted RBCK1 mutant (FLAG-RBCK1C293G) was examined, it was scarcely ubiquitinated (Fig. 1C), indicating that the RING1 finger plays an important role in the se"
https://openalex.org/W1968885280,"It is believed that gene/environment interaction (GEI) plays a pivotal role in the development of motor skills, which are acquired via practicing or motor training. However, the underlying molecular/neuronal mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we reported that the expression of NR2B, a subunit of NMDA receptors, in cerebellar granule cells specifically enhanced the effect of voluntary motor training on motor learning in the mouse. Moreover, this effect was characterized as motor learning-specific and developmental stage-dependent, because neither emotional/spatial memory was affected nor was the enhanced motor learning observed when the motor training was conducted starting at the age of 3 months old in these transgenic mice. These results indicate that changes in the expression of gene(s) that are involved in regulating synaptic plasticity in cerebellar granule cells may constitute a molecular basis for the cerebellum to be involved in the GEI by facilitating motor skill learning."
https://openalex.org/W2054723648,"It is suggested that the degree distribution for networks of the cell-metabolism for simple organisms reflects a ubiquitous randomness. This implies that natural selection has exerted no or very little pressure on the network degree distribution during evolution. The corresponding random network, here termed the blind watchmaker network has a power-law degree distribution with an exponent γ≥2. It is random with respect to a complete set of network states characterized by a description of which links are attached to a node as well as a time-ordering of these links. No a priory assumption of any growth mechanism or evolution process is made. It is found that the degree distribution of the blind watchmaker network agrees very precisely with that of the metabolic networks. This implies that the evolutionary pathway of the cell-metabolism, when projected onto a metabolic network representation, has remained statistically random with respect to a complete set of network states. This suggests that even a biological system, which due to natural selection has developed an enormous specificity like the cellular metabolism, nevertheless can, at the same time, display well defined characteristics emanating from the ubiquitous inherent random element of Darwinian evolution. The fact that also completely random networks may have scale-free node distributions gives a new perspective on the origin of scale-free networks in general."
https://openalex.org/W2086018294,"Reactions to sensory events sometimes require quick responses whereas at other times they require a high degree of accuracy-usually resulting in slower responses. It is important to understand whether visual processing under different response speed requirements employs different neural mechanisms.We asked participants to classify visual patterns with different levels of detail as real-world or non-sense objects. In one condition, participants were to respond immediately, whereas in the other they responded after a delay of 1 second. As expected, participants performed more accurately in delayed response trials. This effect was pronounced for stimuli with a high level of detail. These behavioral effects were accompanied by modulations of stimulus related EEG gamma oscillations which are an electrophysiological correlate of early visual processing. In trials requiring speeded responses, early stimulus-locked oscillations discriminated real-world and non-sense objects irrespective of the level of detail. For stimuli with a higher level of detail, oscillatory power in a later time window discriminated real-world and non-sense objects irrespective of response speed requirements.Thus, it seems plausible to assume that different response speed requirements trigger different dynamics of processing."
https://openalex.org/W2093267478,"Diseases are believed to arise from dysregulation of biological systems (pathways) perturbed by environmental triggers. Biological systems as a whole are not just the sum of their components, rather ever-changing, complex and dynamic systems over time in response to internal and external perturbation. In the past, biologists have mainly focused on studying either functions of isolated genes or steady-states of small biological pathways. However, it is systems dynamics that play an essential role in giving rise to cellular function/dysfunction which cause diseases, such as growth, differentiation, division and apoptosis. Biological phenomena of the entire organism are not only determined by steady-state characteristics of the biological systems, but also by intrinsic dynamic properties of biological systems, including stability, transient-response, and controllability, which determine how the systems maintain their functions and performance under a broad range of random internal and external perturbations. As a proof of principle, we examine signal transduction pathways and genetic regulatory pathways as biological systems. We employ widely used state-space equations in systems science to model biological systems, and use expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms and Kalman filter to estimate the parameters in the models. We apply the developed state-space models to human fibroblasts obtained from the autoimmune fibrosing disease, scleroderma, and then perform dynamic analysis of partial TGF-beta pathway in both normal and scleroderma fibroblasts stimulated by silica. We find that TGF-beta pathway under perturbation of silica shows significant differences in dynamic properties between normal and scleroderma fibroblasts. Our findings may open a new avenue in exploring the functions of cells and mechanism operative in disease development."
