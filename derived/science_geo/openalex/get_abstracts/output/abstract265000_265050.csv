https://openalex.org/W2079567648,"The Permian-Triassic boundary records the most severe mass extinctions in Earth's history. Siberian flood volcanism, the most profuse known such subaerial event, produced 2 million to 3 million cubic kilometers of volcanic ejecta in approximately 1 million years or less. Analysis of 40Ar/39Ar data from two tuffs in southern China yielded a date of 250.0 ± 0.2 million years ago for the Permian-Triassic boundary, which is comparable to the inception of main stage Siberian flood volcanism at 250.0 ± 0.3 million years ago. Volcanogenic sulfate aerosols and the dynamic effects of the Siberian plume likely contributed to environmental extrema that led to the mass extinctions."

Molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that branched threadlike micelles should exist in concentrated solutions of dimeric surfactants. Here experimental evidence, obtained from transmission electron microscopy at cryogenic temperature, is presented of branched threadlike micelles in aqueous solutions of a triquaternary ammonium (trimeric) surfactant made up of three amphiphilic moieties connected at the level of the head-groups by two propanediyl spacers."
https://openalex.org/W2023559472,"Values of the oxygen isotope ratios (delta(18)O) in tree-ring cellulose closely reflect the delta(18)O values in atmospheric precipitation and hence mean annual temperature. The change in delta(18)O in cellulose is 0.41 per mil per degree Celsius for selected near-coastal stations. The values of delta(18)O in precipitation and cellulose also change with altitude, as demonstrated for Mount Rainier, Washington. A temperature lapse rate of 5.2 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C per 1000 meters calculated from cellulose delta(18)O values agrees with the accepted mean annual lapse rate of 5 degrees C per 1000 meters for this region. Cellulose delta(18)O values and delta(18)O values of carbon dioxide equilibrated with leaf water differ by a fixed 16 per mil."
https://openalex.org/W2066103180,"Ordering at short-length scales is a universal feature of the glassy state. Experiments on boron oxide and other materials indicate that ordering on mesoscopic-length scales may also be universal. The high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of oxygen in boron oxide glass presented here provide evidence for structural units responsible for ordering on short- and intermediate-length scales. At the molecular level, planar BO(3/2) units accounted for the local ordering. Oxygen-17 NMR spectra resolved detailed features of the inclusion of these units in boroxol rings, oxygen bridging two rings, and oxygen shared between two nonring BO(3/2) units. On the basis of these and corroborative boron-11 NMR and scattering results, boron oxide glass consists of domains that are rich or poor in boroxol rings; these domains are proposed to be the structural basis of intermediate-range order in glassy boron oxide."

The (206)Pb/(207)Pb ratios, used to characterize the lead source, had values of approximately 1.24 for coastal oceanic water, approximately 1.22 for fjord waters receiving lead from mine tailings, and approximately 1.163 for waters near urban centers. The lead concentration data are in agreement with presently accepted seawater values."

https://openalex.org/W1986903573,Upper Mesozoic and Cenozoic pelagic sediments in the central Pacific Ocean contain occasional horizons with reworked and displaced fossils produced by organisms that once lived in neritic shallow-water environments. The flux of neritic fossils was restricted to eight intervals of low eustatic sea level during Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic times. They were eroded from shoals along the flanks of volcanic highs which often supported tropical islands and which since then have subsided.
https://openalex.org/W2040155456,"Vulnerability to oil supply interruptions poses serious threats to the U.S. economy and the life-style of its citizens. The Iranian cutbacks in 1979 resulted in price increases of 120 percent in 1 year and gasoline lines across the country. Creation and use of ample public and private stocks could moderate price increases after another interruption and prevent disruption of supplies. Use of the marketplace to allocate shortages, coupled with rebates to cushion blows to the economy and hardship to individuals, would be eminently more efficient than government allocation programs. International cooperation, through coordination of stock buildup and withdrawal, could mitigate the damage from oil disruptions among all the Western nations."
