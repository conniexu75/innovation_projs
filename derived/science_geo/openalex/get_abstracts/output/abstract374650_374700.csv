https://openalex.org/W2102650038,"Immune homeostasis is dependent on tight control over the size of a population of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells capable of suppressing over-exuberant immune responses. The T(reg) cell subset is comprised of cells that commit to the T(reg) lineage by upregulating the transcription factor Foxp3 either in the thymus (tT(reg)) or in the periphery (iT(reg)). Considering a central role for Foxp3 in T(reg) cell differentiation and function, we proposed that conserved non-coding DNA sequence (CNS) elements at the Foxp3 locus encode information defining the size, composition and stability of the T(reg) cell population. Here we describe the function of three Foxp3 CNS elements (CNS1-3) in T(reg) cell fate determination in mice. The pioneer element CNS3, which acts to potently increase the frequency of T(reg) cells generated in the thymus and the periphery, binds c-Rel in in vitro assays. In contrast, CNS1, which contains a TGF-beta-NFAT response element, is superfluous for tT(reg) cell differentiation, but has a prominent role in iT(reg) cell generation in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. CNS2, although dispensable for Foxp3 induction, is required for Foxp3 expression in the progeny of dividing T(reg) cells. Foxp3 binds to CNS2 in a Cbf-beta-Runx1 and CpG DNA demethylation-dependent manner, suggesting that Foxp3 recruitment to this 'cellular memory module' facilitates the heritable maintenance of the active state of the Foxp3 locus and, therefore, T(reg) lineage stability. Together, our studies demonstrate that the composition, size and maintenance of the T(reg) cell population are controlled by Foxp3 CNS elements engaged in response to distinct cell-extrinsic or -intrinsic cues."
https://openalex.org/W2014413787,"Abnormal neuronal aggregation of α-synuclein is implicated in the development of many neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Glial cells also show extensive α-synuclein pathology and may contribute to disease progression. However, the mechanism that produces the glial α-synuclein pathology and the interaction between neurons and glia in the disease-inflicted microenvironment remain unknown. Here, we show that α-synuclein proteins released from neuronal cells are taken up by astrocytes through endocytosis and form inclusion bodies. The glial accumulation of α-synuclein through the transmission of the neuronal protein was also demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model expressing human α-synuclein. Furthermore, astrocytes that were exposed to neuronal α-synuclein underwent changes in the gene expression profile reflecting an inflammatory response. Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines correlated with the extent of glial accumulation of α-synuclein. Together, these results suggest that astroglial α-synuclein pathology is produced by direct transmission of neuronal α-synuclein aggregates, causing inflammatory responses. This transmission step is thus an important mediator of pathogenic glial responses and could qualify as a new therapeutic target.

Clinically, it is characterized by a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms, and pathologically by selective neurodegeneration and the occurrence of Lewy bodies in central and peripheral nervous tissues (1.Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). Evidence from genetic, pathologic, and biochemical studies suggests that abnormal deposition of the neuronal protein α-synuclein produces the pathogenesis of PD (2.Cookson M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Aggregated forms of α-synuclein are the major component of Lewy bodies (3.Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar), which are also found in other neurological diseases, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Furthermore, recent studies showed extensive deposition of filamentous α-synuclein aggregates in astroglia and oligodendrocytes in PD, DLB, and multiple system atrophy (4.Braak H. Sastre M.

Previously, we showed that small amounts of the protein, both overexpressed and endogenous, are present in the lumen of vesicles and secreted from neuronal cells by exocytosis (12.Lee H.J. Patel S. Lee S.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6016-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Both monomeric and the aggregated forms were found in vesicles and exocytosed. Monomeric and oligomeric forms of α-synuclein have been detected in human cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma (13.El-Agnaf O.M. Salem S.A. Paleologou K.E. Cooper L.J. Fullwood N.J. Gibson M.J. Curran M.D. Court J.A. Mann D.M. Ikeda S. Cookson M.R. Hardy J. Allsop D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1945-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and the levels of the oligomeric forms were elevated in PD patients compared with control cases (14.El-Agnaf O.M. Salem S.A. Paleologou K.E. Curran M.D. Gibson M.J. Court J.A. Schlossmacher M.G. Allsop D. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest the pathogenic actions of α-synuclein extend to the extracellular space and neighboring cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was shown that extracellular exposure of cultured microglia to aggregated or nitrated α-synuclein produced some signs of activated microglia (15.Zhang W. Wang T. Pei Z. Miller D.S. Wu X. Block M.L. Wilson B. Zhang W. Zhou Y. Hong J.S. Zhang J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 16.Reynolds A.D. Glanzer J.G. Kadiu I.

More recently, it was shown that α-synuclein aggregates released from neuronal cells can be transferred to neighboring neurons forming Lewy-like inclusions (17.Desplats P. Lee H.J. Bae E.J. Patrick C. Rockenstein E. Crews L. Spencer B. Masliah E. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13010-13015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), providing mechanistic basis for the development of Lewy pathology in mesencephalic transplants in PD patients (18.Kordower J.H. Chu Y. Hauser R.A. Freeman T.B. Olanow C.W. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 19.Li J.Y. Englund E. Holton J.L. Soulet D. Hagell P. Lees A.J. Lashley T.

Despite these exciting new findings, the pathophysiological roles of the secreted α-synuclein remain largely unclear. Here, we report that α-synuclein proteins released from neuronal cells are readily endocytosed by astrocytes. When the internalized α-synuclein accumulates in astrocytes, the cells produce glial inclusions and inflammatory responses. Therefore, when neurons are under protein conformational stresses forming α-synuclein aggregates, secreted forms of α-synuclein potentially act as a messenger between neurons and astroglia, inducing neuroinflammatory responses. All-trans-retinoic acid, proteinase K, Triton X-100, thioflavin S, and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The Dynamin K44A/pCB1 vector was a kind gift from Dr. Marc Caron. Recombinant human wild-type α-synuclein was purchased from ATGen (Sungnam, Korea). The following primary antibodies were used: α-synuclein polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), α-synuclein monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), Myc polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-dynamin antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-GFP N terminus antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-GFAP antibody (Abcam), anti-S100 antibody(Abcam), anti-GLUT1 antibody (Abcam), anti-Hsp70/Hsc70 antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), anti-20S antibody (Calbiochem), anti-ubiquitin antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-IL-1α antibody (Abcam), anti-IL-1β antibody (Abcam), anti-IL-6 antibody (Abcam), and anti-β-actin antibody. A monoclonal antibody for LAMP 2 (H4B4) developed by Drs. August and Hildreth and β-tubulin antibody (E7) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health and maintained by The University of Iowa, Dept. of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Maintenance of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells were previously described (20.Lee H.J. Khoshaghideh F. Patel S. Lee S.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Primary astrocytes were obtained from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (21.Shin C.Y. Choi J.W. Ryu J.R. Ryu J.H. Kim W. Kim H. Ko K.H. Brain Res. 2001; 902: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Briefly, dissected cortices without meninges were broken into smaller pieces by pipetting in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, and trypsin was added. After DNaseI digestion, medium was added to inactivate trypsin, and cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min. The cell pellet was resuspended with fresh medium before filtration through a 120-μm Nylon mesh filter. Cells were grown in poly-d-lysine-coated flasks for 3–4 days before splitting into new flasks. On day 7 after preparation, cells grown in T75 flasks were shaken vigorously at least 15 times to detach microglia cells from astrocyte layer and removed. Cells were cultured for another 1∼2 weeks, split onto new dishes when confluent, before they were used for experiments. Contaminant microglia cells in these cultures were 2.3 ± 0.09%. For α-synuclein expression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, a recombinant adenoviral vector containing human α- synuclein cDNA (adeno/α-syn), β-galactosidase (adeno/lacZ, supplied from BD Biosciences), and C-terminal-tagged human α-synuclein (adeno/α-syn-MycHis) were used as previously described (20.Lee H.J. Khoshaghideh F. Patel S. Lee S.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 22.Lee H.J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For co-culture of cells, primary astrocytes were added to SH-SY5Y cells infected with adeno/α-syn, adeno/lacZ, or adeno/α-syn-MycHis on day 3 of infection and co-cultured for 3 days or as indicated. For expression of dynamin K44A and GFP, primary astrocytes were transfected with dynamin K44A/pCB1 or pEGFP (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 before culturing with SH-SY5Y cells. For inhibition of internalized α-synuclein degradation, bafilomycin A1 was added to a final concentration of 50 nm on day 2 of infection for 15 h. For extraction of cellular proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and harvested in PBS containing 1% triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cell extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min and the triton-soluble (supernatant) and -insoluble (pellet) fractions were obtained. For collection of the conditioned medium, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells infected with adeno/α-syn were used. On day 2 of infection, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after washing twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged further at 10,000 × g to remove debris and dead cells. The recovered supernatant was concentrated 50- to 100-fold using Amicon 10K MWCO filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrations of non-tagged and Myc-tagged α-synuclein in the conditioned medium measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were 4.23 ± 1.2 μg/ml and 83.1 ± 27.3 ng/ml, respectively. The concentrations of α-synuclein in the media of rat primary neuron cultures were measured by quantitative Western blotting with recombinant human α-synuclein standards and were approximately ∼3 ng/ml. The conditioned medium from polyhistidine-tagged α-synuclein-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells was prepared as described above. The conditioned medium was incubated with Talon beads (BD Biosciences) to deplete α-synuclein, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. Western blotting was performed using a monoclonal anti α-synuclein antibody (Syn-1, BD Biosciences) as previously described (22.Lee H.J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Images were obtained and quantified using a luminescent image analyzer LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Japan) and Multi Gauge (v3.0) software. For this study, a total of 12 heterozygous transgenic (tg) mice (Line D) expressing human α-synuclein under the regulatory control of the platelet-derived growth factor-β (PDGFβ) promoter (23.Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar) (6 months old) and 12 non-transgenic age-matched littermates were used. These animals were selected because they display abnormal accumulation of detergent-insoluble α-synuclein and develop α-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusion-like structures in the brain. Although some nuclear staining has been observed in this model, distinct cytoplasmic inclusion-like structures have been consistently identified by confocal and electron microscopy (23.Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 24.Masliah E. Rockenstein E.

Furthermore, these animals also display neurodegenerative and motor deficits that mimic certain aspects of PD and DLB. Comparisons for the patterns of α-synuclein distribution were performed in the brains of our model mimicking AD-like pathology by expressing the human mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP tg, line 41) (n = 6, 6 months old) under the thy1 promoter (25.Rockenstein, E., Mallory, M., Mante, M., Alford, M., Windisch, M., Moessler, H., Masliah, E. (2002) J. Neural Transm. Suppl., 327–336Google Scholar). In addition, studies of the re-distribution of α-synuclein were performed in the PDGFα-syn-GFP tg mouse model (line 78) (n = 6, 6 months old) (26.Rockenstein E. Schwach G. Ingolic E. Adame A. Crews L. Mante M. Pfragner R. Schreiner E. Windisch M. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 80: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), because in these mice the fused GFP protein expected to reduce the neuronal release of α-synuclein compared the PGDFα-syn tg lines (line D). Animal protocols were approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. For this study we included a total of 18 cases (for detail see supplemental Table S4); of these, 4 were non-demented controls, 8 were DLB cases, and the other 6 were AD cases. Autopsy material was obtained from patients studied neurologically and psychometrically at the Alzheimer Disease Research Center/University of California, San Diego. For each case, paraffin sections from 10% buffered formalin-fixed neocortical, limbic system, and subcortical material stained with hematoxylin and eosin and thioflavin-S were used for routine neuropathological analysis (27.Hansen L.A. Daniel S.E. Wilcock G.K. Love S. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1998; 64: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that included Braak stage (28.Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11641) Google Scholar). The diagnosis of DLB was based on the clinical presentation of dementia and the pathological findings of Lewy bodies in the locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, or nucleus basalis of Meynert, as well as in cortical and subcortical regions. Lewy bodies were detected using hematoxylin and eosin anti-ubiquitin and anti-α-synuclein antibodies as recommended by the Consortium on DLB criteria for a pathologic diagnosis of DLB (29.McKeith I.G. Galasko D. Kosaka K. Perry E.K. Dickson D.W. Hansen L.A. Salmon D.P. Lowe J. Mirra S.S. Byrne E.J. Lennox G. Quinn N.P. Edwardson J.A. Ince P.G. Bergeron C. Burns A. Miller B.L. Lovestone S. Collerton D. Jansen E.N. Ballard C. de Vos R.A. Wilcock G.K. Jellinger K.A. Perry R.H. Neurology. 1996; 47: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). In addition to the presence of Lewy bodies, the great majority of these cases display sufficient plaques and tangles to be classified as Braak stages III–IV. Specifically, DLB cases had abundant plaques in the neocortex and limbic system but fewer tangles compared with AD cases. The procedure for immunofluorescence cell staining has been described elsewhere (22.Lee H.J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Nuclei were stained with TOPRO-3 dye (Invitrogen), and the coverslips were mounted on slides in Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were observed with an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope. For three-dimensional analysis of images, serial images through z axis were obtained and analyzed using FV10-ASW software (Olympus). For immunohistochemistry of tissue sections, free-floating 40-μm-thick vibratome sections were washed with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), pre-treated in 3% H2O2, and blocked with 10% serum (Vector), 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 0.2% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline-Triton X-100. Sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against human α-synuclein (Chemicon), and then incubated with secondary antibody (1:75, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by avidin d-horseradish peroxidase (ABC Elite, Vector) and reacted with diaminobenzidine (0.2 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) with 0.001% H2O2. Control experiments consisted of incubation with pre-immune rabbit serum. Double-immunofluorescence analyses of tissue sections were performed utilizing the Tyramide Signal Amplification™- Direct (Red) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specificity of this system was tested by deleting each primary antibody. For this purpose, sections were double labeled with the monoclonal antibodies against α-synuclein (1:20,000, Cell Signaling) detected with Tyramide Red and either S100 detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:75, Vector). All sections were processed simultaneously under the same conditions, and experiments were performed twice for reproducibility. Sections were imaged with a Zeiss 63× (numerical aperture, 1.4) objective on an Axiovert 35 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with an attached MRC1024 laser scanning confocal microscope system (Bio-Rad). In situ hybridization was carried out using human α-synuclein sense and antisense Riboprobes labeled with 35S, essentially as described previously (30.Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Song D. Shults C.W. Lang I. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraffin sections were treated with Proteinase K, incubated in the prehybridization solution, and hybridized with Riboprobes at 60 °C. Sections were exposed to film and developed 3 days to 2 weeks later. These sections were then dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion and developed 10 days later. Total RNA was prepared from primary astrocytes using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA was used for microarray and RT-PCR analysis. For RT-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's protocol. Two microliters of synthesized cDNA was used for PCR using ImmomixRed (Bioline) with primers and reaction temperatures as indicated in supplemental Table 3. Rat 8-plex cytokine kit was obtained from Panomics (Fremont, CA). Primary astrocytes grown in a 12-well plate were treated with LacZ or α-synuclein conditioned medium for 24 h. The medium from astrocytes were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was obtained. Quantification of TNFα and CXCL1 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The result was read using a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad). The integrity of the total RNA extracted from primary astrocytes was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and the RNA integrity numbers were 10 for all samples. 500 ng of high quality total RNA was amplified with a TotalPrep amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 750 ng of amplified cRNA was hybridized to the RatRef-12 expression BeadChip for 16 h. The hybridized array was scanned with a BeadArray Reader (Illumina). The microarray data are deposited in a GEO data base under accession number GSE11574. Using the Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip, we obtained expression levels for nearly 22,000 genes in astrocytes exposed for 6 and 24 h to conditioned media from cultures of α-synuclein and lacZ-expressing cells. There were three array replicates done for each condition (astrocytes treated for 6 and 24 h with lacZ and α-synuclein containing conditioned media). The probe intensities were normalized at log2 scale using quantile normalization in BeadArray 1.6, an R/Bioconductor package. Probe annotation was done using lumi 1.4, an R/Bioconductor package providing an integrated solution for Illumina microarray data analysis. Before identifying differentially expressed genes, we first applied a Gaussian mixture modeling technique to the normalized data to determine present/absent calls as follows. In the mixture modeling, 1) two Gaussian probability density functions, one for absent and the other for present probes, were fitted to the distribution of the observed probe intensity and 2) among the 22,523 probes, 11,039 probes, whose maximum intensities in all 12 samples were higher than the threshold intensity, where two fitted Gaussian probability density functions meet, were determined to be present. Then, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between astrocytes treated with α-synuclein and lacZ containing conditioned media independently for two time points (6 and 24 h) by an integrative statistical test combining the p values from three statistical hypothesis testing methods: Student two-tailed t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and median difference test. In each test, an empirical null probability density function was estimated for the corresponding statistic (T, rank sum, and median difference) computed from all possible permutations of the samples. A p value for the observed statistic of each probe was then computed using the empirical probability density function. For each probe, p values resulting from three statistical tests were combined as an overall p value using meta analysis (Stouffer's method) as described in Hwang et al. (31.Hwang D. Rust A.G. Ramsey S. Smith J.J. Leslie D.M. Weston A.D. de Atauri P. Aitchison J.D. Hood L. Siegel A.F. Bolouri H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17296-17301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). DEGs were selected as the genes with overall p values of <0.01. Also, false positives from potential bias toward p values from particular hypothesis testing in meta-analysis were reduced by removing genes that showed -fold differences < 1.5 between samples treated with α-synuclein and lacZ containing conditioned media. We performed a functional enrichment analysis to associate the DEGs with GO Biological Processes (GOBPs), using BiNGO, a Cytoscape Plugin, and KEGG pathways, using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (see Ref. 32.Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several GOBPs and KEGG pathways statistically enriched (p < 0.05) by the DEGs were identified (see supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Finally, network analysis was done using Cytoscape (33.Shannon P. Markiel A. Ozier O. Baliga N.S. Wang J.T. Ramage D. Amin N. Schwikowski B. Ideker T. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (25852) Google Scholar) with information of the DEGs associated with GOBPs and KEGG pathways related to inflammatory responses and known protein-protein interactions from BIND and HPRD (both available on-line). Human and mouse protein-protein interactions were translated into those in rat via ortholog ID mapping using ortholog information in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) data base (available on-line). Values in the figures are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences were considered significant if p values were <0.05. For determination of statistical significance, values were compared by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test or Student's t test using GraphPad InStat version 1.01 GraphPad software. The correlation coefficients (Pearson r) and the p values were determined by linear regression analysis. Recent studies show that cytoplasmic α-synuclein deposition occurs in both neurons and astrocytes in PD (4.Braak H. Sastre M. Del Tredici K. Acta Neuropathol. 2007; 114: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 6.Wakabayashi K. Hayashi S. Yoshimoto M. Kudo H. Takahashi H. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 99: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Considering the fact that astrocytes express no or low levels of α-synuclein on their own and are able to take up recombinant α-synuclein aggregates from the culture media (34.Lee H.J. Suk J.E. Bae E.J. Lee S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 372: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that neuronal α-synuclein aggregates are transmitted to adjacent astrocytes and form pathological inclusion bodies. To test this hypothesis, the conditioned medium containing secreted α-synuclein from differentiated SH-SY5Y cells was added to primary astrocytes. The secreted α-synuclein was readily internalized by the astrocytes, as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 1A) and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B). The presence of α-synuclein inside astrocytes was verified by proteinase K resistance (supplemental Fig. S1). Internalized proteins were found in both the Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions, and a portion of these appeared as SDS-stable high molecular weight complexes (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting internalized α-synuclein maintains its aberrant conformation after internalization. Some astrocytes accumulated the internalized α-synuclein in large juxtanuclear inclusion bodies (Fig. 1B). Approximately 30% of cells took up α-synuclein, and ∼4.6% of these cells showed large inclusion bodies. As a control, when α-synuclein was depleted from the conditioned medium (Fig. 1C), this protein was not detected in astrocytes (Fig. 1, B and D). These results exclude the possibility of transmission of α-synuclein vector to the astrocytes and demonstrate that neuronal cell-derived α-synuclein can be taken up by astrocytes and accumulate in inclusion bodies. Next, transmission of α-synuclein from neuronal cells to astrocytes was directly demonstrated in a co-culture system consisting of primary rat astrocytes and diff"

Here, using solution NMR, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis and hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry, we show that GNF-2 binds to the myristate-binding site of Abl, leading to changes in the structural dynamics of the ATP-binding site. GNF-5, an analogue of GNF-2 with improved pharmacokinetic properties, when used in combination with the ATP-competitive inhibitors imatinib or nilotinib, suppressed the emergence of resistance mutations in vitro, displayed additive inhibitory activity in biochemical and cellular assays against T315I mutant human Bcr-Abl and displayed in vivo efficacy against this recalcitrant mutant in a murine bone-marrow transplantation model. These results show that therapeutically relevant inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity can be achieved with inhibitors that bind to the myristate-binding site and that combining allosteric and ATP-competitive inhibitors can overcome resistance to either agent alone."
https://openalex.org/W2047195990,"Human tumours have a large degree of cellular and genetic heterogeneity1. Complex cell interactions in the tumour and its microenvironment are thought to have an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression2. Furthermore, cooperation between oncogenic genetic lesions is required for tumour development3; however, it is not known how cell interactions contribute to oncogenic cooperation. The genetic techniques available in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster allow analysis of the behaviour of cells with distinct mutations4, making this the ideal model organism with which to study cell interactions and oncogenic cooperation. In Drosophila eye-antennal discs, cooperation between the oncogenic protein RasV12 (ref. 5) and loss-of-function mutations in the conserved tumour suppressor scribbled (scrib)6,7 gives rise to metastatic tumours that display many characteristics observed in human cancers8,9,10,11. Here we show that clones of cells bearing different mutations can cooperate to promote tumour growth and invasion in Drosophila. We found that the RasV12 and scrib- mutations can also cause tumours when they affect different adjacent epithelial cells. We show that this interaction between RasV12 and scrib- clones involves JNK signalling propagation and JNK-induced upregulation of JAK/STAT-activating cytokines, a compensatory growth mechanism for tissue homeostasis. The development of RasV12 tumours can also be triggered by tissue damage, a stress condition that activates JNK signalling. Given the conservation of the pathways examined here, similar cooperative mechanisms could have a role in the development of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2039730962,"The fisheries and biodiversity benefits of marine reserves are widely recognised but there is mounting interest in exploiting the importance of herbivorous fishes as a tool to help ecosystems recover from climate change impacts. This approach might be particularly suitable for coral reefs, which are acutely threatened by climate change, yet the trophic cascades generated by reserves are strong enough that they might theoretically enhance the rate of coral recovery after disturbance. However, evidence for reserves facilitating coral recovery has been lacking. Here we investigate whether reductions in macroalgal cover, caused by recovery of herbivorous parrotfishes within a reserve, have resulted in a faster rate of coral recovery than in areas subject to fishing. Surveys of ten sites inside and outside a Bahamian marine reserve over a 2.5-year period demonstrated that increases in coral cover, including adjustments for the initial size-distribution of corals, were significantly higher at reserve sites than those in non-reserve sites. Furthermore, macroalgal cover was significantly negatively correlated with the change in total coral cover over time. Recovery rates of individual species were generally consistent with small-scale manipulations on coral-macroalgal interactions, but also revealed differences that demonstrate the difficulties of translating experiments across spatial scales. Size-frequency data indicated that species which were particularly affected by high abundances of macroalgae outside the reserve had a population bottleneck restricting the supply of smaller corals to larger size classes. Importantly, because coral cover increased from a heavily degraded state, and recovery from such states has not previously been described, similar or better outcomes should be expected for many reefs in the region. Reducing herbivore exploitation as part of an ecosystem-based management strategy for coral reefs appears to be justified."
https://openalex.org/W2020678906,"Background Circumcision is associated with significant reductions in HIV, HSV-2 and HPV infections among men and significant reductions in bacterial vaginosis among their female partners. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed the penile (coronal sulci) microbiota in 12 HIV-negative Ugandan men before and after circumcision. Microbiota were characterized using sequence-tagged 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing targeting the V3–V4 hypervariable regions. Taxonomic classification was performed using the RDP Naïve Bayesian Classifier. Among the 42 unique bacterial families identified, Pseudomonadaceae and Oxalobactericeae were the most abundant irrespective of circumcision status. Circumcision was associated with a significant change in the overall microbiota (PerMANOVA p = 0.007) and with a significant decrease in putative anaerobic bacterial families (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test p = 0.014). Specifically, two families—Clostridiales Family XI (p = 0.006) and Prevotellaceae (p = 0.006)—were uniquely abundant before circumcision. Within these families we identified a number of anaerobic genera previously associated with bacterial vaginosis including: Anaerococcus spp., Finegoldia spp., Peptoniphilus spp., and Prevotella spp. Conclusions/Significance The anoxic microenvironment of the subpreputial space may support pro-inflammatory anaerobes that can activate Langerhans cells to present HIV to CD4 cells in draining lymph nodes. Thus, the reduction in putative anaerobic bacteria after circumcision may play a role in protection from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2134030824,"Transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) is essential for somatic cell reprogramming. In addition, Klf4 seems to play a redundant role along with other Klf family proteins in embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal. However, how Klf4 regulates ES cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming is still poorly understood. Here we report that Klf4 is required for both ES cell self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency and that the expression of Klf4 prevents ES cell differentiation in response to withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). In addition, Klf4 directly binds to the promoter region of Nanog and regulates its expression. Expression of Nanog prevents ES cell differentiation even when Klf4 gene expression is knocked down. On the other hand, knockdown of Nanog expression induces differentiation of ES cells that overexpress Klf4. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Klf4 functions upstream of Nanog in ES cell self-renewal and in preventing ES cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2075571292,"Replicative senescence in human fibroblasts is accompanied with alterations of various biological processes, including the impaired function of the proteasome. The proteasome is responsible for the removal of both normal and damaged proteins. Due to its latter function, proteasome is also considered a representative secondary antioxidant cellular mechanism. Nrf2 is a basic transcription factor responsible for the regulation of the cellular antioxidant response that has also been shown to regulate several proteasome subunits in mice. We have established in this study the proteasome-related function of Nrf2 in human fibroblasts undergoing replicative senescence. We demonstrate that Nrf2 has a declined function in senescence, whereas its silencing leads to premature senescence. However, upon its activation by a novel Nrf2 inducer, elevated levels of proteasome activity and content are recorded only in cell lines possessing a functional Nrf2. Moreover, treatment by the Nrf2 inducer results in the enhanced survival of cells following oxidative stress, whereas continuous treatment leads to lifespan extension of human fibroblasts. Importantly the Nrf2-proteasome axis is functional in terminally senescent cultures as these cells retain their responsiveness to the Nrf2 stimuli. In conclusion, these findings open up new directions for future manipulation of the senescence phenotype.

Importantly the Nrf2-proteasome axis is functional in terminally senescent cultures as these cells retain their responsiveness to the Nrf2 stimuli. In conclusion, these findings open up new directions for future manipulation of the senescence phenotype. Normal human fibroblasts undergo a limited number of divisions in culture and progressively reach a state of irreversible growth arrest, a process termed replicative senescence. Senescence has been attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors (1.Petropoulou C. Chondrogianni N. Simões D. Agiostratidou G. Drosopoulos N. Kotsota V. Gonos E.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Senescent fibroblasts are viable and fully functional, however, they exhibit several morphologic and biochemical changes as compared with their young/proliferating counterparts (2.Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). We and others (3.Chondrogianni N. Gonos E.S. Exp. Gerontol. 2005; 40: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have reported loss of proteasome function upon aging of several human tissues as well as in senescent primary cultures. Our previous work in human embryonic fibroblast cultures undergoing replicative senescence has shown that the reduced levels of proteasome activities are accompanied by lower proteasome content due to the down-regulation of its β-catalytic subunits (4.Chondrogianni N.

The fundamental link between cellular senescence and proteasome function is further supported by our additional studies (5.Chondrogianni N. Gonos E.S.

Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrating that when the proteasome is partially inhibited in young fibroblasts cultures, an irreversible senescence-like phenotype is triggered. Importantly, reconstitution of the levels of the “down-regulated” β-subunits by genetic means in human embryonic fibroblasts, results in enhanced rates of assembled, and functional proteasome and delays senescence by ∼15% (7.Chondrogianni N.

The proteasome is the major cellular non-lysosomal threonine protease, implicated in the removal of normal as well as abnormal, denatured, or otherwise damaged proteins (8.Ciechanover A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 5944-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is a well organized protein complex that contains a proteolytic active 20 S core, composed of 28 subunits, 7 different α- and 7 different β-subunits, arranged as α1–7β1–7β1–7α1–7 structure (9.Demartino G.N. Gillette T.G. Cell. 2007; 129: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).

J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is also central to the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent intracellular protein degradation pathway where it represents the proteolytic core of the 26 S complex (11.Glickman M.H.

Although the regulation of human proteasome is not yet entirely elucidated, reports in mice indicate that the expression of proteasome subunits and the relative proteasome activities can be modulated by exogenous stimuli. Specifically, Kensler and co-workers (12.Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Greenlaw J.L. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8786-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) have reported that the genes forming the 26 S proteasome complex are coordinately regulated by nuclear-erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2) in response to antioxidants such as 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione. Nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, featuring a Cap “n” collar structure, responsible for the regulation of the cellular antioxidant response. Nrf2 activates the transcription of multiple phase 2 genes encoding for proteins that protect cells against oxidative and electrophilic stress, such as glutathione S-transferases, γ-glutamylcysteine ligases, heme oxygenese 1, and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase (13.Nguyen T. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) through a common DNA regulatory cis-acting element, called antioxidant response element (ARE) or electrophile responsive element (5′-TGA(C/T)NNNGC-3′) (14.Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway is regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) according to changes in the intracellular redox state. Under non-stimulated conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm, where it is associated with Keap1 (15.Furukawa M. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Keap1 does not just passively sequester Nrf2 in the cytoplasm but plays an active role in targeting Nrf2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (15.Furukawa M. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Depending on the type of stimulus, Nrf2 may became phosphorylated and/or Keap1 is modified, resulting in disruption of the Keap1-Nrf2 complex and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (16.Surh Y.J. Kundu J.K. Na H.K. Planta Med. 2008; 74: 1526-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with a small musculo-aponeurotic fibrosarcoma (Maf) protein and binds to AREs/electrophile responsive elements thereby promoting transcription of various cytoprotective genes (17.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar, 18.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Given these findings, the aim of this study was establishing the proteasome-related function of Nrf2 during replicative senescence of human fibroblasts. We have studied the Nrf2 status in senescent cells and examined the effects of its activation on proteasome function as well as on the process of senescence. 18α-Glycyrrhetinic acid (18α-GA), diethyl maleate (DEM), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Sigma. LLVY-AMC, LLE-NA, LSTR-AMC, MG132, as well as primary proteasomal antibodies against α4 (PW8120; 29 kDa), α6 (PW9390; 33 kDa), β5 (PW8895; 23 kDa), β1 (PW8140; 29 kDa), and β2 (PW8145; 28 kDa) subunits were purchased from BIOMOL. Primary antibodies against Nrf2 (sc-13032; 57 kDa), Keap1 (sc-1544; 68–75 kDa), lamin A/C (sc-20681; 69/62 kDa), p16 (sc467; 16 kDa), tubulin (sc-8035; 52 kDa), GAPDH (sc25778; 37 kDa), and secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HFL-1 human embryonic fibroblasts were obtained by the European Collection of Cell Cultures and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v; Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids (complete medium). HFL-1 cells subcultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity, were fed ∼16 h prior to each assay and the cell number was determined in duplicates using a Coulter Z2 counter (Beckman Coulter). HFL-1 cells were subcultured when they reached confluence at a split ratio of 1:2 until they entered senescence. E8.T4 cells, a subclone of L929 cells (19.Wei P. Ahn Y.I. Housley P.R. Alam J. Vedeckis W.V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Prof. J. Alam (20.Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) and were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 200 mg/ml of geneticin (G418 sulfate). In the presence of 1 mg/ml of doxocycline, a tetracycline analogue, E8.T4 cells express the wild type and functional Nrf2, whereas upon doxocycline removal, cells express the mutated and non-functional form of Nrf2. CT-L, PGPH, and trypsin-like proteasome activities were assayed in crude extracts with the hydrolysis of fluorogenic peptides, LLVY-AMC, LLE-NA, and LSTR-AMC, respectively, at 37 °C for 30 min, as described previously (21.Chondrogianni N. Petropoulos I. Franceschi C. Friguet B. Gonos E.S. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Proteasome activity was determined as the difference between the total activity of crude extracts and the remaining activity in the presence of 20 μm MG132. Fluorescence was measured using a VersaFluorTM fluorescence spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard. Young HFL-1 and E8.T4 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA or DMSO for 2 and 16 h, respectively. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and converted into cDNA with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR were performed in triplicate on an iCycler iQ using Gene Expression MacroTM version 1.1 (Bio-Rad). Primers used for real time PCR are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The GAPDH gene was used as normalizer. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, lysed in reducing Laemmli buffer, and proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE according to standard procedures (22.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for probing with appropriate antibodies. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence were used to detect the bound primary antibodies. Equal protein loading was verified by reprobing each membrane with a GAPDH antibody. The abundance of acidic acid residues found in Nrf2 causes the anomalous migration of Nrf2 in SDS-PAGE (23.Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) and we report the appearance of four bands of ∼100 kDa (named as 1, 2, 3, and 4) along with a band at the predicted molecular mass of 57 kDa (band 5) (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). These bands are Nrf2 specific as they all decrease following silencing of Nrf2 (supplemental Fig. S1A) and they all accumulate following proteasome inhibition by MG132, in accordance with previous studies (15.Furukawa M. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), as revealed by immunoblot analysis (see supplemental Fig. S1B). Each immunoblot analysis was performed at least three times and representative blots are shown. For several blots a higher and a lower exposure are included in the figures and supplemental figures. Immunoblot detection of carbonyl groups into proteins (oxidized proteins) was performed with the “OxyblotTM protein oxidation kit” (Chemicon International) by using an anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. HFL-1 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA or DMSO for 2 h and then lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of aprotinin. Protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) equilibrated in lysis buffer were coupled with 1–2 μg of antibody against α6 subunit or 1–2 μg of normal mouse serum (for controls) at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotor. The same quantity of cell extracts was then added in the pre-coupled antibody against α6 proteasome subunit-protein A or in the pre-coupled normal mouse serum-protein A (for controls). Immunoprecipitation was performed on a rotor at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were collected, washed four times with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP, 75 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (washing buffer) and eluted from the agarose beads by boiling for 5 min in non-reducing Laemmli buffer. Controls were used to demonstrate the specificity of the observed immunoprecipitations. Following proteasome immunoprecipitation, the samples were processed for SDS-PAGE. For proteasome activity assays in immunoprecipitated proteasomes (to demonstrate that whole proteasomes are immunoprecipitated), elution of the complexes by boiling was omitted. Instead, immunoprecipitated protein complexes were diluted in proteasome assay buffer and equal volumes of different samples were assayed as described above. HFL-1 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA or DMSO for 2 h and nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts were prepared according to the nuclear extract kit (Active motif). The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were then subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-Nrf2, anti-tubulin, or anti-lamin A/C antibodies. HFL-1 cells were grown on coverslips and treated with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA or DMSO for 2 h, then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde followed by cell permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were incubated with anti-Nrf2 antibody at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed using a Leica TCS SPE confocal laser scanning microscope (Leika Lasertechik). The LAS AF software was used for image acquisition. HFL-1 cells were co-transfected with pTi-Luc or pTi-ARE-Luc constructs and pCMX-β-galactosidase as internal control using EffecteneTM transfection reagent (Qiagen). pTi-ARE-Luc that contains a sequence of 41 bp ARE and its empty vector (pTi-Luc) were kindly provided by Prof. Fahl (14.Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA or DMSO for 2 h. Cells were harvested and lysed; supernatants were used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays, measured with the appropriate kits (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Means and standard deviations were based on three independent transfections. DEM was used as positive control. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Invitrogen) was used for detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS). HFL-1 cells treated with 18α-GA or DMSO for 2 and 24 h were resuspended in PBS ± the dye at a final concentration of 10 μm (loading buffer) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The loading buffer was then removed; cells were resuspended in prewarmed complete medium and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The absorption and emission of the oxidation product were measured at 493 and 520 nm, respectively. Each sample was measured in triplicates. Five × 104 young HFL-1 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA every day until they entered senescence. Upon 90% confluence, cell number was determined in triplicates using a Coulter Z2 counter and the population doublings were calculated using the formula: log (Nf/N0)/log 2, where Nf is the number of cells measured when each culture reached confluence and N0 represents the number of cells initially seeded. Control cultures were supplemented with 0.1% DMSO, the organic solvent of 18α-GA. A combination of four gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against human Nrf2 was used (Dharmacon SMARTpool siRNA reagent; Dharmacon RNA Technologies). Applied siRNAs were complexed with liposome carrier Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). HFL-1 cells at 60–70% confluence were then transfected with 50 or 75 nm siRNA against Nrf2 (siNrf2) or an equal molar of mismatched scrambled siRNA (siCon) and incubated for 24 h. The medium was then changed and a further incubation in complete medium followed for another 24 h. Treatment with DMSO or 18α-GA was then performed for 2 h. To ensure functional and specific silencing, Nrf2 mRNA levels were revealed in siNrf2 and siCon groups before and after treatment in all experiments. Stable knockdown of the Nrf2 expression was performed by repeating Nrf2 siRNA transfection every 48 h for up to 17 days. Scrambled siRNA were used as control. Staining for β-galactosidase activity was performed as described previously (24.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde for 5 min, washed again with PBS, and finally stained at 37 °C for 24 h in the absence of CO2, in staining solution (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 40 mm citric acid, and 12 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0) containing 1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Cell survival was monitored by counting the number of cells following treatment with the mentioned cytotoxic reagent. Briefly, 4 × 106 HFL-1 cells were plated in Petri dishes and treated with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA or DMSO for 24 h, followed by incubation with 300 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for an additional 20 h with or without 20 μm MG132 (cells were treated for 6 h prior to H2O2 treatment). Cell number was determined in triplicates using a Coulter Z2 counter. Statistics were performed using Microsoft Excel software. Statistical significance was evaluated using the one-way analysis of variance. Quantification was performed with Image Quant 5.2. All values including quantification data were reported as mean of three independent experiments ± S.D. and statistical significance at p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 are denoted in graphs by a single (*) or double (**) asterisk, respectively. Quantification of the Nrf2 immunoblots in the figures was performed including all specific Nrf2 bands together (1.Petropoulou C. Chondrogianni N. Simões D. Agiostratidou G. Drosopoulos N. Kotsota V.

Biogerontology. 2004; 5: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Additionally, quantification of each specific band is shown separately in supplemental Fig. S1D. Initially, we aimed to reveal potential changes of the Nrf2 transcription factor status during replicative senescence. As shown in Fig. 1 both RNA (A) and protein (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1C for lower exposure) Nrf2 expression levels were found decreased by ∼45 and ∼65%, respectively, in HFL-1 senescent fibroblasts as compared with their young counterparts. In support, the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 was equally decreased because we detected lower RNA expression levels of its main gene target, namely NADPH quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) (Fig. 1C). To assess the effects of Nrf2 on cell proliferation, the expression of Nrf2 was knocked down using siRNA in HFL-1 cells. Our pilot experiments revealed a maximum ∼85% decrease of Nrf2 mRNA levels using 75 nm siNrf2 for 48 h (supplemental Fig. S2). Knockdown of Nrf2 resulted in inhibition of proliferation and induction of premature senescence in HFL-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1D). The cells acquired the typical senescent morphology (Fig. 1E, panel i), exhibited a higher percentage of β-galactosidase positive staining (Fig. 1E, panel ii) and revealed increased levels of p16 protein (Fig. 1F), as compared with the HFL-1 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. As it is known that many compounds are capable of activating Nrf2 (25.Eggler A.L. Gay K.A. Mesecar A.D. Mol. Nutr. Food. Res. 2008; 52: S84-S94PubMed Google Scholar), our screening analysis using a library of different compounds has identified two triterpenoids, namely 18α-GA and hederagenin (HED) as potential Nrf2 inducers. Extensive follow up analysis has revealed a dose- and time-dependent 18α-GA-mediated activation of Nrf2. Specifically, treatment of HFL-1 young cells with 2 μg/ml of 18α-GA for 2 h (optimal conditions, see next paragraph) induced both the RNA (Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B, top panel) expression levels of Nrf2. In support, we have observed reduced levels of Keap1 as well as increased levels of its modified isoform (a protein greater than 150 kDa). Moreover, cell fractionation experiments (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1D, iii for lower exposure) as well as immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 2D) under the same conditions revealed that treatment with 18α-GA promoted Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, a feature that concurs with its activation. Specifically, more than 80% of the cells treated with 18α-GA showed Nrf2 nuclear accumulation as compared with the control cells (Fig. 2D, panel ii). Finally, to demonstrate the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE elements upon 18α-GA treatment, a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 41-bp murine ARE (pTi-ARE-Luc) and its relative empty vector (pTi-Luc) were used. As shown in Fig. 2E, 18α-GA treatment induced ARE-promoter activity, thus resulting in increased luciferase activity levels. DEM, a thiol-oxidizing agent and a known activator of the Nrf2 pathway (26.Kobayashi M. Li L. Iwamoto N. Nakajima-Takagi Y. Kaneko H. Nakayama Y. Eguchi M. Wada Y. Kumagai Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. In total, our results demonstrate that 18α-GA treatment promotes Nrf2 activation. As Nrf2 has been related to proteasome regulation, next, we investigated the effects of 18α-GA on proteasome status. HFL-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of 18α-GA ranging from 0.5 to 10 μg/ml for 24 h and the CT-L proteasome activity was measured (supplemental Fig. S3A, i). The effective concentration was revealed at 2 μg/ml. Extensive time curve analysis was then conducted for all three proteasome activities (CT-L, PGPH, and trypsin-like) to conclude that the effective time treatment was at 2 h (supplemental Fig. S3B, i and Fig. 3A). More specifically, the activities were increased from 1.5- to 1.8-fold, with PGPH activity being the most affected. Moreover, we have also detected enhanced RNA (Fig. 3B) and protein (Fig. 3C) expression levels of representative proteasome subunits in the same cells and experimental conditions. Importantly, proteasome immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblot analysis (Figs. 3D, panel I, and supplemental Fig. S1E for lower exposure of the β2 immunoblot in total cell lysates) and proteasome activity assay (Fig. 3D, panel ii) has verified an approximate ∼2-fold increase of the amount of assembled proteasome following treatment with 18α-GA, thus further verifying the activation of the proteasome by this substance. Finally to exclude the possibility of a single compound effect, we assayed the HED effects on proteasome status. As it is shown in supplemental Fig. S3, A, ii, and B, ii, HED treatment of HFL-1 cells results in a dose- and time-dependent activation of the proteasome that is similar to 18α-GA. We then examined whether the observed 18α-GA-associated proteasome activation was mediated by Nrf2. To this end, we knocked down Nrf2 in HFL-1 human fibroblasts and the cells were then treated with 18α-GA. As shown in Fig. 4A, silencing Nrf2 inhibited the 18α-GA-mediated activation of the proteasome. We have also taken advantage of the E8.T4 cell line that conditionally expresses the functional Nrf2 (20.Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Specifically, in the presence of the mutated Nrf2, treatment with 18α-GA did not induce CT-L proteasome activity, whereas the same activity was increased upon 18α-GA treatment in the presence of a functional Nrf2 (Fig. 4B). This was also reflected in the RNA expression levels of representative proteasome subunits, because the levels of β5, β1, α3, and α6 were not affected following 18α-GA treatment in the presence of mutated Nrf2, in contrast to their induction in the presence of functional Nrf2 (Fig. 4C). Control experiments have shown a severe induction of an Nrf2 target gene, namely heme oxygenase-1, by 18α-GA only in the Nrf2 functional cell line (Fig. 4D). DEM was used as positive control. These data demonstrate that 18α-GA-mediated proteasome activation is directly linked to the function of Nrf2. We also examined the effects of HED on Nrf2 activation and proteasome status. Specifically, as shown in supplemental Fig. S4, treatment with 2 μg/ml HED for 2 h induced the protein expression levels of representative proteasome subunits and increased the amount of assembled proteasome. Finally, cell fractionation experiments revealed a HED-promoted translocation of Nrf2 in the nucleus. Thus both triterpenoids 18α-GA and HED, act similarly on proteasome and Nrf2 status. Next we tested the effect"

One large family of insect neuropeptides are the adipokinetic hormones (AKHs), which mobilize lipids and carbohydrates from the insect fat body. Other peptides are the corazonins that are structurally related to the AKHs but represent a different neuropeptide signaling system. We have previously cloned an orphan GPCR from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae that was structurally intermediate between the A. gambiae AKH and corazonin GPCRs. Using functional expression of the receptor in cells in cell culture, we have now identified the ligand for this orphan receptor as being pQVTFSRDWNAamide, a neuropeptide that is structurally intermediate between AKH and corazonin and that we therefore named ACP (AKH/corazonin-related peptide). ACP does not activate the A. gambiae AKH and corazonin receptors and, vice versa, AKH and corazonin do not activate the ACP receptor, showing that the ACP/receptor couple is an independent and so far unknown peptidergic signaling system. Because ACP is structurally intermediate between AKH and corazonin and the ACP receptor between the AKH and corazonin receptors, this is a prominent example of receptor/ligand co-evolution, probably originating from receptor and ligand gene duplications followed by mutations and evolutionary selection, thereby yielding three independent hormonal systems. The ACP signaling system occurs in the mosquitoes A. gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and Culex pipiens (Diptera), the silkworm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera), and the bug Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera). However, the ACP system is not present in 12 Drosophila species (Diptera), the honeybee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera), the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera), the body louse Pediculus humanus (Phthiraptera), and the crustacean Daphnia pulex, indicating that it has been lost several times during arthropod evolution. In particular, this frequent loss of hormonal systems is unique for arthropods compared with vertebrates.

Hoffmann K.H. Spring J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 963-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). During high physical activities such as flight and intense locomotion, AKH is released into the circulation and transported to the fat body, where it binds to its G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (2.Staubli F. Jorgensen T.J. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Lenz C. Sondergaard L. Roepstorff P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3446-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Activation of these GPCRs stimulates the release of carbohydrates (trehalose) and lipids, which are needed to fuel the high physical activity of the insect (1.Gäde G. Hoffmann K.H. Spring J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 963-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). AKHs and their GPCRs, however, are also involved in hemolymph carbohydrate homeostasis by releasing trehalose under nonstress conditions, a process that in Drosophila larvae is counteracted by insulin-like peptides and the insulin receptor, which decrease hemolymph trehalose concentrations. Thus, AKH and insulin in insects act comparably to glucagon and insulin in mammals during blood sugar homeostasis (3.Kim S.K. Rulifson E.J. Nature. 2004; 431: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). adipokinetic hormone Aedes aegypti AKH/corazonin-related peptide ACP receptor AKH receptor Anopheles gambiae Apis mellifera Bombyx mori crustacean cardioactive peptide CCAP receptor Chinese hamster ovary Culex pipiens corazonin receptor Drosophila melanogaster enhanced green fluorescent protein G protein-coupled receptor Nasonia vitripennis quantitative PCR Tribolium castaneum phosphate-buffered saline rapid amplification of cDNA ends Anopheles gambiae Bombyx mori Ostrinia nubilalis Rhodnius prolixus. The AKHs are a large family of small, structurally related peptides, all being 8–10 amino acid residues long (1.Gäde G. Hoffmann K.H. Spring J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 963-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The structure of the AKH peptide produced by the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae (4.Riehle M.A. Garczynski S.F. Crim J.W. Hill C.A. Brown M.R. Science. 2002; 298: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1. AKHs occur in all insects investigated so far, with some insects producing more than one AKH (1.Gäde G. Hoffmann K.H. Spring J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 963-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 5.Li B. Predel R. Neupert S. Hauser F. Tanaka Y. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Arakane Y. Verleyen P. Schoofs L. Schachtner J. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Park Y. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). AKH peptides also occur in crustaceans, where they are named red pigment-concentrating hormone, because of their function in color adaptation (1.Gäde G. Hoffmann K.H. Spring J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 963-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The insect corazonins are widespread in insects and are undecapeptides that are structurally related to the AKHs, which is illustrated for the A. gambiae corazonin in Fig. 1. The insect corazonin receptors have recently been identified (6.Cazzamali G. Saxild N. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7.Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). They do not cross-react with AKHs and the AKH receptors do not cross-react with corazonins, showing that these are two independent hormonal systems (2.Staubli F. Jorgensen T.J. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Lenz C. Sondergaard L. Roepstorff P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3446-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6.Cazzamali G. Saxild N. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic tree analyses show that not only the AKH and corazonin neuropeptides but also the AKH and corazonin receptors are closely related, suggesting co-evolution of receptors and ligands in a process, where the ancestor receptor and neuropeptide genes have duplicated. This is followed by mutations and evolutionary selection, leading to two independent hormonal systems each with its own physiological role (Fig. 2) (6.Cazzamali G. Saxild N. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7.Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 29: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of corazonin in insects are, so far, not well understood. The peptide increases heartbeat in cockroaches (10.Veenstra J.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and induces color change (darkening) associated with starvation, swarming, and migration in crowded locust populations (11.Tawfik A.I. Tanaka S. De Loof A. Schoofs L. Baggerman G. Waelkens E. Derua R. Milner Y. Yerushalmi Y. Pener M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7083-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and in some insects, it is involved in the control of motor behavior associated with molting (12.Zitnan D. Kim Y.J. Zitnanová I. Roller L. Adams M.E. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2007; 153: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These findings could perhaps mean that corazonin is also involved in the management of stress situations, suggesting that AKHs and corazonins have specialized in the control of different aspects of stress or high physical activities, which would fit well with the receptor/ligand co-evolution hypothesis mentioned above. In an attempt to understand the function and evolution of AKH and corazonin receptors, we have annotated these and related GPCRs in insects with a sequenced genome (8.Hauser F. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Blenau W. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 80: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 9.Hauser F. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Park Y. Li B. Tanaka Y. Predel R. Neupert S. Schachtner J. Verleyen P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 29: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and subsequently cloned and characterized many of them. In this process, we have also cloned an AKH and a corazonin receptor from the malaria mosquito A. gambiae and characterized them as receptors specifically activated by A. gambiae AKH and corazonin, respectively (13.Belmont M. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition to these two receptors, however, a third A. gambiae receptor was annotated and cloned that was closely related to the AKH and corazonin receptors but could not be activated by AKH, corazonin, or any other peptide from our peptide library (13.Belmont M. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this paper, we identify the ligand for this orphan receptor as a peptide that is structurally intermediate between AKH and corazonin, and which we name AKH/corazonin-related peptide (ACP; see Fig. 1). Because the ACP receptor is also structurally intermediate between the AKH and corazonin receptors, this finding is a prominent example of receptor/ligand co-evolution (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we show that the novel ACP/receptor couple is widely occurring in insects, suggesting that it is an important insect signaling system.

Nasonia vitripennis was a kind gift from Prof. Jack Werren (University of Rochester). All insects have been cultured in our laboratory, using standardized conditions. For PCR, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was synthesized and amplified using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) or, for 5′RACE, the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). The cloning of the A. gambiae ACP receptor (Ag-ACPR-A) has been published previously (13.Belmont M. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The coding sequence of A. gambiae ACPR-B was amplified using the sense primer 5′-CCGCTAGCGCCGCCATGTACCTGGCAGCCGGCTTA-3′ (the underlined nucleotides correspond to nucleotide positions 1–21 of supplemental Fig. S1) and the antisense primer 5′-CCGCTAGCCTAAATGAGATGTTTTTCAAGATACTC-3′ (the underlined nucleotides correspond to nucleotide positions 1399–1425 of supplemental Fig. S1). The coding sequence of the T. castaneum ACP preprohormone was amplified using the sense primer 5′-GCTATATAAAGTTGCTAGTCCGCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TTATCGTCGGCCACTGAAAAT-3′.

All PCR products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The PCR product of the receptor coding sequence was subcloned into the pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (Clontech) using the Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science) and sequenced. qPCR was carried out on an MX3000 machine (Stratagene) using a Brilliant® SYBR® Green qPCR Master Mix from Stratagene. qPCR for the T. castaneum ACP preprohormone and T. castaneum ACP receptor was performed using the primers mentioned in supplemental Table S1. T. castaneum genes, coding for actin, rps3, rpl32, elf1, and tubulin, were used as reference genes (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences and accession numbers). All primer pairs have been tested for dimerization, efficiency (90–110%), and amplification of only one product. The most stable reference genes and gene normalization expression factors were determined by the software program geNORM (14.Vandesompele J. De Preter K. Pattyn F. Poppe B. Van Roy N. De Paepe A.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the human G-protein G16 (CHO/G16) were grown as described previously (15.Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G.

Double-stranded RNAs were synthesized using the T7 MegaScript kit (Ambion); genes for TrcACPR (1374 bp) and EGFP (358 bp), both flanked by T7 sites, were used as templates. To purify the double-stranded RNA, ethanol precipitation was carried out after DNase treatment, and the pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of H2O. Concentration of the double-stranded RNA in this sample was determined using Nanodrop. Approximately 2-day-old female pupae were injected with 1 μg/μl double strand RNA (ACPR or EGFP) and subsequently transferred to flour, including 5% yeast, and kept at 32 °C until hatching. 14 days after injection, three groups of 15 or 25 injected virgin female adult beetles were mated with 15 wild type males. Eggs were counted after 3 days. 14 and 21 days after injection, RNA was isolated from three ACPR- or EGFP-injected beetles, and the level of ACPR mRNA was determined by qPCR using 5′-CACCGCCAGGAATTACAGAT-3′ as sense primer and 5′-GCGACCTGGGTTCAAAACTA-3′ as antisense primer. Brains and ganglia of first instar Tribolium larvae were dissected in a drop of cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4) using a transgenic line, where the central nervous system is labeled with fluorescent color 4M. Averof and G. Bucher, unpublished data. and fixed subsequently in 4% formaldehyde (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in 0.1 m PBS for 1–2 h on ice. The brains were then rinsed three times for 10 min at room temperature in 0.1 m PBS followed by preincubation overnight at 4 °C in 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 0.1 m PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST). Brains were then incubated in a solution containing the polyclonal ACP (1:10,000) and the monoclonal synapsin antibody (1:200) in PBST containing 5% normal goat serum for 1 day at 4 °C. The monoclonal synapsin antibody was used to selectively label neuropilar areas in the brain (kindly provided by Dr. E. Buchner, Würzburg, Germany). The polyclonal ACP rabbit antibody was obtained commercially from GeneMed Synthesis. The brains were rinsed three times for 10 min with PBST before they were incubated with a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Cy3 and a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy5 (both 1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBST and 5% normal goat serum for 1 day at 4 °C. Afterward, the brains were rinsed with PBS three times for 10 min and subsequently mounted in 80% glycerol, 20% PBS. The whole mount preparations were scanned at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution with a ×63 glycerol objective (Leica, Germany) using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope. Controls included preimmune antiserum (1:10,000) and ACP antiserum (1:10,000) preabsorbed with ACP (10−7 m), both of which did not give any staining. DNA sequence comparisons were done using Vector NTI (Invitrogen). Protein sequence alignments were carried out using ClustalW. The phylogenetic tree of Fig. 8 was generated by the Megalign program of the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR). The receptor proteins were aligned by the ClustalW method using the PAM series protein weight matrix and default multiple sequence alignment parameters. We searched the nucleotide collection (nr/nt) and the non-human and non-mouse ESTs data bases at NCBI using the TBLASTN program (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). For the phylogenetic trees shown in supplemental Fig. S5, alignments were performed using ClustalW with the Blosum scoring matrix. Bootstrapping was performed using Phylip protdist to generate 100 replicates. The tree diagrams were drawn using Phylodendron. For the construction of the above-mentioned trees, we used the seven-transmembrane regions of cloned or annotated receptors with the following GenBankTM accession numbers: Nv- AKHR (XP_001599670); Tc-AKHR (DQ422965); Am-AKHR (AAX83121); Aa-AKHR (EAT36594); Ag-AKHR (AY298745); Bm-AKHR (AF403542); Dm-AKHR (AF077299); Aa-ACPR (EAT38429); Cp-ACPR (EDS28711); Ag-ACPR (AY553322 and EU138885, two splice variants); Tc-ACPR (EU138886); Nv-ACPR (XP_001605342); Bm-ACPR-1 (EU138887); Bm-ACPR-2 (BAG68428); Cp-CRZR (EDS44142 and EDS44143, we manually joined the split gene); Ag-CRZR (AY301275); Dm-CRZR (AF373862); Bm-CRZR (BAG68420); Am-CRZR (XP_392570); Bm-CCAPR-1 (BAG68429); Bm-CCAPR-2 (BAG68425); Tc-CCAPR-2 (ABN79652); Am-CCAPR (XP_001122652); Nv-CCAPR (XP_001602277); Ag-CCAPR-2 (XP_321101); Aa-CCAPR (EAT39546); Ag-CCAPR-1 (AAS77205); Cp-CCAPR (EDS26677); Dm-CCAPR (AY219842); Tc-CCAPR (ABN79651); Tc-inotocin receptor (ABX00684); Nv-inotocin receptor (XP_001600203); and Dm-FMRFamide receptor (AAL83921). For the other receptors in Fig. 8 or supplemental Fig. S5, there are no GenBankTM accession numbers available. Prediction of transmembrane helices of the receptor protein was done using the TMHMM server. The signal peptide was predicted by the SignalP server. EC50 values were calculated using Prism software. We have previously cloned the A. gambiae AKH and corazonin receptors and a third, closely related receptor that, however, remained an orphan (13.Belmont M. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F.

To find a candidate ligand for this orphan receptor, we screened the genomic data base from A. gambiae (18.Holt R.A. Subramanian G.M. Halpern A. Sutton G.G. Charlab R. Nusskern D.R. Wincker P.

This search yielded an A. gambiae gene (see also GenBankTM accession number XP_563757), coding for a preprohormone (Fig. 3) that could give rise to a peptide that was related to both AKH and corazonin (Fig. 1) and that we named ACP (AKH/corazonin-related peptide). TBLASTN searches of other sequenced insect genomes showed that similar ACP preprohormone genes did occur in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and in the West Nile virus transmitting mosquito Culex pipiens (Fig. 3).

IntroductionThe capacitation process is the major prerequisite for mammalian sperm to fertilize. This highly complex phenomenon occurs in the female reproductive tract, and renders the spermatozoa capable of binding and fusing with the oocyte (1.Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. Mammalian Fertilization. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). The commonly accepted end point of capacitation is the time when sperm have obtained the ability to fertilize an egg. However, different physiological modifications of sperm have been correlated with the capacitated state. These include: cholesterol loss from the sperm plasma membrane, increased membrane fluidity, changes in intracellular ion concentrations (2.Salicioni A.M. Platt M.D. Wertheimer E.V. Arcelay E. Allaire A. Sosnik J. Visconti P.E. Soc. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 2007; 65: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar), hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane (3.Hernández-González E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. López-González I. Demarco I. Wertheimer E. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol.

Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 52: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Among ion fluxes that occur during capacitation, the transport of HCO3− into sperm promotes cAMP synthesis by the activation of an atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (SACY) 2The abbreviations used are: SACYsoluble adenylyl cyclaseSFKfamily of protein tyrosine kinasePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2ABt2cAMPdibutyryl cyclic AMPCASACEROS computer-assisted semen analysisPKAprotein kinase ABSAbovine serum albuminIBMXisobutylmethylxanthinePVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridepYanti-phosphotyrosinePKIheat stable protein kinase A inhibitor.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15922-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and subsequent PKA activation. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues is known to be a key regulator of tyrosine phosphorylation events linked to the process of capacitation. In mouse sperm exposed to HCO3−, cAMP rises to a maximum in <60 s, followed immediately by an increase in PKA-dependent phosphorylation (2.Salicioni A.M. Platt M.D. Wertheimer E.V. Arcelay E. Allaire A. Sosnik J. Visconti P.E. Soc. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 2007; 65: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation is only observed after incubations for at least 30 min in conditions conducive to capacitation (6.Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the lack of temporal correlation of PKA-induced phosphorylation and the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, it has been shown that PKA inhibition blocks the onset of tyrosine phosphorylation (7.Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The one or more tyrosine kinases responsible for the capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation have remained enigmatic. Recent proposals, however, have put forward the hypothesis that the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) mediates the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse and human sperm (8.Lawson C. Goupil S. Leclerc P. Biol. Reprod. 2008; 79: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9.Mitchell L.A. Nixon B. Baker M.A. Aitken R.J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2008; 14: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10.Varano G. Lombardi A. Cantini G. Forti G. Baldi E. Luconi M. Hum. Reprod. 2008; 23: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The action of SFKs on mammalian cells has been extensively studied and demonstrated to be broadly pleiotropic, including effects on cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, cell morphology, and survival (11.Pawson T. Warner N. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1268-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that c-Src (the prototypic member of the SFKs) is activated through dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 (or the corresponding tyrosine in other members of the SFKs) (12.Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The currently accepted model proposes that c-Src tyrosine kinase (Csk) phosphorylates Tyr-527 allowing its intramolecular interaction with SH2 that keeps the protein in an inactive closed state. However, in its open state, Tyr-416 in the c-Src activation loop (or the corresponding tyrosine in other SFKs) can undergo autophosphorylation inducing kinase activity (13.Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).It has been shown that c-Src is present in mouse sperm and that SU6656, a c-Src kinase family inhibitor is able to block the capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the change in motility pattern, known as hyperactivation (14.Baker M.A. Hetherington L. Aitken R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3182-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This inhibitor is competitive with respect to ATP and is capable of affecting all SFKs, suggesting a role for these kinases in the capacitation process. In addition, more recent studies have shown that SFK inhibitors abrogate human and bovine sperm acrosome reactions (10.Varano G. Lombardi A. Cantini G. Forti G. Baldi E. Luconi M. Hum. Reprod. 2008; 23: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15.Etkovitz N. Tirosh Y. Chazan R. Jaldety Y. Daniel L. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Dev. Biol. 2009; 334: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present work we have further characterized the involvement of SFKs in mouse sperm capacitation. Due to the importance of PKA in this process, we focused on the effect of SFK inhibitors on this kinase. Interestingly, our results indicate that, in addition to their abrogation of tyrosine phosphorylation, SFK inhibitors block PKA phosphorylation, sperm motility, and in vitro fertilization. Although these data suggest unspecific PKA inactivation by SFK inhibitors, in vitro activity assays show that this is not the case. Here, we provide evidence that Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors overcome the block by SFK inhibitors to all capacitation parameters, including in vitro fertilization. In addition, sperm from Src-null mice contained similar levels of capacitation-associated tyrosine phosphorylation as wild-type sperm. Taken together, these data have indicated that Src is not directly involved in the observed capacitation-associated changes in tyrosine phosphorylation, and further have strongly suggested that Ser/Thr protein phosphatase inactivation is necessary for sperm capacitation.DISCUSSIONIncreased tyrosine phosphorylation has been associated with the acquisition of sperm-fertilizing capacity in different species (6.Visconti P.E.

In mammalian sperm, capacitation is a HCO3−-dependent process (39.Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A likely target for HCO3− is the regulation of cAMP metabolism through stimulation of a soluble adenylyl cyclase (SACY). Once activated, intracellular cAMP levels increase, promoting the activation of PKA through the release of its inhibitory subunits. As previously shown, inhibition of sperm PKA activity blocks the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation associated with capacitation. Recently, c-Src has been postulated to be the tyrosine kinase directly responsible for this increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, it has been proposed that c-Src is activated by a cAMP-mediated pathway via the inhibition of Csk, the tyrosine kinase responsible for the inactivation of c-Src in other cell types (14.Baker M.A. Hetherington L. Aitken R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3182-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model and with previous published results from different laboratories (8.Lawson C. Goupil S. Leclerc P. Biol. Reprod. 2008; 79: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10.Varano G. Lombardi A. Cantini G. Forti G. Baldi E. Luconi M. Hum.

Biol. 2009; 333: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), SU6656, an SFK inhibitor, blocked tyrosine phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, immunoprecipitated c-Src from capacitated sperm showed significantly higher activity than c-Src from non-capacitated sperm, suggesting that this kinase is activated during capacitation.The initial aim of the present work was to further investigate the role of c-Src tyrosine kinase in mouse sperm capacitation. For this purpose, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed in sperm from mice in which c-Src had been eliminated by homologous recombination (16.Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Src-null mice have an osteopetrotic phenotype, are toothless, and normally succumb to various lesions (such as benign nasal polyps) by 15 weeks of age. Therefore, their reproductive phenotype has been difficult to analyze in detail. When the capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed in the Src-null sperm, no differences were found when compared with sperm from their wild-type littermates. These findings suggested that c-Src is not the enzyme that directly phosphorylates tyrosine residues as part of sperm capacitation, or, alternatively, that lack of c-Src can be compensated by other members of the SFKs.As mentioned, activation of tyrosine phosphorylation is downstream of a cAMP/PKA pathway. Analysis of PKA phosphorylation using anti-PKA substrate antibodies revealed that this phosphorylation was unaffected in cSrc KO sperm. However, PKA phosphorylation was blocked in the presence of SFK inhibitors suggesting that SU6656 and SKI606 may not be specific at the concentrations used. This possibility was ruled out by directly measuring PKA activity in vitro. At concentrations as high as 100 μm, the SFK inhibitors did not block PKA activity in vitro. Because SU6656 as well as SKI606 are competitive inhibitors of the SFK ATP binding site, the conclusion from these experiments is that the effect of these inhibitors on sperm is not due to unspecific inhibition of PKA activity. Another possibility was that SFK inhibitors could be blocking the capacitation pathway upstream of PKA activation. This possibility was also ruled out, because addition of cAMP agonists did not restore phosphorylation of PKA substrates or the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of SFK inhibitors.In light of these data, we propose an alternative hypothesis in which SFK inhibitors act in a pathway parallel to PKA activation. The steady-state phosphorylation status of a protein is influenced by relative activities of both kinases and phosphatases acting on it. It has been shown that SFK members are able to phosphorylate the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A catalytic subunit in its C-terminal domain. This phosphorylation event results in the inactivation of PP2A (31.Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 32.Chen J. Parsons S.

For example, rat cerebral ischemia has been associated with the SFK-induced down-regulation of PP2A activity through Tyr-307 phosphorylation (44.Hu X. Wu X. Xu J. Zhou J. Han X. Guo J. BMC. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taking this into consideration, the effect of the SFK inhibitors on PKA and tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm could be explained by the hypothesis that Ser/Thr phosphatases are released from inhibition by tyrosine kinase inhibition. Interestingly, both okadaic acid and calyculin-A, two potent inhibitors of Ser/Thr phosphatases, completely rescued the effect of the SFK inhibitors on PKA and tyrosine phosphorylation. However, neither PKA nor tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by okadaic acid when mouse sperm were incubated under non-capacitating conditions. This last set of experiments suggests that two parallel pathways need to be active to promote the capacitation-associated phosphorylation of PKA substrates and the consequent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. One of the pathways is the well established HCO3−-dependent activation of cAMP synthesis by SACY; the second pathway depends on the inactivation of Ser/Thr phosphatases (Fig. 7). Consistent with this model, okadaic acid was unable to increase phosphorylation by PKA or tyrosine phosphorylation when sperm were incubated with the PKA inhibitor H-89.To further investigate the role of phosphatase inactivation in capacitation, the effect of SFK inhibitors and the reversal of their action with okadaic acid was tested in motility and in vitro fertilization assays. As expected, because of their action on phosphorylation of PKA substrates, SFK inhibitors significantly blocked motility and fertilization. The SU6656 inhibition was overcome with the addition of 10 nm okadaic acid indicating that phosphatase inactivation plays an essential role in the regulation of these processes. It has been shown that inhibition of phosphatase activity promotes initiation of caput sperm motility (45.Smith G.D. Wolf D.P. Trautman K.C. da Cruz e Silva EF Greengard P. Vijayaraghavan S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 46.Vijayaraghavan S. Stephens D.T. Trautman K. Smith G.D. Khatra B. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Greengard P. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), further supporting a role of phosphatases in the regulation of motility. The very low concentrations of okadaic acid (IC50: ∼1 nm) capable of rescuing the effect of SFK inhibitors points toward the participation of the phosphatase PP2A in this pathway, which is ∼100-fold more sensitive to okadaic acid than PP1 (43.Mao L.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the two main Ser/Thr phosphatases present in the sperm are PP1γ2, a testis-specific splice variant of Ppp1cc (51.Vijayaraghavan S. Chakrabarti R. Myers K. Soc. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 2007; 63: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar), and PP2A, also present in other cell types. In bull sperm, the phosphorylation state of residue Thr-320 in PP1γ2 has been shown to be modulated during epididymal maturation, and involved in phosphatase activity regulation (52.Huang Z. Vijayaraghavan S. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This residue also appears to be phosphorylated in mouse sperm (53.Goto N. Harayama H. J. Reprod. Dev. 2009; 55: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Phosphatases PP1γ2 and PP2A neither co-localize (53.Goto N. Harayama H. J. Reprod. Dev. 2009; 55: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) nor co-elute in chromatographically purified sperm protein fractions (54.Cheng L. Pilder S. Nairn A.C. Ramdas S. Vijayaraghavan S. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of distinct phosphatase pools with presumably different roles. The possibility that PP2A is inactivated during capacitation warrants more investigation. In addition, PP2A has been shown to be capable of hydrolyzing phosphotyrosine residues (55.Chernoff J. Li H.C. Cheng Y.S. Chen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7852-7857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). This finding might also be relevant to signaling pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm.In summary, the present study presents evidence that c-Src is not directly involved in the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation that occurs during sperm capacitation in the mouse. This conclusion is based on results using sperm from Src-null mice, as well as on the finding that Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors completely overcome the effect of SFK inhibitors used at concentrations in which no residual SFK activity should be observed. This last observation also suggests that at least one of the two sperm Ser/Thr phosphatases, presumably PP2A, must be inactive in capacitating sperm to allow pivotal phosphorylation events to occur. Thus, in sperm, c-Src could participate in this inactivation. In this case, PKA activity and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation observed in sperm from Src-null mice could be explained by compensatory activity of another SFK member. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that SU6656 and SKI606 at the concentrations employed inhibited another tyrosine kinase different from c-Src. This alternative hypothesis is consistent with the high concentration of SU6656 and with the sharp inhibition observed with SKI606 at 50 μm on the capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. These concentrations are at least one order of magnitude higher than the 0.3 μm IC50 expected for c-Src in vitro. If this is the case, we predict that this alternative kinase would act upstream of Ser/Thr phosphatases and would be involved in their inactivation. IntroductionThe capacitation process is the major prerequisite for mammalian sperm to fertilize. This highly complex phenomenon occurs in the female reproductive tract, and renders the spermatozoa capable of binding and fusing with the oocyte (1.Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. Mammalian Fertilization. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). The commonly accepted end point of capacitation is the time when sperm have obtained the ability to fertilize an egg. However, different physiological modifications of sperm have been correlated with the capacitated state. These include: cholesterol loss from the sperm plasma membrane, increased membrane fluidity, changes in intracellular ion concentrations (2.Salicioni A.M. Platt M.D. Wertheimer E.V. Arcelay E. Allaire A. Sosnik J. Visconti P.E. Soc. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 2007; 65: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar), hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane (3.Hernández-González E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. López-González I. Demarco I. Wertheimer E. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol.

Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 52: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Among ion fluxes that occur during capacitation, the transport of HCO3− into sperm promotes cAMP synthesis by the activation of an atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (SACY) 2The abbreviations used are: SACYsoluble adenylyl cyclaseSFKfamily of protein tyrosine kinasePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2ABt2cAMPdibutyryl cyclic AMPCASACEROS computer-assisted semen analysisPKAprotein kinase ABSAbovine serum albuminIBMXisobutylmethylxanthinePVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridepYanti-phosphotyrosinePKIheat stable protein kinase A inhibitor.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15922-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and subsequent PKA activation. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues is known to be a key regulator of tyrosine phosphorylation events linked to the process of capacitation. In mouse sperm exposed to HCO3−, cAMP rises to a maximum in <60 s, followed immediately by an increase in PKA-dependent phosphorylation (2.Salicioni A.M. Platt M.D. Wertheimer E.V. Arcelay E. Allaire A. Sosnik J. Visconti P.E. Soc. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 2007; 65: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation is only observed after incubations for at least 30 min in conditions conducive to capacitation (6.Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the lack of temporal correlation of PKA-induced phosphorylation and the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, it has been shown that PKA inhibition blocks the onset of tyrosine phosphorylation (7.Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The one or more tyrosine kinases responsible for the capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation have remained enigmatic. Recent proposals, however, have put forward the hypothesis that the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) mediates the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse and human sperm (8.Lawson C. Goupil S. Leclerc P. Biol. Reprod. 2008; 79: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9.Mitchell L.A. Nixon B. Baker M.A. Aitken R.J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2008; 14: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10.Varano G. Lombardi A. Cantini G. Forti G. Baldi E. Luconi M. Hum. Reprod. 2008; 23: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The action of SFKs on mammalian cells has been extensively studied and demonstrated to be broadly pleiotropic, including effects on cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, cell morphology, and survival (11.Pawson T. Warner N. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1268-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that c-Src (the prototypic member of the SFKs) is activated through dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 (or the corresponding tyrosine in other members of the SFKs) (12.Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The currently accepted model proposes that c-Src tyrosine kinase (Csk) phosphorylates Tyr-527 allowing its intramolecular interaction with SH2 that keeps the protein in an inactive closed state. However, in its open state, Tyr-416 in the c-Src activation loop (or the corresponding tyrosine in other SFKs) can undergo autophosphorylation inducing kinase activity (13.Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).It has been shown that c-Src is present in mouse sperm and that SU6656, a c-Src kinase family inhibitor is able to block the capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the change in motility pattern, known as hyperactivation (14.Baker M.A. Hetherington L. Aitken R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3182-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This inhibitor is competitive with respect to ATP and is capable of affecting all SFKs, suggesting a role for these kinases in the capacitation process. In addition, more recent studies have shown that SFK inhibitors abrogate human and bovine sperm acrosome reactions (10.Varano G. Lombardi A. Cantini G. Forti G. Baldi E. Luconi M. Hum. Reprod. 2008; 23: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15.Etkovitz N. Tirosh Y. Chazan R. Jaldety Y. Daniel L. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Dev. Biol. 2009; 334: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present work we have further characterized the involvement of SFKs in mouse sperm capacitation. Due to the importance of PKA in this process, we focused on the effect of SFK inhibitors on this kinase. Interestingly, our results indicate that, in addition to their abrogation of tyrosine phosphorylation, SFK inhibitors block PKA phosphorylation, sperm motility, and in vitro fertilization. Although these data suggest unspecific PKA inactivation by SFK inhibitors, in vitro activity assays show that this is not the case. Here, we provide evidence that Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors overcome the block by SFK inhibitors to all capacitation parameters, including in vitro fertilization. In addition, sperm from Src-null mice contained similar levels of capacitation-associated tyrosine phosphorylation as wild-type sperm. Taken together, these data have indicated that Src is not directly involved in the observed capacitation-associated changes in tyrosine phos"
https://openalex.org/W1967045339,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a highly modified integrin-binding protein present in most tissues and body fluids where it has been implicated in numerous biological processes. A significant regulation of OPN function is mediated through phosphorylation and proteolytic processing. Proteolytic cleavage by thrombin and matrix metalloproteinases close to the integrin-binding Arg-Gly-Asp sequence modulates the function of OPN and its integrin binding properties. In this study, seven N-terminal OPN fragments originating from proteolytic cleavage have been characterized from human milk. Identification of the cleavage sites revealed that all fragments contained the Arg-Gly-Asp(145) sequence and were generated by cleavage of the Leu(151)-Arg(152), Arg(152)-Ser(153), Ser(153)-Lys(154), Lys(154)-Ser(155), Ser(155)-Lys(156), Lys(156)-Lys(157), or Phe(158)-Arg(159) peptide bonds. Six cleavages cannot be ascribed to thrombin or matrix metalloproteinase activity, whereas the cleavage at Arg(152)-Ser(153) matches thrombin specificity for OPN. The principal protease in milk, plasmin, hydrolyzed the same peptide bond as thrombin, but its main cleavage site was identified to be Lys(154)-Ser(155). Another endogenous milk protease, cathepsin D, cleaved the Leu(151)-Arg(152) bond. OPN fragments corresponding to plasmin activity were also identified in urine showing that plasmin cleavage of OPN is not restricted to milk. Plasmin, but not cathepsin D, cleavage of OPN increased cell adhesion mediated by the alpha(V)beta(3)- or alpha(5)beta(1)-integrins. Similar cellular adhesion was mediated by plasmin and thrombin-cleaved OPN showing that plasmin can be a potent regulator of OPN activity. These data show that OPN is highly susceptible to cleavage near its integrin-binding motifs, and the protein is a novel substrate for plasmin and cathepsin D."

This ether-linked alkyl bond is formed in peroxisomes by replacement of a fatty acyl chain in the intermediate 1-acyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate with a fatty alcohol in a reaction catalyzed by alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase. Here, we demonstrate that the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (Far1) supplies the fatty alcohols used in the formation of ether-linked alkyl bonds. Far1 activity is elevated in plasmalogen-deficient cells, and conversely, the levels of this enzyme are restored to normal upon plasmalogen supplementation. Down-regulation of Far1 activity in response to plasmalogens is achieved by increasing the rate of degradation of peroxisomal Far1 protein. Supplementation of normal cells with ethanolamine and 1-O-hexadecylglycerol, which are intermediates in plasmalogen biosynthesis, accelerates degradation of Far1. Taken together, our results indicate that ether lipid biosynthesis in mammalian cells is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that senses cellular plasmalogen levels and appropriately increases or decreases Far1.

Formation of the ether bond is catalyzed by another peroxisomal matrix enzyme, alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase (ADAPS), which replaces the acyl chain of 1-acyl-DHAP with a long chain fatty alcohol (1.Nagan N.

Fatty acyl-CoA reductase (Far) converts a fatty acyl-CoA into a fatty alcohol and CoA-SH and is enriched in subcellular fractions containing catalase, a peroxisomal marker enzyme (4.Bishop J.E.

Tissues such as the brain and intestine mucosa synthesize large amounts of plasmalogens, and correspondingly, contain abundant Far activity. In contrast, Far activity is low in liver, which contains little ether lipid (6.Lee T.C. Fitzgerald V. Stephens N. Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys.

Far activity is increased 4–5-fold in plasmalogen-deficient fibroblasts from patients with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), apparently resulting in accumulation of fatty alcohol (7.Rizzo W.B.

Recently, FAR1 and FAR2 cDNAs were isolated from human and mouse (8.Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Far1 prefers saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs of 16–18 carbon atoms as substrates, consistent with the composition of fatty alcohols in the sn-1 position of plasmalogens, whereas Far2 prefers saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates of 16–18 carbons. These studies and those mentioned above suggest that Far1 is responsible for supplying fatty alcohols for ether bond formation and that the activity of this enzyme may be up-regulated in the absence of plasmalogens. If so, Far1 activity may be down-regulated in the presence of plasmalogens. In the present study, we investigate the expression of FAR1 in plasmalogen-deficient and plasmalogen-replete cells. We show that Far1 is regulated by modulating the turnover of the enzyme in a plasmalogen-dependent fashion. Cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]palmitate as described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. For the alkaline methanolysis, lipids were extracted from cells by the Bligh and Dyer method (9.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med.

After neutralization with acetic acid, lipids were re-extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (9.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). To detect plasmenylethanolamine (PlsEtn) by one-dimensional TLC, PlsEtn was converted to either 2-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) by trichloroacetic acid treatment (3.Honsho M. Yagita Y.

Confluent 60-mm dishes of fibroblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and cultured for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 33 μm palmitic acid and 2.4 μm [14C]palmitate (8.Cheng J.B.

Aliquots (50 μg each) of this fraction were added to reaction tubes (final volume = 0.2 ml) containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 1.25 mm NADPH, and 0.1 μCi of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA and subsequently incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with 4 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). [14C]Hexadecanol was extracted and detected as described above. Ether-linked alkyl bond formation in ether lipids is catalyzed by ADAPS and requires fatty alcohols that are converted from fatty acids by reduction of fatty acyl-CoAs. This reaction is catalyzed by Far. Recently, two types of Far cDNAs, FAR1 and FAR2, were cloned from human and mouse, and their peroxisomal localization was demonstrated by expressing epitope-tagged Far proteins (8.Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, Far1 and/or Far2 are believed to be the enzymes responsible for the production of fatty alcohols. Because FAR1 expression was detected in many mouse tissues (8.Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we first analyzed the expression level of FAR1 and FAR2 in several cell lines. Reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA indicated that FAR1 was predominantly expressed in human fibroblasts and that FAR1 was exclusively expressed in HeLa and CHO-K1 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Based on these findings, we used HeLa and CHO-K1 cells to investigate the physiological function of Far1. We attempted to detect PlsEtn with 14C-labeled palmitic acid, which should be incorporated into PlsEtn at the sn-1 position upon reduction to [14C]hexadecanol by Far1. [14C]Palmitate was indeed incorporated efficiently into various phospholipids (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 5, and 9). Upon alkaline methanolysis, fatty acids were liberated from the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycerophospholipids. In contrast, sphingomyelin (SM) was resistant to this alkaline treatment (lanes 3, 7, and 11). Under these conditions, PlsEtn was converted to 1-alkenyl-GPE in CHO-K1 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 11) but not in ZPEG251 cells (lane 3). The latter cell line lacks the ADAPS enzyme and thus cannot synthesize ether lipids. Moreover, the vinyl ether bond of 1-alkenyl-GPE was completely hydrolyzed by subsequent treatment with trichloroacetic acid (3.Honsho M. Yagita Y. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thereby indicating that [14C]palmitate was linked to glycerol via an ether linkage, consistent with incorporation into the sn-1 position of PlsEtn (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 12). Next, we verified whether Far1 is essential for plasmalogen synthesis. FAR1 knockdown specifically gave rise to impaired plasmalogen biosynthesis (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that Far1 is responsible for supplying long chain fatty alcohols for the formation of ether lipids in these cell types. The rate-limiting step of plasmalogen biogenesis has not been elucidated. Far is likely to be a key enzyme in this regard based on the finding that Far activity is highest in tissues that contain large amounts of ether glycerophospholipids (5.Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Lee T.C. Fitzgerald V. Stephens N. Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 619: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, an accumulation of fatty alcohols, possibly due to elevated Far activity, was reported in fibroblasts from patients with an inherited defect in plasmalogen synthesis (7.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. Judd L.L. Moser H.W. Moser A.B. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1993; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspected that Far activity might be regulated in response to cellular levels of plasmalogens. To test this hypothesis, we first verified whether fatty alcohols accumulate in plasmalogen-deficient cell lines, including fibroblasts from patients with RCDP of the PEX7-deficient type 1 (13.Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Miura K. Matsumoto A. Nagaya M. Castillo-Taucher S. Kondo N. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and ADAPS-defective type 3. In control fibroblasts, [14C]palmitate was efficiently incorporated into PlsEtn, whereas PlsEtn was undetectable in plasmalogen-deficient fibroblasts, which instead accumulated hexadecanol as reported previously (7.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. Judd L.L. Moser H.W. Moser A.B. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1993; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 2, and 4). In contrast, in both types of plasmalogen-deficient RCDP fibroblasts, the accumulation of hexadecanol was significantly reduced when plasmalogen levels were restored by supplementation of the medium with 10 μm 1-O-hexadecylglycerol (HG) (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 5). In the ADAPS-CHO cell mutant, ZPEG251 (3.Honsho M. Yagita Y. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), restoration of plasmalogens with HG led to a similar reduction in hexadecanol (supplemental Fig. 2). Together with the data showing that only FAR1 is expressed in CHO cells, these results strongly suggest that Far1 activity is down-regulated in response to the plasmalogen level in ZPEG251 cells. Next, we determined the Far1 activity in CHO-K1, adaps ZPEG251, ZPEG251 supplemented with HG, and ZPEG251 cells stably expressing a human ADAPS tagged with tandem influenza virus hemagglutinin (ADAPS-HA2) epitopes (3.Honsho M. Yagita Y. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In ZPEG251 cells, [14C]hexadecanol was detectable at about a 4-fold higher level than that in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, upon restoring plasmalogen levels in the ZPEG251 cells either by supplementation with HG or by expression of ADAPS-HA2, [14C]hexadecanol levels were decreased to those found in untreated CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). This result implied that Far1 activity had been reduced to the level typically found in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. In additional experiments with ZPEG251 cells, the expression level of Far1 protein was elevated ∼4-fold as compared with CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2B, second panel, lanes 1 and 2). Upon restoration of plasmalogens in ZPEG251 cells, Far1 protein levels were decreased to those of CHO-K1 cells(Fig. 2B, second panel, lanes 3 and 4), in good agreement with the changes in Far1 enzymatic activity (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that Far1 activity is regulated at the protein level in a manner dependent on a cellular levels of plasmalogens. To explore the mechanism underlying the regulation of Far1 activity, we first measured FAR1 mRNA levels. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that restoration to a normal level of plasmalogens in ADAPS-deficient fibroblasts and ZPEG251 cells did not alter the cellular levels of FAR1 mRNA (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggested that Far1 activity is regulated at a post-translational stage as opposed to regulation at the transcriptional level. To confirm this suggestion, we established a cell line, ZPEG251/FLAG-FAR1, which was derived from ZPEG251 by stable transfection of a cDNA expressing FLAG-Far1. Both recombinant FLAG-Far1 and endogenous Far1 were detected in peroxisomes (supplemental Fig. 4A). In ZPEG251/FLAG-FAR1 cells, FLAG-Far1 expression level was reduced by HG supplementation or by expression of ADAPS-HA2 (supplemental Fig. 4, B and C), as was observed for endogenous Far1 in ZPEG251 cells (Fig. 2). Next, we investigated the turnover of Far1 in the presence of plasmalogens. ZPEG251/FLAG-FAR1 cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence or absence of HG, pulse-labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys for 1 h, and examined for FLAG-Far1 expression (Fig. 3A). In immunoblots, FLAG-Far1 was barely detectable in HG-supplemented ZPEG251/FLAG-FAR1 cells (supplemental Fig. 4, B and C). Strikingly, nearly the same amount of newly synthesized [35S]FLAG-Far1 was recovered in organelle fractions containing peroxisomes isolated from both ZPEG251/FLAG-FAR1 and HG-supplemented ZPEG251/FLAG-FAR1 cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 5). This result indicated that newly synthesized Far1 was efficiently transported to peroxisomes and subsequently degraded in cells replete with plasmalogens. To assess the fate of Far1 after targeting to peroxisomes, ZPEG251 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 20 μm HG for 13 h and then further incubated for 6 and 9 h in the presence cycloheximide (Fig. 3B). Far1 was stable when ZPEG251 cells were cultured in the absence of plasmalogens (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–3), whereas a large portion of Far1 was degraded in cells supplemented with 20 μm HG (lanes 4–6), indicating that the rate of Far1 protein turnover was accelerated in the presence of plasmalogens (Fig. 3, B and C). Taking these results together, we think it is most likely that the activity of Far1 is regulated by modulating Far1 stability in response to the level of plasmalogens. Moreover, supplementation of ZPEG251 cells with PlsEtn, but not phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 2-acyl-GPE, increased the degradation of Far1 (supplemental Fig. 5), indicating that the vinyl ether bond at the sn-1 position of PlsEtn is important for sensing plasmalogen content. We next asked whether Far1 was similarly regulated by plasmalogens in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. Upon elevation of cellular PlsEtn level by supplementation, Far1 protein level and the synthesis of PlsEtn were coordinately reduced by ∼50% in this cell type (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, PE supplementation did not alter plasmalogen synthesis or Far1 stability (Fig. 4A, lane 3). We attempted to increase plasmalogen levels in CHO-K1 cells by supplementation with ethanolamine (Etn), HG, or a combination of these two precursors. When CHO-K1 cells were cultured in the presence of Etn for 6 h, PlsEtn and PE, both biosynthetically labeled with [14C]palmitate, were significantly elevated as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2), implying that the amount of Etn in cells under normal culture conditions is not sufficient for the synthesis of PlsEtn and PE. HG supplementation slightly elevated the biosynthetic labeling of PlsEtn with [14C]Etn (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). Conversely, lowering the PE level had an opposite effect (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). By adding both Etn plus HG, PlsEtn was more distinctly increased (∼2-fold), and Far1 levels were substantially reduced (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results again suggest that Far1 activity is regulated via modulation of Far1 stability in response to cellular levels of plasmalogens. We next tested whether peroxisomal matrix proteins were required for Far1 regulation. We used a PEX1-deficient CHO cell mutant, ZP107, as a representative cell line defective in matrix protein import (14.Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Upon restoring plasmalogen levels in pex1 ZP107, Far1 was largely eliminated, just as was observed in ZPEG251 cells (supplemental Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, neither peroxisomal matrix proteins nor Pex1p were required for degradation of Far1. In the present study, we demonstrate that Far1 is an essential enzyme for supplying fatty alcohols for ether bond formation in ether glycerophospholipid synthesis (Fig. 1B). Two Far isozymes, Far1 and Far2, synthesize long chain fatty alcohol by reducing fatty acyl-CoA (8.Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). FAR1 mRNA is detectable in many types of tissues and is therein presumably responsible for a majority of fatty alcohol production. In contrast, FAR2 mRNA is largely restricted to eyelid, skin, and brain (8.Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Currently, it remains unknown whether Far2 supplies fatty alcohols for ether bond formation in these tissues. Fatty alcohols are utilized as substrates for the synthesis of ether lipids and wax esters, and excess amounts of fatty alcohol are oxidized to fatty acid (15.Rizzo W.B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 65: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Accumulation of fatty alcohols has been reported in several cell lines defective in plasmalogen biosynthesis (7.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. Judd L.L. Moser H.W. Moser A.B. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1993; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16.James P.F. Rizzo W.B. Lee J. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Given these findings, it seems likely that the enzymes involved in metabolism of fatty alcohols are coordinately regulated to make these substrates available depending on the biosynthetic needs of the cell. For example, brain contains higher amounts of plasmalogens and a correspondingly higher activity of Far, whereas fatty alcohol oxidase activity of this tissue is low (17.Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2892-2896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the converse is true in liver, where plasmalogens are less abundant (6.Lee T.C. Fitzgerald V. Stephens N. Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 619: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and fatty alcohol oxidase activity is high. The latter enzyme activity is not altered in plasmalogen-deficient cells including a peroxisome assembly-defective CHO cell mutant, PEX2-deficient ZR-82 (7.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. Judd L.L. Moser H.W. Moser A.B. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1993; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16.James P.F. Rizzo W.B. Lee J. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), implying that the accumulation of fatty alcohols in these cells is conferred by a combination of impaired incorporation of fatty alcohols in plasmalogen biosynthesis and elevated stability of Far1. We herein provide several lines of evidence that Far1 activity is regulated by modulating Far1 protein stability in response to the cellular levels of plasmalogens. Currently, we do not know the molecular mechanism behind Far1 degradation. It is also noteworthy that Far1 is degraded apparently in a plasmalogen-dependent manner after targeting to peroxisomes (Fig. 3). Moreover, peroxisomal matrix proteins and at least Pex1p do not seem to be required for this degradation process (supplemental Fig. 6). We show that degradation of Far1 is accelerated upon restoring plasmalogen levels by supplementing deficient cells with PlsEtn or HG (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 5). The vinyl ether bond seems to be important for the recognition of intracellular plasmalogen levels based on the finding that Far1 is not degraded by supplementation with PE or 2-acyl-GPE (supplemental Fig. 5). At present, we do not know whether the level of choline plasmalogen (PlsCho) functions as the signal for intracellular plasmalogen content or whether some other plasmalogen accomplishes this role. In CHO-K1 cells, only small amounts of PlsCho are detected (18.Liu D. Nagan N. Just W.W. Rodemer C. Thai T.P. Zoeller R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 727-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Supplementation of PlsCho to ZPEG251 cells does not lead to Far1 degradation, perhaps because of the higher activity of head group conversion from choline to ethanolamine in these cells (data not shown). PlsCho is in general less abundant in many tissues, except for heart and muscle (1.Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), which suggests that the amount of PlsEtn is more likely key for monitoring intracellular plasmalogen levels. In cells containing a large amount of PlsCho, the regulatory significance of this lipid remains to be defined. At the last step in the biosynthesis of PlsEtn and PE, phosphoethanolamine is transferred to alkylacyl- and diacylglycerol, respectively, via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (1.Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). If cells are unable to synthesize PlsEtn due to the defect in the process of plasmalogen biogenesis in peroxisomes, then the amount of PE is increased (3.Honsho M. Yagita Y. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19.Nagan N. Hajra A.K. Das A.K. Moser H.W. Moser A. Lazarow P. Purdue P.E. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4475-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20.Nagan N. Hajra A.K. Larkins L.K. Lazarow P. Purdue P.E. Rizzo W.B. Zoeller R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conversely, restoring PlsEtn by supplementing HG to such mutant cells reduces the level of PE (3.Honsho M. Yagita Y. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20.Nagan N. Hajra A.K. Larkins L.K. Lazarow P. Purdue P.E. Rizzo W.B. Zoeller R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, enhanced synthesis of PE through the CDP-ethanolamine pathway requires a corresponding increase in diacylglycerol (21.Bleijerveld O.B. Klein W. Vaandrager A.B. Helms J.B. Houweling M. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When this result is considered with the finding that HG supplementation eliminates PE synthesis (Fig. 4), we suggest that alkylacyl- and diacylglycerol may be regulatory metabolites in the synthesis of PlsEtn and PE, respectively. Based on the findings that supplementation of HG does not increase the level of PlsEtn, Nagan and Zoeller (1.Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) suggested that the rate-limiting step of plasmalogen biosynthesis may reside downstream of the first three steps in the pathway; however, the four enzymes responsible for these terminal steps have not yet been studied at the molecular level. Accordingly, the regulation of plasmalogen biosynthesis at the later steps has yet to be fully understood. An agent, 1-O-[9′-(1″-pyrenyl)]nonyl-sn-glycerol, may be useful for isolating mutant cell lines deficient in the terminal steps of plasmalogen biosynthesis (22.Zheng H. Duclos Jr., R.I. Smith C.C. Farber H.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study, we were successful in showing that supplementation with Etn and HG elevated PlsEtn levels in CHO-K1 cells, thereby suggesting that plasmalogen biogenesis is more likely regulated within the first three steps of the pathway, which occur in peroxisomes as opposed to the later steps occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum. In peroxisomes, DHAPAT is an essential enzyme, catalyzing the biosynthesis of an ether lipid precursor, 1-acyl-DHAP. We believe that DHAPAT is less likely to be a regulatory enzyme in plasmalogen biogenesis based on the finding that overexpression of this enzyme in a dhapat CHO mutant, NRel-4, restores plasmalogen content to a level similar to that found in wild-type cells (18.Liu D. Nagan N. Just W.W. Rodemer C. Thai T.P. Zoeller R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 727-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, increased DHAPAT activity is noted under certain conditions such as the conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes, whereas the plasmalogen level is not elevated during differentiation (23.Hajra A.K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hemati N. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9441-9446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasmalogen deficiency does not alter the activity of DHAPAT in ADAPS-defective cells (24.de Vet E.C. Ijlst L. Oostheim W. Dekker C. Moser H.W. van Den Bosch H. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1998-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings imply that DHAPAT activity is not modulated in response to the cellular level of plasmalogens. Similarly, the enzyme activity of ADAPS and acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase catalyzing the third step of plasmalogen synthesis is not altered in plasmalogen-deficient cells such as the dhapat CHO mutant, NRel-4, or in fibroblasts from patients with DHAPAT-deficient RCDP type 2 (20.Nagan N. Hajra A.K. Larkins L.K. Lazarow P. Purdue P.E. Rizzo W.B. Zoeller R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25.Thai T.P. Rodemer C. Jauch A. Hunziker A. Moser A. Gorgas K. Just W.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the activities of DHAPAT, ADAPS, and acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase are not regulated in response to plasmalogen levels. It is of interest to note that ADAPS requires long chain alcohols of 16 or 18 carbons but will not utilize 14-carbon fatty alcohols (26.Davis P.A. Hajra A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given the current findings suggesting that the level of fatty alcohols regulates ether glycerophospholipid synthesis, it is conceivable that hexadecanol- or octadecanol-containing ether lipids are indicators of cellular plasmalogen levels. We and other groups earlier showed that PlsEtn is not localized to peroxisomes where Far1 resides (3.Honsho M. Yagita Y. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27.Kuerschner L. Ejsing C.S. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Anderson K.I. Thiele C. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28.Yang J. Han X. Gross R.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Given these data, we propose that the plasmalogen-dependent regulation of Far1 involves at least three steps: recognition of the PlsEtn level in the endoplasmic reticulum or post-Golgi compartments, transfer to peroxisomes of the signal indicating plasmalogen levels, and finally, modulation of Far1 stability. Feeding PlsEtn or alkylglycerol to rats failed to increase plasmalogen levels in most tissues with the exceptions of plasma and liver (29.Das A.K. Hajra A.K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30.Nishimukai M. Wakisaka T. Hara H. Lipids. 2003; 38: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, dynamic pools of ether lipids were found in the gray matter of the brain (31.Rosenberger T.A. Oki J. Purdon A.D. Rapoport S.I. Murphy E.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of plasmalogen biosynthesis by modulating Far1 stability may play a pivotal role in plasmalogen homeostasis in the living organism. We thank S.

https://openalex.org/W2040614974,"Background With the lengthening of life expectancy among HIV-positive subjects related to the use of highly active antiretroviral treatments, an increased risk of cancer has been described in industrialized countries. The question is to determine what occurs now and will happen in the future in the low income countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where more than two-thirds of all HIV-positive people live in the world. The objective of our paper is to review the link between HIV and cancer in sub-Saharan Africa, putting it in perspective with what is already known in Western countries. Methods and Findings Studies for this review were identified from several bibliographical databases including Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, Pascal, Web of Science and using keywords “HIV, neoplasia, epidemiology and Africa” and related MesH terms. A clear association was found between HIV infection and AIDS-classifying cancers. In case-referent studies, odds ratios (OR) were ranging from 21.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 12.5–38.6) to 47.1 (31.9–69.8) for Kaposi sarcoma and from 5.0 (2.7–9.5) to 12.6 (2.2–54.4) for non Hodgkin lymphoma. The association was less strong for invasive cervical cancer with ORs ranging from 1.1 (0.7–1.2) to 1.6 (1.1–2.3), whereas ORs for squamous intraepithelial lesions were higher, from 4.4 (2.3–8.4) to 17.0 (2.2–134.1). For non AIDS-classifying cancers, squamous cell conjunctival carcinoma of the eye was associated with HIV in many case-referent studies with ORs from 2.6 (1.4–4.9) to 13.0 (4.5–39.4). A record-linkage study conducted in Uganda showed an association between Hodgkin lymphoma and HIV infection with a standardized incidence ratio of 5.7 (1.2–17) although OR in case-referent studies ranged from 1.4 (0.7–2.8) to 1.6 (1.0–2.7). Other cancer sites found positively associated with HIV include lung, liver, anus, penis, vulva, kidney, thyroid and uterus and a decreased risk of female breast cancer. These results so far based on a relatively small number of studies warrant further epidemiological investigations, taking into account other known risk factors for these tumors. Conclusion Studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa show that HIV infection is not only strongly associated with AIDS-classifying cancers but also provided some evidence of association for other neoplasia. African countries need now to implement well designed population-based studies in order to better describe the spectrum of AIDS-associated malignancies and the most effective strategies for their prevention, screening and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2061791102,"Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) was originally characterized as an endogenous inhibitor of thioredoxin, a key regulator in cellular redox homeostasis. TXNIP is also known to play important roles in tumor growth and metastasis, glucose and lipid metabolism. TXNIP expression is induced by various stress stimuli. However, it has been unclear how TXNIP is down-regulated. Here, we report that TXNIP undergoes proteasomal degradation in cells. We identify Itch as the E3 ubiquitin ligase for TXNIP. We demonstrate that Itch mediates polyubiquitination of TXNIP both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of Itch leads to TXNIP proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Itch by small interfering RNA causes an accumulation of the steady-state level of TXNIP. We also show that the PPXY motifs of TXNIP and the WW domains of Itch mediate their interaction. Furthermore, the Itch-TXNIP interaction regulates intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and apoptosis. These findings establish a new mechanism for the negative regulation of TXNIP by Itch and shed new light on the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2156725174,"The genome of extraembryonic tissue, such as the placenta, is hypomethylated relative to that in somatic tissues. However, the origin and role of this hypomethylation remains unclear. The DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, -3A, and -3B are the primary mediators of the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in mammals. In this study, we investigated promoter methylation-mediated epigenetic down-regulation of DNMT genes as a potential regulator of global methylation levels in placental tissue. Although DNMT3A and -3B promoters lack methylation in all somatic and extraembryonic tissues tested, we found specific hypermethylation of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) gene and found hypomethylation of the DNMT3L gene in full term and first trimester placental tissues. Bisulfite DNA sequencing revealed monoallelic methylation of DNMT1, with no evidence of imprinting (parent of origin effect). In vitro reporter experiments confirmed that DNMT1 promoter methylation attenuates transcriptional activity in trophoblast cells. However, global hypomethylation in the absence of DNMT1 down-regulation is apparent in non-primate placentas and in vitro derived human cytotrophoblast stem cells, suggesting that DNMT1 down-regulation is not an absolute requirement for genomic hypomethylation in all instances. These data represent the first demonstration of methylation-mediated regulation of the DNMT1 gene in any system and demonstrate that the unique epigenome of the human placenta includes down-regulation of DNMT1 with concomitant hypomethylation of the DNMT3L gene. This strongly implicates epigenetic regulation of the DNMT gene family in the establishment of the unique epigenetic profile of extraembryonic tissue in humans. The genome of extraembryonic tissue, such as the placenta, is hypomethylated relative to that in somatic tissues. However, the origin and role of this hypomethylation remains unclear. The DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, -3A, and -3B are the primary mediators of the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in mammals. In this study, we investigated promoter methylation-mediated epigenetic down-regulation of DNMT genes as a potential regulator of global methylation levels in placental tissue. Although DNMT3A and -3B promoters lack methylation in all somatic and extraembryonic tissues tested, we found specific hypermethylation of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) gene and found hypomethylation of the DNMT3L gene in full term and first trimester placental tissues. Bisulfite DNA sequencing revealed monoallelic methylation of DNMT1, with no evidence of imprinting (parent of origin effect). In vitro reporter experiments confirmed that DNMT1 promoter methylation attenuates transcriptional activity in trophoblast cells. However, global hypomethylation in the absence of DNMT1 down-regulation is apparent in non-primate placentas and in vitro derived human cytotrophoblast stem cells, suggesting that DNMT1 down-regulation is not an absolute requirement for genomic hypomethylation in all instances. These data represent the first demonstration of methylation-mediated regulation of the DNMT1 gene in any system and demonstrate that the unique epigenome of the human placenta includes down-regulation of DNMT1 with concomitant hypomethylation of the DNMT3L gene.

Here, we demonstrate that our previously cloned human alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3) specifically controls the hydrolysis of ceramides carrying unsaturated long acyl chains, unsaturated long-chain (ULC) ceramides. In vitro, ACER3 only hydrolyzed C18:1-, C20:1-, C20:4-ceramides, dihydroceramides, and phytoceramides. In cells, ACER3 overexpression decreased C18:1- and C20:1-ceramides and dihydroceramides, whereas ACER3 knockdown by RNA interference had the opposite effect, suggesting that ACER3 controls the catabolism of ULC ceramides and dihydroceramides. ACER3 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and up-regulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. Blocking p21CIP1/WAF1 up-regulation attenuated the inhibitory effect of ACER3 knockdown on cell proliferation, suggesting that ACER3 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation because of p21CIP1/WAF1 up-regulation. ACER3 knockdown inhibited cell apoptosis in response to serum deprivation. ACER3 knockdown up-regulated the expression of the alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2), and the ACER2 up-regulation decreased non-ULC ceramide species while increasing both sphingosine and its phosphate. Collectively, these data suggest that ACER3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ULC ceramides and dihydroceramides and that ACER3 coordinates with ACER2 to regulate cell proliferation and survival.

Ceramides also act as bioactive molecules to mediate various cellular responses such as cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to a variety of stress stimuli, including the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (2.Hanna A.N.

SPH is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (8.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

In contrast to ceramides and SPH, S1P mainly promotes cell proliferation and survival (10.Alvarez S.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 300-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Therefore, ceramidases may play an important role in regulating the levels of ceramides, SPH, and S1P as well as cellular responses mediated by these bioactive lipids.Ceramidases, according to their pH optima for in vitro activity, are classified into acid, neutral, and alkaline types (1.Mao C. Obeid L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 11.el Bawab S. Mao C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Subcell. Biochem. 2002; 36: 187-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five human ceramidases encoded by five distinct genes have been identified as follows: the acid ceramidase (ASAH1) (12.Koch J. Gärtner S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26577-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Ceramidases have different cellular localizations and substrate specificities. ASAH1 is a lysosomal ceramidase that uses medium-chain (C10–14) ceramides as its best substrates, and it hydrolyzes C18:1- or C18:2-ceramide more efficiently than C18:0-ceramide (17.Momoi T. Ben-Yoseph Y. Nadler H.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ASAH2 is localized to the plasma membrane or secreted from cells (18.Hwang Y.H. Tani M. Nakagawa T. Okino N. Ito M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ASAH2 prefers long-chain (C16–22) to very long-chain (≥C24) ceramides as substrates (19.El Bawab S. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27948-27955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ACER1 is an endoplasmic reticulum ceramidase that only uses very long-chain ceramides as substrates and hydrolyzes the unsaturated very long-chain C24:1-ceramide more efficiently than the saturated very long-chain C24:0-ceramide (14.Sun W. Xu R. Hu W. Jin J. Crellin H.A. Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Thiers B.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128: 389-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ACER2 is a Golgi ceramidase that uses both long-chain and very long-chain ceramides as substrates (15.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 4Sun, W., Jin, J., Xu, R., Hu, W., Szulc, Z. M., Bielawski, J., Obeid, L. M., and Mao, C. (January 20, 2010) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M109.069203. Different ceramidases have distinct roles in regulating cellular responses likely due to the differences in their cellular localizations and substrate specificities. A genetic deficiency in ASAH1 causes Farber disease, a sphingolipid storage disease (20.Chen W.W. Decker G.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Online J. 2007; 5: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role in sphingolipid catabolism. Recent studies showed that ASAH1 expression is increased in prostate tumors and that its up-regulation may promote tumor cell growth and survival by decreasing ceramide (22.Holman D.H. Turner L.S. El-Zawahry A. Elojeimy S. Liu X. Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Norris K. Zeidan Y.H. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Norris J.S. Cancer Chemother.

Acta. 2009; 1791: 730-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that ASAH2 protein is decreased in gemcitabine-treated cells and that its knockdown by RNAi induces cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, suggesting that ASAH2 plays a role in cell proliferation. In contrast to ASAH1 and ASAH2, ACER1 helps mediate growth arrest and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (major epidermal cell type) (14.Sun W. Xu R. Hu W. Jin J. Crellin H.A. Bielawski J.

Depending on its expression level, ACER2 plays a role in either cell proliferation or growth arrest (15.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Low ACER2 expression promotes cell proliferation likely through decreasing ceramide and increasing S1P, whereas high expression induces cell growth arrest because of an accumulation of SPH in cells.ACER3 was the first mammalian alkaline ceramidase to be cloned by our group (16.Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26577-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but its roles in regulating the metabolism of sphingolipids and cellular responses remain unclear. ACER3 is localized to both the Golgi complex and ER, and it is highly expressed in various tissues compared with the other two alkaline ceramidases (16.Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26577-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We previously showed that ACER3 hydrolyzes a synthetic ceramide analogue d-ribo-C12-NBD-phytoceramide in vitro; thus, it is formerly referred to as the human alkaline phytoceramidase (haPHC) (16.Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26577-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, its natural ceramide substrates remain to be identified.In this study, we investigate the roles of ACER3 in sphingolipid metabolism and signaling. We show that ACER3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of specific ceramides/dihydroceramides/phytoceramides carrying unsaturated long acyl chains (C18:1, C20:1, or C20:4), so-called unsaturated long-chain (ULC) ceramides/dihydroceramides/phytoceramides. With quantitative (q) PCR in conjunction with alkaline ceramidase activity assays, we show that ACER3 is highly expressed in various cell types. We further illustrate that ACER3 plays a role in cell proliferation by regulating the hydrolysis of ULC ceramides and dihydroceramides in cells.DISCUSSIONACER3 was the first mammalian alkaline ceramidase to be cloned by our group (16.Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26577-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because of the unique substrate specificity of ACER3, our attempt to identify its natural substrates was initially fruitless. In this study, we not only successfully elucidated the substrate specificity of ACER3 but also defined its roles in the metabolism of sphingolipids and cellular responses. There are several major findings of this study. First, we found that ACER3 only uses monounsaturated (C18:1 and C20:1) or polyunsaturated (C20:4) long-chain ceramides, dihydroceramides, or phytoceramides as in vitro substrates. Second, we identified ACER3 as the first mammalian alkaline ceramidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of natural phytoceramides to generate PHS in (yeast) cells. Finally, we revealed that ACER3 has the ability to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis by controlling the hydrolysis of ULC ceramides.ACER3 differs from other human ceramidases by having unique substrate specificity. Unlike other human ceramidases that use at least one of the major mammalian ceramide species (C16-, C24:0-, and C24:1-ceramide) as substrate(s), ACER3 only catalyzes the hydrolysis of the minor ULC ceramide species (d-e-C18:1, C20:1, or C20:4-ceramide). Distinct from the other ceramidases that prefer SPH-containing ceramides over dihydroceramides or phytoceramides as substrates, ACER3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ULC dihydroceramides or phytoceramides as efficiently as their ceramide counterparts. These results suggest that the composition of the ceramide acyl chain is more critical for ACER3 activity than the structure of the sphingoid base moiety. This indicates that ACER3 is a unique ceramidase in terms of substrate specificity.Different cell types have distinct compositions of ceramides differing in both the length and unsaturation degree of the acyl chain. Ceramides are synthesized through the action of (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CERSs) (37.Zheng W. Kollmeyer J. Symolon H. Momin A. Munter E. Wang E. Kelly S. Allegood J.C. Liu Y. Peng Q. Ramaraju H. Sullards M.C. Cabot M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1864-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 38.Pewzner-Jung Y. Ben-Dor S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25001-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). To date, six human CERS isozymes have been cloned, and each CERS catalyzes the formation of ceramides with specific acyl chain lengths. The specificity of CERSs for the degree of unsaturation of acyl chains remains unclear, although CERS5/LASS5 was shown to be capable of synthesizing C18:1-ceramide (39.Mizutani Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, there are also multiple human ceramidases, and each catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide species with certain acyl chain lengths and unsaturation degrees. Therefore, the composition of ceramide species in a particular cell type or tissue mainly is determined by the expression levels of both CERS and ceramidase isozymes.Consistent with its in vitro substrate specificity, ACER3 plays a specific role in controlling cellular ULC ceramides and dihydroceramides. This is supported by two lines of direct evidence. First, ACER3 overexpression decreased ULC ceramides but not other ceramide species in HSC-1 cells. Second, ACER3 knockdown significantly increased the cellular levels of C18:1- and C20:1-ceramides. Furthermore, the specific role of ACER3 in regulating ULC ceramide levels is supported by an inverse correlation between ACER3 activity and levels of ULC ceramides in cells or tissues. C18:1- and C20:1-ceramides are much greater in HSC-1 cells than in HeLa cells, although the opposite is true with ACER3 activity. There is also an inverse correlation between the mouse alkaline ceramidase 3 activity and the levels of ULC ceramides in mouse liver and brain (Fig. 8).In addition to ULC ceramides, ACER3 also plays a role in regulating cellular ULC dihydroceramides because ACER3 overexpression decreased, whereas its knockdown increased, cellular C18:1- and C20:1-dihydroceramides. Although we showed that ACER3 in vitro hydrolyzed ULC phytoceramides efficiently, ACER3 knockdown in HeLa cells failed to increase their cellular levels (data not shown), suggesting that phytoceramides may not be synthesized in this cell type or may be too low to detect. In other human cell types that do synthesize phytoceramides, ACER3 knockdown is expected to increase cellular levels of ULC phytoceramides because we showed that ACER3 could hydrolyze phytoceramides to generate PHS in (yeast) cells. Based on the aforementioned observations, we concluded that ACER3 plays a key role in regulating the homeostasis of ULC (phyto/dihydro)ceramides in cells or tissues.It is noteworthy that d-e-C20:4-ceramide is also a substrate of ACER3, although this polyunsaturated long-chain ceramide is undetectable in HeLa or HSC-1 cells. In fact, to date, the existence of polyunsaturated long-chain ceramides or dihydroceramides has not been reported in any mammalian cell types or tissues, although polyunsaturated very long-chain ceramides, such as C28:4-ceramide, have been detected in mouse or rat testicular tissues (40.Furland N.E. Zanetti S.R. Oresti G.M. Maldonado E.N. Aveldaño M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18141-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The absence of an arachidonoyl group in sphingolipids suggests that either none of CERS isozymes use arachidonoyl-CoA as substrate or ACER3 efficiently eradicates C20:4-ceramide from cells. The latter case is very likely because we previously demonstrated that ACER3 is highly expressed in most tissues (16.Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26577-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance for ACER3 to keep ULC and polyunsaturated long-chain ceramides at the lowest levels in cells and tissues remains unclear. Because complex sphingolipids in lipid rafts of the plasma membrane mainly have saturated acyl chains, the presence of mono- and polyunsaturated long acyl chains may have an adverse effect on the physiochemical properties of lipid rafts (41.Wassall S.R. Stillwell W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2008; 153: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, high ACER3 activity may be important for the integrity and function of lipid rafts by preventing polyunsaturated fatty acids from being incorporated into sphingolipids in lipid rafts. This possibility is currently under investigation in our laboratory.Interestingly, although ACER3 does not use saturated long-chain ceramides or very long-chain ceramides, ACER3 knockdown slightly but significantly deceased their cellular levels while increasing both SPH and S1P. These unexpected effects may be caused by up-regulation of ACER2 because ACER3 knockdown up-regulated the expression of ACER2, another alkaline ceramidase whose up-regulation was shown to decrease most ceramide species while increasing both SPH and S1P (15.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that ACER2 in vitro catalyzes the hydrolysis of most mammalian ceramides, including ULC ceramides. 4Sun, W., Jin, J., Xu, R., Hu, W., Szulc, Z. M., Bielawski, J., Obeid, L. M., and Mao, C. (January 20, 2010) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M109.069203. ACER2 up-regulation did not affect the ACER3 knockdown-induced increase in cellular ULC ceramides, suggesting that ACER2 up-regulation cannot compensate for the ability of ACER3 to hydrolyze ULC ceramides in cells. This is probably because cells express much more ACER3 than those of ACER2. ACER2 up-regulation can compensate for the ability of ACER3 to generate both SPH and S1P in cells. This is because the substrates of ACER2 are much more abundant than the substrates of ACER3. The physiological relevance of ACER2 up-regulation may be to maintain SPH and S1P at constant levels in cells where ACER3 is down-regulated or inhibited. Therefore, ACER3 and ACER2 may have a complementary role in regulating the generation of SPH and S1P in cells.Compared with transfection with siCON or with no siRNA, transfection with an ACER3-specific siRNA, siACER3-1 or siACER3-2, not only decreased ACER3 expression but also increased ACER2 expression, so the biological effects of siACER3-1 or siACER3-2 may be caused by ACER3 down-regulation, ACER2 up-regulation, or both. We demonstrated that transfection with siACER3-1 or siACER3-2 inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells. Because we previously showed that a moderate increase in ACER2 expression does not affect the proliferation of HeLa cells in regular serum-containing medium, the inhibitory effect of siACER3-1 or ACER3-2 on cell proliferation may be caused by ACER3 knockdown but not by ACER2 up-regulation. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of ACER3 knockdown on cell proliferation is probably due to an accumulation of ULC ceramides and their derivatives. This idea is in line with a general view that ceramides are anti-proliferative bioactive lipids.p21CIP1/WAF1 up-regulation has been suggested to be a mechanism by which synthetic short-chain ceramide or endogenous ceramide generated by treatment with bacterial sphingomyelinase induces cell growth arrest (33.Phillips D.C. Hunt J.T. Moneypenny C.G. Maclean K.H. McKenzie P.P. Harris L.C. Houghton J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1780-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34.Wang J. Lv X.W. Shi J.P. Hu X.S. World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35.Alesse E. Zazzeroni F. Angelucci A. Giannini G. Di Marcotullio L. Gulino A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we showed that an increase in endogenous ULC ceramides also up-regulated p21CIP1/WAF1. Because p21CIP1/WAF1 has been implicated in growth arrest in various tumor cell types, its up-regulation appears to be important for cell growth arrest induced by increased ULC ceramides. This is supported by the finding that RNAi-mediated knockdown of p21CIP1/WAF1 significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of ACER3 knockdown on cell proliferation. The mechanism by which ULC ceramides up-regulate p21CIP1/WAF1 is under investigation.Transfection with siACER3-1 or siACER3-2 protected cells from apoptosis in response to serum deprivation. The protective effect of siACER3 could also be due to ACER3 down-regulation, ACER2 up-regulation, or both. If ACER3 knockdown is responsible, increased ULC ceramides may have a protective role in apoptosis. This is contradictory to a general view that ceramides are pro-apoptotic bioactive lipids. Interestingly, although the synthetic d-e-C6-ceramide has been shown to induce the apoptosis of various cell types, Plummer et al. (42.Plummer G. Perreault K.R. Holmes C.F. Posse De Chaves E.I. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment with C6-ceramide inhibits apoptosis of sympathetic neurons in response to nerve growth factor deprivation. C6-ceramide was shown to increase endogenous long-chain ceramides through a deacylation-reacylation recycling pathway (43.Ogretmen B. Pettus B.J. Rossi M.J. Wood R. Usta J. Szulc Z. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12960-12969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because ULC ceramides are abundant in brain tissue (Fig. 8), treatment with exogenous C6-ceramide may preferentially increase ULC ceramides in sympathetic neurons, thus enhancing cell survival against nerve growth factor deprivation. We previously demonstrated that ACER2 up-regulation protects HeLa cells from apoptosis in response to serum deprivation by increasing the generation of S1P, a serum component that has been shown to potently inhibit the apoptosis of cells grown in serum-free medium (15.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This supports the notion that ACER2 up-regulation and S1P increase may also be responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect of siACER3-1 or siACER3-2.In conclusion, we demonstrate that ACER3 is highly expressed in various cell types and has distinct substrate specificity from other ceramidases. Its high expression plays a role in cell proliferation by minimizing the cellular levels of ULC ceramides, which are otherwise anti-proliferative. ACER3 also has the ability to control the generation of SPH and S1P in cells. Loss of this ability can be compensated by up-regulation of ACER2, another alkaline ceramidase, suggesting that alkaline ceramidases have a complementary role in regulating the generation of SPH and S1P in cells.

Ceramides also act as bioactive molecules to mediate various cellular responses such as cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to a variety of stress stimuli, including the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (2.Hanna A.N.

SPH is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (8.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Therefore, ceramidases may play an important role in regulating the levels of ceramides, SPH, and S1P as well as cellular responses mediated by these bioactive lipids.Ceramidases, according to their pH optima for in vitro activity, are classified into acid, neutral, and alkaline types (1.Mao C.

In addition to the direct microbicidal effects of these polypeptides, members of the β-defensin super family have the capacity to promote local innate inflammatory and systemic adaptive immune responses, which are in part mediated by the CC-chemokine receptor CCR6. Here we report the expression of recombinant mBD4 and its human orthologue hBD2 fused to the constant domain of human IgG1 to obtain correct folding and to increase stability and solubility using the Drosophila S2 expression system. Purified recombinant mBD4:Ig and hBD2:Ig fusion proteins retained potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, these β-defensin fusion proteins showed specific binding to CCR6-expressing cells as revealed by flow cytometry.

This result supports our finding that mBD4 does not interact with human CCR6-expressing cells. Further evidence for specific interaction of the β-defensin fusion proteins with CCR6-expressing cells is demonstrated by the observation that CCL20 and β-defensin fusion proteins desensitize each other in inducing chemotactic activity. In addition both mBD4:Ig and hBD2:Ig demonstrated CCR6-independent chemotaxis of freshly isolated mouse resident peritoneal cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating the interaction with another chemotaxis-inducing receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2064133865,"Background Genetic resistance to barley leaf rust caused by Puccinia hordei involves both R genes and quantitative trait loci. The R genes provide higher but less durable resistance than the quantitative trait loci. Consequently, exploring quantitative or partial resistance has become a favorable alternative for controlling disease. Four quantitative trait loci for partial resistance to leaf rust have been identified in the doubled haploid Steptoe (St)/Morex (Mx) mapping population. Further investigations are required to study the molecular mechanisms underpinning partial resistance and ultimately identify the causal genes. Methodology/Principal Findings We explored partial resistance to barley leaf rust using a genetical genomics approach. We recorded RNA transcript abundance corresponding to each probe on a 15K Agilent custom barley microarray in seedlings from St and Mx and 144 doubled haploid lines of the St/Mx population. A total of 1154 and 1037 genes were, respectively, identified as being P. hordei-responsive among the St and Mx and differentially expressed between P. hordei-infected St and Mx. Normalized ratios from 72 distant-pair hybridisations were used to map the genetic determinants of variation in transcript abundance by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping generating 15685 eQTL from 9557 genes. Correlation analysis identified 128 genes that were correlated with resistance, of which 89 had eQTL co-locating with the phenotypic quantitative trait loci (pQTL). Transcript abundance in the parents and conservation of synteny with rice allowed us to prioritise six genes as candidates for Rphq11, the pQTL of largest effect, and highlight one, a phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (HvPHGPx) for detailed analysis. Conclusions/Significance The eQTL approach yielded information that led to the identification of strong candidate genes underlying pQTL for resistance to leaf rust in barley and on the general pathogen response pathway. The dataset will facilitate a systems appraisal of this host-pathogen interaction and, potentially, for other traits measured in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2007338713,"Background A point mutation in the Drosophila gene technical knockout (tko), encoding mitoribosomal protein S12, was previously shown to cause a phenotype of respiratory chain deficiency, developmental delay, and neurological abnormalities similar to those presented in many human mitochondrial disorders, as well as defective courtship behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we describe a transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression in tko25t mutant flies that revealed systematic and compensatory changes in the expression of genes connected with metabolism, including up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase and of many genes involved in the catabolism of fats and proteins, and various anaplerotic pathways. Gut-specific enzymes involved in the primary mobilization of dietary fats and proteins, as well as a number of transport functions, were also strongly up-regulated, consistent with the idea that oxidative phosphorylation OXPHOS dysfunction is perceived physiologically as a starvation for particular biomolecules. In addition, many stress-response genes were induced. Other changes may reflect a signature of developmental delay, notably a down-regulation of genes connected with reproduction, including gametogenesis, as well as courtship behavior in males; logically this represents a programmed response to a mitochondrially generated starvation signal. The underlying signalling pathway, if conserved, could influence many physiological processes in response to nutritional stress, although any such pathway involved remains unidentified. Conclusions/Significance These studies indicate that general and organ-specific metabolism is transformed in response to mitochondrial dysfunction, including digestive and absorptive functions, and give important clues as to how novel therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial disorders might be developed."

Utilizing dynamic imaging modalities (confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and luminescence detection utilizing a high sensitivity CCD camera) at different scales, including confluent cell populations, single cells, and the intracellular submembrane space, we have demonstrated in a model liver cell line that (i) ATP release is not uniform but reflects point source release by a defined subset of cells; (ii) ATP within cells is localized to discrete zones of high intensity that are ∼1 μm in diameter, suggesting a vesicular localization; (iii) these vesicles originate from a bafilomycin A1-sensitive pool, are depleted by hypotonic exposure, and are not rapidly replenished from recycling of endocytic vesicles; and (iv) exocytosis of vesicles in response to cell volume changes depends upon a complex series of signaling events that requires intact microtubules as well as phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C.

Collectively, these findings are most consistent with an essential role for exocytosis in regulated release of ATP and initiation of purinergic signaling in liver cells. Extracellular ATP functions within liver as a key autocrine/paracrine signaling molecule. The purinergic signaling cascade is initiated by release of ATP from intracellular stores, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. However, P2 receptors are expressed on all liver cell types, and once outside of the cell ATP has multiple effects, including (i) coordination within the liver lobule of cell-to-cell [Ca2+]i signaling (1.Schlosser S.F.

Specifically, cellular ATP release leads to increased concentrations of ATP in bile sufficient to activate P2 receptors in the apical membrane of targeted cholangiocytes, resulting in a robust secretory response through activation of Cl− channels in the apical membrane. Moreover, multiple signals including intracellular calcium, cAMP and bile acids appear to coordinate ATP release, which has been recognized recently as a final common pathway responsible for biliary secretion (3.Minagawa N. Nagata J. Shibao K. Masyuk A.I. Gomes D.A. Rodrigues M.A. Lesage G. Akiba Y. Kaunitz J.D. Ehrlich B.E. Larusso N.F. Nathanson M.H.

Accordingly, definition of the mechanisms involved in ATP release represents a key focus for efforts to modulate liver function and the volume and composition of bile. Previous studies indicate that increases in cell volume serve as a potent stimulus for physiologic ATP release in many epithelia and in liver cells increase extracellular nucleotide concentrations 5–10-fold (6.Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two broad models for ATP release by nonexcitatory cells have been proposed, including (i) opening of ATP-permeable channels and/or (ii) exocytosis of ATP-containing vesicles (7.Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). There is evidence, for example, for conductive movement of ATP4− across the plasma membrane, consistent with a channel-mediated mechanism, and connexin 36 hemichannels (8.Schock S.C. Leblanc D. Hakim A.M. Thompson C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), ATP-binding cassette proteins, and P2X7 receptor proteins (9.Suadicani S.O. Brosnan C.F. Scemes E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) each have been proposed to function as ATP-permeable transmembrane pores where opening permits movement of ATP from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space (10.Arcuino G.

Alternatively, ATP can be co-packaged into vesicles with other signaling molecules in endothelial and chromaffin cells, and exocytosis results in rapid point source increases in extracellular ATP concentrations (11.Carabelli V. Carra I. Carbone E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1255-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12.Bodin P. Burnstock G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Quinacrine taken up by the cell is concentrated in ATP-containing vesicles, and fluorescence imaging of intracellular ATP stores in pancreatic acinar cells shows a punctate distribution consistent with a vesicular localization (13.Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Given the diverse functions of ATP as an agonist, it is likely that more than one pathway is operative with substantial differences among cell types in the mechanisms involved. In the liver, expression of the ATP-binding cassette protein MDR1 increases ATP release, but the effects of P-glycoproteins on ATP release can be dissociated from P-glycoprotein substrate transport, suggesting that MDR1 per se is not likely to function as an ATP channel (14.Roman R.M. Lomri N. Braunstein G. Feranchak A.P. Simeoni L.A. Davison A.K. Mechetner E. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, in biliary cells, the related cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in the apical membrane and plays an important regulatory role in ATP release through a mechanism not yet defined (3.Minagawa N.

Recent indirect observations suggest an important role for vesicular pathways in hepatic ATP release. In a cholangiocyte cell line, increases in cell volume stimulate an abrupt increase in exocytosis to rates sufficient to replace 15–30% of plasma membrane surface area within 1 min through a mechanism dependent on both protein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and interruption of this exocytic response inhibits volume-sensitive ATP release (16.Gatof D. Kilic G. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 286: G538-G546Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, intracellular dialysis through a patch pipette with the lipid products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the absence of an increase in cell volume is sufficient to stimulate ATP release (6.Feranchak A.P.

Together, these findings suggest that functional interactions between cell volume and exocytosis modulate purinergic signaling in liver through effects on ATP release. Accordingly, the purpose of these studies was to assess the kinetics of volume-sensitive ATP release, to assess whether liver cells possess vesicles enriched in ATP, and to determine whether exocytosis and ATP release are functionally related. Studies were performed in HTC rat hepatoma cells, which express all components of the P2-signaling axis, including mechanosensitive ATP release, Ca2+ signaling, and coupled changes in ion permeability (2.Wang Y.

Cells were grown to near confluence on 35-mm tissue culture-treated dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (600 μl, twice). 600 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing L-L (Fl-ATP assay mix, Sigma; reconstituted according to the manufacturer's directions and used at a final dilution of 1:50 with Opti-MEM) was added, and then cells were placed into a modified Turner TD 20/20 Luminometer in complete darkness. After a 5–10-min equilibration period, readings were obtained every 15 s, and cumulative bioluminescence over 15-s photon intervals was quantified in real time as arbitrary light units (ALU).

The perfusion system allowed delivery of the hypotonic stimulus to the cells without interrupting imaging or opening the light-sealed chamber. Light produced by the catalysis of the L-L reaction by released ATP was detected by a high sensitivity electron-multiplying CCD camera (Princeton Instruments/ACTON PhotonMAX 512B with the e2v CCD97 sensor, 512 × 512 pixels), mounted in a vertical orientation on an x-y-z stage. A relay lens consisting of two 25.4-mm format lenses (Schneider Xenon f/# 0.95) coupled front-to-front with each focused at infinity with full aperture was used to image at 1×, similar to macroscopic geometries previously utilized in CCD-based γ-camera configurations (23.Soesbe T.C.

Med. 2007; 48: 47PGoogle Scholar). Focusing was performed by translating the z axis. Images were collected at a frequency of 9–10 Hz with a 100-ms exposure time during basal (isotonic) and hypotonic conditions. Typical stacks of 500–700 images were streamed to hard disk for storage and data analysis. Full electron-multiplication stage gain was utilized in all experiments for maximum sensitivity. Base-line image stacks prior to hypotonic stimulation were also obtained for residual ATP detection and electron-multiplication noise characterization. Precautions were taken to avoid overexposure of the high-gain sensor mode because this has been shown to reduce sensitivity. Quinacrine (Sigma), an acridine derivative, has a very high affinity for ATP and has been utilized to label intracellular ATP-enriched vesicles in neuronal and epithelial cell types (12.Bodin P.

Cells cultured on Lab-Tech glass-bottom 8-well imaging coverglasses (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY), were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with quinacrine (5 μm × 5 min), washed, and placed in isotonic buffer. In select studies, FM 4-64 (4 μm for 10–120 min; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes), to label the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles, preceded or was administered concurrently with quinacrine as indicated. Cells were culture on Lab-Tek 8-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc), stained with FM 4-64 and quinacrine and imaged under basal and hypotonic conditions as described above. Imaging was performed using a PerkinElmer Biosciences UltraVIEW ERS spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An argon ion laser and a krypton laser (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA) were utilized as a light source (excitation at 488 and 561 nm, respectively), and data were captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG high resolution cooled CCD (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ) controlled by the UltraVIEW ERS software. Images were recorded using a Zeiss Plan Apo ×63/1.40 numerical aperture oil immersion objective lens. Fast multicolor images were captured using emission band pass filters to allow effective separation of overlapping wavelengths, and 2 × 2 binning was selected for all images. Speed of acquisition was increased by subarraying the camera to reduce the size of the captured image. Image analysis was performed utilizing ImageJ (available on the World Wide Web), and Imaris 5.0 (Bitplane Inc., Saint Paul, MN) was used for three-dimensional volume rendering of z stacks after background correction and edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion filtering. The Imaris spot detection algorithm was applied to detect and measure objects (vesicles) after specifying minimum diameter so that speckle noise was not detected. We defined small vesicles as those between 0.4 and 0.99 μm versus large vesicles, defined as those of ≥1 μm. Potential co-localization between FM4-64- and quinacrine-labeled vesicles was evaluated by application of Imaris 5.0–6.2 (Bitplane, Inc.) utilizing the co-localization feature, with complete (100%) co-localization indicated by a Person's coefficient of ≥1.00. Cells were cultured on a Lab-Tek 8-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc), stained with quinacrine, and imaged under basal and hypotonic conditions, as described above. TIRF imaging was performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with an Olympus TIRF module. Quinacrine TIRF was excited with the 488-nm line of a 10-milliwatt argon laser (Melles Griot) through a ×60 PlanApo-N 1.45 numerical aperture oil immersion lens or a PLAPO ×100 1.45 numerical aperture TIRF microscope oil immersion lens as described (29.Axelrod D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 30.Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Laser intensity was modulated by neutral density filters and Uniblitz electronic shutters (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Time-lapse images were acquired every 300 ms with exposure times of 100–200 ms using SlideBook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO) to control a Hamamatsu Orca II ERG camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and the electronic shutters. LDH measurements were performed pre- and posthypotonic exposure using an enzymatic colorimetric cytotoxicity assay (CytoTox 96, Promega, Madison, WI). Calibration of the assay was performed with cell-free controls and reagents only (no LDH release), LDH standard at a dilution of 1:5000 (amount of LDH in ∼13,000 lysed cells), and after exposure of cells to lysis solution (maximum LDH release). Wortmannin was obtained from Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA), and calphostin C was obtained from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. None of the reagents affected L-L luminescence as measured during cell-free conditions. Results are presented as the means ± S.E., with n representing the number of culture plates or repetitions for each assay as indicated. Statistical analysis included Fisher's paired and unpaired t test and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons to assess statistical significance as indicated, and p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Increases in liver cell volume result in an increase in bulk ATP concentration in the overlying media from ∼10 to ∼300 nm as measured by luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence (31.Feranchak A.P. Fitz J.G. Roman R.M. J. Hepatol. 2000; 33: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This response represents an integrated signal from >106 cells, peaks within ∼90 s, and gradually decays over minutes. In order to visualize the dynamics of ATP release, direct imaging of ATP in solution was performed using real-time bioluminescence to detect extracellular ATP across a field of cells (10.Arcuino G. Lin J.H. Takano T. Liu C. Jiang L. Gao Q. Kang J. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9840-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For these studies, cells in culture were superperfused with luciferin-luciferase-containing medium, maintained in a dark environment, and imaged with a high sensitivity electron-multiplying CCD camera (see supplemental Fig. S1). Under these conditions, the appearance of ATP in the medium was detected in real time by light emissions resulting from ATP-dependent luciferase-catalyzed oxidation of luciferin (10.Arcuino G. Lin J.H. Takano T. Liu C. Jiang L. Gao Q. Kang J. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9840-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A representative sequence of images from a single plate of cells is shown in Fig. 1. Under basal conditions, there was low background activity. When medium osmolality was reduced (by 33%) to produce an increase in cell volume, there was an increase in luminescence, but it was not evenly distributed across the field of cells. Rather, there were abrupt point source bursts of high intensity. Each burst reached maximal intensity within <2 s (the dead time of the instrument) and then decayed with t½ of 4.9 s as shown in Fig. 1. The maximal diameter of detectable ATP bursts averaged 201 ± 11 μm (n = 31). In the presence of high dose suramin to block P2 receptors, the average size of the individual events was unaffected (diameter 231 ± 18 μm, not significant, n = 13), confirming that each burst was a discrete event and did not represent propagation of ATP-dependent ATP release from neighboring cells. Further, ATP release was restricted to single events, in that there was no evidence for subsequent open events at the same site. Finally, luminescence was eliminated completely by exposure to apyrase (1 unit/ml) to hydrolyze ATP (data not shown); there was no associated release of LDH and no evidence of cell injury or necrosis when visualized by conventional microscopy (not shown). Thus, volume-sensitive ATP release is not uniform but occurs as focal points of high intensity across a population of cells. Each event is discrete and nonrecurring and produces a localized zone of increased ATP concentration that diffuses rapidly over a range corresponding to ∼10 cell diameters before dropping to undetectable levels, consistent with the published values of the ATP diffusion coefficient and suggesting an autocrine/paracrine sphere of signaling. This temporal profile of extracellular ATP kinetics is most compatible with point source release and rapid ATP diffusion/hydrolysis. In an effort to visualize candidate vesicles containing ATP, cells were preincubated with quinacrine, which has a high affinity for ATP and, when exposed to blue light, produces a concentration-dependent fluorescence (13.Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, using TIRF microscopy to visualize the submembrane space of ∼100 nm adjacent to the coverslip, demonstrates that that quinacrine visualization of cellular ATP stores is not uniform. Rather, fluorescence is detected as discrete foci 0.5–1.0 μm in diameter, which vary in intensity over a 4-fold range. When visualized in real time, these focal regions of high intensity are not static but vacillate in a Brownian manner. Further, occasional vesicles move toward the membrane and demonstrate a transient increase in fluorescence intensity followed by rapid disappearance (see supplemental Fig. S2). This transient increase in intensity is analogous to exocytosis of pancreatic secretory vesicles loaded with acridine orange (32.Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting concentration of quinacrine (and presumably ATP) within a population of vesicles and subsequent exocytic release of quinacrine/ATP into the extracellular space (Fig. 2B). Although FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 are visually similar, Fig. 1 corresponds to macroscopic visualization of extracellular ATP diffusing over ∼200 μm, and Fig. 2 detects intracellular stores packaged into discrete domains of ∼1 μm. Under basal conditions (23 °C), these release events occurred spontaneously at a rate of 0.13 ± 0.06 events/cell/min (Fig. 2C). Increases in cell volume (33% decrease in osmolality) increased the rate to 0.88 ± 0.27 events/cell/min (n = 35, p < 0.01). Moreover, increasing temperature to 35 °C increased both basal (0.73 ± 0.09 events/cell/minute) and volume-sensitive (1.48 ± 0.19 events/cell/min) responses (n = 41 for each, p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained when quinacrine-enriched vesicles were assessed using digital reconstruction of spinning disk confocal z stacks to estimate the size of the vesicular pool involved (Fig. 3A). In the example shown, the plasma membrane is shown in red (FM4-64), and vesicles are shown in green (quinacrine). Exposure to hypotonic medium decreased the total number of quinacrine-stained vesicles in responding cells by 76 ± 8% (n = 14 cells); which represented a decrease of 76 ± 6% of small (0.4–0.99-μm) and a decrease of 58 ± 8% of large (≥1-μm) vesicle populations (Fig. 3C). Similar to the point source ATP bursts described above, not all cells within a given area reacted similarly, with a loss of quinacrine vesicles, in response to the hypotonic stimulus. In confluent cell preparations, 69 ± 14% of cells responded to a hypotonic stimulus with a loss of quinacrine-labeled vesicles, as shown in this representative example (Fig. 3B). Together, these findings are compatible with previous studies demonstrating close coupling between volume-stimulated exocytosis and ATP release. Moreover, the findings suggest that the ATP-containing vesicular pool might be limited in size and subject to depletion over the time course of these studies. Loss of quinacrine-stained vesicles was not due to photobleaching because cells exposed to isotonic solution and then imaged under identical conditions did not lose fluorescence (Fig. 3C). To determine the origin of the ATP-enriched vesicles, a dual staining strategy was employed with quinacrine and FM4-64 to label endosomes (Fig. 4). Two staining protocols were utilized: (i) concurrent FM4-64 and quinacrine staining in which cells were incubated with both dyes and imaged at defined time points for up to 45 min and (ii) sequential labeling in which cells were first exposed to FM4-64 for 15–120 min and then dye was removed, followed by exposure to quinacrine and imaging at the defined time points. Utilizing these protocols, two vesicle populations were observed: endocytic vesicles due to incorporation of FM4-64-stained plasma membrane and a second pool of quinacrine-labeled vesicles that was distinct from the FM4-64 endocytic pool. No dual staining was observed within 30 min of labeling (Pearson's coefficient = 0.42) with either of the protocols. However, co-localization was observed at 45 min with 96% of the quinacrine-labeled vesicles co-localizing with the FM4-64-labeled vesicles (Pearson's coefficient = 0.85). The same staining protocol was utilized after cells were exposed to hypotonicity (33%) to determine if endosomal or rapid refilling occurs after an ATP-depleting stimulus. Once again, no dual labeling was identified until 30 min postexposure (data presented in supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Together, these studies demonstrate that the quinacrine-labeled vesicles do not co-localize with the FM4-64-labeled vesicles until after 30 min, suggesting that these vesicles may derive from a late endosomal compartment. No co-localization was observed at early time points (before 30 min), excluding rapid refilling of early endosomes as a source of the ATP-enriched compartment. Bafilomycin A1, a macrolide antibiotic, is a potent inhibitor of V-type ATPase and impairs storage of ATP in chromaffin granules and secretory vesicles in astrocytes (28.Coco S. Calegari F. Pravettoni E. Pozzi D. Taverna E. Rosa P. Matteoli M. Verderio C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1354-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with bafilomycin (4 μm × 30 min) significantly inhibited the appearance of quinacrine-stained ATP vesicles 1.12 ± 0.48 versus control 31.62 ± 3.35 vesicles/unit area (square pixels), n = 8 each, p < 0.01 (Fig. 4B, bottom). In complementary real-time measurements of ATP release, bafilomycin blocked basal (57.9 ± 9.1 ALU), mechanically stimulated (67.6 ± 11.1 ALU), and volume-stimulated (92.6 ± 17.1 ALU) ATP release versus control (219.3 ± 4.3, 251.4 ± 7.8, and 384.4 ± 9.1 ALU, respectively, n = 7 trials each, p < 0.01 (Fig. 4C)). Together, these studies demonstrate that the V-type ATPase, a necessary component of vesicle formation and trafficking, contributes to liver cell ATP release through"
https://openalex.org/W2081739769,"The kinesin-1 molecular motor contains an ATP-dependent microtubule-binding site in its N-terminal head domain and an ATP-independent microtubule-binding site in its C-terminal tail domain. Here we demonstrate that a kinesin-1 tail fragment associates with microtubules with submicromolar affinity. Binding is largely electrostatic in nature, and is facilitated by a region of basic amino acids in the tail and the acidic E-hook at the C terminus of tubulin. The tail binds to a site on tubulin that is independent of the head domain-binding site but overlaps with the binding site of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Surprisingly, the kinesin tail domain stimulates microtubule assembly and stability in a manner similar to Tau. The biological function of this strong kinesin tail-microtubule interaction remains to be seen, but it is likely to play an important role in kinesin regulation due to the close proximity of the microtubule-binding region to the conserved regulatory and cargo-binding domains of the tail."
https://openalex.org/W2006392330,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress immune activation and are critical in preventing autoimmune diseases. While the ability of Tregs to inhibit proliferation of other T cells is well established, it is not yet clear whether Tregs also modulate inflammatory cytokines during an immune response. Here, we show that the expression of inflammatory cytokine receptors IL-1R1 and TNFR2 were higher on resting mature Tregs compared to naïve or memory T cells. While upon activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), expression of IL-1R1 and TNFR2 were upregulated on all T cell subsets, IL-1R1 maintained significantly higher expression on activated Tregs as compared to other T cell subsets. The decoy receptor for IL-1 (IL-1R2) was not expressed by any of the resting T cells but was rapidly upregulated and preferentially expressed upon TCR-stimulation on Tregs. In addition, we found that Tregs also expressed high levels of mRNA for IL-1 antagonist, IL-1RA. TCR-stimulation of naïve T cells in the presence of TGFbeta, which induces FOXP3 expression, however did not result in upregulation of IL-1R1 or IL-1R2. In addition, ectopic expression of FOXP3 in non-Tregs, while causing significant upregulation of IL-1R1 and IL-1R2, did not achieve the levels seen in bona fide Tregs. We also determined that resting human Tregs expressing IL-1R1 did not have higher suppressive capacity compared to IL-1R1- Tregs, suggesting that IL-1R1 does not discriminate suppressive resting Tregs in healthy individuals. Functionally, activated human Tregs displayed a capacity to neutralize IL-1beta, which suggests a physiological significance for the expression of IL-1 decoy receptor on Tregs. In conclusion, our findings that human Tregs preferentially express receptors for TNF and IL-1 suggest a potential function in sensing and dampening local inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2044643896,"Class I myosins, which link F-actin to membrane, are largely undefined in lymphocytes. Mass spectrometric analysis of lymphocytes identified two short tail forms: (Myo1G and Myo1C) and one long tail (Myo1F). We investigated Myo1G, the most abundant in T-lymphocytes, and compared key findings with Myo1C and Myo1F. Myo1G localizes to the plasma membrane and associates in an ATP-releasable manner to the actin-containing insoluble pellet. The IQ+tail region of Myo1G (Myo1C and Myo1F) is sufficient for membrane localization, but membrane localization is augmented by the motor domain. The minimal region lacks IQ motifs but includes: 1) a PH-like domain; 2) a ""Pre-PH"" region; and 3) a ""Post-PH"" region. The Pre-PH predicted alpha helices may contribute electrostatically, because two conserved basic residues on one face are required for optimal membrane localization. Our sequence analysis characterizes the divergent PH domain family, Myo1PH, present also in long tail myosins, in eukaryotic proteins unrelated to myosins, and in a probable ancestral protein in prokaryotes. The Myo1G Myo1PH domain utilizes the classic lipid binding site for membrane association, because mutating either of two basic residues in the ""signature motif"" destroys membrane localization. Mutation of each basic residue of the Myo1G Myo1PH domain reveals another critical basic residue in the beta3 strand, which is shared only by Myo1D. Myo1G differs from Myo1C in its phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate dependence for membrane association, because membrane localization of phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase releases Myo1C from the membrane but not Myo1G. Thus Myo1PH domains likely play universal roles in myosin I membrane association, but different isoforms have diverged in their binding specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2074966638,"Background VA7 is a neurotropic alphavirus vector based on an attenuated strain of Semliki Forest virus. We have previously shown that VA7 exhibits oncolytic activity against human melanoma xenografts in immunodeficient mice. The purpose of this study was to determine if intravenously administered VA7 would be effective against human glioma. Methodology/Principal Findings In vitro, U87, U251, and A172 human glioma cells were infected and killed by VA7-EGFP. In vivo, antiglioma activity of VA7 was tested in Balb/c nude mice using U87 cells stably expressing firefly luciferase in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor models. Intravenously administered VA7-EGFP completely eradicated 100% of small and 50% of large subcutaneous U87Fluc tumors. A single intravenous injection of either VA7-EGFP or VA7 expressing Renilla luciferase (VA7-Rluc) into mice bearing orthotopic U87Fluc tumors caused a complete quenching of intracranial firefly bioluminescence and long-term survival in total 16 of 17 animals. In tumor-bearing mice injected with VA7-Rluc, transient intracranial and peripheral Renilla bioluminescence was observed. Virus was well tolerated and no damage to heart, liver, spleen, or brain was observed upon pathological assessment at three and ninety days post injection, despite detectable virus titers in these organs during the earlier time point. Conclusion VA7 vector is apathogenic and can enter and destroy brain tumors in nude mice when administered systemically. This study warrants further elucidation of the mechanism of tumor destruction and attenuation of the VA7 virus."
https://openalex.org/W2083783158,"The development of fibrosis promotes the differentiation of myofibroblasts, pro-fibrotic cells, which contribute to tissue dysfunction. Myofibroblast differentiation is dependent on actin assembly, which in response to force, is mediated by various actin-binding proteins including the mammalian Diaphanous-related formins (mDia). We examined the role of mDia in the mechano-sensing pathway that leads to force-induced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), a marker and critical determinant of myofibroblast differentiation. In cells treated with siRNA to knockdown mDia and then subjected to tensile force using collagen-coated magnetite beads attached to beta1 integrins, actin assembly was inhibited at bead contact sites. Force-induced nuclear translocation of MRTF-A, a transcriptional co-activator of SMA, was reduced 50% by mDia knockdown. The expression of the transcriptional co-activator of SMA, serum response factor, was reduced by 50% after siRNA knockdown of mDia or by 100% in cells transfected with catalytically inactive mDia. Force-induced activation of the SMA promoter and SMA expression were blocked by knockdown of siRNA of mDia. In anchored collagen gel assays to measure myofibroblast-mediated contraction, knockdown of mDia reduced contraction by 50%. We conclude that mDia plays an important role in the development of force-induced transcriptional activation of SMA and myofibroblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2118605649,"Alzheimer disease is characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and intracellular inclusions containing neurofibrillary tangles of phospho-Tau and intraneuronal Abeta associated with neuronal cell death. We generated a novel gene transfer animal model using lentiviral Abeta(1-42) that resulted in intracellular but not extracellular Abeta accumulations in the targeted rat primary motor cortex. Expression of intracellular Abeta(1-42) led to pathological changes seen in human Alzheimer disease brains, including cell death, inflammatory signs, activation of two Tau kinases, and Tau hyperphosphorylation. Promoting clearance of lentiviral Abeta(1-42) reversed these effects, demonstrating that intraneuronal Abeta(1-42) is a toxic peptide that lies upstream of Tau modification. These studies reveal the role of intracellular Abeta(1-42) in a novel gene transfer animal model, which is a useful tool to study intraneuronal Abeta(1-42)-induced pathology in the absence of extracellular plaques. Targeted delivery of Abeta will allow speedy delineation of pathological mechanisms associated with specific neurodegenerative lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2084217258,"Although metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is a DNA-damage response protein and regulates p53-dependent DNA repair, it remains unknown whether MTA1 also participates in p53-independent DNA damage response. Here, we provide evidence that MTA1 is a p53-independent transcriptional corepressor of p21(WAF1), and the underlying mechanism involves recruitment of MTA1-histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) complexes onto two selective regions of the p21(WAF1) promoter. Accordingly, MTA1 depletion, despite its effect on p53 down-regulation, superinduces p21(WAF1), increases p21(WAF1) binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and decreases the nuclear accumulation of PCNA in response to ionizing radiation. In support of a p53-independent role of MTA1 in DNA damage response, we further demonstrate that induced expression of MTA1 in p53-null cells inhibits p21(WAF1) promoter activity and p21(WAF1) binding to PCNA. Consequently, MTA1 expression in p53-null cells results in increased induction of gamma H2AX foci and DNA double strand break repair, and decreased DNA damage sensitivity following ionizing radiation treatment. These findings uncover a new target of MTA1 and the existence of an additional p53-independent role of MTA1 in DNA damage response, at least in part, by modulating the p21(WAF1)-PCNA pathway, and thus, linking two previously unconnected NuRD complex and DNA-damage response pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2005563364,"A new cis-acting element, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) binding site, within the 5'-flanking human androgen receptor (AR) promoter region and its binding transcription factor, SREBP-1, was identified to regulate AR transcription in AR-positive human prostate cancer cells. We further characterized the molecular mechanism by which a novel anti-beta2-microglobulin monoclonal antibody (beta2M mAb), shown to induce massive cell death in a number of human and mouse cancer cell lines, interrupted multiple cell signaling pathways in human prostate cancer cells. beta2M mAb decreased AR expression through inactivation of MAPK and SREBP-1. By inactivation of MAPK, beta2M mAb decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival. By inhibition of SREBP-1, beta2M mAb reduced fatty acid and lipid levels, an integral component of cell membrane, cell signaling mediators, and energy metabolism. These results provide for the first time a molecular link between the beta2M intracellular signaling axis mediated by MAPK and SREBP-1 and involving lipid signaling, which collectively regulates AR expression and function. Antagonizing beta2M by beta2M mAb may be an effective therapeutic approach simultaneously targeting multiple downstream signaling pathways converging with MAPK, SREBP-1, and AR, important for controlling prostate cancer cell growth, survival, and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2021193295,"Previous studies have shown that the combined presence of two cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) can affect the function of both enzymes, results that are consistent with the formation of heteromeric P450.P450 complexes. The goal of this study was to provide direct evidence for a physical interaction between P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and P450 2B4 (CYP2B4), by determining if the interactions required both enzymes to reside in the same lipid vesicles. When NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and a single P450 were incorporated into separate vesicles, extremely slow reduction rates were observed, demonstrating that the enzymes were anchored in the vesicles. Next, several reconstituted systems were prepared: 1) CPR.CYP1A2, 2) CPR.CYP2B4, 3) a mixture of CPR.CYP1A2 vesicles with CPR.CYP2B4 vesicles, and 4) CPR.CYP1A2.CYP2B4 in the same vesicles (ternary system). When in the ternary system, CYP2B4-mediated metabolism was significantly inhibited, and CYP1A2 activities were stimulated by the presence of the alternate P450. In contrast, P450s in separate vesicles were unable to interact. These data demonstrate that P450s must be in the same vesicles to alter metabolism. Additional evidence for a physical interaction among CPR, CYP1A2, and CYP2B4 was provided by cross-linking with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. The results showed that after cross-linking, antibody to CYP1A2 was able to co-immunoprecipitate CYP2B4 but only when both proteins were in the same phospholipid vesicles. These results clearly demonstrate that the alterations in P450 function require both P450s to be present in the same vesicles and support a mechanism whereby P450s form a physical complex in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2171123172,"Emx2 encodes for a transcription factor expressed in the embryonic intermediate mesoderm and central nervous system (CNS). It is implicated in several aspects of cerebral cortex development, including morphogenetic field specification, arealization, precursor proliferation and lamination. Four Emx2-associated antisense transcripts have been found in the urogenital system; one of them, Emx2OS, has been also detected in the adult brain. Until now, however, nothing is known about expression and function of Emx2OS in the developing CNS.By quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, we reconstructed the Emx2OS expression profile in the embryonic CNS, paying special attention to the developing cerebral cortex. Emx2OS was observed in a number of CNS structures expressing also Emx2. Within the cortex, Emx2OS was detectable in periventricular precursors, expressing the sense transcript, and peaked in newly born post-mitotic neurons not expressing such transcript. By integrating lentiviral gene delivery, RNAi, TetON technology, morpholino-mediated gene knock-down, drug-induced perturbation of gene expression, and quantitative RT-PCR, we addressed possible roles of Ex2 antisense RNA in Emx2 regulation, in primary CNS precursor cultures. We found that, in both cortical precursors and their neuronal progenies, Emx2 antisense RNA contributes to post-transcriptional down-regulation of its sense partner, possibly by a Dicer-promoted mechanism. The same RNA, when delivered to rhombo-spinal precursors, stimulates ectopic expression of Emx2, whereas Emx2 knock-out dramatically impairs Emx2OS transcription. This suggests that, within the developing CNS, a reciprocal Emx2/Emx2OS regulatory loop may normally sustain transcription at the Emx2 locus.This study shows that antisense transcripts may contribute to developmental regulation of a key transcription factor gene implicated in CNS patterning, possibly by complex and multilevel mechanisms. The activation of Emx2 by a short antisense transcript may be a prototype of a method for overexpressing single specific genes, without introducing additional copies of them into the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2033964565,"Invasive parasites are a major threat to island populations of animals. Darwin's finches of the Galápagos Islands are under attack by introduced pox virus (Poxvirus avium) and nest flies (Philornis downsi). We developed assays for parasite-specific antibody responses in Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortis), to test for relationships between adaptive immune responses to novel parasites and spatial-temporal variation in the occurrence of parasite pressure among G. fortis populations.We developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the presence of antibodies in the serum of Darwin's finches specific to pox virus or Philornis proteins. We compared antibody levels between bird populations with and without evidence of pox infection (visible lesions), and among birds sampled before nesting (prior to nest-fly exposure) versus during nesting (with fly exposure). Birds from the Pox-positive population had higher levels of pox-binding antibodies. Philornis-binding antibody levels were higher in birds sampled during nesting. Female birds, which occupy the nest, had higher Philornis-binding antibody levels than males. The study was limited by an inability to confirm pox exposure independent of obvious lesions. However, the lasting effects of pox infection (e.g., scarring and lost digits) were expected to be reliable indicators of prior pox infection.This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of parasite-specific antibody responses to multiple classes of parasites in a wild population of birds. Darwin's finches initiated acquired immune responses to novel parasites. Our study has vital implications for invasion biology and ecological immunology. The adaptive immune response of Darwin's finches may help combat the negative effects of parasitism. Alternatively, the physiological cost of mounting such a response could outweigh any benefits, accelerating population decline. Tests of the fitness implications of parasite-specific immune responses in Darwin's finches are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2085641050,"The plasma membrane assembly of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels into orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) involves interactions of AQP4 N-terminal domains. To study in live cells the site of OAP assembly, the size and dynamics of plasma membrane OAPs, and the heterotetrameric associations of AQP4, we constructed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled AQP4 ""long"" (M1) and ""short"" (M23) isoforms in which GFP was inserted at the cytoplasm-facing N or C terminus or between Val-141 and Val-142 in the second extracellular loop of AQP4. The C-terminal and extracellular loop GFP insertions did not interfere with the rapid unrestricted membrane diffusion of GFP-labeled M1 or the restricted diffusion and OAP assembly of GFP-labeled M23. Photobleaching of brefeldin A-treated cells showed comparable and minimally restricted diffusion of M1 and M23, indicating that OAP assembly occurs post-endoplasmic reticulum. Single-molecule step photobleaching and intensity analysis of GFP-labeled M1 in the absence versus presence of excess unlabeled M1 or M23 with an OAP-disrupting mutation indicated heterotetrameric AQP4 association. Time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence imaging of M23 in live cells at 37 degrees C indicated that OAPs diffuse slowly (D approximately 10(-12) cm(2)/s) and rearrange over tens of minutes. Our biophysical measurements in live cells thus reveal extensive AQP4 monomer-monomer and tetramer-tetramer interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2016564173,"Background Klebsiella pneumoniae is a clinically significant species of bacterium which causes a variety of diseases. Clinical treatment of this bacterial infection is greatly hindered by the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. The resistance is largely due to the acquisition of plasmids carrying drug-resistant as well as pathogenic genes, and its conjugal transfer facilitates the spread of resistant phenotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings The 70,057 bp plasmid pKF3-70, commonly found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, is composed of five main functional modules, including regions involved in replication, partition, conjugation, transfer leading, and variable regions. This plasmid is more similar to several Escherichia coli plasmids than any previously reported K. pneumoniae plasmids and pKF3-70 like plasmids share a common and conserved backbone sequence. The replication system of the pKF3-70 is 100% identical to that of RepFII plasmid R100 from E. coli. A beta-lactamase gene ctx-m-14 with its surrounding insertion elements (ISEcp1, truncated IS903 and a 20 bp inverted repeat sequence) may compose an active transposon which is directly bordered by two putative target repeats “ATTAC.” Conclusions/Significance The K. pneumoniae plasmid pKF3-70 carries an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene, ctx-m-14. The conjugative characteristic makes it a widespread plasmid among genetically relevant genera which poses significant threat to public health."
https://openalex.org/W2072494953,"A major goal for the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with cytotoxic therapies is the induction of long-term remission. There is, however, a paucity of information concerning the effects of these therapies on the reconstituting B cell repertoire. Since there is recent evidence suggesting that B cell lymphopenia might attenuate negative selection of autoreactive B cells, we elected to investigate the effects of cyclophosphamide on the selection of the re-emerging B cell repertoire in wild type mice and transgenic mice that express the H chain of an anti-DNA antibody. The reconstituting B cell repertoire in wild type mice contained an increased frequency of DNA-reactive B cells; in heavy chain transgenic mice, the reconstituting repertoire was characterized by an increased frequency of mature, high affinity DNA-reactive B cells and the mice expressed increased levels of serum anti-DNA antibodies. This coincided with a significant increase in serum levels of BAFF. Treatment of transgene-expressing mice with a BAFF blocking agent or with DNase to reduce exposure to autoantigen limited the expansion of high affinity DNA-reactive B cells during B cell reconstitution. These studies suggest that during B cell reconstitution, not only is negative selection of high affinity DNA-reactive B cells impaired by increased BAFF, but also that B cells escaping negative selection are positively selected by autoantigen. There are significant implications for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2087067720,"The Arp2/3 complex is a conserved seven-subunit actin-nucleating machine activated by WASp (Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein). Despite its central importance in a broad range of cellular processes, many critical aspects of the mechanism of the Arp2/3 complex have yet to be resolved. In particular, some of the individual subunits in the complex have not been assigned clear functional roles, including p40/ARPC1. Here, we dissected the structure and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae p40/ARPC1, which is encoded by the essential ARC40 gene, by analyzing 39 integrated alleles that target its conserved surfaces. We identified three distinct sites on p40/ARPC1 required for function in vivo: one site contacts p19/ARPC4, one contacts p15/ARPC5, and one site resides in an extended structural ""arm"" of p40/ARPC1. Using a novel strategy, we purified the corresponding lethal mutant Arp2/3 complexes from yeast and compared their actin nucleation activities. Lethal mutations at the contact with p19/ARPC4 specifically impaired WASp-induced nucleation. In contrast, lethal mutations at the contact with p15/ARPC5 led to unregulated (""leaky"") nucleation in the absence of WASp. Lethal mutations in the extended arm drastically reduced nucleation, and the same mutations disrupted the ability of the purified p40/ARPC1 arm domain to bind the VCA domain of WASp. Together, these data indicate that p40/ARPC1 performs at least three distinct, essential functions in regulating Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly: 1) suppression of spontaneous nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex, which requires proper contacts with p15/ARPC5; 2) propagation of WASp activation signals via contacts with p19/ARPC2; and 3) direct facilitation of actin nucleation through interactions of the extended arm with the VCA domain of WASp."
https://openalex.org/W2083703191,"ClpS is an adaptor protein that interacts with ClpA and promotes degradation of proteins with N-end rule degradation motifs (N-degrons) by ClpAP while blocking degradation of substrates with other motifs. Although monomeric ClpS forms a 1:1 complex with an isolated N-domain of ClpA, only one molecule of ClpS binds with high affinity to ClpA hexamers (ClpA6). One or two additional molecules per hexamer bind with lower affinity. Tightly bound ClpS dissociates slowly from ClpA6 with a t½ of ∼3 min at 37 °C. Maximum activation of degradation of the N-end rule substrate, LR-GFPVenus, occurs with a single ClpS bound per ClpA6; one ClpS is also sufficient to inhibit degradation of proteins without N-degrons. ClpS competitively inhibits degradation of unfolded substrates that interact with ClpA N-domains and is a non-competitive inhibitor with substrates that depend on internal binding sites in ClpA. ClpS inhibition of substrate binding is dependent on the order of addition. When added first, ClpS blocks binding of both high and low affinity substrates; however, when substrates first form committed complexes with ClpA6, ClpS cannot displace them or block their degradation by ClpP. We propose that the first molecule of ClpS binds to the N-domain and to an additional functional binding site, sterically blocking binding of non-N-end rule substrates as well as additional ClpS molecules to ClpA6.

ClpA and ClpX, the regulatory components of the ATP-dependent ClpAP and ClpXP proteases, are members of the Clp/Hsp100 family of molecular chaperones, which play important roles in protein quality control and regulatory protein degradation (1.Schirmer E.C.

Specific proteins targeted for regulatory unfolding or degradation are recognized by virtue of sequence or structural motifs located in accessible regions near their amino or carboxyl termini. Clp chaperones can also target aberrant or altered forms of virtually any cellular protein either through weak interaction with unfolded regions of the protein or by more specific recognition of motifs that become exposed in the protein or are added to the protein as degradation tags by other enzymatic systems. The specific motifs or degradation tags are either directly recognized by sites in ClpA or ClpX or recognized by one of several adaptor proteins that associate with ClpA or ClpX, and, in some instances, different parts of the tag can be recognized by the chaperone and the adaptor (3.Levchenko I.

Among the substrates for ClpAP in Escherichia coli are proteins degraded by the N-end rule pathway (6.Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The N-end rule relates the stability of a protein to its N-terminal residue. A destabilizing N-terminal residue is referred to as an N-degron (7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1991; 64: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) when it is recognized by a component of a degradative system and is sufficient to target the protein for degradation. In E. coli, the N-degrons include phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and leucine (6.Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Arginine and lysine serve as secondary destabilizing residues, because proteins with these residues at the N terminus are modified by Leu/Phe-tRNA protein transferase to generate an N-degron by post-translational attachment of phenylalanine or leucine (8.Shrader T.E. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9.Ninnis R.L. Spall S.K. Talbo G.H. Truscott K.N. Dougan D.A. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1732-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Destabilizing residues are usually not found at the N terminus of newly synthesized proteins in vivo, because protein biosynthesis usually begins with methionine, and the N-terminal methionine is not removed by methionine aminopeptidase when one of these residues is in the second position (10.Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Initially, components of the N-end rule pathway in E. coli were identified using proteins engineered to display N-degrons (6.Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A.

In at least one case, an aminopeptidase generates a protein with an N-degron that is degraded by ClpAP (9.Ninnis R.L. Spall S.K. Talbo G.H. Truscott K.N. Dougan D.A.

EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms by which N-end rule substrates are formed and the frequency with which they occur are largely unknown. In E. coli, proteins with N-degrons are recognized by a small protein, ClpS, which binds the N-degron and delivers the protein to ClpAP (5.Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).

Peptides with Phe, Tyr, Trp, or Leu at the N terminus bind to ClpS, and similar peptides with other N-terminal residues bind with substantially lower affinity (5.Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T.

The crystal structure of ClpS with a bound peptide bearing an N-degron shows the hydrophobic side chain of the N-degron pointing into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ClpS and the α-amino group of the peptide forming an ion pair with an acidic residue on the rim of the hydrophobic pocket (12.Schuenemann V.J.

Details of how ClpS interacts with the ClpAP holoenzyme complex and performs its functions are not well understood. The holoenzyme complex of ClpAP is a barrel-like complex. The center has two heptameric rings of ClpP subunits stacked face to face. The ClpP rings are flanked on either side by axially aligned hexameric rings of ClpA (17.Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18.Beuron F. Maurizi M.R. Belnap D.M. Kocsis E. Booy F.P. Kessel M. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ATP binding to ClpA is required to stabilize the ClpA hexamers and to maintain the ClpAP complex. ClpA subunits contain three tandem domains: an N-domain and two non-identical ATPase domains (NBD1 and NBD2) (19.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the ClpA hexamer, NBD1 and NBD2 form separate homomeric rings superimposed on each other. The NBD2 ring makes the contact with ClpP, whereas NBD1 forms the distal ring. The N-domain folds independently and is connected to NBD1 by a flexible linker (19.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies suggest that the N-domains are mobile and occupy multiple positions above surface of the NBD1 ring (20.Ishikawa T. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The N-domain binds unfolded proteins, which serves to recruit substrates to NBD1 and to slow the release of proteins unfolded by ClpA. The N-domain also binds ClpS. Substrates bound to the N-domain or to ClpS are handed off to the ATPase domains, unfolded, and translocated via an axial pathway into ClpP. Both ClpS and the isolated ClpA N-domain are monomers and form a tight 1:1 complex when mixed in vitro (15.Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21.Zeth K. Ravelli R.B. Paal K. Cusack S. Bukau B. Dougan D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, up to six molecules of ClpS might be expected to bind to assembled ClpA hexamers. The binding of multiple molecules of an adaptor and its substrate cargo raises a question as to the efficiency of substrate delivery and processing by hexameric ClpA. The ClpA axial channel appears too narrow to allow translocation of more than one protein at a time, which suggests that a mechanism to limit the binding or transfer of bound substrate to the unfolding and translocation apparatus would be needed to prevent steric clashes between multiple bound substrates and to improve overall efficiency. In fact, several observations suggest that the geometry of interaction of ClpS with assembled ClpA or structural changes subsequent to binding might affect the binding stoichiometry and activity. In the crystal, the mobile N-terminal 17 amino acids of ClpS (ClpS-N1–17) extend out from the complex, and residues 3–8 interact with another ClpA N-domain. ClpS-N1–17 is not needed for binding to N-domains but is required for inhibition of activity against substrates, such as SsrA-tagged proteins (15.Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ClpS-N1–17 is also needed for activation of N-end rule degradation (22.Hou J.Y. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that ClpS-N1–17 interacts within or near the axial channel of ClpA. To learn more about the interaction of ClpS with ClpA and the mechanisms by which it affects ClpA activity, we investigated whether ClpS can bind to all six N-domains in a ClpA hexamer and how many ClpS molecules are needed for optimal activation or inhibition of protein degradation. Here we show that one molecule of ClpS binds to a ClpA hexamer with high affinity and that only one ClpS molecule is required for maximum stimulation or inhibition of degradation. We propose that ClpS allosterically affects the structure of ClpA hexamers and reorganizes the N-domains to reduce the number of ClpS molecules that can bind. ClpA, ClpP, and ClpS were expressed and purified as described (15.Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol.

To clone the SUMO-LR-GFPVenus fusion protein, we first amplified the GFPVenus coding region in plasmid pVenus-N1-NPY (28.Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat.

After suspension in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, with 10% (v/v) glycerol, the thawed cells were lysed by a single pass through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 60 min, and the clear supernatant solution was passed over a 10-ml bed of Talon metal chelate affinity resin. After washing the column with 5 column volumes of buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 10 aliquots of 2 ml each of 0.2 m imidazole in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, with 10% (v/v) glycerol. Fractions with the SUMO-LR-GFPVenus fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer without imidazole. The fusion protein was cleaved with 50 μg of SUMO hydrolase (29.Levine R.L. Federici M.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) per mg of SUMO-LR-GFPVenus by incubation for 6 h at 4 °C.

[3H]ClpS was prepared by reductive methylation. [3H]formaldehyde (350 μCi; 5 μmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to 1 mg of purified ClpS in 0.2 ml of 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 20 mm NaCNBH3. The mixture was placed on ice for 16 h. The protein was precipitated with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, and desalted by passing over a 2-ml column of Sephadex G25 (Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer. [3H]RepA was prepared by a similar procedure. Protein concentrations were measured by absorbance using either experimentally determined absorption coefficients (23.Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29.Levine R.L. Federici M.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or absorption coefficients calculated from the aromatic amino acid content using the Pepstats program (available on the World Wide Web). For routine assays or in the presence of substances that interfere with absorbance measurements, a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) was used after calibration with known stock solutions of the particular protein. Protein concentrations are expressed in molar units of the native solution structure of the protein: hexamers of ClpA, tetradecamers of ClpP, monomers of ClpS or isolated ClpA-N-domain, and so on. Fluorescence measurements for LR-GFPVenus were made using an Aminco Bowman spectrofluorometer with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 528 nm (2–4-nm bandwidth). For GFP-SsrA fluorescence measurements, excitation was at 394 nm and emission was at 509 nm with a 2-nm bandwidth. Degradation of radioactively labeled proteins was measured by release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts as described previously (23.Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). LR-GFPVenus degradation was determined in a continuous assay by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence in an assay solution containing excess ClpP (30 μg) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2–4 mm ATP, and varying concentrations of ClpA, ClpS, and the substrate. GFP-SsrA degradation was assayed under similar conditions without ClpS. The peptides, YLFVQ, LRKGE, MYLFVQ, SLRKGE, and MLRKGE, were obtained from Biomatik Corp. USA, LLC (Wilmington, DE). The peptide, FKTA, was synthesized in house from FMOC-amino acids on an ABI431 peptide synthesizer following standard procedures and purified by reverse phase chromatography (HPLC). Peptide purity was confirmed by HPLC and mass spectroscopic analysis; all peptides had free amino and carboxyl termini. Peptides were dissolved in water for use. To measure inhibition of LR-GFPVenus degradation, peptides were added to assay solutions prior to the addition of ClpA to initiate the reaction. Binding measurements were made by titration calorimetry using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal). ClpA hexamers were assembled in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol with 25 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATPγS. [3H]ClpS was added, and, after 5 min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged through a Microcon100 ultrafiltration membrane. To avoid excessive concentration of the ClpA during ultrafiltration and to minimize dissociation of the complex, centrifugation time was limited to 30 s to allow less than half of the solution to pass through the membrane. The filtrate was collected and counted, and the amount of [3H]ClpS bound was calculated from the decrease in counts between the filtrate and an equivalent volume of the mixture before filtration. Analytical gel filtration was performed at room temperature using a Superdex200 or Superdex75 column (3 mm × 25 cm) (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were run in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol at a flow rate of 0.04–0.08 ml/min. ATPγS (1 mm) and MgCl2 (20 mm) were added to buffers as required for specific experiments. Protein absorbance was monitored at 235 and 280 nm in the absence of nucleotide and at 295 nm when nucleotide was present. When needed, fractions were collected manually at 1-min intervals. SDS-PAGE was performed using precast Novex 4–20% polyacrylamide gels in the BisTris/MES buffer system as described by the manufacturer. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. To quantitate proteins in gel filtration fractions, equal aliquots were run in each lane, digital images of the gels were recorded, and the intensities of the stained protein bands were measured using NIH Image software. To compare the distribution of ClpS in different experiments, the ClpS intensities in the fractions within a given run were summed and normalized to the amount of ClpS loaded on the column. Based on the reported specificity of ClpS in targeting proteins for degradation by ClpAP, we constructed the substrate, LR-GFPVenus, which has an N-terminal leucine followed by arginine. LR-GFPVenus was degraded by ClpAP in the presence of ClpS but was not degraded in the absence of ClpS (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm the importance of the N-terminal amino acid in allowing ClpS to target LR-GFPVenus to ClpAP, we synthesized several peptides with N-degrons and determined their ability to bind to ClpS and inhibit degradation of LR-GFPVenus. The peptides, LRKGE and FKTA, displayed monotonic binding isotherms with one molecule of peptide bound per ClpS (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The Kd for binding was 3.0 μm for LRKGE and 3.5 μm for FKTA. Virtually identical data were obtained for binding of the peptides to the heterodimeric complex of ClpS and isolated ClpA N-domain (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D). Variants of the peptides with N-terminal serine or methionine residues (SLRKGE, MLRKGE, and MYVLVQ) showed no evidence of binding at concentrations of ≤30 μm (data not shown).TABLE 1Effects of ClpS and peptides with N-degrons on protein degradation by ClpAPAdditionActivityKa (or Kd)Kiμmol/min/μmol ClpA6μmμmDegradation of LR-GFPVenus by ClpAPa0.4 μm ClpA6 and 1.0 μm ClpP14 were present in standard assay mixture with 11 μm LR-GFPVenus (see “Materials and Methods”).

Open table in a new tab When added at saturating levels, LRKGE, FKTA, and YVLVQ completely inhibited ClpS-mediated degradation of LR-GFPVenus by ClpAP (Table 1); half-maximal inhibition occurred at ∼1 μm peptide (Table 1), consistent with the dissociation constants measured by direct binding. None of the peptides inhibited degradation of the non-N-end rule substrate, GFP-SsrA, by ClpAP (Table 1). Peptide variants with N-terminal serine or methionine residues had no inhibitory activity in either assay at concentrations up to 30 μm. We conclude that degradation of LR-GFPVenus by ClpAP is dependent on recognition of the N-degron by ClpS. If ClpS binds to the N-domains in ClpA6 in the same manner as it binds to the isolated N-domain, each hexamer of ClpA could bind up to six ClpS monomers. However, neither the substrate saturation curve for LR-GFPVenus nor the peptide inhibition curves gave indications of multiple binding sites (supplemental Fig. S1). To address the question of how many ClpS molecules bind to assembled ClpA hexamers and are required for activity, we measured binding of ClpS to ClpA6 and then determined the binding stoichiometry needed for expression of ClpS activities. To isolate tightly binding complexes of ClpS and ClpA6, we initially assembled ClpA6 in the presence of ATPγS, incubated it with increasing amounts of ClpS, and passed the mixtures over a gel filtration column under conditions in which ClpA remained hexameric. When one equivalent of ClpS was added per ClpA6 (Fig. 1A, circles), essentially all of the ClpS co-migrated with ClpA6, indicating that the complex was very stable. When 2 eq of ClpS were added (Fig. 1A, triangles), only about two-thirds of the ClpS remained bound to ClpA6, and a significant amount was found as free ClpS. The addition of more than 3 eq of ClpS (Fig. 1A, squares) did not increase the amount of ClpS bound to ClpA6, and the excess ClpS migrated as the unbound protein. These data suggested that only 1–2 molecules of ClpS bind tightly enough to ClpA6 to remain bound during gel filtration, and any additional molecules that bind do so with lower affinity and dissociate during gel filtration. To quantitate binding between ClpS and ClpA6 directly, we measured [3H]ClpS bound to ClpA6 following ultrafiltration through 30,000 Mr cut-off membranes. To minimize dissociation of the complex, the samples were centrifuged for only 30 s. A Scatchard plot of the binding data is shown in Fig. 1B. Binding was biphasic, indicating more than one binding interaction. Extrapolation of the steep portion of the line to the abscissa showed that ∼1 molecule of ClpS per ClpA6 was bound with high affinity, and the Kd, obtained from the slope of the line, was ∼40 nm. The slope of the shallower portion of the line indicates the presence of weaker binding sites with Kd of >700 nm. Extrapolation of this segment to the axis indicated two or more additional ClpS molecules bound, but the exact number of ClpS molecules binding with low affinity cannot be determined by this method, because rapid dissociation prevents retention of some of the weakly bound species. These data indicate that the mode of binding of the first molecule of ClpS to ClpA6 differs from the binding of subsequent molecules. The N-terminal portion of ClpS (residues 1–17) is an extended, mobile polypeptide that is important for inhibitory activity (15.Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2100256774,"In species across taxa, offspring have means to influence parental investment (PI). PI thus evolves as an interacting phenotype and indirect genetic effects may strongly affect the co-evolutionary dynamics of offspring and parental behaviors. Evolutionary theory focused on explaining how exaggerated offspring solicitation can be understood as resolution of parent-offspring conflict, but the evolutionary origin and diversification of different forms of family interactions remains unclear.In contrast to previous theory that largely uses a static approach to predict how ""offspring individuals"" and ""parental individuals"" should interact given conflict over PI, we present a dynamic theoretical framework of antagonistic selection on the PI individuals obtain/take as offspring and the PI they provide as parents to maximize individual lifetime reproductive success; we analyze a deterministic and a stochastic version of this dynamic framework. We show that a zone for equivalent co-adaptation outcomes exists in which stable levels of PI can evolve and be maintained despite fast strategy transitions and ongoing co-evolutionary dynamics. Under antagonistic co-adaptation, cost-free solicitation can evolve as an adaptation to emerging preferences in parents.We show that antagonistic selection across the offspring and parental life-stage of individuals favors co-adapted offspring and parental behavior within a zone of equivalent outcomes. This antagonistic parent-offspring co-adaptation does not require solicitation to be costly, allows for rapid divergence and evolutionary novelty and potentially explains the origin and diversification of the observed provisioning forms in family life."

Coronin7 proteins are characterized by two WD-repeat domains that presumably fold into two β-propeller structures. DdCRN7 shares highest homology with human CRN7, a protein with roles in membrane trafficking. DdCRN7 is present in the cytosol and accumulates in cell surface projections during movement and phago- and pinocytosis. Cells lacking CRN7 have altered chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Furthermore, loss of CRN7 affects the infection process by the pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> and allows a more efficient internalization of bacteria. To provide a mechanism for CNR7 action, we studied actin-related aspects. We could show that CRN7 binds directly to F-actin and protects actin filaments from depolymerization. CRN7 also associated with F-actin <i>in vivo</i>. It was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton, colocalized with F-actin, and its distribution was sensitive to drugs affecting the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that the CRN7 role in chemotaxis and phagocytosis is through its effect on the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1977802366,"During seed germination, beta-conglutin undergoes a major cycle of limited proteolysis in which many of its constituent subunits are processed into a 20 kDa polypeptide termed blad. Blad is the main component of a glycooligomer, accumulating exclusively in the cotyledons of Lupinus species, between days 4 and 12 after the onset of germination.The sequence of the gene encoding beta-conglutin precursor (1791 nucleotides) is reported. This gene, which shares 44 to 57% similarity and 20 to 37% identity with other vicilin-like protein genes, includes several features in common with these globulins, but also specific hallmarks. Most notable is the presence of an ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM), which possibly links the unique catabolic route of beta-conglutin to the ubiquitin/proteasome proteolytic pathway.Blad forms through a unique route from and is a stable intermediary product of its precursor, beta-conglutin, the major Lupinus seed storage protein. It is composed of 173 amino acid residues, is encoded by an intron-containing, internal fragment of the gene that codes for beta-conglutin precursor (nucleotides 394 to 913) and exhibits an isoelectric point of 9.6 and a molecular mass of 20,404.85 Da. Consistent with its role as a storage protein, blad contains an extremely high proportion of the nitrogen-rich amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2065326277,"L-type calcium currents (I(Ca)) are influenced by changes in extracellular chloride, but sites of anion effects have not been identified. Our experiments showed that CaV1.2 currents expressed in HEK293 cells are strongly inhibited by replacing extracellular chloride with gluconate or perchlorate. Variance-mean analysis of I(Ca) and cell-attached patch single channel recordings indicate that gluconate-induced inhibition is due to intracellular anion effects on Ca(2+) channel open probability, not conductance. Inhibition of CaV1.2 currents produced by replacing chloride with gluconate was reduced from approximately 75%-80% to approximately 50% by omitting beta subunits but unaffected by omitting alpha(2)delta subunits. Similarly, gluconate inhibition was reduced to approximately 50% by deleting an alpha1 subunit N-terminal region of 15 residues critical for beta subunit interactions regulating open probability. Omitting beta subunits with this mutant alpha1 subunit did not further diminish inhibition. Gluconate inhibition was unchanged with expression of different beta subunits. Truncating the C terminus at AA1665 reduced gluconate inhibition from approximately 75%-80% to approximately 50% whereas truncating it at AA1700 had no effect. Neutralizing arginines at AA1696 and 1697 by replacement with glutamines reduced gluconate inhibition to approximately 60% indicating these residues are particularly important for anion effects. Expressing CaV1.2 channels that lacked both N and C termini reduced gluconate inhibition to approximately 25% consistent with additive interactions between the two tail regions. Our results suggest that modest changes in intracellular anion concentration can produce significant effects on CaV1.2 currents mediated by changes in channel open probability involving beta subunit interactions with the N terminus and a short C terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1996352484,"ODE simulations of chemical systems perform poorly when some of the species have extremely low concentrations. Stochastic simulation methods, which can handle this case, have been impractical for large systems due to computational complexity. We observe, however, that when modeling complex biological systems: (1) a small number of reactions tend to occur a disproportionately large percentage of the time, and (2) a small number of species tend to participate in a disproportionately large percentage of reactions. We exploit these properties in LOLCAT Method, a new implementation of the Gillespie Algorithm. First, factoring reaction propensities allows many propensities dependent on a single species to be updated in a single operation. Second, representing dependencies between reactions with a bipartite graph of reactions and species requires only storage for reactions, rather than the required for a graph that includes only reactions. Together, these improvements allow our implementation of LOLCAT Method to execute orders of magnitude faster than currently existing Gillespie Algorithm variants when simulating several yeast MAPK cascade models."

The recombinant antibody fragment frequently retains antigen-recognizing capability rivaling that of the parent antibody. Moreover, an scFv library, which could contain more than one billion scFv variants, can be propagated with an Escherichia coli vector of bacterial phage origin (12.McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D.

One shortcoming of the scFv scaffold that frequently hampers the applications of this powerful technology is the aggregation tendency of the scFv molecules under physiological and storage conditions (for reviews see Refs. 16.Raag R. Whitlow M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17.Reiter Y. Brinkmann U. Lee B. Pastan I. Nat.

The aggregation mechanism has much to do with the stability of the two variable domains and the dimeric interface (20.Röthlisberger D. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 773-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), any nonoptimal interactions within or between the two variable domains could result in unstable dimeric interface and dissociation of the two variable domains in the scFv. The variable domain dissociation has two molecular consequences as follows. First, the variable domains are less stable in isolation and could unfold. Second, the transiently dissociated variable domains could re-associate with supplementary domains from other scFv polypeptide chains, forming higher order complexes composed of more than one polypeptide chain (16.Raag R. Whitlow M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both situations lead to insoluble aggregates or meta-stable structures. The instability of the scFv structure also compromises the fidelity in reproducing the antibody gene products on the phage surface. This could cause biases in favor of more stable scFv molecules over the less stable ones, in selecting misfolded structures on phage surfaces but nevertheless binding to the antigen (21.Brinkmann U. Chowdhury P.S. Roscoe D.M. Pastan I. J. Immunol.

This structural instability has thus impacted negatively on the utilities of scFv, leading to uncertainties to the outcomes of the selected and screened scFv molecules in terms of their potential applications in biomedicine. Although the misfolding tendency of scFv has been potentially problematic, the uncertainties because of the intrinsic stability properties of the scFv in phage display remain uncharacterized. A more robust scFv phage display system without the uncertainties due to scFv misfolding would provide an alternative circumventing the downside of the conventional scFv phage display systems. One way to stabilize the scFv scaffold is to engineer a disulfide bond between the two Fv domains, so that the variable domains can be covalently linked with a disulfide bond. Single chain disulfide-stabilized Fv fragment (sc-dsFv) format has been constructed in a single polypeptide chain, as in scFv, with a disulfide bond linking the two variable domains in the framework region (22.Young N.M.

The advantages of the sc-dsFv molecules have been demonstrated with the sc-dsFv expressed in E. coli (22.Young N.M. MacKenzie C.R. Narang S.A. Oomen R.P. Baenziger J.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23.Rajagopal V. Pastan I. Kreitman R.J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24.Wörn A. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8739-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). But the single chain disulfide-stabilized Fv fragments have not been expressed on phage surface or as soluble form secreted by E. coli in the culture medium, mostly due to severely decreased yield because of the introduction of the interface cysteines (19.Wörn A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 989-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22.Young N.M. MacKenzie C.R. Narang S.A. Oomen R.P. Baenziger J.E.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8739-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and phage-displayed sc-dsFv libraries and their applications have not been established. In this work, an sc-dsFv phage display platform has been developed. The key discovery is that the signal sequence variants of the sc-dsFv-pIII fusion protein have varying effects in directing the sc-dsFv expression on the recombinant phage surface. The signal sequence has been known to be responsible for the Sec system-dependent translocation of the pIII fusion protein from the translation site in the cytoplasm to the periplasm membrane (25.Thie H. Schirrmann T. Paschke M. Dubel S. Hust M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 25: 49-54Google Scholar, 26.Clérico E.M. Maki J.L. Gierasch L.M.

Microbiol. 2001; 152: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a critical process for the integration of the displayed protein on the recombinant phage surface (32.Rapoza M.P. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1856-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But the optimal signal sequences for the translocation of the pIII fusion protein were not known. We used biological combinatorial strategies to diversify the signal sequence with synthetic phage display libraries. The variants in the phage libraries were selected and screened for high expression capabilities (31.Jestin J.L. Volioti G. Winter G. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The results indicated that the sequence of the signal peptidase cleavage site (c-region) in the signal peptide amino-terminal to the pIII fusion protein is more critically responsible for the expression of the phage-displayed fusion protein. This finding enabled success in increasing the expression of functional anti-VEGF sc-dsFv on M13 phage surface by up to 2 orders of magnitude compared with the expression efficiency due to the wild-type signal sequence. The interface disulfide bond of the phage-displayed sc-dsFv was largely formed, and the binding affinity against VEGF was substantially enhanced. More importantly, synthetic sc-dsFv libraries were expressed successfully on the M13 phage surface with one of the optimum signal sequences, and a large number of the binding sc-dsFv variants against VEGF were compared with the binding scFv variants to assess the effects of the interdomain disulfide bond on the binding sequence preferences of the scFv or the sc-dsFv molecules. This work demonstrates a new antibody display platform with all the benefits from the scFv format but without the drawbacks due to the instability of the scFv structure. The sequence of the template scFv was derived from G6 anti-VEGF Fab (Protein Data Bank code 2FJG (33.Fuh G. Wu P. Liang W.C. Ultsch M. Lee C.V. Moffat B. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6625-6631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). The construct starts from amino terminus with a hexa-His tag (His)6GH, followed by the Vκ1 light chain variable domain, and then the VH3 heavy chain variable domain. The two variable domains are connected with a linker polypeptide, (G)4SIEGRS(G)4S (for anti-VEGF scFv(fXa+) construct) or (G)4S(G)4S(G)4S (for anti-VEGF scFv(fXa−) construct), where IEGR is the factor Xa (fXa) cutting site. A knowledge-based computer program is available in scanning sequences for tentative fXa cleavage sites in a protein sequence (34.Chen C.T. Yang E.W. Hsu H.J. Sun Y.K. Hsu W.L. Yang A.S. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2691-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); any possible cleavage sites other than the engineered site could interfere with the fXa-based assay and should be avoided in designing the phage-displayed protein sequence. The sequence of the template scFv is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. The software DNAWorks (helixweb.nih.gov) (35.Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) was used to optimize the DNA sequence for optimum expression in E. coli and to design a total of 30 overlapping DNA fragments (45 bases each from Integrated DNA Technologies) encoding the sequence of the template scFv. These oligonucleotide fragments were synthesized and ligated with PCR in three stages. Due to the large number of the DNA fragments, it was successful only when the fragments were ligated separately in three groups (a01–a10, a11–a20, and a21–a30, see supplemental Fig. 1B) in the first stage. Each 50-μl PCR contains 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 2 μl of 25 mm MgSO4, 1 μl of 50× dNTP mix, 1 μl of 50× high fidelity KOD hot start polymerase Mix (Novagen), and 0.5 μl from each of the 10 μm DNA fragments in water. After hot start for 5 min at 95 °C, 35 PCR cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 25 s) were carried out for each of the three reactions. In the second stage, 5 μl of each of the PCR product mixtures was mixed with respective end fragments (2 μl, 100 μm) into a 50-μl PCR mixture as described above. The same PCR protocol was applied to each of the three reaction mixtures. 10 μl from each of the reaction mixtures were pooled, and the DNA products were extracted with the gel extraction kit from Qiagen. In the third stage, the extracted DNA products were mixed together with the end fragments, i.e. 1st and the 30th DNA fragment (0.5 μl, 10 μm), in a 50-μl PCR mixture, followed by the PCR procedure as described before. The PCR product was purified from excised gel slabs with the gel extraction kit from Qiagen. The agarose gel electrophoresis of the DNA products from the three PCR stages is shown in supplemental Fig. 2. The sequence of the DNA product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The purified PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes NotI and SfiI (New England Biolabs). The digested DNA (788 bases) was purified with agarose gel electrophoresis and the gel extraction kit from Qiagen. The phagemid pCANTAB5E (GE Healthcare), digested with the same restriction enzymes NotI and SfiI, was purified with agarose gel electrophoresis and incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) (1.5 units/μg of DNA) in buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. The 5′-dephosphorylated linear vector was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in pure water. 2 μg of the purified linear vector was mixed with the digested PCR product (vector/insert = 1:2 to 1:5 in molar ratio) in the presence of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in buffer overnight at 16 °C. The ligation reaction product was examined with agarose gel electrophoresis, as shown in supplemental Fig. 3. The ligation reaction product was purified with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The construct of the pCANTAB5E phagemid encoded the scFv, followed by an E-tag sequence and a TAG amber stop codon amino-terminal to the gene III sequence. The E-tag is a marker for the expression of the scFv. The DNA product, dissolved in pure water, was electroporated into an electrocompetent E. coli strain ER2738 (New England Biolabs). The transformed E. coli was plated on LB-ampicillin agar plate overnight. Single colonies were picked, and the insert in the phagemid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant phage particles were rescued from the E. coli culture by super-infecting the E. coli with the helper phage M13KO7 (GE Healthcare), precipitated with polyethylene glycol/NaCl, and resuspended in PBS. Human VEGF-121 (VEGF-A residues 34–135 receptor binding domain) (33.Fuh G. Wu P. Liang W.C. Ultsch M. Lee C.V. Moffat B. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6625-6631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was expressed in E. coli as inclusion body; refolding and purification followed the procedure published recently (36.Chang H.J. Hsu H.J. Chang C.F. Peng H.P. Sun Y.K. Yu H.M. Shih H.C. Song C.Y. Lin Y.T. Chen C.C. Wang C.H. Yang A.S. Structure. 2009; 17: 620-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Multiple competition curves with various concentrations of immobilized and free VEGF competing for anti-VEGF scFv binding were determined to estimate the EC50 values (the concentration of free VEGF resulting in 50% reduction in binding of the phage-displayed scFv to immobilized VEGF) at the lowest immobilized VEGF concentration (37.DeLano W.L. Cunningham B.C. Clackson T. Lowman H.B. Phage Display. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2004: 85-94Google Scholar). Wells in the first column of a Maxisorb (Nunc) 96-well plate were coated with human VEGF-A, 2 μg/100 μl. The following wells of the nth column in the plate were coated with (0.25n−1) × 2 μg/100 μl VEGF. After overnight coating at room temperature, the plate was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20) for 3 h. The plate was washed three times with PBST and two times with PBS. Recombinant phage displaying the anti-VEGF scFv (109 cfu/50 μl) was mixed with free VEGF (10 μg/50 μl in PBS) and 5% skim milk (50 μl in PBST) in the wells of the first row of the plate; the following wells of the mth row contained the same recombinant phage and skim milk solution, but the VEGF was diluted 10-fold in series, i.e. (0.1m−1) ×10 μg/50 μl for wells in the mth row. The plate was allowed to equilibrate for 7 h at room temperature, washed with 3× PBST and 2× PBS, added anti-M13 antibody was conjugated with HRP (GE Healthcare) for 1 h, washed again with 3× PBST and 2× PBS, and then developed with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) for 30 min before adding 1% SDS to stop the reaction. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured, and the data were used for EC50 calculations. Primers encoding the altered residues at light chain positions for L:Q38C, L:G41C, L:A43C, L:F98C, and L:Q100C mutations and heavy chain positions for H:Q39C, H:G42C, H:G44C, H:L45C, and H:Q112C mutations were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). The amino acid numbers followed the numbering published in the Protein Data Bank code 2FJG (33.Fuh G. Wu P. Liang W.C. Ultsch M. Lee C.V. Moffat B. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6625-6631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The primers were designed with the annealing temperature in the range 60–65 °C. Pairs of cysteines were introduced in one step to the anti-VEGF scFv sequence in the pCANTAB5E phagemid (see above paragraph for the construction of the template phagemid) following the Kunkel protocol (38.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The DNA construct of the gene III signal peptide in the pCANTAB5E is shown in Fig. 3. Four libraries spanning the signal peptide region were designed as shown in the figure to identify the critical regions of the signal sequence. The primer sequences for the library constructions are also shown in Fig. 3. For each of the sequence regions to be randomized in amino acid sequence, TAA stop codons were first inserted in the designated place as shown in Fig. 3. The TAA-containing phagemids were used as the parents for the following library construction with the primers containing the degenerate codons NNK (Fig. 3). The TAA stop codons were designed to ensure that only the phagemids carrying degenerate codons would produce pIII fusion protein for phage surface display. Both the TAA-containing phagemids and the phagemid libraries for phage display were constructed with the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis initially proposed by Kunkel (38.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). In this work, we followed the Sidhu and Weiss protocol (39.Sidhu S.S. Weiss G.A. Clackson T. Lowman H.B. Phage Display. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2004: 27-42Google Scholar). E. coli strand ER2738 was transformed with the phagemid libraries, and the recombinant phage particles were rescued with helper phage M13KO7, precipitated with polyethylene glycol/NaCl, and resuspended in PBS. More details of the phage library preparation can be found in a previous publication (40.Hsu H.J. Tsai K.C. Sun Y.K. Chang H.J. Huang Y.J. Yu H.M. Lin C.H. Mao S.S. Yang A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12343-12353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The construction of the phage display libraries in the CDR regions followed the same procedure above. Wells in a 96-well Maxisorb microtiter plate were coated with VEGF (1 μg/100 μl PBS per well) overnight at room temperature. The wells were then blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST for 1 h and then washed as described before. 100 μl of resuspended phage library (1013 cfu/ml) was added to each well for 1 h under gentle shaking. The plate was cleared with 16 × 300 μl of PBST and 2 × 300 μl of PBS. Vigorous wash steps were intended to remove phages from the well surface because of nonspecific binding. The bound phages were eluted with 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl/glycine (pH 2.2) per well, followed by neutralization with 20 μl of 2 m Tris-base buffer (pH 9.1). The eluted phages were mixed with 1 ml of E. coli strand ER2738 (A600 nm = 0.6) for 15 min at 37 °C. Infected E. coli was titered, and the recombinant phage particles were rescued and amplified (in 9 ml of 2× YT, ampicillin 100 μg/ml; after 1 h, add helper phage (1010); wait for another hour before adding 50 ml of medium containing kanamycin 50 μg/ml and ampicillin 100 μg/ml) overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. The phage in the supernatant of the culture was titered, precipitated with polyethylene glycol/NaCl, and resuspended in PBS. The phage solution was ready for the next round of selection. Single E. coli colonies harboring the selected phagemid were randomly picked using GENETIX Qpix II colony picker to a 96-well deep well culture plate. Each well contained 1 ml of 2× YT, 100 μg of ampicillin, 20 μg of tetracycline, and helper phage M13KO7 1 × 109 cfu. The culture plates were incubated at 37 °C and shaken vigorously overnight. After centrifuging at 3000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, 50 μl of supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of 5% skim milk in a corresponding well of a 96-well Maxisorb microtiter plate, for which the wells were coated with 1 μg/100 μl VEGF and blocked with 5% skim milk. The ELISA developing procedure was identical to that described above under “Competitive Phage ELISA for Affinity Measurement of the Phage-displayed Anti-VEGF scFv,” except that the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was used, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured. 13 × 10-cm nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN) was coated with VEGF (100 μg/30 ml in PBS) overnight at room temperature. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk for 20 min and then laid on a PBS-soaked filter paper over the platform in GENETIX Qpix II. The phage solutions in the 96-well culture plate were arrayed on the membrane with 96-pin gridding tool (FP3S100 from V & P Scientific, Inc; each pin holds 100 nl of phage solution) installed on the gridding robot in GENETIX Qpix II. After arraying the phage solutions, the membrane was then immersed in 5% skim milk in PBS buffer for 20 min before washing with PBST. Phage remaining on the membrane was quantified by immersing the membrane in anti-M13 antibody conjugated with HRP (1:3000 in 5% skim milk PBST) for 30 min and then washing with PBST and PBS. The membrane was allowed to react with Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The chemiluminescence signal was recorded with a LAS-3000 imaging system (FujiFilm). Phage particles displaying anti-VEGF scFv(fXa+) derived from standard pCANTAB5E phagemid were tested for VEGF binding with competitive phage ELISA. EC50 values (the concentration of free VEGF resulting in 50% reduction in binding of the phage-displayed scFv to immobilized VEGF) derived from the series of curves of competitive ELISA in Fig. 1 indicated that the Kd (dissociation constant) values of anti-VEGF scFv against VEGF is on the order of 10–100 nm. This value was derived as EC50 approached Kd when both the phage-displayed anti-VEGF scFv concentration and the immobilized VEGF concentration approached zero (37.DeLano W.L. Cunningham B.C. Clackson T. Lowman H.B. Phage Display. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2004: 85-94Google Scholar). But the signal-to-noise ratio decreased as the immobilized VEGF concentration decreased (Fig. 1), rendering large uncertainty in measuring EC50. Hence, the EC50 values measured in Fig. 1 can only be regarded as a crude estimation of the Kd for the anti-VEGF scFv(fXa+) against VEGF. Nevertheless, the competitive phage ELISA against VEGF, along with the negative control experiment (null control phage without displaying scFv did not show any binding to VEGF, as shown in Fig. 2), confirmed the expression and binding of the phage-displayed anti-VEGF scFv(fXa+) against VEGF with reasonable binding affinity for the following experiments.FIGURE 2Expression level and binding affinity of anti-VEGF sc-dsFv(fXa+) on M13 phage surface or as free soluble protein secreted in the culture medium with the pCANTAB5E phagemid in E. coli strain ER2738.

However, the precise regulation for MEKK3 activation at the molecular level is still not fully understood. Here we report the identification of two regulatory phosphorylation sites at Thr-516 and Ser-520 within the kinase activation loop that is essential for MEKK3-mediated IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta)/NF-kappaB activation. Substitution of these two residues with alanine abolished the ability of MEKK3 to activate IKKbeta/NF-kappaB, whereas replacement with acidic residues rendered MEKK3 constitutively active. Furthermore, substitution of these two residues with alanine abolished the ability of MEKK3 to mediate lysophosphatidic acid-induced optimal IKKbeta/NF-kappaB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2000431586,"Proliferation and apoptosis are diametrically opposite processes. Expression of certain genes like c-Myc, however, can induce both, pointing to a possible linkage between them. Developing CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes are intrinsically sensitive to apoptosis, but the molecular basis is not known. We have found that these noncycling cells surprisingly express many cell cycle proteins. We generated transgenic mice expressing a CDK2 kinase-dead (CDK2-DN) protein in the T cell compartment. Analysis of these mice showed that the CDK2-DN protein acts as a dominant negative mutant in mature T cells as expected, but surprisingly, it acts as a dominant active protein in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes. The levels of CDK2 kinase activity, cyclin E, cyclin A, and other cell cycle proteins in transgenic CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes are increased. Concurrently, caspase levels are elevated, and apoptosis is significantly enhanced in vitro and in vivo. E2F-1, the unique E2F member capable of inducing apoptosis when overexpressed, is specifically up-regulated in transgenic CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes but not in other T cell populations. These results demonstrate that the cell cycle and apoptotic machineries are normally linked, and expression of cell cycle proteins in developing T cells contributes to their inherent 1sensitivity to apoptosis."
