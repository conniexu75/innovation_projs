https://openalex.org/W2035778594,"Pollen, spores, hystrichospherids, dinoflagellates, and the fresh-water alga Pediastrum occur in marine clays at the classic Claiborne Bluffs locality, Alabama. The presence of Ephedra pollen provides the first documented Tertiary record of this genus from the southeastern states. The occurrence of several characteristically temperate genera lends support to the idea that a deciduous hardwood forest was present in the Appalachian uplands during the Eocene."
https://openalex.org/W2058143763,"Pleistocene paleotemperatures inferred from zoogeographic evidence are based on temperatures at species' range limits at present. Paleotemperatures inferred from isotopic evidence are based on average former shell-growth temperatures which commonly, but not exclusively, lie between present range-limiting temperatures. With allowance for these differences, the two lines of evidence suggest similar thermal patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2050553823,"Predictions of the orbit of the Transit 1B satellite were systematically in error until account was taken of a third-order gravitational harmonic. The amplitude deduced for this harmonic by O'Keefe from the Vanguard I orbit serves very well, even though the orbits and the methods of observation and orbit fitting for the two satellites are quite different."
