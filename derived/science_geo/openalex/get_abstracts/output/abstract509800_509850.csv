https://openalex.org/W2085529478,"Myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs) are formed continuously in the healthy adult brain. In this work, we study the function of these late-forming cells and the myelin they produce. Learning a new motor skill (such as juggling) alters the structure of the brain’s white matter, which contains many OLs, suggesting that late-born OLs might contribute to motor learning. Consistent with this idea, we show that production of newly formed OLs is briefly accelerated in mice that learn a new skill (running on a “complex wheel” with irregularly spaced rungs). By genetically manipulating the transcription factor myelin regulatory factor in OL precursors, we blocked production of new OLs during adulthood without affecting preexisting OLs or myelin. This prevented the mice from mastering the complex wheel. Thus, generation of new OLs and myelin is important for learning motor skills."
https://openalex.org/W2050208293,"Controlling and reversing the effects of loss are major challenges in optical systems. For lasers, losses need to be overcome by a sufficient amount of gain to reach the lasing threshold. In this work, we show how to turn losses into gain by steering the parameters of a system to the vicinity of an exceptional point (EP), which occurs when the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of a system coalesce. In our system of coupled microresonators, EPs are manifested as the loss-induced suppression and revival of lasing. Below a critical value, adding loss annihilates an existing Raman laser. Beyond this critical threshold, lasing recovers despite the increasing loss, in stark contrast to what would be expected from conventional laser theory. Our results exemplify the counterintuitive features of EPs and present an innovative method for reversing the effect of loss."

Here, we report the application of isolated attosecond pulses to prompt ionization of the amino acid phenylalanine and the subsequent detection of ultrafast dynamics on a sub–4.5-femtosecond temporal scale, which is shorter than the vibrational response of the molecule. The ability to initiate and observe such electronic dynamics in polyatomic molecules represents a crucial step forward in attosecond science, which is progressively moving toward the investigation of more and more complex systems."
https://openalex.org/W2143103243,"Nitrogen (N) is a critical nutrient for plants but is often distributed unevenly in the soil. Plants therefore have evolved a systemic mechanism by which N starvation on one side of the root system leads to a compensatory and increased nitrate uptake on the other side. Here, we study the molecular systems that support perception of N and the long-distance signaling needed to alter root development. Rootlets starved of N secrete small peptides that are translocated to the shoot and received by two leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs). Arabidopsis plants deficient in this pathway show growth retardation accompanied with N-deficiency symptoms. Thus, signaling from the root to the shoot helps the plant adapt to fluctuations in local N availability."
https://openalex.org/W2046953810,"Rydberg excitons (condensed-matter analogues of hydrogen atoms) are shown to exist in single-crystal copper oxide with principal quantum numbers as large as n = 25 and giant wavefunctions with extensions of around two micrometres; this has implications for research in condensed-matter optics. Excitons, electron–hole pairs that play an essential role in the optical properties of semiconductors, can be viewed as condensed-matter analogues of hydrogen atoms, with a similar excitation spectrum. Dietmar Fröhlich and colleagues extend the series of excitations from the previous record of principal quantum number n = 12, to n = 25 for excitons in single crystal cuprous oxide. At such high quantum numbers, the wave function of the excitons becomes giant, around 2 micrometres, and it is expected that these giant excitons (also called Rydberg excitons) strongly interact with each other. The authors observe evidence for a blockade effect where the presence of an exciton prevents excitation of another exciton in its vicinity. This work opens new research directions for optics in condensed matter. A highly excited atom having an electron that has moved into a level with large principal quantum number is a hydrogen-like object, termed a Rydberg atom. The giant size of Rydberg atoms1 leads to huge interaction effects. Monitoring these interactions has provided insights into atomic and molecular physics on the single-quantum level. Excitons—the fundamental optical excitations in semiconductors2, consisting of an electron and a positively charged hole—are the condensed-matter analogues of hydrogen. Highly excited excitons with extensions similar to those of Rydberg atoms are of interest because they can be placed and moved in a crystal with high precision using microscopic energy potential landscapes. The interaction of such Rydberg excitons may allow the formation of ordered exciton phases or the sensing of elementary excitations in their surroundings on a quantum level. Here we demonstrate the existence of Rydberg excitons in the copper oxide Cu2O, with principal quantum numbers as large as n = 25. These states have giant wavefunction extensions (that is, the average distance between the electron and the hole) of more than two micrometres, compared to about a nanometre for the ground state. The strong dipole–dipole interaction between such excitons is indicated by a blockade effect in which the presence of one exciton prevents the excitation of another in its vicinity."
https://openalex.org/W2036260386,"Potassium channels selectively conduct K + ions across cellular membranes with extraordinary efficiency. Their selectivity filter exhibits four binding sites with approximately equal electron density in crystal structures with high K + concentrations, previously thought to reflect a superposition of alternating ion- and water-occupied states. Consequently, cotranslocation of ions with water has become a widely accepted ion conduction mechanism for potassium channels. By analyzing more than 1300 permeation events from molecular dynamics simulations at physiological voltages, we observed instead that permeation occurs via ion-ion contacts between neighboring K + ions. Coulomb repulsion between adjacent ions is found to be the key to high-efficiency K + conduction. Crystallographic data are consistent with directly neighboring K + ions in the selectivity filter, and our model offers an intuitive explanation for the high throughput rates of K + channels."
https://openalex.org/W2066940795,"As the interface between the Sun's photosphere and corona, the chromosphere and transition region play a key role in the formation and acceleration of the solar wind. Observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph reveal the prevalence of intermittent small-scale jets with speeds of 80 to 250 kilometers per second from the narrow bright network lanes of this interface region. These jets have lifetimes of 20 to 80 seconds and widths of ≤300 kilometers. They originate from small-scale bright regions, often preceded by footpoint brightenings and accompanied by transverse waves with amplitudes of ~20 kilometers per second. Many jets reach temperatures of at least ~10(5) kelvin and constitute an important element of the transition region structures. They are likely an intermittent but persistent source of mass and energy for the solar wind."
https://openalex.org/W2033439717,"The atomic nucleus is composed of two different kinds of fermions, protons and neutrons. If the protons and neutrons did not interact, the Pauli exclusion principle would force the majority fermions (usually neutrons) to have a higher average momentum. Our high-energy electron scattering measurements using 12C, 27Al, 56Fe and 208Pb targets show that, even in heavy neutron-rich nuclei, short-range interactions between the fermions form correlated high-momentum neutron-proton pairs. Thus, in neutron-rich nuclei, protons have a greater probability than neutrons to have momentum greater than the Fermi momentum. This finding has implications ranging from nuclear few body systems to neutron stars and may also be observable experimentally in two-spin state, ultra-cold atomic gas systems."
https://openalex.org/W1966317059,"The mechanisms that underlie the origin of major prokaryotic groups are poorly understood. In principle, the origin of both species and higher taxa among prokaryotes should entail similar mechanisms--ecological interactions with the environment paired with natural genetic variation involving lineage-specific gene innovations and lineage-specific gene acquisitions. To investigate the origin of higher taxa in archaea, we have determined gene distributions and gene phylogenies for the 267,568 protein-coding genes of 134 sequenced archaeal genomes in the context of their homologues from 1,847 reference bacterial genomes. Archaeal-specific gene families define 13 traditionally recognized archaeal higher taxa in our sample. Here we report that the origins of these 13 groups unexpectedly correspond to 2,264 group-specific gene acquisitions from bacteria. Interdomain gene transfer is highly asymmetric, transfers from bacteria to archaea are more than fivefold more frequent than vice versa. Gene transfers identified at major evolutionary transitions among prokaryotes specifically implicate gene acquisitions for metabolic functions from bacteria as key innovations in the origin of higher archaeal taxa."

https://openalex.org/W2128541299,"Understanding how predation risk and plant defenses interactively shape plant distributions is a core challenge in ecology. By combining global positioning system telemetry of an abundant antelope (impala) and its main predators (leopards and wild dogs) with a series of manipulative field experiments, we showed that herbivores’ risk-avoidance behavior and plants’ antiherbivore defenses interact to determine tree distributions in an African savanna. Well-defended thorny Acacia trees ( A. etbaica ) were abundant in low-risk areas where impala aggregated but rare in high-risk areas that impala avoided. In contrast, poorly defended trees ( A. brevispica ) were more abundant in high- than in low-risk areas. Our results suggest that plants can persist in landscapes characterized by intense herbivory, either by defending themselves or by thriving in risky areas where carnivores hunt."
https://openalex.org/W2078216201,"Although bipolar jets are seen emerging from a wide variety of astrophysical systems, the issue of their formation and morphology beyond their launching is still under study. Our scaled laboratory experiments, representative of young stellar object outflows, reveal that stable and narrow collimation of the entire flow can result from the presence of a poloidal magnetic field whose strength is consistent with observations. The laboratory plasma becomes focused with an interior cavity. This gives rise to a standing conical shock from which the jet emerges. Following simulations of the process at the full astrophysical scale, we conclude that it can also explain recently discovered x-ray emission features observed in low-density regions at the base of protostellar jets, such as the well-studied jet HH 154."
https://openalex.org/W2062771689,"The conserved heat shock transcription factor–1 (HSF-1) is essential to cellular stress resistance and life-span determination. The canonical function of HSF-1 is to regulate a network of genes encoding molecular chaperones that protect proteins from damage caused by extrinsic environmental stress or intrinsic age-related deterioration. In Caenorhabditis elegans , we engineered a modified HSF-1 strain that increased stress resistance and longevity without enhanced chaperone induction. This health assurance acted through the regulation of the calcium-binding protein PAT-10. Loss of pat-10 caused a collapse of the actin cytoskeleton, stress resistance, and life span. Furthermore, overexpression of pat-10 increased actin filament stability, thermotolerance, and longevity, indicating that in addition to chaperone regulation, HSF-1 has a prominent role in cytoskeletal integrity, ensuring cellular function during stress and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2068648892,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival, and given its association with many types of cancers, it has recently emerged as a promising target for therapy. In this work, we present the synthesis of N-substituted azaspirane derivatives and their biological evaluation against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (IC50 = 7.3 μm), thereby identifying 2-(1-(4-(2-cyanophenyl)1-benzyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-5-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-1-oxa-3-azaspiro(5,5) undecane (CIMO) as a potent inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway with selectivity over normal LO2 cells (IC50 > 100 μm). The lead compound, CIMO, suppresses proliferation of HCC cells and achieves this effect by reducing both constitutive and inducible phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3. Interestingly, CIMO displayed inhibition of Tyr-705 phosphorylation, which is required for nuclear translocation of STAT3, but it has no effect on Ser-727 phosphorylation. CIMO accumulates cancer cells in the sub-G1 phase and decreases STAT3 in the nucleus and thereby causes down-regulation of genes regulated via STAT3. Suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation by CIMO and knockdown of STAT3 mRNA using siRNA transfection displayed a similar effect on the viability of HCC cells. Furthermore, CIMO significantly decreased the tumor development in an orthotopic HCC mouse model through the modulation of phospho-STAT3, Ki-67, and cleaved caspase-3 in tumor tissues. Thus, CIMO represents a chemically novel and biologically in vitro and in vivo validated compound, which targets the JAK-STAT pathway as a potential cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2160620965,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging human pathogen that was first isolated in 2012. MERS-CoV replication depends in part on a virus-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) that cleaves the viral replicase polyproteins at three sites releasing non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), nsp2, and nsp3. In addition to this replicative function, MERS-CoV PLpro was recently shown to be a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and to possess deISGylating activity, as previously reported for other coronaviral PLpro domains, including that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. These activities have been suggested to suppress host antiviral responses during infection. To understand the molecular basis for ubiquitin (Ub) recognition and deconjugation by MERS-CoV PLpro, we determined its crystal structure in complex with Ub. Guided by this structure, mutations were introduced into PLpro to specifically disrupt Ub binding without affecting viral polyprotein cleavage, as determined using an in trans nsp3↓4 cleavage assay. Having developed a strategy to selectively disable PLpro DUB activity, we were able to specifically examine the effects of this activity on the innate immune response. Whereas the wild-type PLpro domain was found to suppress IFN-β promoter activation, PLpro variants specifically lacking DUB activity were no longer able to do so. These findings directly implicate the DUB function of PLpro, and not its proteolytic activity per se, in the inhibition of IFN-β promoter activity. The ability to decouple the DUB activity of PLpro from its role in viral polyprotein processing now provides an approach to further dissect the role(s) of PLpro as a viral DUB during MERS-CoV infection.

https://openalex.org/W2035124901,"Spatially resolved infrared observations of two galaxies with oxygen abundances below 10 per cent of the solar value show that stars formed very inefficiently in seven star-forming clumps, suggesting that star formation may have been very inefficient in the early Universe. The first generations of stars formed from gas containing few or no elements heavier than helium (called 'metals' by astronomers). Star formation processes under these conditions would probably have been very different from those seen in galaxies today. Now, using the far-infrared capabilities of the Herschel Space Observatory, Yong Shi et al. have mapped the dusty regions of two nearby young galaxies where the extreme conditions resemble those prevailing in the primordial galaxies in the early Universe. They estimate the dust/gas ratio in regions dominated by atomic gas and use that to estimate the amount of gas in the star-forming regions. They find star formation that is only a tenth as efficient as that seen in normal, metal-rich galaxies today. This work provides a glimpse of how stars may have formed in the early Universe and a convenient model in which theoretical models for early galaxy evolution can be put to the test. The first galaxies contain stars born out of gas with few or no ‘metals’ (that is, elements heavier than helium). The lack of metals is expected to inhibit efficient gas cooling and star formation1,2, but this effect has yet to be observed in galaxies with an oxygen abundance (relative to hydrogen) below a tenth of that of the Sun2,3,4. Extremely metal poor nearby galaxies may be our best local laboratories for studying in detail the conditions that prevailed in low metallicity galaxies at early epochs. Carbon monoxide emission is unreliable as a tracer of gas at low metallicities5,6,7, and while dust has been used to trace gas in low-metallicity galaxies5,8,9,10, low spatial resolution in the far-infrared has typically led to large uncertainties9,10. Here we report spatially resolved infrared observations of two galaxies with oxygen abundances below ten per cent of the solar value, and show that stars formed very inefficiently in seven star-forming clumps in these galaxies. The efficiencies are less than a tenth of those found in normal, metal rich galaxies today, suggesting that star formation may have been very inefficient in the early Universe."
https://openalex.org/W1991864985,"Whether or not climate change has had an impact on the occurrence of tornadoes in the United States has become a question of high public and scientific interest, but changes in how tornadoes are reported have made it difficult to answer it convincingly. We show that, excluding the weakest tornadoes, the mean annual number of tornadoes has remained relatively constant, but their variability of occurrence has increased since the 1970s. This is due to a decrease in the number of days per year with tornadoes combined with an increase in days with many tornadoes, leading to greater variability on annual and monthly time scales and changes in the timing of the start of the tornado season."
https://openalex.org/W2093088422,"Small molecules are useful tools for probing the biological function and therapeutic potential of individual proteins, but achieving selectivity is challenging when the target protein shares structural domains with other proteins. The Bromo and Extra-Terminal (BET) proteins have attracted interest because of their roles in transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, and cancer. The BET bromodomains (protein interaction modules that bind acetyl-lysine) have been targeted by potent small-molecule inhibitors, but these inhibitors lack selectivity for individual family members. We developed an ethyl derivative of an existing small-molecule inhibitor, I-BET/JQ1, and showed that it binds leucine/alanine mutant bromodomains with nanomolar affinity and achieves up to 540-fold selectivity relative to wild-type bromodomains. Cell culture studies showed that blockade of the first bromodomain alone is sufficient to displace a specific BET protein, Brd4, from chromatin. Expansion of this approach could help identify the individual roles of single BET proteins in human physiology and disease."

KpBest is a pentamer that forms a five-helix transmembrane pore, closed by three rings of conserved hydrophobic residues, and has a cytoplasmic cavern with a restricted exit. From electrophysiological analysis of structure-inspired mutations in KpBest and hBest1, we find a sensitive control of ion selectivity in the bestrophins, including reversal of anion/cation selectivity, and dramatic activation by mutations at the cytoplasmic exit. A homology model of hBest1 shows the locations of disease-causing mutations and suggests possible roles in regulation."

However, in this study only a limited number of potential substrates have been tested, and, for example, it is unknown whether nucleoside mono- and di-phosphates are transported by SLC25A33. The high homology existing between SLC25A33 and SLC25A36 has suggested that these two members of the MCF might have similar functions (1Palmieri F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties, and physiopathology.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 2Gutiérrez-Aguilar M. Baines C.P. Physiological and pathological roles of mitochondrial SLC25 carriers.Biochem. J. 2013; 454: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the substrate(s) transported by SLC25A36 has not yet been discovered, and its function is still completely elusive. This study reports the identification and functional characterization of SLC25A36 as well as a much more in-depth characterization of SLC25A33 transport activity as compared with that reported by Floyd et al. (11Floyd S. Favre C. Lasorsa F.M. Leahy M. Trigiante G. Stroebel P. Marx A. Loughran G. O'Callaghan K. Marobbio C.M. Slotboom D.J. Kunji E.R. Palmieri F. O'Connor R.

The SLC25A33 and SLC25A36 genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene products were purified and reconstituted into liposomes. Recombinant SLC25A33 was shown to transport uracil, thymine, and cytosine (deoxy)nucleoside di- and tri-phosphates and SLC25A36 cytosine and uracil (deoxy)nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates. Both SLC25A33- and SLC25A36-catalyzed transports were saturable and inhibited by mercurial compounds. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to SLC25A36 was found to be targeted to mitochondria as previously shown for SLC25A33 (11Floyd S. Favre C. Lasorsa F.M. Leahy M. Trigiante G. Stroebel P. Marx A. Loughran G. O'Callaghan K. Marobbio C.M. Slotboom D.J. Kunji E.R. Palmieri F. O'Connor R.

Furthermore, expression of SLC25A33 or SLC25A36 proved to restore the phenotypes of S. cerevisiae cells lacking RIM2, encoding the yeast well characterized mitochondrial pyrimidine nucleotide carrier (10Marobbio C.M. Di Noia M.A. Palmieri F. Identification of the mitochondrial transporter for pyrimidine nucleotides in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: bacterial expression, reconstitution, and functional characterization.Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As pyrimidine (deoxy)nucleotide transporters, SLC25A33 and SLC25A36 are essential for the synthesis and breakdown of mitochondrial DNA and RNA by providing the precursors and removing the products of these processes. Radioactive compounds were supplied from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All (deoxy)nucleotides were obtained from Sigma. Protein and genomic data bases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were screened with the protein sequence of SLC25A33 (accession number NP_115691.1) and SLC25A36 (accession number NP_001098117.1) using BLASTP and TBLASTN. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (Version 1.8). The coding sequences of SLC25A33 and SLC25A36 (accession numbers NM_032315.2 and NM_001104647.1, respectively) were amplified by PCR from human testis and brain cDNA, respectively. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the extremities of the coding sequences, with additional NdeI and HindIII (for SLC25A33) or BamHI and EcoRI (for SLC25A36) restriction sites as linkers. The amplified products were cloned into the pRUN (SLC25A33) and pMW (SLC25A36) vectors for expression in E. coli. The RIM2-pRS42H plasmid was constructed by cloning a DNA fragment consisting of the 381 bp upstream of the RIM2 open reading frame (ORF), the RIM2 ORF, and the 352 bp downstream of the RIM2 ORF (amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR using primers with additional BamHI and SacI sites) into the episomal vector pRS42H. For the preparation of the SLC25A33-pRS42H and SLC25A36-pRS42H plasmids, a chimera consisting of the 381 bp upstream of the RIM2 ORF, the coding sequence of SLC25A33 or SLC25A36 with a His6 tag before the termination codon and the 352 bp downstream of the RIM2 ORF was constructed. Each of the three fragments was amplified using long primers consisting of the sequences corresponding to the extremities of the template to be amplified and an additional sequence corresponding to the extremity of the fragment to be linked. After amplification and purification, the three fragments were mixed together and used in an overlapping PCR. The first 5 cycles of PCR were run without primers to generate the complete overlapping template, then forward primers (first 25 nucleotides of the chimera with HindIII site) and reverse primers (last 25 nucleotides of the chimera with SacI site) were added, and further 25 cycles of PCR were run. The two chimeras containing either the coding sequence of SLC25A33 or SLC25A36 were checked for correct overlapping and sequence errors, then they were digested with HindIII and SacI and cloned into the pRS42H plasmid. All the plasmids, prepared as above, were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Transformants were selected on 2X YT plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and screened by direct colony PCR and by restriction digestion of purified plasmids. The sequences of the inserts were verified. The expression of recombinant proteins was carried out at 37 °C in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (15Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F.

Finally, the recombinant SLC25A33 and SLC25A36 were solubilized in 1.2% (w/v) lauric acid and diluted 1:3 with 3% (w/v) Triton X-114, 10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA in the presence (SLC25A36) or absence (SLC25A33) of 20 mm Na2SO4. Eventual small residues were removed by centrifugation (20,800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The recombinant proteins in lauric acid were reconstituted into liposomes by cyclic removal of the detergent with a hydrophobic column of Amberlite beads (Fluka), as previously described (18Palmieri F.

The composition of the initial mixture used for reconstitution was 50 μl of purified protein (∼20 μg of SLC25A33 or 30 μg of SLC25A36), 60 μl of 10% Triton X-114, 100 μl of 10% phospholipids (l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk; Sigma) in the form of sonicated liposomes, 10 mm substrate except where otherwise indicated, 0.6 mg (SLC25A33) or 1 mg (SLC25A36) of cardiolipin, 10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0 (SLC25A33) or 5 mm MES-NaOH, 5 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.25 (SLC25A36), and water to a final volume of 700 μl. After vortexing, this mixture was recycled 13-fold through an Amberlite column (3.2 × 0.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 mm PIPES-NaOH at pH 7.0 (SLC25A33) or 5 mm MES-NaOH, 5 mm PIPES-NaOH at pH 6.25 (SLC25A36) and the substrate at the same concentration as in the starting mixture. External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 columns pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm PIPES-NaOH at pH 7.0 for SLC25A33 (buffer A) or 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm MES-NaOH, 5 mm PIPES-NaOH at pH 6.25 for SLC25A36 (buffer B). Transport at 25 °C was started by adding the indicated labeled substrates to substrate-loaded proteoliposomes (exchange) or to empty proteoliposomes (uniport). In both cases transport was terminated by the addition of 30 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and 20 mm bathophenanthroline, which in combination and at high concentrations inhibit the activity of several mitochondrial carriers rapidly and completely (see, for example, Refs. 20Fiermonte G.

In controls, the inhibitors were added at the beginning together with the radioactive substrate. Finally, the external radioactivity was removed from each sample of proteoliposomes by a Sephadex G-75 column pre-equilibrated with buffer A or buffer B for SLC25A33 and SLC25A36, respectively, and the entrapped radioactivity was measured. The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values. The initial transport rate was calculated from the radioactivity taken up by proteoliposomes after 1.5 min (SLC25A33) or 3 min (SLC25A36) (in the initial linear range of substrate uptake). For efflux measurements, proteoliposomes containing 2 mm substrate were labeled with 5 μm radioactive substrate by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration (18Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F.

After 40 min, the external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through Sephadex G-75 columns pre-equilibrated with buffer A or buffer B for SLC25A33 or SLC25A36, respectively. Efflux was started by adding unlabeled external substrate or buffer alone (buffer A for SLC25A33 and buffer B for SLC25A36) to aliquots of proteoliposomes and terminated by adding the inhibitors indicated above. For the subcellular localization of SLC25A36 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, these cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of mtEBFP/pcDNAI (where EBFP stands for enhanced blue fluorescent protein) and 4 μg of a modified pcDNA3 plasmid containing the coding sequence of SLC25A36 fused with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence at the C terminus (25Lasorsa F.M.

The strains used in this study are all in W303 genetic context (his3-11,15; ade2-1; leu2-3,112; ura3-1; trp1-1; can1-100). The wild-type W303 rho° haploid strain was produced as follows. Cells were grown at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml on YPD medium for 24 h, then 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide were added to 1 ml of culture. This culture was incubated at 28 °C for 24 h, then the cells were washed twice with H2O and plated on YPD medium. The lack of rho° cell growth was assessed on glycerol as the carbon source and the absence of mtDNA by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) staining. RIM2Δ diploid strain (RIM2/RIM2::kanMX) was generated using the PCR-mediated gene disruption technique (26Güldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. A new efficient gene disruption cassette for repeated use in budding yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) by replacing one of the two wild-type RIM2 copies with the kanMX cassette in wild-type W303 diploid strain (EUROSCARF). This strain was sporulated to obtain the wild-type and the RIM2Δ haploid strains. To obtain RIM2Δ strain-containing mtDNA, the RIM2Δ haploid strain was transformed with the RIM2-pRS42H, SLC25A33-pRS42H, or SLC25A36-pRS42H plasmid and crossed with the wild-type haploid strain of the opposite mating type to obtain the diploid strains. Cell crossing was generated by bringing the cells near on plate with the needle of the Singer micromanipulator. The generation of zygotes was usually produced in 2 h. All the transformed RIM2Δ diploid strains were used for tetrad dissection to obtain transformed RIM2Δ haploid strains containing mtDNA (named RIM2Δ + RIM2, RIM2Δ + A33, RIM2Δ + A36). Wild-type, wild-type rho°, and deletion strains were grown at 28 °C in rich medium containing 1% Bacto-peptone and 1% yeast extract supplemented with 2% glucose (YPD) or 3% glycerol (YPG). 2.2% Bacto agar (Difco) was also present in solid media. In all cases the final pH was adjusted to 4.5. The pre-sporulation medium contained 1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto-peptone, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 1% potassium acetate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 0.05 m potassium phthalate, pH 5, and the sporulation medium contained 1% potassium acetate, pH 7.6. After 48 h of growth on YPD plate at 28 °C, diploid strains were inoculated in pre-sporulation medium; after 24 h, cells were collected, washed 2 times in H2O, and inoculated in the sporulation medium. To avoid plasmid loss, hygromycin (100 μg/ml) was added to the pre-sporulation medium of the diploid strains containing the plasmid RIM2-pRS42H, SLC25A33-pRS42H, or SLC25A36-pRS42H. The formation of tetrads was followed by microscopic observation, and diploid strains were treated 18 min with cytohelicase (Sigma); the spores of asci were separated with the needle of the Singer micromanipulator. After 3 days, tetrad analysis was performed using marker selection; RIM2Δ spores were Geneticin (G418)-resistant; transformed RIM2Δ spores were hygromycin-resistant. The microscope used was a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 Fluorescence Microscope with AxioVision 4.8 Digital Image Processing System, and the objective lens used was 63× oil. The fluorescence was observed using filter sets for DAPI (365-nm excitation and 445/450-nm emission), DASPMI (2-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide; Sigma; 550/25-nm excitation and 605/670-nm emission), and GFP (470/40-nm excitation and 525/50-nm emission). Intact cell respiration was determined at 30 °C using an Oxygraph-2 k system (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria) equipped with two chambers, and the data were analyzed using DatLab software (27Leadsham J.E. Gourlay C.W. cAMP/PKA signaling balances respiratory activity with mitochondria-dependent apoptosis via transcriptional regulation.BMC Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cultures in YPD or YPG were harvested at an A600 of 0.7–1, centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in YP at a density of ∼5 A600 units. 50 μl of this suspension corresponding to ∼5 × 106 cells/ml were added to each chamber containing 2 ml of YP. The chambers were closed, and respiration was recorded. The highest rate of respiration was determined by adding 0.5% ethanol and then 2.5–10 μl of 2 mm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma). The addition of 2 μm antimycin A (Sigma) accounted for non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue dye. The identity of purified SLC25A33 and SLC25A36 was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry of trypsin digests of the corresponding band excised from a Coomassie-stained gel (28Palmieri L.

https://openalex.org/W2130446505,"Lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding protein (LGALS3BP, also called Mac-2 binding protein) is a heavily glycosylated secreted molecule that has been shown previously to be up-regulated in many cancers and has been implicated in tumor metastatic processes, as well as in other cell adhesion and immune functions. The CD33-related subset of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) consists of immunomodulatory molecules that have recently been associated with the modulation of immune responses to cancer. Because up-regulation of Siglec ligands in cancer tissue has been observed, the characterization of these cancer-associated ligands that bind to inhibitory CD33-related Siglecs could provide novel targets for cancer immunomodulatory therapy. Here we used affinity chromatography of tumor cell extracts to identify LGALS3BP as a novel sialic acid-dependent ligand for human Siglec-9 and for other immunomodulatory Siglecs, such as Siglec-5 and Siglec-10. In contrast, the mouse homolog Siglec-E binds to murine LGALS3BP with lower affinity. LGALS3BP has been observed to be up-regulated in human colorectal and prostate cancer specimens, particularly in the extracellular matrix. Finally, LGALS3BP was able to inhibit neutrophil activation in a sialic acid- and Siglec-dependent manner. These findings suggest a novel immunoinhibitory function for LGALS3BP that might be important for immune evasion of tumor cells during cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2121833986,"T cells that mediate autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are difficult to characterize because they are likely to be deleted or inactivated in the thymus if the self antigens they recognize are ubiquitously expressed. One way to obtain and analyze these autoimmune T cells is to alter T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in developing T cells to change their sensitivity to thymic negative selection, thereby allowing their thymic production. From mice thus engineered to generate T cells mediating autoimmune arthritis, we isolated arthritogenic TCRs and characterized the self antigens they recognized. One of them was the ubiquitously expressed 60 S ribosomal protein L23a (RPL23A), with which T cells and autoantibodies from RA patients reacted. This strategy may improve our understanding of the underlying drivers of autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2001966776,"In humans, colorectal cancer is often initiated through APC loss of function, which leads to crypt hyperplasia and polyposis driven by unrestricted canonical Wnt signaling. Such polyps typically arise in the colorectal region and are at risk of transforming to invasive adenocarcinomas. Although colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, the processes impacting initiation, transformation, and invasion are incompletely understood. Murine APC(Min/+) mutants are often used to model colorectal cancers; however, they develop nonmetastatic tumors confined largely to the small intestine and are thus not entirely representative of the human disease. APC(Min/+) alleles can collaborate with mutations impacting other pathways to recapitulate some aspects of human colorectal cancer. To this end, we assessed APC(Min/+)-induced polyposis following somatic loss of the homeodomain transcription factor Cdx2, alone or with a Cdx1 null allele, in the adult gastrointestinal tract. APC(Min/+)-Cdx2 mutants recapitulated several aspects of human colorectal cancer, including an invasive phenotype. Notably, the concomitant loss of Cdx1 led to a significant increase in the incidence of tumors in the distal colon, relative to APC(Min/+)-Cdx2 offspring, demonstrating a previously unrecognized role for this transcription factor in colorectal tumorigenesis. These findings underscore previously unrecognized roles for Cdx members in intestinal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2149106879,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal, fibroproliferative disease. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can develop secondary to IPF and increase mortality. Alternatively, activated macrophages (AAMs) contribute to the pathogenesis of both IPF and PH. Here we hypothesized that adenosine signaling through the ADORA2B on AAMs impacts the progression of these disorders and that conditional deletion of ADORA2B on myeloid cells would have a beneficial effect in a model of these diseases. Conditional knockout mice lacking ADORA2B on myeloid cells (Adora2B(f/f)-LysM(Cre)) were exposed to the fibrotic agent bleomycin (BLM; 0.035 U/g body weight, i.p.). At 14, 17, 21, 25, or 33 d after exposure, SpO2, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and histologic analyses were performed. On day 33, lung function and cardiovascular analyses were determined. Markers for AAM and mediators of fibrosis and PH were assessed. Adora2B(f/f)-LysM(Cre) mice presented with attenuated fibrosis, improved lung function, and no evidence of PH compared with control mice exposed to BLM. These findings were accompanied by reduced expression of CD206 and arginase-1, markers for AAMs. A 10-fold reduction in IL-6 and a 5-fold decrease in hyaluronan, both linked to lung fibrosis and PH, were also observed. These data suggest that activation of the ADORA2B on macrophages plays an active role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and PH."
https://openalex.org/W2053772447,"Like our Moon, the majority of the solar system’s satellites are locked in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance; on average, these satellites show the same face toward the planet at a constant rotation rate equal to the satellite’s orbital rate. In addition to the uniform rotational motion, physical librations (oscillations about an equilibrium) also occur. The librations may contain signatures of the satellite’s internal properties. Using stereophotogrammetry on Cassini Image Science Subsystem (ISS) images, we measured longitudinal physical forced librations of Saturn’s moon Mimas. Our measurements confirm all the libration amplitudes calculated from the orbital dynamics, with one exception. This amplitude depends mainly on Mimas’ internal structure and has an observed value of twice the predicted one, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. After considering various possible interior models of Mimas, we argue that the satellite has either a large nonhydrostatic interior, or a hydrostatic one with an internal ocean beneath a thick icy shell."

Here we show novel regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in KRIT1-depleted endothelial cells. Loss of KRIT1 and PDCD10, but not CCM2, increases nuclear β-catenin signaling and up-regulates VEGF-A protein expression. In KRIT1-depleted cells, increased VEGF-A levels led to increased VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) activation and subsequent alteration of cytoskeletal organization, migration, and barrier function and to in vivo endothelial permeability in KRIT1-deficient animals. VEGFR2 activation also increases β-catenin phosphorylation but is only partially responsible for KRIT1 depletion-dependent disruption of cell-cell contacts. Thus, VEGF signaling contributes to modifying endothelial function in KRIT1-deficient cells and microvessel permeability in Krit1+/− mice; however, VEGF signaling is likely not the only contributor to disrupted endothelial cell-cell contacts in the absence of KRIT1.

https://openalex.org/W2082841783,"Sepsis remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Excessive inflammation is a major cause of organ failure and mortality in sepsis. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1, ENTPDase1 (CD39) is a cell surface nucleotide-metabolizing enzyme, which degrades the extracellular purines ATP and ADP, thereby regulating purinergic receptor signaling. Although the role of purinergic receptor signaling in regulating inflammation and sepsis has been addressed previously, the role of CD39 in regulating the host's response to sepsis is unknown. We found that the CD39 mimic apyrase (250 U/kg) decreased and knockout or pharmacologic blockade with sodium polyoxotungstate (5 mg/kg; IC50 ≈ 10 μM) of CD39 increased mortality of mice with polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. CD39 decreased inflammation, organ damage, immune cell apoptosis, and bacterial load. Use of bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that CD39 expression on myeloid cells decreases inflammation in septic mice. CD39 expression is upregulated during sepsis in mice, as well as in both murine and human macrophages stimulated with Escherichia coli. Moreover, E. coli increases CD39 promoter activity in macrophages. Altogether, these data indicate CD39 as an evolutionarily conserved inducible protective pathway during sepsis.

Much information is available about insulin signaling, but understanding of the cellular mechanisms causing impaired signaling and insulin resistance is hampered by fragmented data, mainly obtained from different cell lines and animals. We have collected quantitative and systems-wide dynamic data on insulin signaling in primary adipocytes and compared cells isolated from healthy and diabetic individuals. Mathematical modeling and experimental verification identified mechanisms of insulin control of the MAPKs ERK1/2. We found that in human adipocytes, insulin stimulates phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 and hence protein synthesis about equally via ERK1/2 and mTORC1. Using mathematical modeling, we examined the signaling network as a whole and show that a single mechanism can explain the insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes throughout the network, involving signaling both through IRS1, PKB, and mTOR and via ERK1/2 to the nuclear transcription factor Elk1. The most important part of the insulin resistance mechanism is an attenuated feedback from the protein kinase mTORC1 to IRS1, which spreads signal attenuation to all parts of the insulin signaling network. Experimental inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin in adipocytes from non-diabetic individuals induced and thus confirmed the predicted network-wide insulin resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2061170330,"The initial observation that guinea pig serum kills lymphoma cells marks the serendipitous discovery of a new class of anti-cancer agents. The serum cell killing factor was shown to be an enzyme with l-asparaginase (ASNase) activity. As a direct result of this observation, several bacterial l-asparaginases were developed and are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of the subset of hematological malignancies that are dependent on the extracellular pool of the amino acid asparagine. As drugs, these enzymes act to hydrolyze asparagine to aspartate, thereby starving the cancer cells of this amino acid. Prior to the work presented here, the precise identity of this guinea pig enzyme has not been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. We discovered that the guinea pig enzyme annotated as H0W0T5_CAVPO, which we refer to as gpASNase1, has the required low Km property consistent with that possessed by the cell-killing guinea pig serum enzyme. Elucidation of the ligand-free and aspartate complex gpASNase1 crystal structures allows a direct comparison with the bacterial enzymes and serves to explain the lack of l-glutaminase activity in the guinea pig enzyme. The structures were also used to generate a homology model for the human homolog hASNase1 and to help explain its vastly different kinetic properties compared with gpASNase1, despite a 70% sequence identity. Given that the bacterial enzymes frequently present immunogenic and other toxic side effects, this work suggests that gpASNase1 could be a promising alternative to these bacterial enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2033587029,"Dephosphorylation of important myocardial proteins is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), representing a heterotrimer that is comprised of catalytic, scaffolding, and regulatory (B) subunits. There is a multitude of B subunit family members directing the PP2A holoenzyme to different myocellular compartments. To gain a better understanding of how these B subunits contribute to the regulation of cardiac performance, we generated transgenic (TG) mice with cardiomyocyte-directed overexpression of B56α, a phosphoprotein of the PP2A-B56 family. The 2-fold overexpression of B56α was associated with an enhanced PP2A activity that was localized mainly in the cytoplasm and myofilament fraction. Contractility was enhanced both at the whole heart level and in isolated cardiomyocytes of TG compared with WT mice. However, peak amplitude of [Ca]i did not differ between TG and WT cardiomyocytes. The basal phosphorylation of cardiac troponin inhibitor (cTnI) and the myosin-binding protein C was reduced by 26 and 35%, respectively, in TG compared with WT hearts. The stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol (ISO) resulted in an impaired contractile response of TG hearts. At a depolarizing potential of -5 mV, the ICa,L current density was decreased by 28% after administration of ISO in TG cardiomyocytes. In addition, the ISO-stimulated phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser(16) was reduced by 27% in TG hearts. Thus, the increased PP2A-B56α activity in TG hearts is localized to specific subcellular sites leading to the dephosphorylation of important contractile proteins. This may result in higher myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and increased basal contractility in TG hearts. These effects were reversed by β-adrenergic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2029404470,"Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a mesenchymal cancer that occurs throughout the body. Although LMS is easily recognized histopathologically, the cause of the disease remains unknown. Versican, an extracellular matrix proteoglycan, increases in LMS. Microarray analyses of 80 LMSs and 24 leiomyomas showed a significant elevated expression of versican in human LMS versus benign leiomyomas. To explore the importance of versican in this smooth muscle cell tumor, we used versican-directed siRNA to knock down versican expression in a LMS human cell line, SK-LMS-1. Decreased versican expression was accompanied by slower rates of LMS cell proliferation and migration, increased adhesion, and decreased accumulation of the extracellular matrix macromolecule hyaluronan. Addition of purified versican to cells expressing versican siRNA restored cell proliferation to the level of LMS controls, increased the pericellular coat and the retention of hyaluronan, and decreased cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of versican was not only synergistic with hyaluronan in increasing cell proliferation, but the depletion of versican decreased hyaluronan synthase expression and decreased the retention of hyaluronan. When LMS cells stably expressing versican siRNA were injected into nude mice, the resulting tumors displayed significantly less versican and hyaluronan staining, had lower volumes, and had reduced levels of mitosis as compared with controls. Collectively, these results suggest a role for using versican as a point of control in the management and treatment of LMS."

Polysaccharides are represented by three different families: cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Cellulose is present as long chains of β-1,4-glucose, and hemicelluloses are branched polysaccharides containing backbones of neutral sugars. Pectins are defined by the presence of uronic acids divided in four polysaccharide “domains”: homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), and xylogalacturonan (25Somerville C.

In short, bacteria were cultured in LB medium supplemented with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and ampicillin at 37 °C for 16 h in static conditions, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS), detached from the bacterial cell by using a blender (three times for 30 s), and centrifuged twice at 4,000 × g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added slowly into the supernatant containing the fimbriae with vigorous stirring to achieve two-thirds saturation. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the fimbriae were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then suspended in cold TBS + 0.5% deoxycholate. The preparation was subjected to a sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (60–10%) in an Optima L-80 XP centrifuge for 16 h at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor and then fractioned in 1-ml lots. The fractions were visualized for density and absorbance at 280 nm. The fractions containing ECP were pooled, dialyzed against water, and freeze-dried. To confirm purity of the isolated ECP, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE after denaturation at low pH (35McMichael J.C. Ou J.T. Structure of common pili from Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 969-975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The predicted size of E. coli EcpA is 21 kDa. A mock fimbrial preparation was prepared in an identical manner using E. coli JT1 as a control. The anti-ECP fimbrial serum derived from E. coli strain JTI overexpressing pMat3 was obtained by immunizing rats according to standard procedures by Genosphere Biotechnologies (France). Antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-E. coli (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; Ab137967), anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated antibodies, and anti-rabbit and anti-rat horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). For anti-plant polysaccharide/glycoprotein (Plantprobes, Leeds, UK) specificities and details, see Table 3. The presence of fimbriae was confirmed by electron microscopy. Fimbrial preparations were spotted (10 μl) to carbon-coated copper grids and incubated for 1 min, and the grid was transferred to a 100-μl drop of sterile distilled water and incubated for 2 s. Without drying, the grid was transferred to a 100-μl drop of 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0 and incubated for 2 min. Excess liquid was then removed, the grid allowed to dry, and the images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1400 electron microscope (Japan).TABLE 3Monoclonal antibodiesAntibodySpecificitiesRef.LM1Extensin (plant glycoprotein)78Smallwood M.

CTA1 then unfolds and passes through an ER translocon pore to reach its cytosolic target. Due to its intrinsic instability, cytosolic CTA1 must be refolded to achieve an active conformation. The cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 is involved with the ER to cytosol export of CTA1, but the mechanistic role of Hsp90 in CTA1 translocation remains unknown. Moreover, potential post-translocation roles for Hsp90 in modulating the activity of cytosolic CTA1 have not been explored. Here, we show by isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that Hsp90 induces a gain-of-structure in disordered CTA1 at physiological temperature. Only the ATP-bound form of Hsp90 interacts with disordered CTA1, and refolding of CTA1 by Hsp90 is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis. In vitro reconstitution of the CTA1 translocation event likewise required ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. Surface plasmon resonance experiments found that Hsp90 does not release CTA1, even after ATP hydrolysis and the return of CTA1 to a folded conformation. The interaction with Hsp90 allows disordered CTA1 to attain an active state, which is further enhanced by ADP-ribosylation factor 6, a host cofactor for CTA1. Our data indicate CTA1 translocation involves a process that couples the Hsp90-mediated refolding of CTA1 with CTA1 extraction from the ER.

The A subunit consists of two domains, A1 and A2, linked by a disulfide bond. The A1 domain is responsible for catalytic activity, and the A2 domain acts as a tether between the A1 domain and the B subunit. The homopentameric B subunit is a highly stable ring-like structure with a central pore that interacts with the A2 chain and contains binding sites for GM1 gangliosides on the plasma membrane of the host cell (1De Haan L.

The ER to cytosol translocation of unfolded proteins by ERAD is a normal process that prevents the accumulation of protein aggregates in the ER. Exported ERAD substrates move through protein-conducting channels in the ER membrane and are targeted for cytosolic degradation by the 26 S proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (21Bagola K.

CTA1 and A chains from other ER-translocating toxins contain an arginine over lysine bias in their amino acid sequences.

Ubiquitin-independent proteolytic functions of the proteasome.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The relatively long half-life (t½ between 1 and 2 h) for cytosolic CTA1 suggests a stabilizing interaction with host factors may protect CTA1 from rapid, ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation (13Pande A.H.

An early model of toxin translocation proposed CTA1 spontaneously refolded as it emerged at the cytosolic face of the ER translocon pore (27Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I.

This would prevent back-sliding into the pore and would thus provide an ER to cytosol directionality to the translocation process. Yet the subsequent discovery of CTA1 conformational instability indicated the toxin could not independently refold at physiological temperature and therefore required a host factor(s) for extraction to the cytosol (13Pande A.H.

The ER to cytosol translocation of unfolded CTA1 is instead facilitated by heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a cytosolic ATP-dependent chaperone that plays a role in multiple cellular events including protein folding, protein stabilization, and refolding of denatured proteins (35Sreedhar A.S.

In fact, the isolated CTA1 polypeptide has little to no enzymatic activity at 37 °C (45Murayama T. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 30395-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An interaction with ARF proteins will enhance the activity of folded CTA1 and is required for productive intoxication of cultured cells, but ARF alone cannot induce a gain-of-structure or gain-of-function in disordered CTA1 (47Banerjee T. Taylor M. Jobling M.G. Burress H. Yang Z. Serrano A. Holmes R.K. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 acts as an allosteric activator for the folded but not disordered cholera toxin A1 polypeptide.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 10.1111/mmi.12807Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Other host factors must therefore place cytosolic CTA1 in a folded conformation that can be further activated by ARF proteins. Lipid rafts were recently shown to exhibit a “lipochaperone” property that places disordered CTA1 in a folded, functional state at physiological temperature. Furthermore, lipid rafts are essential for the in vivo activity of cytosolic CTA1 (46Ray S. Taylor M. Banerjee T. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. Lipid rafts alter the stability and activity of the cholera toxin A1 subunit.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30395-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other host factors that could refold and/or activate cytosolic CTA1 have yet to be identified. The high affinity interaction between CTA1 and Hsp90 (37Taylor M. Navarro-Garcia F. Huerta J. Burress H. Massey S. Ireton K. Teter K. Hsp90 is required for transfer of the cholera toxin A1 subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31261-31267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), combined with the established chaperone activity of Hsp90, suggests Hsp90 could be another host factor linked to the cytosolic activity of CTA1. To generate molecular detail regarding the co- and post-translocation roles of Hsp90 in CT intoxication, we performed a structure/function analysis on the interaction between Hsp90 and CTA1. Biophysical measurements provided a mechanistic basis for Hsp90-mediated extraction of CTA1 from the ER by demonstrating that Hsp90 can convert disordered CTA1 to a structured conformation. ATP hydrolysis was required for Hsp90 to refold CTA1 and to maintain a high-affinity interaction with the refolded toxin. ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 was also required for the ER to cytosol export of CTA1. The Hsp90-mediated refolding of CTA1 thus appears to provide the driving force for toxin extraction from the ER: refolded CTA1 could not slide back into the translocon pore, thereby resulting in a unidirectional ER to cytosol export. Hsp90 remains associated with the refolded toxin and allows ARF6 to simulate the activity of CTA1 at 37 °C. These studies have elucidated a new, Hsp90-driven mechanism for toxin translocation that may apply to a broad range of ADP-ribosylating toxins.

To monitor the catalytic activity of CTA1, the stated concentrations of CTA1-His6 were placed in a 200-μl assay buffer containing 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 20 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml of BSA. Hsp90 at a 2:1 molar ratio to CTA1, equimolar ARF6, and/or 800 μm lipid raft LUVs were also present as indicated, as were 1 mm ATP, ATPγS, or GTP. CTA1 samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 or 37 °C, followed by the addition of the indicated components for a further 1-h incubation at the indicated temperature. The ADP-ribosylation reaction was initiated by addition of 0.4 mg/ml of DEA-BAG and 25 μl of 10 mm NAD. Samples were then incubated at the indicated temperature for 2 h, during which CTA1 (if active) was able to ADP-ribosylate the DEA-BAG substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of 30% AG50W-4X bead slurry. The samples were vortexed for 30 s, followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 10 min. ADP-ribosylation of DEA-BAG inhibits its ability to bind to AG50W-4X beads, so pelleting the resin leaves modified DEA-BAG in the supernatant. 400 μl of supernatant was removed, and the intrinsic fluorescence of DEA-BAG (excitation 361 nm, emission 440 nm) was read with a Bio-Tek (Winooski, VT) Synergy 2 plate reader.

Despite accumulating data in tissue culture models on the function and mechanisms of ER dislocation, its physiological function in an organismal context is poorly defined, due to the limited number of model substrates and cell lines investigated and due to the lack of appropriate in vivo mammalian models. To obtain further insight into the physiological role of ER dislocation, we generated a floxed allele of Ube2j1 in mice and analyzed Ube2j1−/− mice. Although Ube2j1 has been repeatedly implicated in the dislocation of various misfolded glycoprotein substrates, mice that lack Ube2j1 are viable and show no gross aberrations in morphology or behavior. On the assumption that ER quality control is essential to development and survival, these results suggest remarkable redundancy in its mode of operation. The main defect we observe in Ube2j1−/− animals, surprisingly, is male sterility due to defects in flagella and acrosome function, and defective removal of cytoplasm from elongating spermatids. Our results thus identify a unique, non-redundant role for Ube2j1 in male germ cell development and define a previously unknown physiological function of ER dislocation. We generated mice carrying a conditional allele of the gene encoding UBE2J1 (also known as UBC6e or NCUBE1, gene name Ube2j1) by homologous recombination (Fig. 1A). Genomic sequences were amplified by PCR from a BAC clone (Clone DB name RP24–531A22; C57BL/6J, male, brain, spleen; BAC-PAC Resources, Oakland, CA) containing the genomic sequence of Ube2j1 from C57BL/6J mice. Ube2j1 consists of 8 exons. We constructed a targeting vector based on the pPGKneoF2L2dta (pF2L2, Addgene 13445, Ref. 7Hoch R.V. Soriano P.

A neomycin resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites was inserted upstream of the 3′ LoxP site between exons 3 and 4. The LoxP sites were flanked by a ∼4.6 kb 5′ and a ∼2.8 kb 3′ homology arm. The linearized targeting construct was electroporated into JM8A3.N1 ES cells (strain C57BL/6N, agouti; obtained from the KOMP Repository), which were subsequently grown in the presence of neomycin. ES cells were selected with 300 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen) for 6 days. G418-resistant ES cell colonies were screened for correct targeting by Southern blotting or long range PCR, and correctly targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Chimeras were bred with FLPe transgenic mice (JAX strain B6.Cg-Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) to excise the neomycin resistance cassette. Ube2j1fl/wt mice were intercrossed to obtain FLPe− Ube2j1fl/wt mice. FLPe− Ube2j1fl/wt mice were then crossed to CMV-Cre transgenic mice (JAX strain B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J; Jackson Laboratories) to generate full-body knock-out mice (Ube2j1−/−) and to CD19-Cre mice (JAX strain B6.129P2(C)-Cd19tm1(cre)Cgn/J; Jackson Laboratories) for specific ablation in B cells (CD19-Cre Ube2j1fl/fl). Mice were genotyped by PCR using primers annealing to the genomic regions indicated in Fig. 1A (A: 5′-GCCTCTGAGGATTTCCTGTGAGG-3′; B: 5′-ATGGAGACCCGCTACAACCT-3′; C: 5′-GCAGGATAATGCTTGGTGGTT-3′). The expected amplicon sizes are 458 bp for the wild type, 531 bp for the floxed, and 538 bp for the knock-out allele. Animals were housed at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and maintained according to protocols approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on Animal Care. MEFs were generated from E13.5 fetuses and cultured in DME medium supplemented with 10% IFS, 1 mm glutamine, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (MEF medium). In the experiments described here, matched pairs of primary wild type and knock-out MEFs from littermates were used (except for experiments with SV40, for which we used MEFs that had been immortalized by serial passage). B cells were isolated from spleens of Ube2j1−/− or CD19-Cre Ube2j1fl/fl mice and Cre-matched Ube2j1wt/wt littermates, respectively. Splenocytes were enriched for B cells by depletion of non-B cells using Mouse CD43 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. B cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) (B cell medium). B plasma cells were induced by adding 1 μm CpG-DNA 1826 (a TLR9 agonist, phosphorothioate backbone, 5′- TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′; IDT, Coralville, IA) to the B cell medium for 4 days. Mouse organs were homogenized in PBS containing protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with a rotor-stator homogenizer (TissueRuptor; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD).

The antibodies used were anti-mouse IgM PE (clone II/41; eBioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse B220 Pacific Blue (clone RA3-6B2; BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), anti-mouse AA4.1 (CD93) PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone AA4.1; eBioscience), anti-mouse CD1d PE (clone 1B1; eBioscience), anti-mouse CD21/CD35 APC (clone 7E9; BioLegend, Inc., San Diego, CA), anti-mouse CD23 FITC (clone B3B4; BD Pharmingen), anti-mouse CD19 FITC (clone 1B3; BD Pharmingen), anti-mouse CD5 PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone 53-7.3; eBioscience) and anti-mouse CD43 PE (clone S7; BD Pharmingen). Plasmablasts were analyzed after 4 days of culture in B cell medium with 1 μm CpG-DNA 1826. Cells were pretreated for five hours with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (T7765; Sigma-Aldrich) or left untreated, then starved for 1 h in serum-free RPMI medium followed by a 20 min labeling period with [35S]cysteine/methionine (EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mix, NEG072014MC; PerkinElmer, Inc, Waltham, MA). Aliquots were taken after chase periods of 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. The supernatants were saved for immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and lysed in NET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) with complete protease inhibitors. Equivalent amounts of radiolabeled proteins were used for immunoprecipitations. IgM was immunoprecipitated with a μ chain-specific goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (1020-01; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Class I MHC was immunoprecipitated with an H-2Kb heavy chain-specific rabbit serum (p8, produced in our laboratory according to Ref. 13Smith M.H. Parker J.M. Hodges R.S. Barber B.H.

RNA for the RNA-Seq analysis was isolated from passage three MEFs with an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was analyzed for integrity with the RNA Pico kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Total RNA input amounts for library preparation were normalized, and libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq TM V2 RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications in the PCR step. Fifteen cycles of PCR were done using the HiFi NGS Library Amplification kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). The libraries were quantified by qPCR using the Illumina Library Quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and sized using the High Sensitivity DNA kit from Agilent (Agilent Technologies). The RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina, Inc.) for 40 bases (unidirectional). Sequence as well as quality scores were generated using the Off-Line Basecaller software (version 1.9.4; Illumina, Inc.). Single cell suspensions of bone marrow cells, splenocytes, and peritoneal cavity cells were prepared, and red blood cells were lysed. Cell suspensions were adjusted to the same concentration before surface staining in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum. To measure SV40 large T antigen expression, MEFs were fixed and permeabilized. SV40 Large T antigen was stained with a monoclonal mouse anti-SV40 large T antigen antibody (Ref. 14Hess R. Rau P. Schwab M. Paetzold S. Kuther M. Obert M. Agostini H. Haessler C. Braun D.G. Brandner G. Covalent immunochemical membrane labeling of viable cells with K698-T708, a simian virus 40 tumor antigen-derived peptide.Pept Res. 1994; 7: 146-152PubMed Google Scholar; gift from Ari Helenius, ETH Zurich) and goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor647 (A21235; Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur or BD LSRII flow cytometer and data were processed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). ER stress was induced in MEFs by culturing cells in MEF medium with tunicamycin (T7765; Sigma-Aldrich) at the indicated concentrations. Induction of ER stress was assessed by immunoblotting for ATF6 or RT-PCR for splicing of the XBP-1u mRNA. For the the XBP-1u RT-PCR, RNA from stimulated cells was isolated with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using oligo-dT primers (SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System; Invitrogen). cDNAs of the XBP-1u (unspliced) and XBP-1s (spliced) mRNAs were detected by PCR amplification of a sequence surrounding the excised intron (forward: 5′-GAACCAGGAGTTAAGAACACG-3′; reverse: 5′-AGGCAACAGTGTCAGAGTCC-3′). SV40 was produced and titrated in simian CV-1 cells and crude virus extracts obtained as described (15Geiger R. Andritschke D. Friebe S. Herzog F. Luisoni S. Heger T. Helenius A. BAP31 and BiP are essential for dislocation of SV40 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For infection experiments, cells were seeded at a confluency of ∼60%. On the day of the experiment cells were washed with PBS and infection medium (RPMI, 3% BSA, 10 mm HEPES pH 6.8), then covered with SV40 infection inoculum for 4 h. Subsequently the inoculum was removed and replaced with MEF medium. Cells were detached with trypsin 16 h later and fixed for FACS staining of the large T antigen (see above). Cumulus oocytes complexes (COCs) were isolated from 4–5 weeks old mice, superovulated C57BL/6NTac (Taconic, Hudson, NY) mice. Sperm from Ube2j1−/− mice and wild type littermates were isolated from caudal epididymides. After 10 min at 37 °C/5% CO2, sperm cells were video documented, counted and normalized before incubation with COCs. Embryos of different developmental stages were counted once a day for 3 days. The remaining sperm were spread on glass microscopy slides, fixed for 10 min in 100% ethanol and morphologically assessed under a phase contrast microscope. Testes and epididymides were fixed in Bouin's solution or 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then processed into paraffin wax. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma 395B-1KT). For immunohistology, tissues were rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, CA). After blocking in 10% normal donkey serum, primary antibodies were applied in PBS for 2 h at 37°C. Sections were then washed, and immunolocalization was performed with DyLight-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), stained with 50 μg/ml lectin PNA (Molecular Probes) for 5 min and mounted using ProLong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen). Antibodies used were anti-VASA (AF2030, goat polyclonal, 0.3 μg/ml; R&D Biosystems, Minneapolis, MN) and anti-UBE2J1 (Ref. 5Mueller B. Klemm E.J. Spooner E. Claessen J.H. Ploegh H.L. SEL1L nucleates a protein complex required for dislocation of misfolded glycoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12325-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, rabbit polyclonal serum, 1/200, produced in our laboratory). Testes and epididymides were fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde, 3% paraformaldehyde with 5% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxidein veronal-acetate buffer. Epididymal sperm cells were embedded in agar prior to further processing. Samples were stained in block overnight with 0.5% uranyl acetate in veronal-acetate buffer (pH 6.0), then dehydrated and embedded in Embed-812 resin. 50-nm sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut UCT microtome with a Diatome diamond knife, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined using a FEI Tecnai Spirit at 80 keV. We inserted LoxP sites into introns 1 and 3 of the Ube2j1 gene to allow conditional ablation of Ube2j1 (Fig. 1A). Correctly targeted ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts and the resulting male chimeras were crossed to FLPe transgenic females to delete the Neo cassette in Exon 3, which is flanked by Frt sites. Whole body knock-out mice were obtained by crossing floxed mice to CMV-Cre transgenic animals. Intercrosses of Ube2j1+/− animals yielded progeny of all possible genotypes as assessed by PCR. MEFs were generated from fetuses on gestation day E13.5. RNA-Seq analysis confirmed the deletion of specifically exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 1B). Analysis of lysates from Ube2j1−/− MEFs showed the complete absence of the UBE2J1 protein as assessed by immunoblot. Levels of UBE2J1 in Ube2j1+/− MEFs were reduced by half, indicative of a gene dosage effect (Fig. 1C). The additional bands in the wild type and heterozygous samples with apparent molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (asterisk in Fig. 1C) might represent a so-far uncharacterized splice variant of Ube2j1. Indeed, exon junction analysis of the RNA-Seq data supported skipping of Exon 7 (data not shown). Litters from heterozygous parents were born at the expected Mendelian ratios (Fig. 1D), and the weight of P0.5 pups was similar for wild type, heterozygous, and knock-out animals (Fig. 1E, top panel). At weaning (P21), approximately half of the knock-out animals had died (Fig. 1D), the survivors were smaller in size and weighed significantly less than wild-type animals (Fig. 1E, bottom panel). Ube2j1+/− mice had intermediate body weights at P21 (Fig. 1E, bottom panel), concordant with intermediate expression levels of UBE2J1 seen in heterozygous MEFs (Fig. 1C). We identified milk spots 1 day after birth in both wild type and Ube2j1−/− mice, excluding the inability to feed as possible reason for the failure to thrive. We did not observe enhanced mortality in Ube2j1−/− animals after weaning. Thus, while the lack of Ube2j1 does not impair development or growth of embryos in the gestation phase, Ube2j1 is important for postnatal survival and growth. Removal of key components of a quality control pathway is expected to result in accumulation of misfolded proteins and might therefore activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, we did not observe constitutive activation of the UPR in Ube2j1−/− MEFs as judged by the splicing status of the Xbp-1 mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B), cleavage status of ATF6 (Fig. 3C), and protein (Fig. 2, A and B) or transcript levels (Fig. 2D and data not shown) of genes known to be up-regulated upon ER stress, unlike what was described in Derlin-2−/− MEFs (16Dougan S.K. Hu C.C. Paquet M.E. Greenblatt M.B. Kim J. Lilley B.N. Watson N. Ploegh H.L. Derlin-2-deficient mice reveal an essential role for protein dislocation in chondrocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, when we examined protein levels of ER proteins in MEFs (Fig. 2A) and in lysates prepared from different tissues (Fig. 2, B and C), we found that OS9, SEL1L, and EDEM1 levels were increased in Ube2j1−/− MEFs. The observed increase varied with tissue and/or cell-type examined. For example, OS9 was barely detectable in skin from wild type mice, but present at a much higher level in skin from a knock-out mouse. While the increase was modest in the large intestine (∼2-fold), changes in OS9 levels in MEFs (Fig. 2B), pancreas, thymus, and spleen were considerably higher (∼5–10-fold, Fig. 2B). Quantitative analysis of RNA-Seq data from MEFs did not show changes similar to those observed in the immunoblots (Fig. 2D and data not shown), implying that increased transcription of the corresponding genes is not the reason for this observation. Global regulation at the translational level also seems unlikely, because levels of other proteins, including components of the dislocation machinery such as HRD1, XTP3B, Derlin-1 or Derlin-2, were unaffected (Fig. 2A). The RNA-Seq data confirmed the absence specifically of exons 2 and 3 of Ube2j1 in Ube2j1−/− MEFs (Fig. 1B). Therefore we can conclude with confidence that similar RKPM values for other genes of interest, including those encoding ER quality control components, reflect similar levels of transcripts. Taken together, ablation of Ube2j1 results in the accumulation of specific proteins of the ER quality machinery, probably by their post-translational stabilization.FIGURE 2Ube2j1−/− MEFs and organs express higher levels of specific ER dislocation components, and Ube2j1−/− MEFs are more susceptible to SV40 infection. A, immunoblots of several components of the ER quality machinery in two independent Ube2j1+/+ (WT) or Ube2j1−/− (KO) MEF lines, respectively, show increased levels for specific ER quality control components in Ube2j1−/− MEFs.

Shown are average reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) values as determined by RNA-Seq from two independent MEF cell lines (passage 3) per genotype.

ER dislocation components are required for transport of SV40 from the ER to the cytosol (15Geiger R. Andritschke D. Friebe S. Herzog F. Luisoni S. Heger T. Helenius A.

An increase in the concentration of components involved in ER quality control might therefore facilitate escape of SV40 from the ER. We infected knock-out and wild type MEFs with SV40 and quantified infection 20 h later by flow cytometry using antibodies for SV40 large T antigen (TAg). Ube2j1−/− MEFs were indeed more susceptible to SV40 infection than WT MEFs (Fig. 2E). To test whether enhanced susceptibility of Ube2j1−/− MEFs to infection was not simply due to an increase in"
https://openalex.org/W2044640605,"Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABP2) potently suppresses the growth of various carcinomas, but the mechanism(s) that underlies this activity remains incompletely understood. CRABP2 displays two distinct functions. The classical function of this protein is to directly deliver retinoic acid (RA) to RA receptor (RAR), a nuclear receptor activated by this hormone, in turn inducing the expression of multiple antiproliferative genes. The other function of the protein is exerted in the absence of RA and mediated by the RNA-binding and stabilizing protein HuR. CRABP2 directly binds to HuR, markedly strengthens its interactions with target mRNAs, and thus increases their stability and up-regulates their expression. Here we show that the anticarcinogenic activities of CRABP2 are mediated by both of its functions. Transcriptome analyses revealed that, in the absence of RA, a large cohort of transcripts is regulated in common by CRABP2 and HuR, and many of these are involved in regulation of oncogenic properties. Furthermore, both in cultured cells and in vivo, CRABP2 or a CRABP2 mutant defective in its ability to cooperate with RAR but competent in interactions with HuR suppressed carcinoma growth and did so in the absence of RA. Hence, transcript stabilization by the CRABP2-HuR complex significantly contributes to the ability of CRABP2 to inhibit tumorigenesis. Surprisingly, the observations also revealed that HuR regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in nuclear pore formation and is required for nuclear import of CRABP2 and for transcriptional activation by RAR. The data thus point at a novel function for this important protein."

MIWI2-associated piRNAs are essential for silencing transposons during primordial germ cell development, and MIWI-bound piRNAs are required for normal spermatogenesis during adulthood in mice. Although piRNAs have long been regarded as germ cell-specific, increasing lines of evidence suggest that somatic cells also express piRNA-like RNAs (pilRNAs).

Based on small RNA deep sequencing and quantitative PCR analyses, pilRNA expression is dynamic and displays tissue specificity. Although pilRNAs are similar to pachytene piRNAs in both size and genomic origins, they have a distinct ping-pong signature. Furthermore, pilRNA biogenesis appears to utilize a yet to be identified pathway, which is different from all currently known small RNA biogenetic pathways. In addition, pilRNAs appear to preferentially target the 3′-UTRs of mRNAs in a partially complementary manner.

PIWI-interacting RNA piRNA-like small RNA interstitial cells of Cajal conditional knock-out small noncoding RNA coding sequence quantitative PCR nucleotide(s) Personal Genome Machine. During male germ cell development, repetitive sequence-derived piRNAs are mainly expressed in primordial germ cells in fetal testes, whereas nonrepetitive sequence-derived piRNAs are predominantly expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids in adult testes (9Aravin A.A.

Developmentally regulated piRNA clusters implicate MILI in transposon control.Science. 2007; 316: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Therefore, these two types of piRNAs are also called prepachytene and pachytene piRNAs, respectively. Prepachytene piRNAs are produced through the ping-pong mechanism and consist of repetitive sequence-derived primary and secondary transcripts, the production of which involves both MILI (enriched in primary transcripts) and MIWI2 (enriched in secondary transcripts) (6Aravin A.A.

On the one hand, the ping-pong positive feedback loop inhibits transposon expression through post-transcriptional cleavage of transposon transcripts (11Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M.

On the other hand, these transposon-derived piRNAs induce transposon silencing through piRNA-dependent DNA methylation (9Aravin A.A. Sachidanandam R. Girard A. Fejes-Toth K. Hannon G.J. Developmentally regulated piRNA clusters implicate MILI in transposon control.Science. 2007; 316: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). In contrast, pachytene piRNAs associate with MIWI and MILI, creating two subcategories of piRNAs: MILI-associated and MIWI-associated piRNAs (12Beyret E. Liu N. Lin H. piRNA biogenesis during adult spermatogenesis in mice is independent of the ping-pong mechanism.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These piRNAs do not show ping-pong characteristics such as secondary transcripts that are partially complementary to primary transcripts. Instead, pachytene piRNAs represent largely, if not exclusively, primary transcripts (12Beyret E. Liu N. Lin H. piRNA biogenesis during adult spermatogenesis in mice is independent of the ping-pong mechanism.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

However, a detailed characterization of this novel class of small RNAs expressed in somatic cells/tissues has been lacking. Here, we report the identification of hundreds of murine pilRNAs from small RNA libraries of murine testicular Sertoli cells, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) from the murine gastrointestinal tract, and murine small intestine, in addition to millions of murine stomach small RNAs that align to newly defined germ cell piRNA clusters. Our in-depth analyses revealed a high degree of similarities between these somatic pilRNAs and pachytene piRNAs in size, nucleotide composition, clustering, genomic origin, and potential targets. However, unlike pachytene piRNAs, pilRNAs have a distinct ping-pong signature. Finally, biogenesis of pilRNAs is mediated by an unidentified mechanism different from any of the currently known small RNA biogenetic pathways indicative of an entirely novel population of small RNAs.

Bloom T. Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome.Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5392) Google Scholar). Known piRNA-Seq data analysis was performed using Partek Genomic Suite (version 6.6; Partek, St. Louis, MO). Aligned reads were clustered into at least 15 nucleotide groups including overlapping reads. The resulting groups were aligned to mature piRNA sequences from the functional RNA database (2010/10/04 16:15:05 GMT+9), which contains a collection of small RNAs found associated with mouse PIWI proteins (30Mituyama T.

Resulting alignments to known germ cell piRNAs were classified as pilRNAs. To account for sequencing depth variation, the abundance of each pilRNA was normalized to the total aligned reads obtained from each sample, multiplied by 1 × 106, and averaged between biological replicates. pilRNAs with ≤1 read in all six libraries were removed from analysis. Resulting reads from PGM sequencing of wild-type stomach samples were mapped to mm9 using Ion Torrent Server Suite 3.2.1 t-map aligner (Invitrogen) (31Waterston R.H. Lindblad-Toh K. Birney E.

In-house python scripts were used to ascertain reads mapped within piRNA clusters and their corresponding nucleotide lengths and composition. Large RNA from adult wild-type mouse brain and testis was isolated using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with either DNaseI amplification grade (Invitrogen) or RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich). DNaseI treatment was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNase A treatment was performed at 37 °C for 60 min with 0.5 μg of RNase A in 1X DNaseI reaction buffer, followed by the same reaction conditions used for the DNaseI treatment (without the DNase). Using 1 μg of treated RNA, reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system kit with random hexamers (Invitrogen). A reaction volume of 20 μl was used, consisting of 10 μl of 2× GoTaq (Promega), 10 pmol of forward and reverse primer, and 1 μl of cDNA. PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 95 °C/2min, 28 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s), followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min.

Here, we compared TAP function and interaction with tapasin of a range of species within two classes of jawed vertebrates. We found that avian and mammalian TAP1 and TAP2 form heterodimeric complexes across taxa. Moreover, the extra N-terminal domain TMD0 of mammalian TAP1 and TAP2 as well as avian TAP2 recruits tapasin. Strikingly, however, only TAP1 and TAP2 from the same taxon can form a functional heterodimeric translocation complex. These data demonstrate that the dimerization interface between TAP1 and TAP2 and the tapasin docking sites for PLC assembly are conserved in evolution, whereas elements of antigen translocation diverged later in evolution and are thus taxon specific.

We report that pharmacological inhibition of CD39 in a cultured human mastocytoma cell line (HMC-1) and murine bone marrow-derived MC with ARL67156 (100 µM) increased ATP-induced renin release (≥2-fold), whereas purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) blockade with A740003 (3 µM) prevented it. Likewise, CD39 RNA silencing in HMC-1 increased ATP-induced renin release (≥2-fold), whereas CD39 overexpression prevented it. Acetaldehyde, an I/R product (300 µM), elicited an 80% increase in ATP release from HMC-1, in turn, causing an autocrine 20% increase in renin release. This effect was inhibited or potentiated when CD39 was overexpressed or silenced, respectively. Moreover, P2X7R silencing prevented ATP- and acetaldehyde-induced renin release. I/R-induced RAS activation in ex vivo murine hearts, characterized by renin and norepinephrine overflow and ventricular fibrillation, was potentiated (∼2-fold) by CD39 inhibition, an effect prevented by P2X7R blockade. Our data indicate that by regulating ATP availability at the MC surface, CD39 modulates local renin release and thus, RAS activation, ultimately exerting a cardioprotective effect."

By retaining catalytic activity in the crystalline state, the structure of the enzyme bound to the GlcNAc-6P product identifies the topology of the active site pocket and points to invariant residues Lys66 as a putative single catalyst, supported by the structure of the catalytically inactive K66A mutant in complex with substrate ManNAc-6P. 1H NMR-based time course assays of native NanE and mutated variants demonstrate the essential role of Lys66 for the epimerization reaction with participation of neighboring Arg43, Asp126, and Glu180 residues. These findings unveil a one-base catalytic mechanism of C2 deprotonation/reprotonation via an enolate intermediate and provide the structural basis for the development of new antimicrobial agents against this family of bacterial 2-epimerases.

The mechanisms that are involved in sucrose accumulation in sugarcane are not well understood, and little is known with regard to factors that control the extent of sucrose storage in the stalks. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase; EC 2.7.7.9) is an enzyme that produces UDP-glucose, a key precursor for sucrose metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis. The objective of this work was to gain insights into the ScUGPase-1 expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms that control protein activity. ScUGPase-1 expression was negatively correlated with the sucrose content in the internodes during development, and only slight differences in the expression patterns were observed between two cultivars that differ in sucrose content. The intracellular localization of ScUGPase-1 indicated partial membrane association of this soluble protein in both the leaves and internodes. Using a phospho-specific antibody, we observed that ScUGPase-1 was phosphorylated in vivo at the Ser-419 site in the soluble and membrane fractions from the leaves but not from the internodes. The purified recombinant enzyme was kinetically characterized in the direction of UDP-glucose formation, and the enzyme activity was affected by redox modification.

In this study we found that CK2 overexpression promotes Wts to phosphorylate Yki and in this way to suppress Yki activity in vitro. The function of CK2 on Wts is independent of the Hpo-induced Wts promotion, as knockdown of Hpo cannot block this function. In vivo, we found that CK2 overexpression suppresses hpo mutant-induced expanded (Ex) up-regulation and overgrowth phenotype, although it cannot affect wts mutant at all. Consistently, up-regulation of Hpo pathway target gene expressions is observed in tissues with CK2 depletion, indicating that loss of CK2 increases Yki activity. Meanwhile, our in vivo evidence also suggests a necessity of Drosophila CK2 for normal tissue growth as it acts as a cell death inhibitor and its depletion in developing discs induces caspase3 severely. Taken together, our results uncover a dual role of CK2 on regulating tissue growth. S2 cell were cultured in Drosophila Schneider's Medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Plasmid transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A construct of ubiquitin-Gal4 was cotransfected with pUAST expression vectors for all transfection experiments. For immunoprecipitation, Drosophila S2 cells were cultured for 3 days and then were collected and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were precleared by Protein A beads (GE Healthcare) and then incubated with indicated antibodies. Western blot analyses were performed according to standard protocols as previously described. Antibodies used were mouse anti-Myc (1:5000, Sigma), mouse anti-FLAG (1:5000, Sigma), mouse anti-V5 (1:5000, Invitrogen), mouse anti-HA (1:5000, Sigma), mouse anti-tubulin (1:1000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), mouse anti-histone (1:1000, Sigma), rabbit anti-Yki phosphorylated Ser-168 (Ser(P)-168) (1:500) was generated by Abgent. Double strand RNA (dsRNA) was designed and synthesized according to standard protocol. To perform knockdown experiment, S2 cells were diluted into 1 × 106 cells/ml with serum-free medium for 1 h of starvation with 15 μg/ml indicated dsRNA. Total RNA was extracted from S2 cells that express the indicated constructs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by ReverTra Ace synthesis kit (Toyobo). The real-time PCR was performed using ABI7500 System with SYBR Green real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) reagent. Primer sequences are available upon request. Real-time PCR was repeated for three independent biological replicates. Rp49 was used as a normalization control for all of the PCR reaction. For in vitro kinase assay, bacterial purified GST-Yki proteins were incubated with immunoprecipitated Wts or CK2 (expressed in S2 cells) and ATP (0.5 mm) in a kinase reaction buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2). Proteins were then subjected for Western analysis with Yki Ser(P)-168 antibody. For some phosphorylation mobility shift assays, Phos-Tag AAL-107 (FMS Laboratory, Hiroshima University, Japan) was introduced to enlarge the mobility shift. The operating procedure was according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all the mobility shift assays, the protein samples ran in an SDS-PAGE gel under a low voltage. To construct CK2α and CK2β transgenes, larva cDNA fragments corresponding to Drosophila CK2α and CK2β coding sequence were amplified by PCR and cloned into a pUAST-FLAG vector. The generation of transgenes at attP locus have been described previously. CK2α RNAi (17520R1, 17520R2) and CK2β RNAi (15224R1, 15224R2) were ordered from the National Institute of Genetics (NIG).

Fluorescent microscopy was performed on a Leica LAS SP5 confocal microscope; confocal images were obtained using the Leica AF Lite system. Images were processed in Photoshop CS. CK2 is widely expressed and involved in a lot of cellular processes. Both CK2 and Hippo signaling have been demonstrated to control cell proliferation and apoptosis. We wondered if CK2 affects Hippo pathway activity. The phosphorylation status of Yki, especially of Yki Ser-168, reflects the activity of Yki (30Oh H. Irvine K.D. Yorkie: the final destination of Hippo signaling.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We detected a dramatic increase of Yki Ser(P)-168 upon CK2 coexpression (CK2α plus CK2β; Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a phosphorylation mobility shift was observed in Phos-Tag gel (Fig. 1B, compare lane 4 with lane 1). Phos-Tag gel is used to separate phosphorylated proteins from those unphosphorylated (45Jin Y. Dong L. Lu Y. Wu W. Hao Q. Zhou Z. Jiang J. Zhao Y. Zhang L. Dimerization and cytoplasmic localization regulate Hippo kinase signaling activity in organ size control.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 5784-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yki Ser-168 is reported to be phosphorylated by Wts kinase; to figure out whether the entire Yki mobility shift band in Phos-Tag gel resulted from Wts-mediated phosphorylation, we repeated the above experiment using Yki-3SA whose Wts-mediated phosphorylation sites (Ser-111, Ser-168, and Ser-250) were mutated to alanine (46Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. Expression and localization of epitope-tagged protein kinase CK2.J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, coexpression of CK2 with Yki-3SA failed to induce shift band of Yki-3SA in Phos-Tag gel, suggesting that CK2 changes the phosphorylation status of Wts-targeted Yki sites. We also found that the increase of Yki phosphorylation is in response to CK2 kinase activity, as the CK2 kinase dead form (a lysine to arginine mutation at the 66 site of CK2α subunit) (46Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. Expression and localization of epitope-tagged protein kinase CK2.J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) failed to induce either Ser(P)-168 increase or Yki mobility shift in Phos-Tag gel (Fig. 1, A, lane 3, and B, lane 6). Moreover, neither CK2α expression nor CK2β expression was able to induce a dramatic Yki phosphorylation compared with the CK2 holoenzyme (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 4), suggesting CK2-induced Yki phosphorylation requires co-expression of both CK2α and CK2β subunits. Yki activity is tightly controlled by Hpo signaling via phosphorylation as well as protein-protein interactions (30Oh H. Irvine K.D. Yorkie: the final destination of Hippo signaling.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Wts phosphorylates Yki to induce binding between Yki and 14-3-3 protein to restrict Yki in cytosol and hence inhibits Yki activity. Because CK2 promotes Yki phosphorylation on Wts-targeted Yki sites, we sought to confirm whether the CK2-promoted Yki phosphorylation truly affects Yki activity. A cell fractionation experiment was performed to separate the nucleus from cytoplasm, and the distribution of Yki was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). In normal cellular conditions, Yki localizes predominantly in cytoplasm. Coexpression of CK2 moderately increases Yki cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 1C). We also noticed that Scalloped coexpression-induced Yki nuclear translocation was significantly affected by CK2 coexpression. As expected, coexpression of CK2KD was unable to drive Yki out of the nucleus, suggesting that CK2 kinase activity is necessary for its function on driving the Yki nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttle. In addition to the detection of Yki localization change, we checked the dynamic interaction between Yki and 14-3-3 protein (17Ren F. Zhang L. Jiang J. Hippo signaling regulates Yorkie nuclear localization and activity through 14-3-3-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Dev. Biol. 2010; 337: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The binding between Yki and 14-3-3 protein is enhanced when CK2, but not CK2KD, was coexpressed (Fig. 1D) although not as strong as Hpo/Wts coexpression-induced binding. Taken together, we provide evidence that CK2 promotes Yki phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization to inhibit Yki activity. To dissect the mechanism of how CK2 inhibits Yki activity, we tested whether CK2 directly phosphorylates Yki as it is a serine-threonine kinase. Considering that CK2 promotes Yki phosphorylation on Wts-targeted serine sites, we cotransfected Yki with CK2 in S2 cells with treatment of wts dsRNA to avoid the interference induced by Wts-induced Yki phosphorylation. The efficiency of wts dsRNA treatment was confirmed by mRNA quantification (Fig. 2A). To our surprise we found that CK2 no longer induced Yki phosphorylation upon Wts depletion (Fig. 2A, compare lane 4 with lane 2), indicating that CK2 only promotes Wts-induced Yki phosphorylation rather than directly phosphorylates Yki. To figure out how CK2 promotes Wts-induced Yki phosphorylation, we first coexpressed CK2 and Yki with Hpo depletion. Compared with Wts knockdown, Hpo knockdown decreased but not completely abolished CK2-promoted Yki Ser-168 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, compare lane 3 with lane 2), indicating that Hpo is not necessary for CK2-promoted Yki phosphorylation. To confirm the efficiency of hpo dsRNA treatment, the hpo mRNA level was quantified by real-time PCR (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we examined the effects of Ex depletion or Tao-1 depletion and found that neither blocks the CK2-promoted Yki Ser-168 phosphorylation. 4L. Hu, H. Huang, J. Li, M.-X. Yin, Y. Lu, W. Wu, R. Zeng, J. Jiang, Y. Zhao, and L. Zhang, unpublished data. These results suggest that CK2 promotes Yki phosphorylation possibly through enhancing Wts activity but independent of components upstream of Wts in Hpo signaling. To further confirm the function of CK2 on Wts-induced Yki phosphorylation, we carried out kinase assay using in vitro purified GST-Yki protein. When incubated with immunoprecipitated Wts from S2 cell lysates, GST-Yki was phosphorylated on Ser-168 (Fig. 2B, lane 2). We found that coexpression of CK2 and Wts significantly enhanced Wts-induced Ser-168 phosphorylation, which was not observed when CK2KD or each single CK2 subunit was coexpressed (Fig. 2B, compare lane 5 with lane 3, 4, 6, and 7), consistent with our findings in Fig. 2A. However, no matter if Wts was coexpressed or not, if Yki was incubated with immunoprecipitated CK2 in the kinase assay, Ser-168 was not phosphorylated (Fig. 2C), supporting our findings that CK2 does not directly phosphorylate Yki Ser-168 but promotes Wts-mediated Yki phosphorylation. Consistently, CK2 knockdown decreases Wts-mediated Yki Ser-168 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2D, depletion of CK2α decreases Yki phosphorylation levels, whereas CK2β knockdown does not make dramatic effects. In toto we conclude that CK2 induces Yki phosphorylation through promoting Wts activity. CK2 is known as a cell death suppressor in mammalian systems, whereas interestingly, we found that CK2 promotes Wts-induced Yki phosphorylation to suppress Yki activity. To address why CK2 suppresses Yki activity while it functions as a cell death suppressor, we used CK2 transgenic flies and CK2 RNAi flies for in vivo functional analyses.
