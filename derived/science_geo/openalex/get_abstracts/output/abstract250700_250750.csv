https://openalex.org/W1993987952,"A fundamental aspect of the biogenesis and function of eukaryotic messenger RNA is the quality control systems that recognize and degrade non-functional mRNAs. Eukaryotic mRNAs where translation termination occurs too soon (nonsense-mediated decay) or fails to occur (non-stop decay) are rapidly degraded. We show that yeast mRNAs with stalls in translation elongation are recognized and targeted for endonucleolytic cleavage, referred to as 'no-go decay'. The cleavage triggered by no-go decay is dependent on translation and involves Dom34p and Hbs1p. Dom34p and Hbs1p are similar to the translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 (refs 3, 4), indicating that these proteins might function in recognizing the stalled ribosome and triggering endonucleolytic cleavage. No-go decay provides a mechanism for clearing the cell of stalled translation elongation complexes, which could occur as a result of damaged mRNAs or ribosomes, or as a mechanism of post-transcriptional control."

https://openalex.org/W2022586495,"The function of the 30-kilodalton movement protein (MP) of tobacco mosaic virus is to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of viral progeny in an infected plant. A novel method for delivering non-plasmalemma-permeable fluorescent probes to the cytosol of spongy mesophyll cells of tobacco leaves was used to study plasmodesmatal size exclusion limits in transgenic plants that express the MP gene. Movement of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (F-dextran) with an average molecular mass of 9400 daltons and an approximate Stokes radius of 2.4 nanometers was detected between cells of the transgenic plants, whereas the size exclusion limit for the control plants was 700 to 800 daltons. No evidence of F-dextran metabolism in the leaves of the transgenic plants was found. Thus, the tobacco mosaic virus movement protein has a direct effect on a plasmodesmatal function."
https://openalex.org/W1983523125,"Voltage changes across the cell membrane control the gating of many cation-selective ion channels. Conserved from bacteria to humans1, the voltage-gated-ligand superfamily of ion channels are encoded as polypeptide chains of six transmembrane-spanning segments (S1–S6). S1–S4 functions as a self-contained voltage-sensing domain (VSD), in essence a positively charged lever that moves in response to voltage changes. The VSD ‘ligand’ transmits force via a linker to the S5–S6 pore domain ‘receptor’2, thereby opening or closing the channel. The ascidian VSD protein Ci-VSP gates a phosphatase activity rather than a channel pore, indicating that VSDs function independently of ion channels3. Here we describe a mammalian VSD protein (HV1) that lacks a discernible pore domain but is sufficient for expression of a voltage-sensitive proton-selective ion channel activity. Hv1 currents are activated at depolarizing voltages, sensitive to the transmembrane pH gradient, H+-selective, and Zn2+-sensitive. Mutagenesis of Hv1 identified three arginine residues in S4 that regulate channel gating and two histidine residues that are required for extracellular inhibition of Hv1 by Zn2+. Hv1 is expressed in immune tissues and manifests the characteristic properties of native proton conductances ( ). In phagocytic leukocytes4, are required to support the oxidative burst that underlies microbial killing by the innate immune system4,5. The data presented here identify Hv1 as a long-sought voltage-gated H+ channel and establish Hv1 as the founding member of a family of mammalian VSD proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2125753237,"Sea ice and dust flux increased greatly in the Southern Ocean during the last glacial period. Palaeorecords provide contradictory evidence about marine productivity in this region, but beyond one glacial cycle, data were sparse. Here we present continuous chemical proxy data spanning the last eight glacial cycles (740,000 years) from the Dome C Antarctic ice core. These data constrain winter sea-ice extent in the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean biogenic productivity and Patagonian climatic conditions. We found that maximum sea-ice extent is closely tied to Antarctic temperature on multi-millennial timescales, but less so on shorter timescales. Biological dimethylsulphide emissions south of the polar front seem to have changed little with climate, suggesting that sulphur compounds were not active in climate regulation. We observe large glacial-interglacial contrasts in iron deposition, which we infer reflects strongly changing Patagonian conditions. During glacial terminations, changes in Patagonia apparently preceded sea-ice reduction, indicating that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for different phases of CO2 increase during glacial terminations. We observe no changes in internal climatic feedbacks that could have caused the change in amplitude of Antarctic temperature variations observed 440,000 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2004543547,"CHIP — a co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase — not only targets chaperone substrates for degradation, but mediates Hsp70 turnover after misfolded substrates have been depleted. The sequential catalysis of the CHIP-associated chaperone adaptor and its bound substrate provides a mechanism for maintaining homeostasis by tuning chaperone levels appropriately to reflect the status of protein folding within the cytoplasm. Exposure of cells to various stresses often leads to the induction of a group of proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs, molecular chaperones)1,2. Hsp70 is one of the most highly inducible molecular chaperones, but its expression must be maintained at low levels under physiological conditions to permit constitutive cellular activities to proceed3,4. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is the transcriptional regulator of HSP gene expression5, but it remains poorly understood how newly synthesized HSPs return to basal levels when HSF1 activity is attenuated. CHIP (carboxy terminus of Hsp70-binding protein), a dual-function co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase, targets a broad range of chaperone substrates for proteasomal degradation6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we show that CHIP not only enhances Hsp70 induction during acute stress but also mediates its turnover during the stress recovery process. Central to this dual-phase regulation is its substrate dependence: CHIP preferentially ubiquitinates chaperone-bound substrates, whereas degradation of Hsp70 by CHIP-dependent targeting to the ubiquitin–proteasome system occurs when misfolded substrates have been depleted. The sequential catalysis of the CHIP-associated chaperone adaptor and its bound substrate provides an elegant mechanism for maintaining homeostasis by tuning chaperone levels appropriately to reflect the status of protein folding within the cytoplasm."

According to an increasing number of biochemical studies, these complexes are assembled into supercomplexes. However, little is known about the architecture of the proposed multicomplex assemblies. Here, we report the electron microscopic characterization of the two respiratory chain supercomplexes I1III2 and I1III2IV1 in bovine heart mitochondria, which are also two major supercomplexes in human mitochondria. After purification and demonstration of enzymatic activity, their structures in projection were determined by single particle image analysis. A difference map between the supercomplexes I1III2 and I1III2IV1 closely fits the x-ray structure of monocomplex IV and shows its location in the assembly. By comparing different views of supercomplex I1III2IV1, the location and mutual arrangement of complex I and the complex III dimer are discussed. Detailed knowledge of the architecture of the active supercomplexes is a prerequisite for a deeper understanding of energy conversion by mitochondria in mammals.

Detailed knowledge of the architecture of the active supercomplexes is a prerequisite for a deeper understanding of energy conversion by mitochondria in mammals. All living organisms use a series of integral membrane protein complexes for energy conversion and ATP synthesis. In eukaryotes, electrons are transported by the respiratory chain, starting from NADH via complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) or from succinate via complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the membrane integral electron carrier ubiquinol, complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase), the peripheral electron carrier cytochrome c, and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) to the terminal acceptor molecular oxygen (1Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The electron transport chain generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is used by complex V (FOF1-ATP synthase) to synthesize ATP. In the last decade, structures of the individual respiratory chain complexes from various organisms have been determined. Atomic models exist for bovine heart mitochondrial complex III (2Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and IV (3Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). A high resolution structure of complex I is not yet available, but electron microscopy indicates that it is L-shaped in all organisms investigated, and a 2.2-nm resolution map from cryoelectron microscopy exists for the bovine heart complex I (4Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).Two alternative models for the arrangement of the respiratory chain complexes in the membrane have been proposed. According to the currently favored random collision model (5Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), all components of the respiratory chain diffuse individually in the membrane, and electron transfer depends on the random, transient encounter of the individual protein complexes and the smaller electron carriers. In the solid state model (6Chance B. Williams G.R. Nature. 1955; 176: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) proposed 50 years ago, the substrate is channeled directly from one enzyme to the next. Recently isolated stoichiometric assemblies, so-called supercomplexes, support this model. Respiratory supercomplexes of different compositions have been described in bacteria (e.g. Paracoccus denitrificans (7Stroh A. Anderka O. Pfeiffer K. Yagi T. Finel M. Ludwig B. Schägger H. J. Biol.

In these studies, supercomplexes of various stoichiometries have been detected, such as assemblies of monomeric complex I (I1), dimeric complex III (III2), and complex IV in various copy numbers (IVx). A crucial function of these respiratory supercomplexes may be the stabilization of the individual complexes (7Stroh A. Anderka O. Pfeiffer K. Yagi T. Finel M. Ludwig B. Schägger H. J. Biol.

Kinetic evidence by inhibitor-titration studies in bovine heart mitochondria is consistent with both models for the arrangement of the respiratory chain complexes and suggests their coexistence (19Bianchi C.

But so far, the supramolecular architecture of a stoichiometrically defined supercomplex comprising all three complexes (I, III, and IV) has not been determined. By BN-PAGE analysis, the most abundant supercomplexes in bovine heart mitochondria are a supercomplex consisting of complex I and dimeric III and another supercomplex containing complexes I and dimeric III and IV with molecular masses of ∼1,500 kDa and 1,700 kDa, respectively (8Schägger H.

Spectrophotometric activity assays of complexes I and III were performed by a procedure modified from Ref. 8Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar at 20 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 75 mm imidazole, 200 μm β-NADH, 750 μm decylubiquinone, pH 7.4, but with 0.1% (w/v) digitonin. NADH:ubiquinol reductase activity of complex I was measured by the rotenone (50 μm)-sensitive oxidation of NADH (200 μm; ε 6.2 mm–1·cm–1) at a wavelength of 340 nm. The cytochrome c reductase activity of complex III was determined by the antimycin (5 μm)-sensitive cytochrome c reduction (70 μm; ε 21.1 mm–1·cm–1) at a wavelength of 550 nm. 10 mm KCN was added to inhibit cytochrome c oxidation by complex IV. To eliminate buffer-dependent effects during the measurements, the test buffer was incubated without protein, and the absorptions were observed. For the actual tests, the buffers with supercomplexes and substrates were observed at the given wavelengths (340 or 550 nm) for 1–3 min. The absorptions decreased linearly, and the decrease/time unit was determined. Afterward, the inhibitors rotenone or antimycin, respectively, were added. The decrease in absorption with the inhibitor was less than that without and was subtracted from the absorption before inhibition to determine the protein-dependent absorption change. All tests were performed three times, and the S.D. was determined.Electron Microscopy and Single Particle Analysis—The supercomplex samples were negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate, pH ∼4. Negative staining with 2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, pH 6.9, was also carried out and showed equivalent results. Electron micrographs were collected using a Philips CM120 at 120 kV under low dose conditions at a magnification of 45,000× on Kodak SO-163 electron image film. The negatives were checked by optical diffraction for correct defocus and lack of drift and astigmatism and digitized on a PhotoScan scanner (Z/I Imaging, Aalen, Germany) at a pixel size of 7 μm, corresponding to 1.56 Ä on the specimen. Subsequently, adjacent pixels were averaged to yield a pixel size of 4.67 Ä. The images were processed using Imagic V (Image Science Software GmbH, Berlin, Germany).RESULTSTo structurally characterize the supercomplexes, bovine heart mitochondria were solubilized with 1% (w/v) digitonin at a ratio of 28 g of digitonin/1 g of protein. Afterward, the solubilizate was separated by BN-PAGE. The protein pattern of respiratory chain complexes resembles that in previous reports (8Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 14Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It shows the individual complexes I–V, as well as two prominent supercomplex bands, namely I1III2 (consisting of one complex I and a dimer of complex III; 1,500 kDa) and I1III2IV1 (with one additional complex IV; 1,700 kDa) and some minor supercomplex bands of higher molecular masses (Fig. 1, a and b). Solubilization was performed at a detergent-to-protein ratio far above the 2–4 g of digitonin/1 g of protein needed for quantitative extraction of the respiratory chain complexes (8Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 16Krause F. Reifschneider N.H. Goto S. Dencher N.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This was done to obtain I1III2 and I1III2IV1 as the two predominant supercomplex species (Fig. 1, a and b) while minimizing the amounts of complex V dimers, which because of their comparable mass (∼1,500 kDa) would comigrate with I1III2. In addition, sharper protein bands were obtained. The employed detergent-to-protein ratio thus facilitated the isolation of the supercomplexes I1III2 and I1III2IV1.For biochemical and structural characterization, supercomplexes I1III2 and I1III2IV1 were excised from the gel and electroeluted. The integrity of the purified supercomplexes was verified by an additional BN-PAGE (Fig. 1c) to detect supercomplex fragments, which might arise during electroelution. Supercomplex I1III2IV1 remained intact after isolation, whereas in the supercomplex I1III2 sample, two minor bands representing complexes I (∼1,000 kDa) and III2 (500 kDa) were present (Fig. 1c). The composition of both supercomplexes was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting. In total, 20 subunits of the integrated complexes were identified, e.g. the 49- and 30-kDa subunits from complex I, core protein II from complex III, and subunit IV from complex IV (data not shown).The enzymatic activity of each supercomplex component was tested to confirm their functional integrity after isolation. NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I and cytochrome c oxidase activity of complex IV, respectively, were visualized by in-gel activity staining. NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I was displayed by purple bands resulting from in-gel formazan precipitation (10Krause F. Scheckhuber C.Q. Werner A. Rexroth S. Reifschneider N.H. Dencher N.A.

Thus, complex I activity for supercomplexes I1III2 and I1III2IV1, as well as complex IV activity for supercomplex I1III2IV1 in the isolated samples, were demonstrated (Fig. 1, d and e). Spectrophotometric activity assays using specific inhibitors were employed to assess NADH:ubiquinol reductase activity of complex I and cytochrome c reductase activity of complex III in the electroeluted samples. For the latter activity, no in-gel assay exists (28Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, complex I in supercomplex I1III2 displayed about half the activity of that in supercomplex I1III2IV1 (Table 1). Complex III was active in supercomplex I1III2IV1, but supercomplex I1III2 showed only minor cytochrome c reductase activity (Table 1). In conclusion, both isolated supercomplexes displayed activity, but supercomplex I1III2IV1 was significantly more active.TABLE 1Spectrometric activity measurements of the isolated supercomplex I1III2 and I1III2IV1ActivitiesNADH:ubiquinol reductaseCytochrome c reductasemilliunits/mg proteinSupercomplex I1III20.13 ± 0.040.06 ± 0.02Supercomplex I1III2IV10.30 ± 0.110.99 ± 0.28 Open table in a new tab For electron microscopy, the purified supercomplexes I1III2 and I1III2IV1 were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate (Fig. 2). Electron micrographs of both supercomplex samples showed predominantly triangular particles measuring 30–33 nm on the longest side (Fig. 2). In addition, smaller particles were seen in the I1III2 sample (Fig. 2a). As there are no other proteins present in the sample, the smaller particles might be individual complex III dimer arising from partial disintegration of the supercomplex. This observation is consistent with the minor supercomplex I1III2 dissociation seen on BN-PAGE (Fig. 1c). Another less frequent view on the micrographs is an L-shaped particle (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Transmission electron microscopic images of isolated supercomplexes I1III2 (a) and I1III2IV1 (b). Triangular views are indicated by red circles and L-shaped views by yellow circles.

Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). 14% of the selected particles did not align well and were rejected.All classes displayed asymmetrical triangles, with three sides of different lengths (Fig. 3). Two orientations with a bright stain-excluding density pointing either right or left were present. The view with the density pointing right represented ∼80% of the particles (Figs. 3a and 4a) and the other ∼20% (Figs. 3b and 4d). All classes of the same orientation displayed similar general features with no pronounced differences. It can be concluded that the two views represent the two preferential orientations of the supercomplexes on the carbon support film with opposite sides attached to the film. Apparently, one orientation is preferred over the other.FIGURE 3Class averages of supercomplex I1III2IV1 triangular views. a, the majority of classes show the same view with the same orientation on the carbon support film. This top view shows the supercomplex seen from the intermembrane space (see “Results”). b, a minor group of classes represents the opposite orientation, a view from the matrix side.

To derive the two top views (a and d) from the side view (e), the film would be on the bottom (red line) or on the top (green line) of the side view, respectively. Because the red and the green lines are not parallel in e, the top views in a and d are not mirror images. f, top view of the bovine complex IV x-ray structure as seen from the intermembrane space (green, Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1OCC).

This was characterized by a bright stain-excluding line of ∼3 nm width. ∼300 particles of this view of supercomplex I1III2IV1 were selected. After alignment and averaging, the resulting image showed two large protrusions on one side of the bright line, whereas the other surface appeared smooth (Fig. 4e).Based on their known electron microscopic and x-ray structures, the protrusions in this view can be assigned unambiguously to the individual complexes I and III2. Comparison with a recent negative stain projection map of the bovine heart complex I (Fig. 5a) (30Bostina M.

The membrane domain of complex I in the supercomplex extends along to the smaller protrusion in this view. The bright line around the supercomplex can be interpreted as the transmembrane domains of the protein decorated by detergent and possibly Coomassie stain from the BN-PAGE. Hence, this class represents a side view along the plane of the membrane.FIGURE 5Alternative arrangements of the complexes I and III2 in supercomplex I1III2IV1. a, projection structure of bovine complex I, average of 300 particles (from Ref. 30Bostina M.

Complex III2 is in the lower part of the supercomplex, and the remaining density in the upper part is the membrane arm of complex I. The matrix arm is indicated by the white stain-depleted right corner. Thus complex IV shares a large contact surface with complex I and only a small one with III2. h, (model 2), complex III2 is in the upper part of the supercomplex. The remaining mass in the lower part is the membrane arm of complex I. Thus complex IV is sharing a large contact surface with III2 but makes only little contact with complex I.

https://openalex.org/W2002168939,"Some botanists think that plant species don't really exist: they are a product of the human imagination. Claims of extensive hybridization among the likes of oaks, blackberries and dandelions have encouraged the idea that individual, discrete species are a nonsense. Zoologists in the main seem content with the concept of animal species. The idea of a species has now been tested by measuring phenotypic and reproductive distinctness of over 400 genera of plants and animals. The results show that difficulty in pinning species names to vague clusters of individuals, when it does occur, is more likely to result from asexual reproduction, polyploidy (multiple chromosomes) and over-differentiation by taxonomists than it is to be due to hybridization between distinct, sexual species. In fact, plant species are more likely than animal species to represent reproductively independent lines. Analysis of phenetic and/or crossing relationships in over 400 genera of plants and animals shows that although discrete phenotypic clusters exist in most genera (more than 80%), the correspondence of taxonomic species to these clusters is poor (less than 60%) and no different between plants and animals. However, crossability data indicate that 70% of taxonomic species and 75% of phenotypic clusters in plants correspond to reproductively independent lineages. Many botanists doubt the existence of plant species1,2,3,4,5, viewing them as arbitrary constructs of the human mind, as opposed to discrete, objective entities that represent reproductively independent lineages or ‘units of evolution’. However, the discreteness of plant species and their correspondence with reproductive communities have not been tested quantitatively, allowing zoologists to argue that botanists have been overly influenced by a few ‘botanical horror stories’, such as dandelions, blackberries and oaks6,7. Here we analyse phenetic and/or crossing relationships in over 400 genera of plants and animals. We show that although discrete phenotypic clusters exist in most genera (> 80%), the correspondence of taxonomic species to these clusters is poor (< 60%) and no different between plants and animals. Lack of congruence is caused by polyploidy, asexual reproduction and over-differentiation by taxonomists, but not by contemporary hybridization. Nonetheless, crossability data indicate that 70% of taxonomic species and 75% of phenotypic clusters in plants correspond to reproductively independent lineages (as measured by postmating isolation), and thus represent biologically real entities. Contrary to conventional wisdom8, plant species are more likely than animal species to represent reproductively independent lineages."

Here, we show for the first time that mature amyloid fibrils produced from full-length recombinant mammalian prion protein (rPrP) were highly toxic to cultured cells and primary hippocampal and cerebella neurons. Fibrils induced apoptotic cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The toxic effect of fibrils was comparable with that exhibited by soluble small β-oligomers generated from the same protein. Fibrils prepared from insulin were not toxic, suggesting that the toxic effect was not solely due to the highly polymeric nature of the fibrillar form. The cell death caused by rPrP fibrils or β-oligomers was substantially reduced when expression of endogenous PrPC was down-regulated by small interfering RNAs. In opposition to the β-oligomer and amyloid fibrils of rPrP, the monomeric α-helical form of rPrP stimulated neurite out-growth and survival of neurons.

A common feature among these and other “conformational” diseases is the conversion of specific proteins or peptides into polymeric forms that are characterized by cross-β-sheet structures and referred to as amyloid (3Sipe J.C.

For the past several years, a substantial body of evidence has accumulated indicating that soluble oligomers are toxic species that are actively involved in the impairment of cellular functions in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, non-fibrillar oligomers have been shown to be intrinsically toxic to cells even when formed from proteins that are not related to any known conformational disease (20Bucciantini M.

This implies that oligomeric species share a common mechanism of cytotoxicity regardless of the specific protein from which they are generated (22Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. McIntire T.M.

On the other hand, there is considerable debate as to whether mature amyloid fibrils also exhibit toxicity and are responsible for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases (8Walsh D.M. Klyubin I.

In the prevailing opinion, formation of mature fibrils and their co-aggregation into deposits and plaques is considered to be a protective mechanism that evolved in nature to avoid the high intrinsic toxicity of soluble oligomers (20Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar, 24Caughey B. Lansbury P.T.

Determining the relationship between toxicity and the physical state of protein is essential for the identification of the pathogenic species and developing effective therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases. To establish a link between toxicity and the physical state of a protein, we tested the effect of full-length mammalian prion protein (rPrP) 5The abbreviations used are: rPrP, recombinant full-length prion protein; PrPC, cellular isoform of the prion protein; PrPSc, disease-associated isoform of the prion protein; PLL, polylysine; siRNA, small interfering RNA. presented in three conformationally different isoforms to cultured cells and primary neurons. These three isoforms are α-helical monomers, referred to as α-rPrP, β-sheet rich oligomers, referred to as the β-oligomer, and mature amyloid fibrils. To date the studies on toxicity of mammalian prions have been mostly confined to a short synthetic PrP-derived peptide encompassing residues 106-126 or to PrPSc. Although both PrPSc extracted from scrapie brains and aged solutions of synthetic PrP-(106-126) were reported to induce apoptotic cell death in primary neurons (27Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2275-2286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the identity of the cytotoxic species remains uncertain. The difficulties in establishing the origin of cytotoxic effects are largely due to the heterogeneous nature of PrPSc aggregates, which are known to consist of a mixture of fibrils and non-fibrillar oligomeric species (32Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Science. 2005; 437: 257-261Google Scholar) and also due to possible impact of non-protein components that are tightly associated with PrPSc (33Appel T.R. Dumpitak C. Matthiesen U. Riesner D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1295-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Zou W. Zheng J. Gray D.M. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1380-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we report for the first time that both the soluble β-oligomeric species and mature amyloid fibrils produced from the full-length prion protein are highly toxic to cultured cells and primary neurons. As in the case for PrPSc-induced toxicity, the toxicity of the fibrils and the β-oligomers was dependent on expression of endogenous PrPC. Several lines of evidence indicate that cell death occurred via an apoptotic mechanism. In opposition to the fibrils and to the β-oligomers, α-rPrP stimulated neurite outgrowth and prolonged neuronal survival. These finding illustrate the remarkable ability of cells to recognize three conformationally different isoforms of the prion protein and provide insight into possible origin of neuron loss during prion infection. Protein Purification and Refolding—Recombinant mouse full-length PrP encompassing residues 23-230 was expressed, purified, and refolded into the α-helical form (α-rPrP) as described previously (35Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6776-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The purified rPrP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry to be a single species with an intact disulfide bond (purity >99%). The conformation and monomeric state of α-rPrP was confirmed by circular dichroism and by size-exclusion chromatography, respectively (13Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Conversion of rPrP to the β-oligomeric form and to the amyloid fibrils was performed as previously described using partially denatured conditions (13Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To form amyloid fibrils from insulin, an aqueous solution of bovine insulin (Sigma) was prepared at a concentration of 1 mm, the pH was then adjusted to 2.0 with HCl, and the solution was incubated overnight at 65 °C as described previously (36Krebs M.R.H. MacPhee C.E. Miller A.F. Dunlop I.E. Dobson C.M. Donald A.M. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14420-14424Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The β-oligomers and the amyloid fibrils of rPrP and insulin were dialyzed in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, and kept in stock at concentrations equivalent to 50 μm. rPrP isoforms and insulin fibrils were administered directly to the cultured cells by diluting the stock solutions to final concentrations of 0.1-1 μm as indicated. Cell Cultures—Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (ATCC), mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells (ATCC), mouse fibroblasts NIH-3T3 cells (ATCC), and human NT2 (nondifferentiated) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultured cells were plated at a density of ∼8000 cells/cm2 in 8-well Pemanox Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nagel NUNC Inc.) coated with poly-l-lysine (PLL, 10 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Because toxicity experiments lasted for up to 4 days, we blocked the cell proliferation by reducing the fetal bovine serum percentage in the culture medium from 10 to 1% when rPrP isoforms were administered to the culture medium. Primary Neuronal Cells—Hippocampi were obtained from E18 Wistar rats as described by Maar et al. (37Maar T. Moran J. Schousboe A. Pasantes-Morales H. Int. J. Dev.

After dissection, the hippocampi were cleared from blood vessels and meninges, mechanically chopped, and trypsinized. The neurons were washed in the presence of DNase and trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and the cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were plated at a density ∼40,000 cells/cm2 in 8-well Lab-Tek Pemanox chamber slides either directly or after PLL-coating in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 2 mm Glutamax, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 mm HEPES, and 4% w/v bovine serum albumin. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Cerebella neurons were isolated from 5-day pups and cultivated using the same procedure. rPrP isoforms were administered at final concentrations of 0.1-1 μm as indicated either1hor2 days after plating neuronal cells, and the cells were incubated for an additional period of time before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.01 m sucrose for 20 min. Neurons were identified with primary rabbit anti-GAP43 antibodies (1:700), and secondary antibodies were labeled with Alexa 488 (1:1000). During the final washing stages the cells were counterstained with Hoechst-33258 to visualize their nuclei. To analyze the neurite outgrowth, images of at least 300 neurons for each group were obtained with a 20×/0.50 NA objective using a cooled 12-bit CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics). From these images neurite outgrowth was estimated using the software program Process Length (Protein Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark) as described by Ronn et al. (39Ronn L.C. Ralets I. Hartz B.P. Bech M. Berezin A. Berezin V. Moller A. Bock E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 100: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Assay and Apoptotic Cell Death—The toxicity of rPrP isoforms was measured on living cells using staining with Hoechst-33342 (Molecular Probes). Hoechst-33342 permeates non-fixed cells and, therefore, has been commonly used for distinguishing dying cells from living cells based on the intensity of nuclei staining. Hoechst-33258 has been used for fixed cells. Apoptotic cells were identified by characteristic bright blue fluorescence of nuclei that appears due to condensed or fragmented chromatin. Digital images were captured from 10 random fields for each sample (∼500 cells total) using an inverted microscope. Cell death rate was determined by counting bright cells including cells with fragmented or condensed nuclei and expressed as a percentage of total number of cells. Statistical analysis was made for 3 or 4 independent experiments for each cell type. Apoptosis was monitored by measuring DNA fragmentation with Hoechst-33342, caspase-3 activation, the movement of phosphatidylserine from the internal to the external surface of the cell membrane (annexin assay), and membrane blebbing (calcein assay). The caspase-3 activity was estimated by a caspase 3-R110 assay (Molecular Probes) using D2-R110 as a substrate according to the manufacturer's procedure. D2-R110 is cell-permeable and was used on living cells (40Hug H. Los M. Hirt W. Debatin K.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13906-13911Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylserine on the external surface and propidium iodide uptake were visualized simultaneously using the annexin V-Alexa 488 apoptosis detection kit (Vibrant apoptosis assay kit 2, Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This double staining discriminates the early stages of apoptosis from necrosis. Membrane blebbing was visualized by staining non-fixed cells with calcein AM (41Gatti R. Beletti S. Orlandini G. Bussolati O. Dall'Asta V. Gazzola C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit, Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Caspase-3 Activity—SH-SY5Y cells were cultivated in 60-mm Petri dishes for 24 h before administration of rPrP (1 μm) and then incubated for additional 20 h. Non adherent and adherent cells were collected and solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with rabbit anti caspase-3 antibody (cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175) antibody, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) that recognizes active caspase-3 subunits. Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA) Transfection—SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siRNA specific for human PrP (siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA, Dharmacon, Dallas, TX) or with non-targeting siRNA pool (Dharmacon). One day before the transfection cells were plated at a density of ∼60,000 cells/well in 24-well culture plates or in 4-well Lab-Tek Pemanox chamber slides in 400 ml of growth medium without antibiotics. The siRNAs were transfected at final concentrations of 50 or 150 nm mixed with 1.2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were cultured for 3 days, and PrP gene knockdown was confirmed by fluorescence immunostaining using 3F4 antibody (1:1000) followed by secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies labeled with Alexa 488 and by Western blot using anti-PrP AG4 antibodies (1:1000). For fluorescence, immunostaining cells were treated with 0.2% saponin. siGLORISC-Free siRNA (Dharmacon) was used as negative control and as transfection marker. Efficiency of transfection for SH-SY5Y cells was ∼80%. Fluorescence Microscopy—Microscopy was carried out on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) with an illumination system X-Cite 120 (EXFO Photonics Solutions Inc.) connected through fiber optics using a 1.3 aperture Plan Fluor 100× NA and 20×/0.50 NA objectives. Digital images were acquired using a cooled 12-bit CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics). Statistical Analysis—Data on cell death were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements supplemented with Newman-Keuls post-comparison test. Statistical comparison of results was made in the GraphPad Prism software package, Version 4 (San Diego, CA). Significance was expressed as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Preparation of Conformationally Distinct Isoforms of rPrP—Elucidating the potential toxicity of conformationally distinct isoforms requires preparation of relatively homogeneous species of each isoform. All three isoforms of rPrP (α-rPrP, β-oligomer, and amyloid fibrils) were prepared according to the experimental procedures that we have previously described (13Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To prepare homogeneous samples of the β-oligomer and fibrils, we took advantage of the fact that these two isoforms can be produced selectively under different solvent conditions and that the β-oligomer is not on the kinetic pathway to amyloid fibrils (13Bocharova O.V.

Chem. 2004; 279: 586-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Differences in the physical properties of rPrP isoforms were confirmed using several biophysical techniques including circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (to confirm secondary structure), size-exclusion chromatography (to confirm the oligomerization state), thioflavin T assay, electron microscopy, and epifluorescence microscopy (to confirm fibrillar structures) (13Bocharova O.V.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6776-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the preparation of α-rPrP no fibrils were found; however, ∼5% of total rPrP was the β-oligomer species as determined by the size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The preparation of β-oligomer contained less than 10% of the monomeric α-rPrP species as was quantified by size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). However, samples of the β-oligomers were free of amyloid fibrils as judged from electron microscopy, thioflavin T binding assay (data not shown), and epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1a). The preparations of amyloid fibrils contained less than 1% of the monomeric α-rPrP as determined by the size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown) but were free of any detectible amount of the β-oligomeric species as judged from electron microscopy (data not shown) and epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1b). Most importantly, the preparations of the β-oligomers were free of amyloid fibrils, and vice versa. Amyloid Fibrils and the β-Oligomers but Not α-rPrP Are Toxic to Cultured Cells and Primary Neurons—The toxicities of all three rPrP isoforms were assessed using four cultured cell lines and two primary neuron cultures. rPrP isoforms were added to the cultured cells at concentrations equivalent to 0.5 μm and incubated for 48 h, and the percent cell death was measured using the Hoechst-33342 assay (Fig. 2). Dying cells stain very strongly in the Hoechst assay and show bright fluorescence, whereas nuclei of healthy cells display only dim staining (Fig. 2e). Amyloid fibrils were found to be toxic to all cultured cell lines tested: 3T3, NT2, N2a, and SH-SY5Y (Fig. 2, a-d). The percent cell death observed in cells treated with the β-oligomer was lower than that found in cells treated with fibrils. α-rPrP showed a very minor toxic effect, which was comparable with that observed in control cells. This minor toxic effect could be due to the presence of minor amounts of the β-oligomer in the preparation of the α-monomeric species. Cell lines showed the same rank order with respect to their susceptibilities to toxicity induced by the amyloid fibrils and the β-oligomer (Fig. 2, a-d). To test whether the toxic effect of amyloid fibrils is limited to cultured cells or not, we used primary hippocampal and cerebellar neurons. Primary neuronal cultures are a more appropriate model to study toxicity because they are terminally differentiated. Two protocols for plating neuronal cells were applied; cells were plated on PLL either for 1 h (i) or for 2 days (ii) before administration of rPrP isoforms. The second format allowed cells to grow and produce neurites before incubating with rPrP. We found that both the β-oligomer and amyloid fibrils were highly toxic to hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3, a and b) and cerebellar neurons (Fig. 3c). High toxicity of both abnormal isoforms was observed regardless of the format for plating cells. Specifically, the β-oligomer and fibrils induced death in up to ∼90 and ∼80% of the population of neuronal cells, respectively, that were precultivated for 1 h before the addition of rPrP (Fig. 3a). Precultivation of cells for 2 days reduced the size of the cell population susceptible to the toxic effects of the β-oligomer and amyloid fibrils to ∼60 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 3b). Toxicity was dose-dependent (Fig. 3b) and time-dependent (Fig. 3a). Cell death in neuronal cultures treated with α-rPrP only slightly exceeded that observed in control samples (Fig. 3, a-c). Small amounts of the β-oligomer species found in the preparations of α-rPrP could account for this minor effect. Visual observation of neuronal cells stained for the neuronal marker GAP43 revealed that α-rPrP did not interfere with the outgrowth of neurites. Hippocampal cells cultivated in the presence of α-rPrP produced numerous long neurites in a manner similar to that found in the control group of cells (Fig. 3e). In contrast, cells cultivated in the presence of either β-oligomer or amyloid fibrils were characterized by a substantial reduction in number of neurites per cell and by shortening of neurite length. Taken together, our data illustrated that both β-oligomer and amyloid fibrils were toxic to cultured cells and to primary neuronal cells. Primary neuronal cells were more susceptible to the toxic effect than cultured cells. Suppression of Endogenous PrPC Expression by siRNAs Abolishes the Toxic Effect of the Fibrils and the β-Oligomer—Because endogenously expressed PrPC was previously shown to be essential for mediating the toxic effect of extracellular PrPSc (43Brandner S.

Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), we were interested to test whether down-regulation of PrPC abolishes the toxic effect of abnormal rPrP isoforms. To down-regulate the expression of PrPC, we used anti-PrP siRNAs. As judged from the immunofluorescence staining and from Western blotting, the level of PrPC expression in SH-SY5Y cells displayed dose-dependent response to transfection of cultured cells with siRNAs (Fig. 4, a and b). The PrPC expression was found to be substantially reduced upon transfection with 150 nm siRNAs. The toxic effect of both the β-oligomer and fibrils was abolished when cultured cells were transfected with anti-PrP siRNAs (Fig. 4, c and d) but not with non-targeting siRNAs (Fig. 4, c and d). These data indicate that endogenously expressed PrPC mediates the toxic effects of both abnormal isoforms. Next we were interested in determining whether the β-oligomer or amyloid fibrils induced cell death through apoptotic or necrotic mechanisms. Amyloid Fibrils and the β-Oligomer Induce Apoptosis—Cell death can be divided into two main types, programmed (apoptotic) and necrotic cell death. During apoptosis the cells display membrane blebbing, flipping of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane, nuclear fragmentation, and activation of a family of cysteine proteases, referred to as caspases. To test whether the cells treated with abnormal isoforms of rPrP undergo apoptosis, we employed several aforementioned assay"

https://openalex.org/W1975247881,"The proliferation and migration of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are key events in the vascular restenosis that frequently follows angioplasty. Furthermore, SMC migration and neointimal hyperplasia are promoted by degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Because we demonstrated previously that the proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) stimulates SMC proliferation (Chandrasekar, B., Mummidi, S., Valente, A. J., Patel, D. N., Bailey, S. R., Freeman, G. L., Hatano, M., Tokuhisa, T., and Jensen, L. E. (2005) J. Biol.

IL-18 treatment increased both mRNA and protein expression of MMP9 in human coronary artery SMCs. Gel shift, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a strong induction of IL-18-mediated AP-1 (c-Fos, c-Jun, and Fra-1) and NF-κB (p50 and p65) activation and stimulation of MMP9 promoter-dependent reporter gene activity in an AP-1- and NF-κB-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of p65, c-Fos, c-Jun, and Fra-1 induced MMP9 promoter activity. Specific antisense or small interfering RNA reagents for these transcription factors reduced IL-18-mediated MMP9 transcription. Furthermore, IL-18 stimulated SMC migration in an MMP9-dependent manner. Atorvastatin effectively suppressed IL-18-mediated AP-1 and NF-κB activation, MMP9 expression, and SMC migration.

Mummidi S. Valente A.J. Patel D.N. Bailey S.R. Freeman G.L. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. Jensen L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26263-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether IL-18 induces SMC migration. Both migration and proliferation play a role in normal and diseased vessels (1Ross R. Am.

Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6891) Google Scholar). SMC migration contributes to normal angiogenesis. However, SMC migration also plays a causal role in pathological remodeling of the vessel walls during atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and restenosis following angioplasty (1Ross R. Am.

Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6891) Google Scholar).Vessel wall remodeling is characterized by a disruption in the delicate balance between extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and degradation, with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs)) playing a prominent role. MMPs are zinc-dependent proteases and are classified as collagenases, stromelysins, elastases, and gelatinases based on substrate specificity. Their expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. They are synthesized as proenzymes and are activated following proteolytic cleavage. SMCs express MMP2 (gelatinase A) and MMP9 (gelatinase B), the two gelatinases described so far (12Galis Z.S. Khatri J.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Excess activation of MMP2 and MMP9, without alteration of TIMP expression and activation, results in destruction of the ECM and can lead to pathological remodeling and vascular restenosis (12Galis Z.S. Khatri J.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar, 13Ikeda U. Shimada K. Clin. Cardiol. 2003; 26: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Newby A.C.

Because increased matrix degradation promotes SMC migration (15Cho A. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that IL-18 induces SMC migration via induction of MMP9. Our novel findings demonstrate that IL-18 promotes SMC migration in an MMP9-dependent manner. IL-18 induced MMP9 expression via activation of AP-1 (activator protein-1) and NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB). We demonstrate that atorvastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, inhibits IL-18-mediated SMC migration by attenuating AP-1 and NF-κB activation and MMP9 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human IL-18 (catalog no.

Normal rabbit IgG (control IgG) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). MG-132, wortmannin, SH-5, and (±)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine were purchased from EMD Biosciences. Anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibodies and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Atorvastatin was a kind gift from Pfizer.Cell Culture—Normal human coronary artery SMCs were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego CA) and grown in SmGM-2 medium supplied by the manufacturer. At 70–80% confluency, the culture medium was replaced with basal medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (conditioning medium). After a 24-h incubation, recombinant human IL-18 was added and cultured for the indicated time periods. At the end of the experimental period, culture supernatants were collected into slick tubes and snap-frozen. Cells were harvested, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. To determine whether IL-18 induces arterial SMC migration directly or is mediated by intermediaries such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, cells were pretreated with the respective neutralizing antibodies (5 μg/ml for 1 h) prior to IL-18 addition. Normal goat IgG at a similar concentration served as a control. The efficacy of these antibodies was verified in transient transfection assays using SMC transfected with the pNF-κB-Luc or pGAS-Luc vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (16Chandrasekar B. Vemula K.

The transfection efficiency of SMCs was determined using pEGFP-N1 and found to be 34.8 ± 2.13%. Ectopic expression of p65, p50, c-Fos, c-Jun, and Fra-1 was carried out using the corresponding expression vectors. Human dnAkt1 was overexpressed in SMCs using a recombinant adenoviral vector containing hemagglutinin-tagged dnAkt1 (Ad-CMV-dnAkt1(T308A/S473A), where Ad is adenovirus and CMV is cytomegalovirus; Vector BioLabs) (20Chandrasekar B.

Infection with green fluorescent protein (Ad-CMV-GFP, catalog no. 1060, Vector BioLabs) was used as a viral control. To determine the role of PI3K and Akt in IL-18-mediated MMP9 expression, SMCs were treated with wortmannin (50 nm in Me2SO), SH-5 (1 μm in Me2SO), phosphate-buffered saline, or Me2SO prior to the addition of IL-18.Cell Migration—SMC migration was quantified using Discovery Labware BD BioCoat™ Matrigel™ invasion chambers (catalog no. 354481, BD Biosciences) and 8.0-μm pore polyethylene terephthalate membranes with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix. Cultured SMCs were trypsinized and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1 ml containing 2.0 × 105 cells/ml was layered on the coated insert filters. Cells were stimulated with IL-18 (10 ng/ml). The lower chamber contained IL-18 at the same concentration. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and non-invading cells on the upper surface were removed using cotton swabs. Cells migrating to the lower surface of the membrane were determined at A540 nm using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (17Chandrasekar B. Bysani S. Mummidi S. J.

SMCs were treated with siRNA (see above) for 48 h prior to the addition of IL-18. To determine the inhibitory effects of atorvastatin on migration, SMCs were treated with atorvastatin at the indicated concentrations for 1 h prior to IL-18 addition. Me2SO served as a negative control.Cell Viability and Death—Cell viability following various treatments and transfections was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (16Chandrasekar B.

ECM proteins (MMP1, -2, -3, -8, -9, -10, and -13 and TIMP1, -2, -3, and -4) in the culture supernatants were determined by an antibody array (RayBio® matrix metalloproteinase antibody array 1.1, catalog no. H0149801, RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA) following the manufacturer's protocol and quantified by densitometry.To differentiate between latent and active forms, we analyzed MMP9 levels in culture supernatants by Western blotting using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide based on the C-terminal end of the human sequence (rabbit antibody to gelatinase B (MMP9), catalog no. RP1MMP9, Triple Point Biologics, Inc., Forest Grove, OR). This antibody detects both the latent (92 kDa) and active (88 kDa) forms of MMP9.Gelatin Zymography—Protein levels in cell-free culture supernatants were quantified, and equal amounts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE essentially as described by Mandler et al. (21Mandler R.N. Dencoff J.D. Midani F. Ford C.C. Ahmed W. Rosenberg G.A. Brain. 2001; 124: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Gels were prepared with 1 mg/ml gelatin (catalog no. G2500, Sigma) co-polymerized into the gel matrix. After electrophoresis, gels were agitated in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove the SDS and to restore enzyme activity and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij 35, and 0.02% sodium azide. Finally, gels were stained for 1 h in 50% methanol and 1% acetic acid with 0.125% Coomassie Blue G-250 dye and destained in 10% acetic acid. Zones of proteolytic activity were evident as clear bands against a dark blue background.MMP9 Promoter-Reporter Assays—A 726-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the MMP9 gene (GenBank™ accession number D10051.1) was amplified from human genomic DNA (catalog no.

The antisense primer contained a HindIII restriction site. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic reporter vector in the same restriction sites. The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing on both strands. A series of nested deletions was generated using the sense primers listed in Table 1.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutation of the NF-κB- and AP-1-binding sites in the MMP9 promoter-reporter vector was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the primers listed in Table 1 and was confirmed by complete nucleotide sequencing.Statistical Analysis—Comparisons between controls and various treatments were performed by analysis of variance with Dunnett's post hoc t tests. All assays were performed at least three times, and the error bars in the figures indicate the S.E.RESULTSIL-18 Stimulates Human Coronary Artery SMC Migration—To determine whether IL-18 induces SMC migration, we used Matrigel™ invasion chambers. A significant increase in cell migration was detected 24 h following IL-18 (10 ng/ml) treatment (Fig. 1). Because IL-18 is a potent inducer of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ production (4Dinarello C.A. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2000; 11: 483-486PubMed Google Scholar) and as these cytokines play a role in atherogenesis (1Ross R. Am. Heart J. 1999; 138: S419-S420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ross R. N. Engl.

Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6891) Google Scholar), we investigated whether IL-18-induced SMC migration is mediated by these cytokines. Pretreatment with the respective neutralizing antibodies for 1 h prior to IL-18 treatment failed to modulate cell migration. In contrast, incubation of IL-18 with anti-IL-18Rα neutralizing antibody for 1 h blocked IL-18-induced cell migration. Specificity of the neutralizing antibodies was determined in transient transfection assays using NF-κB and γ-interferon activation sequence reporter gene vectors. The results in Fig. 1 (B–E) demonstrate that anti-IL-1β, anti-TNF-α, anti-IFN-γ and anti-IL-18Rα n"

However, the molecular mechanism behind increased microglial CD11b expression is poorly understood. The present study was undertaken to explore the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the expression of CD11b in microglial cells. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the production of NO and increased the expression of CD11b in mouse BV-2 microglial cells and primary microglia. Either a scavenger of NO (PTIO) or an inhibitor of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (L-NIL) blocked this increase in microglial CD11b expression. Furthermore, co-microinjection of PTIO with LPS was also able to suppress LPS-mediated expression of CD11b and loss of dopaminergic neuronal fibers and neurotransmitters in striatum in vivo. Similarly, other inducers of NO production such as interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 gp120, and double-stranded RNA (poly(IC)) also increased the expression of CD11b in microglia through NO. The role of NO in the expression of CD11b was corroborated further by the expression of microglial CD11b by GSNO, an NO donor. Because NO transduces many intracellular signals via guanylate cyclase (GC), we investigated the role of GC, cyclic GMP (cGMP), and cGMP-activated protein kinase (PKG) in microglial expression of CD11b. Inhibition of LPS- and GSNO-mediated up-regulation of CD11b either by NS2028 (a specific inhibitor of GC) or by KT5823 and Rp-8-bromo-cGMP (specific inhibitors of PKG), and increase in CD11b expression either by 8-bromo-cGMP or by MY-5445 (a specific inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase) alone suggest that NO increases microglial expression of CD11b via GC-cGMP-PKG. In addition, GSNO induced the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) via PKG that was involved in the up-regulation of CD11b. This study illustrates a novel biological role of NO in regulating the expression of CD11b in microglia through GC-cGMP-PKG-CREB pathway that may participate in the pathogenesis of devastating neurodegenerative disorders.

It acts as a binding protein for intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and complement C3bi (8Schwarz M. Nordt T. Bode C. Peter K. Thromb. Res. 2002; 107: 121-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is reported that in various neuroinflammatory diseases, the increased Cd11b expression corresponds to the severity of microglial activation (1Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 6Rock R.B. Gekker G. Hu S. Sheng W.S. Cheeran M. Lokensgard J.R. Peterson P.K. Clin. Microbiol.

Morphologically, microglial activation is associated with intense ramification and cytoskeletal rearrangement in which changes in shape and motility correlate with increased expression of CD11b (1Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 6Rock R.B. Gekker G. Hu S. Sheng W.S. Cheeran M. Lokensgard J.R. Peterson P.K. Clin. Microbiol.

During this activation process, the cytoplasmic domain of CD11b is believed to interact increasingly with cytoskeletal protein (1Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which microglial expression of CD11b is increased in neurodegenerative CNS remains unclear. Because activated microglia also express inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) to produce an excessive amount of NO, a molecule implicated virtually in all reported neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions (9Stewart V.C. Heales S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), we were prompted to investigate whether NO plays a role in the microglial expression of CD11b. Here we report that NO is instrumental in increasing the expression of CD11b in microglia. Different inducers of NO production such as LPS, IFN-γ, IL-1β, HIV-1 gp120, and poly(IC) stimulated microglial expression of CD11b via NO. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that NO employed the guanylate cyclase (GC)-cGMP-cGMP-activated protein kinase (PKG)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway to up-regulate the expression of CD11b in microglia. Reagents—Fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 were from Mediatech Inc. LPS (Escherichia coli), actinomycin D, and poly(IC) were purchased from Sigma. HIV-1 coat protein gp120 was obtained from US Biological. l-N6-(1-Iminoethyl)-lysine (l-NIL), NS-2028 (an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase), 8-Br-cGMP, MY-5445 (an inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase), and KT5823 (an inhibitor of PKG) were obtained from Biomol. Recombinant mouse IFN-γ and IL-1β were obtained from R&D. Isolation of Mouse Microglia—Microglial cells were isolated from mixed glial cultures according to the procedure of Giulian and Baker (11Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, on day 7-9 the mixed glial cultures were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and subjected to shaking at 240 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C on a rotary shaker. The floating cells were washed and seeded on to plastic tissue culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The attached cells were removed by trypsinization and seeded onto new plates for further studies. Ninety to ninety-five percent of this preparation was found to be positive for Mac-1 surface antigen. Mouse BV-2 microglial cells (kind gift from Virginia Bocchini of University of Perugia) were also maintained and induced as indicated above. Assay for NO Synthesis—Synthesis of NO was determined by assay of culture supernatants for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen, using Griess reagent as described (12Jana M.

Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39312-39319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Surface expression of CD11b on BV-2 microglial cells was checked by flow cytometry as described earlier (14Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 10 6 cells suspended in RPMI 1640-fetal bovine serum were incubated in the dark with appropriately diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies to CD11b (Mac-1 Integrin) (BD Pharmingen) at 4 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, cell suspension was centrifuged, washed thrice, and resuspended in 500 μl of RPMI-fetal bovine serum. The cells were then analyzed through FACS (Becton Dickinson). A minimum of 10,000 cells was accepted for FACS analysis. Cells were gated based on morphological characteristics. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were not accepted for FACS analysis. Immunofluorescence Analysis—It was performed as described earlier (16Jana A. Pahan K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9531-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cover slips containing 100-200 cells/mm2 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by treatment with cold ethanol (-20 °C) for 5 min and two rinses in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween-20 (PBST) for 30 min and incubated in PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin and rabbit anti-CD11b (1:50). After three washes in PBST (15 min each), slides were further incubated with Cy2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For negative controls, a set of culture slides was incubated under similar conditions without the primary antibodies. The samples were mounted and observed under a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES confocal laser-scanning microscope. Microinjection of LPS into the Striatum of C57BL/6 Mice—Male C57BL/6 mice (8-10-week old) were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and underwent cerebellar operations in a Kopf small animal stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf, CA). Briefly, the animal was mounted in a stereotaxic frame on a heating blanket. Body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C during the time of surgery. A midsagittal incision was made to expose the cranium and a hole <0.5 mm in diameter was drilled with a dental drill over the cerebrum according to the following coordinates: 5 mm anterior to lambda, lateral (L) 2.2 mm, ventral (V) 3.5 (as shown in Fig. 6A). Four micrograms of LPS in the presence or absence of l-NIL (10 μg) and PTIO (10 μg) dissolved in 3 μl of saline was injected using a 5-μl syringe (Hamilton, Reno, Nevada) over a period of 2 min, and the needle was held in place for another minute before withdrawing it from the skull to prevent reflux up the needle tract. Similarly control mice received 3 μl of saline. The incision was closed with surgical staples and covered with a mixture of bacitracin and Hurricane (20% benzocaine). Tyrosine Hydroxylase Immunostaining—Five days after microinjection, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and their brains were processed for immunohistochemical studies. Sections (10 μm) were incubated with a polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 1,000 dilution, Calbiochem) for 24 h at 4 °C. Biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by avidin-biotin complex were used. Immunoreactivity was visualized by Vectastatin Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Striatal optical density of TH immunostaining, measured by SpotDenso Analysis Tools in Fluorochem 8800 Imaging System, was used as an index of striatal density of TH innervation. Measurement of Dopamine and Its Metabolite Levels in Striatal Tissues—After 5 days of microinjection, mice were sacrificed, and their striata were dissected out and stored at -80 °C until analysis. On the day of the assay, striatal tissues were sonicated in 0.2 m perchloric acid (0.5 ml/100 mg of tissue) containing isoproterenol (100 ng/100 mg of tissue) as internal standard. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the pH of supernatants was adjusted to pH 3.0 with 1 m sodium acetate. After filtration, 10 μl of supernatant was injected onto a Eicompak SC-3ODS column (Complete Stand-Alone HPLC-ECD System EiCOMHTEC-500 from JM Science Inc., Grand Island, NY) and analyzed for dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid following manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the mobile phase consisted of 20% methanol and 80% 0.1 m citrate-acetate buffer (pH 3.5) with 220 mg/l sodium octane sulfate and 5 mg/l disodium EDTA. The flow rate was maintained at 340-400 μl/min. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from BV-2 microglial cells, primary microglia, or striatal tissues surrounding the point of microinjection using Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.) following manufacturer's protocol. To remove any contaminating genomic DNA, total RNA was digested with DNase. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out as described earlier (17Dasgupta S. Jana M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using a RT-PCR kit from Clontech. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 as primer and MMLV reverse transcriptase (Clontech) in a 20-μl reaction mixture. The resulting cDNA was appropriately diluted, and diluted cDNA was amplified using titanium TaqDNA polymerase and the following primers. Amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining: CD11b, sense: 5′-CAGATCAACAATGTGACCGTATGGG-3′, antisense: 5′-CATCATGTCCTTGTACTGCCGCTTG-3′; IL-1β, sense: 5′-CTCCATGAGCTTTGTACAAGG-3′, antisense: 5′-TGCTGATGTACCAGTTGGGG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sense: 5′-GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACG-3′, antisense: 5′-TTGGCTCCACCCTTCAAGTG-3′. The relative expression of either CD11b or IL-1β (CD11b or IL-1β/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was measured after scanning the bands with a Fluor Chem 8800 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corporation). Real Time PCR analysis for CD11b mRNA—It was performed using the ABI-Prism7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) as described earlier (17Dasgupta S. Jana M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were performed in 96-well optical reaction plates on cDNA equivalent to 50 ng of DNase-digested RNA in a volume of 25 μl, containing 12.5 μl of TaqMan Universal Master mix and optimized concentrations of carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe, forward and reverse primers, following manufacturer's protocol. All primers and FAM-labeled probes for mouse CD11b and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from Applied Biosystems. The mRNA expression of CD11b was normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Data were processed by the ABI Sequence Detection System 1.6 software and analyzed by analysis of variance. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extract preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously with some modifications (15Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Liu X. Hilger S. McKinney M.J. Petro T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7899-7905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding sequence for CREB (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) (Promega) was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide T4 kinase. Labeled probe was purified with chroma spin column (BD Biosciences). Six-micrograms of nuclear extract was incubated with binding buffer and nonspecific oligonucleotides for 15 min in ice prior to incubation with labeled probe for another 15 min. Subsequently, samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer (Tris borate-EDTA), which were then dried and exposed to generate autoradiograms. Bacterial LPS Increases the Expression of CD11b in Mouse BV-2 Microglial Cells via NO—Microglia express CD11b, however, during microglial activation the expression of CD11b is markedly increased. Because microglial activation is also associated with the production of NO, we investigated the role of NO in microglial expression of CD11b. Mouse BV-2 microglial cells were stimulated with different concentrations of LPS, the prototype inducer of different immune cells including CNS microglia (18Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Liu X. Hilger S. McKinney M.J. Petro T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7899-7905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Kim H.S. Whang S.Y. Woo M.S. Park J.S. Kim W.K. Han I.O. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 151: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is clear from Fig. 1A that LPS dose dependently increased the expression of CD11b in BV-2 cells with maximum increase observed at 0.75 or 1.0 μg/ml of LPS. An assay of nitrite in culture supernatants shows that the increase in CD11b expression was associated with the production of NO (Fig. 1B). Next during a time-dependent analysis of LPS-mediated up-regulation of CD11b expression, we observed that LPS was unable to increase the mRNA expression of CD11b within 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 1C). However, the increase in CD11b expression was visible at 12 h with the maximum up-regulation observed at 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 1C). When we measured the time-dependent production of nitrite in response to LPS, we observed that the induction of NO production began at 12 h and reached the maximum at 24 h (Fig. 1D). In fact, the expression of CD11b paralleled to the production of NO suggesting a possible involvement of NO in the increase in CD11b expression. We then compared the expression pattern of another inducible gene in microglia. In contrast to the expression pattern of CD11b, marked induction of IL-1β mRNA was observed within 6 h of stimulation with LPS (Fig. 1C). Because the expression of IL-1β was observed before the increase in CD11b expression, we also investigated whether IL-1β was playing a role in LPS-induced expression of CD11b. The time course of IL-1β-induced CD11b expression shows that IL-1β was unable to stimulate the expression of CD11b within 12 h of stimulation (Fig. 1E). However, at 24 h of stimulation, the up-regulation of CD11b was clearly visible (Fig. 1E) suggesting that IL-1β may not be involved in LPS-induced expression of CD11b. Therefore, to investigate the role of NO in LPS-mediated up-regulation of CD11b, we examined the effect of l-NIL (an inhibitor of NOS) and carboxyl PTIO (a scavenger of NO) on the LPS-mediated increase in CD11b mRNA expression in BV-2 glial cells. It is clearly evident from semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis that both l-NIL and PTIO markedly inhibited LPS-mediated expression of CD11b (Fig. 1, F and G). Quantitative real time PCR analysis also reveals a marked inhibition of LPS-mediated expression of CD11b mRNA by l-NIL and PTIO (Fig. 1H). Next we investigated the effect of l-NIL and PTIO on the expression of CD11b protein in LPS-stimulated cells. Because CD11b is a surface protein, we analyzed its expression by FACS using FITC-labeled antibodies against CD11b. Fig. 2A represents auto-fluorescence, as this was observed in unconjugated normal BV-2 glial cells. As areas under M1 and M2 in Fig. 2, A-E represent auto-fluorescence and fluorescence, respectively, because of CD11b there was some expression of CD11b on the surface of normal BV-2 glial cells (Fig. 2B) in contrast to marked increase in CD11b expression on the surface of LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 2C). Consistent to the inhibition of CD11b mRNA expression, both l-NIL and PTIO markedly inhibited LPS-mediated stimulation of CD11b protein expression (Fig. 2, D and E). Immunofluorescence analysis of CD11b in BV-2 microglial cells also shows that LPS stimulation increased the expression of CD11b and that l-NIL and PTIO attenuated LPS-mediated CD11b expression (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these studies suggest that LPS up-regulates the expression of CD11b in BV-2 microglial cells via NO. LPS Increases the Expression of CD11b in Mouse Primary Microglia via NO—To understand whether NO is required for the increase in CD11b expression by LPS in primary cells, we examined the effect of l-NIL and PTIO on LPS-mediated expression of CD11b in mouse primary microglia (Fig. 3). Consistent with the induction of NO production and increase in CD11b mRNA expression in BV-2 microglial cells, LPS induced the production of NO (Fig. 3A) and increased the expression of CD11b mRNA as revealed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3B) and quantitative real time PCR analyses (Fig. 3C)in mouse primary microglia. However, either blocking the production of NO by l-NIL or scavenging NO by PTIO (Fig. 3A) markedly suppressed LPS-mediated stimulation of CD11b mRNA expression (Fig. 3, B and C) in primary microglia. Apart from CD11b, microglia express many other surface markers such as, CD18, CD11a, CD11c, etc. In addition, CD11b pairs with CD18 to exhibit functional activity, therefore, we wondered whether NO was also regulating the expression of other surface markers including CD18. In mouse primary microglia, LPS increased the expression of CD18, CD11a, and CD11c compared with control (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, similar to the regulation of CD11b, both l-NIL and PTIO suppressed the LPS-mediated increase in CD18, CD11c, and CD11a expression in primary microglia (Fig. 3D) suggesting that NO is capable of regulating the expression of various surface markers of microglia associated with its activation. Involvement of NO in Proinflammatory Cytokine-, Double-stranded RNA- and HIV-1 gp120-mediated Increase in CD11b Expression in BV-2 Microglial Cells—Microglia are activated under various pathological conditions, such as inflammation, viral infection, etc. (1Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 20Saha R.N. Pahan K. J.

Because LPS increased the expression of CD11b in microglia through NO, we investigated whether other inducers of microglial activation also increase CD11b expression via NO. Therefore, BV-2 microglial cells were stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IFN-γ), HIV-1 coat protein gp120 (22Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Uhl G.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3256-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and double-stranded RNA in the form of polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid (poly(IC)) (23Auch C.J. Saha R.N. Sheikh F.G. Liu X. Pahan K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of l-NIL and PTIO. All four stimuli (IFN-γ, IL-1β, gp120, and poly(IC)) induced the production of NO and increased the expression of CD11b in BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 4). Similar to the inhibition of LPS-mediated expression of CD11b, either blocking the production of NO by l-NIL or scavenging NO by PTIO knocked down IFN-γ-, IL-1β-, gp120-, and poly(IC)-mediated increase in CD11b mRNA expression (Fig. 4, A-D) suggesting that different neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative stimuli also up-regulate the expression of CD11b in microglia via NO. LPS-mediated Increase in CD11b Expression in Vivo in the Striatum Depends on NO—Using various approaches, the studies presented above have shown that different neurotoxins increase the expression of CD11b in microglial cells or cultured primary microglia via NO. However, these studies do not indicate whether NO may have the capacity to influence the expression of CD11b in vivo in the CNS. It is increasingly becoming clear that microglial activation plays an important role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in striatum and nigra of patients with Parkinson disease (3Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar, 4Wu D.C. Jackson-Lewis V. Vila M. Tieu K. Teismann P. Vadseth C. Choi D.K.

Therefore, we were prompted to investigate whether NO is also involved in the up-regulation of CD11b expression in vivo in the striatum. As expected, the microinjection of LPS but not saline into the striatum of 8-10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice induced the expression of iNOS (Fig. 5B) and CD11b (C and D). Next to analyze the role of NO in LPS-mediated expression of CD11b, PTIO was microinjected together with LPS. As revealed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5C) and quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 5D), PTIO knocked down LPS-mediated increase in CD11b expression in vivo in the striatum (Fig. 5, C and D). This has been further suppo"
https://openalex.org/W2006406952,"Supernovae have been subjected to extensive study over the years, particularly since the discovery of their involvement with γ-ray bursts. But there are still some basic questions about them that remain unanswered, for instance, what shape are they? Explosion geometry has been a difficult subject to tackle because supernovae in other galaxies are so distant that they remain point-like in our night sky. Now observations of SN 2004dj, the closest normal Type II-P supernova ever observed, show that the innermost regions of the expanding ejecta are severely distorted, the result of an explosion mechanism that is strongly nonspherical. This property may be inherent to the core-collapse process in all types of supernovae. Multi-epoch spectropolarimetry of a supernova reveals the abrupt appearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed in the thinning ejecta — roughly 90 days after explosion. An important and perhaps critical clue to the mechanism driving the explosion of massive stars as supernovae is provided by the accumulating evidence for asymmetry in the explosion. Indirect evidence comes from high pulsar velocities1, associations of supernovae with long-soft γ-ray bursts2,3, and asymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles4. Spectropolarimetry provides a direct probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generally indicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry5,6. Large polarizations have been measured for ‘stripped-envelope’ (that is, type Ic; ref. 7) supernovae, which confirms their non-spherical morphology8,9; but the explosions of massive stars with intact hydrogen envelopes7,10 (type II-P supernovae) have shown only weak polarizations at the early times observed11,12. Here we report multi-epoch spectropolarimetry of a classic type II-P supernova that reveals the abrupt appearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed in the thinning ejecta (∼90 days after explosion). We infer a departure from spherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. Combined with earlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be a generic feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericity in type II-P supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque, hydrogen envelope."

Here we show that currents through heterologously expressed neuronal and smooth muscle CaL channel isoforms are acutely potentiated following α5β1 integrin activation.

Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis strategies reveal that regulation of Cav1.2 by α5β1 integrin requires phosphorylation of α1C C-terminal residues Ser1901 and Tyr2122.

The three α1C isoforms (neuronal, Cav1.2c; smooth muscle, Cav1.2b; cardiac, Cav1.2a) exhibit significant sequence differences in their N and C termini but all are regulated by intracellular kinases in ways that uniquely determine calcium entry and cell excitability. The regulation of CaL channels by serine-threonine kinases has been extensively investigated. PKG phosphorylates a conserved serine reside in the cytoplasmic I-II linker (3Jiang L.H. Gawler D.J.

PKA phosphorylates all three α1C isoforms at a conserved C-terminal serine (Ser1901 in Cav1.2c; Ser1928 in Cav1.2a), thereby mediating β-adrenergic potentiation of the calcium current in cardiac myocytes and neurons (7Gao T.

PKA also regulates α1C in smooth muscle, but the functional consequences on calcium current are complicated by crossover activation of PKG, which is expressed at high levels in that tissue (10Ruiz-Velasco V. Zhong J.M. Hume J.R. Keef K.D. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that CaL currents in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) are acutely regulated by the integrin class of cell adhesion molecules. CaL current is inhibited by ligands of αvβ3 integrin but potentiated by ligands of α5β1 and α4β1 integrins, including the abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, fibronectin (11Wu X.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). α5β1-mediated potentiation depends critically on the integrin-associated tyrosine kinases c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (12Wu X.

This mechanism is consistent with reports that α1C isoforms are potentiated by the growth factors, insulin-like growth factor-1 and platelet-derived growth factor (13Hu X.-Q. Singh N. Mukhopadhyay D.

Here, we present evidence that activation of α5β1 integrin acutely potentiates CaL channels in rat brain and smooth muscle. The effect can be reproduced fully in heterologously expressed neuronal and smooth muscle CaL isoforms and depends critically on phosphorylation of two specific C-terminal serine and tyrosine residues, indicating that integrin-ECM interactions are a common mechanism for acute regulation of CaL channels in brain and muscle. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings were made using EPC7 and EPC9 amplifiers controlled by pClamp (Axon Instruments) or Pulse (HEKA) software. Methods were mostly as described previously (12Wu X. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Wilson E. Davis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30285-30292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Both perforated-patch and conventional whole cell modes were used. Pipettes were filled with Cs+ pipette solution (110 Cs+) containing (in mm): 110 CsCl, 20 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl2 (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Perforated patch pipettes also contained 240 mg/ml amphotericin. Ba2+ was used as the charge carrier to increase the size of the inward current, and to minimize calcium-dependent inactivation of current. In experiments with VSM or HEK-293 cells, the bath solution (20 Ba2+) contained (in mm): 20 BaCl2, 124 choline chloride, 10 HEPES, 15 d-glucose (pH 7.4 with triethanolamine-OH). In experiments with MS/nDB neurons, the bath solution (2 Ba2+) was similar except for containing 2 mm Ba2+. Neuronal and VSM Cell Isolation—Basal forebrain neurons were isolated by microdissection of MS/nDB regions from coronal slices of rat (Sprague-Dawley) brain followed by incubation in trypsin and then trituration (23Murchison D. Griffith W.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 350-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dissected segments of 1A and 2A arterioles from rat cremaster muscle were sequentially digested in low Ca2+ physiological saline solutions containing papain and then collagenase/elastase. The resulting fragments were rinsed with low Ca2+ saline solution and gently triturated using a Pasteur pipette to release single, elongated VSM cells (12Wu X. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Wilson E. Davis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30285-30292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All animal protocols conformed to the Public Health Service policy for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the respective university Animal Care Committees. Reagents—The integrin ligands, α5 integrin monoclonal antibody (HMα5-1, rat; BD Pharmingen) or α5β1 integrin polyclonal Ab (human, 10 μg/ml; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), were applied in soluble form or by biotin-streptavidin linking to polystyrene beads (3.2 μm, outer diameter) followed by addition of the beads (typically 5–10) to individual cells using gentle superfusion from a micropipette (11Wu X. Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Soluble reagents (PP2; Calbiochem) were applied using a picospritzer connected to micopipettes positioned ∼50 μm from the cell. In some protocols the solution in the recording pipette was exchanged with solutions containing inhibitors (PKA inhibitory peptide (PKI); Sigma) (Src SH2 inhibitory domain peptide; Calbiochem) over a 1–2-min period using a 2PK push-pull pipette exchange system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Heterologous Channel Expression—HEK-293 cells (tsA-201 line) were maintained at 30–37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in supplemented Dul-becco's modified Eagle's medium, and transfected with CaL isoforms using CaPO4 (for electrophysiology) or Lipofectamine 2000 (for Western blotting). Rat neuronal α1C, β1b, and α2-δ DNA, subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vectors, were gifts from T. Snutch; rabbit SM α1C, β2a, and α2-δ1 DNA were gifts from F. Hofmann and N. Klugbauer; human c-Src subcloned into SRα using the EcoRI site was a gift from D. Fujita. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was used as a co-transfectant in all electrophysiological protocols to identify successfully transfected cells. Only single cells were used for electrophysiological protocols, typically 48–72 h after transfection. Mutagenesis Methods—A PCR strategy was used to introduce stop codons at various positions in the Cav1.2 α1C subunit C terminus. The wild type Cav1.2 clone contained a NotI site at the 3′ multicloning site. Thus, primer A was designed to anneal to the Cav1.2 antisense strand immediately upstream of the site intended for the stop codon. The primer included the stop codon and the sequence encoding a NotI restriction site. Primer B was designed to associate with the Cav1.2 residues upstream of both a unique SbfI restriction site and the placement of the intended stop codon. The resulting PCR product that extended from the SbfI site to the stop codon/NotI site was then sequenced, excised via SbfI and NotI, and subcloned into the original Cav1.2 construct via SbfI and NotI. Site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate phosphorylation consensus sites in the C terminus of Cav1.2 was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using the entire cDNA as a template. Subsequently, a fragment ranging from SbfI to NotI was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations, excised, and subcloned into the original WT Cav1.2 construct. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and in Vitro Kinase Assays—TsA-201 cells were lysed 48–72 h after transfection in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 1% Triton X-100 with a mixture of protease inhibitors (4 °C). CaL channels were immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with α1C Ab (Chemicon) followed by addition of protein A/G beads, pelleting, washing, and resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer. For immunoblotting, lysates or immunoprecipitates (IPs) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 6% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with appropriate primary and secondary Ab before application of SuperSignal chemiluminescent reagent and exposure to x-ray film. c-Src or cAK-induced phosphorylation was carried out at 30 °C in standard assay solution by incubation of IP complexes with 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of purified recombinant human c-Src or cAK catalytic subunit purified from bovine heart, respectively (24Ling S. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After separating the phosphorylation mixture by SDS-PAGE, the gels were exposed to x-ray film for 9–36 h at –20 °C; densitometry was performed using Scion software or, in some cases, a PhosphorImager. Activation of α5β1 Integrin in Brain and VSM Potentiates CaL Current—Neurons (Fig. 1a) were acutely dissociated from the medial septum/diagonal band nucleus (MS/nDB) of the rat. CaL currents were measured using whole cell patch clamp techniques in the presence of 5 μm ω-conotoxin MVIIC and a holding potential of –40 mV to block N and P/Q channels (25McDonough S.I. Boland L.M. Mintz I.M. Bean B.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). α5β1 integrins were activated by micropipette application of beads coated with anti-α5 integrin Ab (α5-Ab, a multivalent α5β1 ligand). Bead attachment to the neuron whose current is shown in Fig. 1a resulted in 1.6-fold potentiation of CaL current that peaked 3–5 min after bead application; potentiation averaged 1.43 ± 0.11-fold in 4 cells. I-V relationships of whole cell currents before (control) and after attachment of α5 beads are illustrated at the bottom of Fig. 1a. Potentiation did not appear to be associated with a significant shift in voltage sensitivity of the channel. In rat VSM cells, the application of anti-α5 integrin Ab on beads also resulted in time-dependent potentiation of the whole cell CaL current. Peak potentiation of the CaL current was 1.8-fold for the cell shown in Fig. 1b, whereas the average potentiation was 1.64 ± 0.05-fold in 5 cells. This effect was specific for integrin engagement because uncoated beads or beads coated with bovine serum albumin had no significant effect on current. In addition, a non-integrin binding Ab, in soluble form or coated onto beads, was without a significant effect on current (11Wu X. Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Potentiation of Heterologously Expressed Cav1.2 by Integrin Activation—To explore the mechanism of current potentiation, CaL subunits were subsequently expressed in tsA-201 cells, which constitutively express α5β1 integrin and demonstrate α5β1 integrin-dependent adhesion (not shown). Transient transfection with the neuronal α1C channel subunit (Cav1.2c) alone resulted in relatively small currents that were potentiated 1.90 ± 0.13-fold by application of soluble anti-α5β1 integrin Ab (human; Fig. 2a, left). Co-expression of β1b and α2-δ subunits (Fig. 2a, right) along with Cav1.2c resulted in much larger basal currents that were also potentiated by soluble α5β1 integrin Ab (2.07 ± 0.15-fold). We also used two additional methods known to cross-link integrins (26Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar): 1) application of microbeads coated with α5β1 Ab; 2) successive application of soluble α5β1 Ab (mouse anti-human) and an appropriate secondary Ab (goat anti-mouse IgG). Both methods also led to potentiation of current, 1.85–2.07-fold (Fig. 2b), either with or without the accessory channel subunits. Integrin cross-linking and activation with multivalent ECM ligands, or with the appropriate concentration of monovalent Ab, is known to initiate outside-in signaling in several other cell systems (26Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 27Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Currents were comparably potentiated by activation of α5β1 integrin in HEK cells expressing either cardiac (Cav1.2a; not shown) or smooth muscle (Cav1.2b) isoforms of CaL. Fig. 3a shows examples of current potentiation by rabbit smooth muscle CaL channels in response to soluble α5β1 integrin Ab application, when the cells were expressing α1C-b alone or α1C-b together with β2a and α2-δ1 subunits. The data are summarized in Fig. 3b, where the potentiation averaged 1.99 ± 0.20- and 1.94 ± 0.14-fold, respectively. Potentiation of Cav1.2 Requires the Distal C Terminus of the α1C Subunit—Compared with smooth muscle and cardiac isoforms, the neuronal channel (Cav1.2c) has 27 fewer amino acid residues on the N terminus (28Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), including potential PKC phosphorylation sites (6Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29McHugh D. Sharp E.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12334-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The comparable potentiation of neuronal and smooth muscle isoforms argues that the N terminus is not the regulatory site for α5β1 integrinmediated potentiation. Subsequently, a series of successive, C-terminal truncation mutants of Cav1.2c were created and their responses to α5β1 integrin activation tested. As shown in Fig. 4, the truncation mutant Stop 5, which terminated proximal to the canonical PKA phosphorylation site (9Mitterdorfer J. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Moebius F.F. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9400-9406Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) at Ser1901 (equivalent to Ser1928 on cardiac Cav1.2a) exhibited a loss of significant potentiation by α5β1 integrin Ab. In contrast, truncations distal to the PKA phosphorylation site (Stop 6–8), including those missing a proline-rich domain (30Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Bunemann M. Puri T.S. Adair A. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), resulted in a significantly reduced (∼50%), but not completely abolished, response to integrin activation, as compared with wild-type (WT) Cav1.2c. Each of the Stop 6–8 constructs was missing the putative tyrosine phosphorylation site at Tyr2122 previously identified as a regulatory site for insulin-like growth factor-1 (14Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A.C. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results suggest that two different regulatory sites on the C terminus of Cav1.2 are required for full potentiation following α5β1 integrin activation, with one of the sites being Ser1901 (Cav1.2c). Consistent with this conclusion is the additional observation that inclusion of PKI in the patch pipette abolished the remaining potentiation associated with integrin activation in the Stop 6–8 constructs (Fig. 4c). Potentiation of Cav1.2c Depends Partially on α1C Tyr 2122—Our previous work showed that potentiation of CaL in rat smooth muscle was partially but incompletely blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (12Wu X. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Wilson E. Davis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30285-30292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because only two tyrosine residues in rat Cav1.2c are distal to Ser1901, we constructed single-site mutants in which each of those residues was substituted with phenylalanine (Y2122F-α1C and Y2139F-α1C). After expression, current through the Y2122F-α1C construct continued to be potentiated by the α5β1 integrin Ab, but potentiation was only 1.39 ± 0.06-fold above basal current, compared with 1.90 ± 0.13-fold for WT-α1C (Fig. 5, a and b). In contrast, the magnitude of potentiation of Y2139-α1C was statistically indistinguishable from that for WT-α1C (1.86 ± 0.09- versus 1.90 ± 0.13-fold, respectively). To further verify that Tyr2122 was critical for full potentiation by α5β1 integrin, we recorded current through WT-α1C while dialyzing the cells with a decoy peptide containing the same amino acid sequence as rat WT-α1C-c. This peptide was previously found to interfere with potentiation of native CaL channels in smooth muscle (12Wu X. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Wilson E. Davis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30285-30292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and here it reduced integrin-induced potentiation of WT-α1C by ∼50% (to 1.43 ± 0.05-fold above basal). As controls, neither an identical peptide containing a Y2122F substitution, nor a scrambled peptide, had any effect on integrin-induced potentiation of WT-α1C (Fig. 5b). Collectively, these results suggest that Tyr2122 is required for a significant fraction of, but not complete, potentiation of α1C-c following α5β1 integrin activation. As an additional approach to testing whether the Tyr2122 residue of α1C-c was phosphorylated following integrin activation, we immunoprecipitated the channel after its expression in HEK-293 cells and performed in vitro phosphorylation assays with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of purified Src tyrosine kinase. Radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into Y2122F-α1C was reduced to 39 ± 6% of the level in WT-α1C, whereas [γ-32P]ATP incorporation into Y2139F-α1C averaged 120 ± 26% of that in WT-α1C (Fig. 5c, right). Phosphorylation of WT-α1C and Y2139F-α1C could also be detected (albeit at much lower levels) in the absence of exogenous c-Src (Fig. 5c, left), but it was nearly undetectable in Y2122F-α1C under comparable conditions. These results are consistent with the conclusion that phosphorylation of the Tyr2122 residue in α1C-c by c-Src (or other tyrosine kinases) is part of the mechanism for integrin-induced potentiation of the CaL current. Potentiation of Cav1.2c Is Partly Mediated by c-Src—We further explored the role of c-Src in integrin-induced potentiation of CaL by co-expressing various c-Src constructs along with WT-α1C in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 6, a and b). Co-expression of WT-Src (human) with WT-α1C resulted in a significantly enhanced potentiation of current following integrin activation (2.34 ± 0.13-fold) as compared with the magnitude of potentiation when WT-α1C was expressed alone (1.90 ± 0.13-fold). In contrast, co-expression of a kinase-dead (Kd) form of c-Src (24Ling S. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), along with WT-α1C, resulted in ∼50% reduction of potentiation of current after integrin activation (to 1.43 ± 0.05-fold). Although we attempted various additional methods of enhancing the amount of Kd-Src expression, we were unable to completely abolish the α5 integrin-induced potentiation of current (not shown). As an alternative approach to Kd-Src co-expression, we tested the effects of PP2 (100 nm), a membrane permeable inhibitor of Src family kinases, which reduced potentiation of WT-α1C by 40% following integrin activation (1.58 ± 0.06- versus 1.90 ± 0.13-fold). Collectively, these results are consistent with the conclusion that phosphorylation of the channel by c-Src accounts for some, but not all, of the potentiation following α5β1 integrin activation. When the channel was immunoprecipitated and probed with an antiphosphotyrosine Ab, co-expression of c-Src with α1C significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of α1C (by ∼5-fold; Fig. 6c). However, when Kd-Src was co-expressed instead, tyrosine phosphorylation of α1C was undetectable under comparable conditions. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of α1C by endogenous Src (Fig. 6c, lane 1) is not apparent in Fig. 6, longer film exposure times revealed detectable phosphorylation of the channel in the absence of c-Src co-transfection (not shown). Full Potentiation of Cav1.2c Depends on Dual Phosphorylation of α1C Residues Ser 1901 and Tyr 2122—The results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 collectively suggest that full potentiation of α1C-c by α5β1 integrin activation requires phosphorylation of both α1C residues, Ser1901 and Tyr2122. To directly test this hypothesis, we constructed an α1C mutant in which the PKA site was altered to alanine (S1901A-α1C) and a double mutant in which both the PKA and Src phosphorylation sites were altered (S1901A/Y2122F-α1C). We initially checked the mutants to verify that regulation by PKA was impaired in response to the membrane-permeable cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 7, a and b, top). 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) potentiated the WT-α1C current by 1.64 ± 0.12-fold and this effect was completely abolished in both S1901A-α1C and S1901A/Y2122F-α1C constructs. No significant potentiation by 8-Br-cAMP was observed in cells transfected with WT-α1C if PKI was included in the recording pipette. We also tested whether the S1901A-α1C mutant could be phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK). Compared with phosphorylation of WT-α1C, phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated S1901A-α1C by cAK was reduced to 65 ± 8% (Fig. 7d). In contrast, the phosphorylation of neither Y2122F-α1C nor Y2139F-α1C by cAK was significantly different from that for WT-α1C (88 ± 14 and 108 ± 11%, respectively; Fig. 7d). The remaining, background [γ-32P]ATP incorporation into S1901A-α1C likely represents phosphorylation of the channel at additional sites containing cAK/cGK consensus sequences (3Jiang L.H. Gawler D.J.

Moebius F.F. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9400-9406Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that may become modified under the in vitro assay conditions. Finally, we examined the effects of α5β1 integrin activation on whole cell current recorded from cells expressing channels mutated at the PKA regulatory site. Potentiation of the S1901A-α1C construct following integrin activation was reduced by ∼45% (1.90 ± 0.13- versus 1.47 ± 0.13-fold) compared with the potentiation of WT-α1C; however, currents were still significantly higher than basal. In contrast, in cells expressing S1901A/Y2122F-α1C, integrin activation did not result in any significant potentiation of current above basal levels (Fig. 7b, bottom, and c). To further test this idea, we tested five different methods of interfering with phosphorylation of α1C at Ser1901 and Tyr2122: S1901A-α1C plus PP2 added to the bath; S1901A-α1C plus co-expression of Kd-Src; WT-α1C co-expressed with Kd-Src plus PKI in the recording pipette; Y2122F-α1C plus PKI in the recording pipette; and the S1901A/Y2122F-α1C double mutant. In all five cases, no significant potentiation of current was observed following integrin activation (Fig. 7c).

For short-chain trans-prenyltransferases that synthesize C10-C25 products, bulky amino acid residues generally occupy the fourth or fifth position upstream from the first DDXXD motif to block further elongation of the final products. However, the short-chain type-III GGPPs in eukaryotes lack any large amino acid at these positions. In this study, the first structure of type-III GGPPs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined to 1.98 Å resolution. The structure is composed entirely of 15 α-helices joined by connecting loops and is arranged with α-helices around a large central cavity. Distinct from other known structures of trans-prenyltransferases, the N-terminal 17 amino acids (9-amino acid helix A and the following loop) of this GGPPs protrude from the helix core into the other subunit and contribute to the tight dimer formation. Deletion of the first 9 or 17 amino acids caused the dissociation of dimer into monomer, and the Δ(1-17) mutant showed abolished enzyme activity. In each subunit, an elongated hydrophobic crevice surrounded by D, F, G, H, and I α-helices contains two DDXXD motifs at the top for substrate binding with one Mg2+ coordinated by Asp75, Asp79, and four water molecules. It is sealed at the bottom with three large residues of Tyr107, Phe108, and His139. Compared with the major product C30 synthesized by mutant H139A, the products generated by mutant Y107A and F108A are predominantly C40 and C30, respectively, suggesting the most important role of Tyr107 in determining the product chain length.

Five-carbon isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) 3The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; GPP, geranyl pyrophosphate; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; FPPs, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; OPPs, octaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase; GGPPs, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase; SeMet, selenomethionine; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; HexPPs, hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase. serves as the building block for the isoprenoid natural products (1Kellogg B.A. Poulter C.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). IPP is first converted to its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) by IPP:DMAPP isomerase (2Ogura K. Koyama T. Sagami H. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Condensation of DAMPP with 1-3 IPP results in C10 geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), C15 farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and C20 geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) by the corresponding synthases (3Liang P.H. Ko T.P. Wang A.H.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3339-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These allylic pyrophosphates, including DMAPP, GPP, FPP, and GGPP, serve as the precursors for hormones, pheromones, visual pigments, photoprotective agents, defensive agents, skeletons of lipid for membranes, and constituents of signal transduction networks (4Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). From the allylic substrate (FPP in most cases), larger linear polymers can be synthesized through the addition of IPP to the growing chain by a group of prenyltransferases (5Wang K. Ohnuma S. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 445-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These prenyltransferases either form a cis or trans double bond during each IPP condensation (6Szkopinska A. Plochocka D. Acta Biochim.

Two conserved aspartate-rich motifs DDXXD, where X encodes any amino acid, found in all trans-prenyltransferases, coordinate with Mg2+ for substrate binding and the subsequent reaction (7Chen A.

In general, trans-prenyltransferases synthesize products up to C50 in chain lengths, which can be further divided into short-chain (C10-C25), medium-chain (C30-C35), and long-chain (C40-C50) (14Ogura K. Koyama T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1263-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and cis-prenyltransferases generate much longer products (15Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H. Tsai P.C. Gao Y.G.

In the co-crystal structure of FPP synthase (FPPs) with nonreactive thiol analog of the allylic substrate DMAPP and the homoallylic substrate IPP, the first DDXXD binds the pyrophosphate head group of the allylic substrate via Mg2+ and the second DDXXD coordinates with two other Mg2+ ions to form a trinuclear cluster for pulling the pyrophosphate leaving group of the allylic substrate (16Hosfield D.J.

A bulky amino acid residue at the fourth or fifth position before the first DDXXD motif in helix D (see Fig. 1 for sequence homology) forms a blockage underneath the allylic substrate site to avoid the further elongation of FPP product. Replacement of the large amino acid with a small one removes the blockage and leads to longer products (17Tarshis L.C. Proteau P.J. Kellogg B.A. Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For the long-chain C40-octaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (OPPs), its crystal structure shows a small residue at that position and a large amino acid Phe132 from another helix (helix G) seals the bottom of the active site crevice (20Guo R.T. Kuo C.J. Ko T.P. Chou C.C. Liang P.H. Wang A.H.-J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7678-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar to OPPs, medium-chain C30 hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (HexPPs) also utilizes L164 from helix G for shielding the final product in the middle of the crevice (10Sun H.Y. Ko T.P. Kuo C.J. Guo R.T. Chou C.C. Liang P.H. Wang A.H.-J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8137-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the short-chain geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthases (GGPPs) from different species contain either large or small residues at the fourth or fifth position before the first DDXXD (Fig. 1). By virtue of one IPP condensation reaction with FPP, GGPPs synthesizes C20 GGPP, which serves as a precursor for carotenoids, geranylgeranylated proteins, chlorophylls, and archaeal ether-linked lipid for the cytoplasmic membrane (21Jiang Y. Proteau P. Poulter D. Ferro-Novick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21793-21799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These GGPPs are classified into three types based on their amino acid sequences; type-I GGPPs contains a large amino acid at the fourth or fifth position prior to the DDXXD motif, but type-II (with insertion of two amino acids within the first Asp-rich motif) and type-III GGPPs found in eukaryotes (except plants) have a small amino acid at the corresponding position (see Fig. 1) (22Hemmi H. Noike M. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2186-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To rationalize the mechanism of product chain length determination for the type-III GGPPs, we solved the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GGPPs to 1.98 Å resolution as reported here. While bearing a common structural feature with other trans-prenyltransferases, GGPPs structure reveals a unique orientation of its N terminus. The helix A of type-III GGPPs protrudes into the other subunit, which seems to be involved in the tight dimer formation. Mutants truncated by deleting this helix and the following loop region were examined for dimer formation as presented here. On the basis of the structure, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies to identify the amino acids critical for product chain length determination. Together with recently solved type-I GGPPs, 4Crystal structure of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase from T. thermophilus, deposited by K. Suto, K. Nishio, Y. Nodake, K. Hamada, M. Kawamoto, N.

Miura, Riken Structural Genomics Proteomics and Initiative (Rsgi) on July 21, 2004. our structures enhance the understanding of the chain elongation mechanisms for the short-chain trans-prenyltransferases. Materials—Radiolabeled [14C]IPP (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nonlabeled FPP and seleno-dl-methionine were obtained from Sigma. Reverse-phase TLC plates were purchased from Merck. PfuTurbo DNA polymerase was obtained from Invitrogen. The plasmid miniprep kit, DNA gel extraction kit, and Ni2+-NTA resin were purchased from Qiagen. Potato acid phosphatase (2 units/mg) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Factor Xa and the protein expression kit (including the pET32Xa/LIC vector and competent JM109 and BL21 cells) were obtained from Novagen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene. All commercial buffers and reagents were of the highest grade. Expression and Purification of GGPPs—The gene encoding GGPPs was cloned from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by using PCR and the forward primer 5′-ggtattgagggtcgcatggaggccaagatagatg-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-agaggagagttagagcctcacaattcggataagtgg-3′ into the pET32Xa/LIC vector. In this construct, we included a five-residue sequence (MTKNK) from Thermotoga maritima OPPs between the N terminus of GGPPs and the Factor Xa cleavage sequence to expose the protease site for tag removal. The recombinant GGPPs plasmid was then used to transform Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells that were streaked on a Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected from the agar plate and grown in 5 ml of LB culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. The correct construct by sequencing was subsequently transformed to E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The 60-ml overnight culture of a single transformant was used to inoculate 6 liters of fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown to A600 = 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C. After 16 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 15 min to collect the cell paste. The enzyme purification was conducted at 4 °C. Cell paste was suspended in 75 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. Cell lysate was prepared with a French pressure cell press (AIM-AMINCO Spectronic Instruments) and centrifuged at 17,000 × g to remove cell debris. The cell-free extract was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column, which had been previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 mm imidazole followed by 20 mm imidazole-containing buffer. His-tagged GGPPs eluted with 100 mm imidazole was dialyzed twice against 3 liters of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) and then subjected to Factor Xa digestion to remove the tag. The mixture was then passed through another Ni2+-NTA column, and subsequently untagged GGPPs was eluted with 10 mm imidazole-containing buffer and then dialyzed twice against 3 liters of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) for storage. SDS-PAGE analysis was used to check the purity (>95%) of GGPPs and its mutants. Preparation of Selenomethionine-labeled GGPPs—To produce selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled GGPPs for x-ray phase solving, the plasmid that GGPPs gene was transformed into a BL21 (DE3)-competent cell. The single transformant was first grown overnight at 37 °C in 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 15 min. The paste suspended in SeMet minimal medium (24Guerrero S.A. Hecht H.J. Hofmann B. Biebl H. Singh M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was then used to inoculate 6 liters of SeMet minimal medium with the supplement of 100 μg/ml seleno-dl-methionine. Isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm for induction after the cell density reached A600 = 0.4. The cells were grown for another 96 h at 16 °C and then harvested by centrifugation. The subsequent purification procedure for SeMet GGPPs was the same as for the native GGPPs. Crystallization and Data Collection—Native and SeMet-labeled GGPPs were crystallized using the hanging drop method from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA) by mixing 2 μl of the GGPPs solution (10-12 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with 2 μl of the mother liquor (0.08 m CH3COONa, 0.145 m (NH4)2SO4, 13% polyethylene glycol 4000, 7-9% glycerol, and 7-9% 1,2-propanediol) and equilibrating with 500 μl of the mother liquor. Within 7 days at room temperature, crystals grew to dimensions of about 0.4 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm. The x-ray diffraction data for the native GGPPs were collected to 1.98 Å resolution at beam line BL17B2 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Hsinchu, Taiwan), and the SeMet-labeled GGPPs data were collected to 2.4 Å at 100 K on the Taiwan Contract BL12B2 station at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) by employing the multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction method. The diffraction data were processed and scaled by using the program HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). These GGPPs crystals belong to the space group P212121, with typical unit cell parameters of a = 48 Å, b = 116 Å, and c = 129 Å. Each asymmetric unit contained a dimeric GGPPs molecule. Structure Determination and Refinement—The multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction data sets in the resolution range of 30 to 2.4 Å were collected at wavelengths of 1.0332 Å (low remote), 0.9799 Å (inflection point), 0.9796 Å (peak), and 0.9537 Å (high remote) at and near the selenium absorption edge. Using SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), 20 selenium sites in the asymmetric unit were located, and the phase angles were determined in the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method using the peak wavelength data. Further iterative cycles of density modification, model building, and refinement were carried out with RESOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1763-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Xtalview (28McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Rfree values were calculated by using 5% reflections. The stereochemical quality of the refined structure was checked with the program PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Each monomer of the refined structure encompassed 322 of the 335 total residues of the GGPPs sequence, with a small disordered region of residues 315-327. 578 well ordered water molecules were also located and included in the model. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. All of the structural diagrams were drawn by using the PyMol software (available on the World Wide Web at pymol.sourceforge.net/) and GRASP (31Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct.

The mutagenic primers used were prepared by MDBio Inc. (Taiwan). The mutagenic oligonucleotides for performing site-directed mutagenesis are 5′-caccgcaaattatatgGCGttcagagccatgcaacttg-3′ for Y107A, 5′-caccgcaaattatatgtatGCGagagccatgcaacttg-3′ for F108A, 5′-caccgcaaattatatgGCGGCGagagccatgcaacttg-3′ for Y107A/F108A, 5′-cgattttcaacgaagaaGCGatcaatctacatagg-3′ for L135A, 5′-gaagaattgatcaatctaGCGaggggacaaggcttgg-3′ for H139A, and 5′-gctcttgcataattccTACcttttaatcgacgatatag-3′ for S71Y (the mutated nucleotides are underlined and shown in capital letters). The multiple mutants were constructed with the combination of the above mutagenic primers. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire GGPPs mutant gene of the plasmid obtained from the overnight culture. The correct construct was subsequently transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression and purification. The purity (>95%) of each purified mutant GGPPs was checked by SDS-PAGE. Kinetic Parameters for Mutant GGPPs—For enzyme activity measurements, each mutant GGPPs (0.2 μm Y107A, F108A, H139A, Y107A/F108A, Y107A/H139A, L135A/H139A, F108A/H139A, Y107A/F108A/H139A, or Y107A/F108A//L135A/H139A) was used. The reaction was initiated in 200 μl of solution containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), various concentrations of FPP and [14C]IPP as specified below, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 25 °C. The enzyme concentration used in all experiments was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm ([cepsilon] = 20,340 m-1 cm-1). The measurements of the kinetic parameters for the wild type and mutants followed our published procedure (32Kuo T.H. Liang P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1599: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 33Pan J.J. Chiu S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For IPP Km determinations, 20 μm FPP was utilized to saturate the enzyme, and IPP concentrations from 0.25 to 400 μm varied with the Km of IPP for each mutant were employed. For FPP Km and kcat measurements, 0.25-32 μm FPP was used along with 50 μm [14C]IPP, except for the mutants of Y107A/H139A, F108A/H139A, Y107A/F108A/H139A, and Y107A/F108A/L135A/H139A, where 250 μm [14C]IPP was used. For Y107A/H139A, Y107A/F108A/H139A, and Y107A/F108A/L135A/H139A, the enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 0.1 μm mutants to measure the FPP Km and kcat. GPP Km measurements for wild type and S71Y used 0.25-50 μm GPP along with 50 μm [14C]IPP. To measure the initial rate, 40-μl portions of the reaction mixture were periodically withdrawn within 10% substrate depletion and then mixed with 10 mm EDTA for reaction termination. The radiolabeled products were then extracted with 1-butanol, and the radioactivities associated with aqueous and butanol phases were separately quantitated by using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Data of initial rates versus substrate concentrations were analyzed by nonlinear regression of the Michaelis-Menten equation using the KaleidaGraph computer program (Synergy software) to obtain Km and Vmax values. The kcat was calculated from Vmax/[E]. Steady-state activity of the S71Y mutant was assayed under the same condition except that GPP instead of FPP was used. Product Analysis—The GGPPs reaction containing 1 μm enzyme (wild-type or mutant GGPPs), 10 μm FPP, 150 μm [14C]IPP, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl in 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) was incubated for 6 h at 25 °C. Ten mm EDTA was used to terminate the enzyme reaction. For identification of S71Y product, GPP instead of FPP was used as the allylic substrate. The radiolabeled products were extracted with 1-butanol. The 1-butanol was then evaporated, and the 20% 1-propanol solution containing 4.4 units/ml acidic phosphatase, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.7) was used to convert the products to the corresponding alcohols according to the reported procedure (32Kuo T.H. Liang P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1599: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After the pyrophosphate hydrolysis catalyzed by acidic phosphatase was completed, the polyprenols were extracted with n-hexane. The polyprenols were separated on reversed-phase TLC using acetone/water (19:1) as mobile phase. The radiolabeled products were identified by autoradiography using a bioimaging analyzer FUJIFILM BAS-1500 (Japan) according to their Rf (retention factor) values reported (22Hemmi H. Noike M. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2186-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Construction of N-terminal Truncated Mutants—For constructing the genes to express the truncated GGPPs without the first N-terminal 17 amino acids Δ(1-17) or without the first 9 amino acids Δ(1-9), a common reverse primer, 5′-agaggagagttagagcctcacaattcggataagtgg-3′, was used with the forward primer 5′-ggtattgagggtcgccaaaatgaaagcttgatttc-3′ for Δ(1-17) or 5′-ggtattgagggtcgcaataatgatcctgtttggtc-3′ for Δ(1-9). The PCR-amplified products from the template were inserted into the pET32Xa/LIC vector as described above. The deletion was confirmed by sequencing, and correct construct was subsequently transformed to E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The truncated proteins were purified using a Ni2+-NTA column, and their activities were measured as the other mutant enzymes described above. Gel Filtration Experiments—The molecular mass of GGPPs was determined on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL High Performance column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences) by comparing the elution volume of the GGPPs (1 and 0.2 mg/ml) with those of protein molecular mass standards, including catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). A buffer of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl was used to elute the proteins at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Overall Structure of S. cerevisiae GGPPs—The crystal structure of S. cerevisiae GGPPs has been determined to 1.98 Å resolution. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, each asymmetric unit of the crystal unit cell contains one GGPPs dimer, and two identical subunits are associated into a dimer by forming a four-layer helix bundle using helices F and G and a four-layer helix arm using helices A and B. The refined structure of type-III GGPPs in complex with one magnesium ion in each subunit contains amino acid residues 2-314 and 328-340. The electron density map between residues 315 and 327 at the C terminus is not clearly visible. The structure contains 15 α helices, nine of them (helices A-I) surrounding a large central cavity. Helices F and G are involved in the dimer formation, with the major stabilization coming from the helices F (α chain)-F (β chain) and F (α chain)-G (β chain) intersubunit hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The side chain of Met111 is stacked with that of Met111 from the other subunit, so it is different from the T. maritima OPPs, which uses aromatic amino acid of Phe117 for hydrophobic interaction (9Guo R.T.

Active Site—Two conserved DDXXD motifs located on helices D and I, respectively, near the opening of a deep cleft, are proposed to be the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 2A). In the superimposed three-dimensional structures of this GGPPs with other trans-prenyltransferases (Fig. 3A), this region is coincident with the active site proposed for FPPs. From the potential surface diagram (not shown), this proposed active site pocket is surrounded by the polar (mostly positively charged) residues, including Arg84, Arg85,His68, Lys37, and Arg40, which are probably responsible for attracting if not directly interacting with the negatively charged pyrophosphate head groups of the substrates. As revealed by a more focused view of this active site (Fig. 3B), a Mg2+ ion is coordinated by Asp75 and Asp79 from the first DDXXD and four water molecules. The distances of coordination bonds from the Mg2+ to Asp75, Asp79, and four water molecules are 2.06, 2.0, 2.5, 3.08, 3.07, and 2.12 Å, respectively, in α subunit and 2.03, 2.06, 2.3, 2.33, 2.8, and 3.04 Å, respectively, in β subunit. This Mg2+ supposedly coordinates with the pyrophosphate group of FPP. There are two short α helices, helix E (Ser95-Phe99) and helix J (Glu231-Glu235) on the outer surface of the α-cone. The region including the loop between D and E, the loop between I and J, helix J, and the loop between J and K are not part of the active site, but it may sw"
https://openalex.org/W2029492108,"Four recent observational results have challenged our understanding of high-redshift galaxies, as they require the presence of far more ultraviolet photons than should be emitted by normal stellar populations. First, there is significant ultraviolet emission from Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at wavelengths shorter than 912 A. Second, there is strong Lyman alpha emission from extended 'blobs' with little or no associated apparent ionizing continuum. Third, there is a population of galaxies with unusually strong Lyman alpha emission lines. And fourth, there is a strong He II (1,640 A) emission line in a composite of LBGs. The proposed explanations for the first three observations are internally inconsistent, and the fourth puzzle has remained hitherto unexplained. Here we show that all four problems are resolved simultaneously if 10-30 per cent of the stars in many galaxies at z approximately 3-4 are mainly primordial--unenriched by elements heavier than helium ('metals'). Most models of hierarchical galaxy formation assume efficient intragalactic metal mixing, and therefore do not predict metal-free star formation at redshifts significantly below z approximately 5. Our results imply that micromixing of metals within galaxies is inefficient on an approximately gigayear timescale, a conclusion that can be verified with higher-resolution simulations, and future observations of the He ii emission line."
https://openalex.org/W2068146190,"Chromosome 11, although average in size, is one of the most gene- and disease-rich chromosomes in the human genome. Initial gene annotation indicates an average gene density of 11.6 genes per megabase, including 1,524 protein-coding genes, some of which were identified using novel methods, and 765 pseudogenes. One-quarter of the protein-coding genes shows overlap with other genes. Of the 856 olfactory receptor genes in the human genome, more than 40% are located in 28 single- and multi-gene clusters along this chromosome. Out of the 171 disorders currently attributed to the chromosome, 86 remain for which the underlying molecular basis is not yet known, including several mendelian traits, cancer and susceptibility loci. The high-quality data presented here—nearly 134.5 million base pairs representing 99.8% coverage of the euchromatic sequence—provide scientists with a solid foundation for understanding the genetic basis of these disorders and other biological phenomena. The Human Genome Project's analysis of chromosome 11 is published this week. This is one of the most gene- and disease-rich chromosomes in the human genome. It contains more than 40% of the olfactory receptor genes, the largest multi-gene family in any metazoan genome. It is also home to the β-globin gene cluster, which is responsible for several disorders including sickle-cell anaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2095363062,"Bcl2 and c-Myc are two major oncogenic proteins that can functionally promote DNA damage, genetic instability, and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism(s) remains unclear. Nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is the most potent carcinogen contained in cigarette smoke that induces cellular DNA damage. Here we found that Bcl2 potently suppresses the repair of NNK-induced abasic sites of DNA lesions in association with increased c-Myc transcriptional activity. The Bcl2 BH4 domain (amino acids 6-31) was found to bind directly to c-Myc MBII domain (amino acids 106-143), and this interaction is required for Bcl2 to enhance c-Myc transcriptional activity and inhibit DNA repair. In addition to mitochondria, Bcl2 is also expressed in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with c-Myc. Expression of nuclear-targeted Bcl2 enhances c-Myc transcriptional activity with suppression of DNA repair but fails to prolong cell survival. Depletion of c-Myc expression from cells overexpressing Bcl2 significantly accelerates the repair of NNK-induced DNA damage, indicating that c-Myc may be essential for the Bcl2 effect on DNA repair. It is known that apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) plays a crucial role in the repair of abasic sites of DNA lesions. That overexpression of Bcl2 results in up-regulation of c-Myc and down-regulation of APE1 suggests APE1 may function as the downstream target of Bcl2/c-Myc in the DNA repair machinery. Thus, Bcl2, in addition to its survival function, may also suppress DNA repair in a novel mechanism involving c-Myc and APE1, which may lead to an accumulation of DNA damage in living cells, genetic instability, and tumorigenesis.

Bcl2 was discovered by cloning the t(14,18)(q32;q21) chromosomal breakpoint characteristic of human follicular B-cell lymphoma (1Bakhshi A. Jensen J.P. Goldman P. Wright J.J. McBride O.W.

Bcl2 has the unique role of extending cell survival rather than promoting cell proliferation (4Cheng N. Janumyan Y.M. Didion L. Hofwegen C.V. Yang E. Knudson C.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3770-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). B- and T-cell lineage Bcl2 transgenic mice models demonstrate an oncogenic phenotype (5Linette G.P. Hess J.L. Sentman C.L.

Cory S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Eμ-Bcl2 transgenic mice show an increased incidence of B-cell lymphomas (7Strasser A. Harris A.W. Cory S.

Blood. 1995; 86: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Bcl2 not only functions as a potent antiapoptotic molecule but also as a cellular proto-oncogene that can promote tumor development. Several reports indicate that Bcl2 can enhance DNA damage and attenuate DNA repair in association with genetic instability (8Chebonnel-Lasserre C. Gauny S. Kronenberg A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1489-1497PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kuo M. Shiah S. Wang C. Chuang S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 894-901PubMed Google Scholar, 10Liu Y. Naumovski L. Hanawalt P.

However, the mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 regulates DNA damage and repair remains enigmatic. c-Myc is a protooncogene that normally regulates cellular growth and proliferation and in some contexts induces apoptosis (12Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar, 13Soucie E.L.

Overexpression of c-Myc is thought to cause tumorigenesis by promoting unrestrained cellular proliferation and blocking differentiation. c-Myc also contributes to tumorigenesis by inducing genomic destabilization (14Felsher D.W. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3940-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 15Li Q. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell.

The genomic damage induced by c-Myc can be broadly grouped into two classes of abnormalities. First, overexpression of c-Myc induces loss of chromosomal integrity associated with chromosomal aberrations such as gene amplifications, double minutes, and fusions. Second, c-Myc overexpression can cause inappropriate DNA replication, resulting in endoreduplication. The former type of genomic abnormalities can be caused by defects in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand DNA break; SSB, single-strand DNA break; NNK, nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; AP sites, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites or abasic sites; BER, base excision repair; BH; Bcl2 homology; MBI, Myc Box I; MBII, Myc Box II; siRNA, small interfering RNA; APE1, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ARP, aldehyde-reactive probe; RNAi, RNA interference. 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand DNA break; SSB, single-strand DNA break; NNK, nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; AP sites, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites or abasic sites; BER, base excision repair; BH; Bcl2 homology; MBI, Myc Box I; MBII, Myc Box II; siRNA, small interfering RNA; APE1, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ARP, aldehyde-reactive probe; RNAi, RNA interference. since c-Myc overexpression disrupts the repair of DSBs (17Karlsson A.

Bcl2 and c-Myc are two major oncogenic proteins that can functionally cooperate in cell proliferation, transformation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (20Reed J.C. Cuddy M. Haldar S. Croce C. Nowell P. Makover D. Bradley K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To avoid c-Myc-induced cell death and ensure its oncogenic property, Bcl2 functions as one of the most potent Myc-cooperating oncoproteins, which is a global inhibitor of apoptosis, likely through multiple mechanisms (13Soucie E.L.

Because Bcl2, in addition to its antiapoptotic function, is able to regulate DNA damage and repair (8Chebonnel-Lasserre C. Gauny S. Kronenberg A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that Bcl2 may regulate c-Myc to inhibit DNA repair and retain such damage in surviving cells leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Nicotine and nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are two important components in cigarette smoke (22Schuller H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that nicotine promotes survival of both normal human lung epithelial and lung cancer cells (23Mai H. May W.S. Gao F. Jin Z. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1886-1891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S. Linnoila I.R. Yang X. Swain S.M. Harris C. Belinsky S. Dennis P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). NNK is formed from nicotine by opening of the pyrrolidine ring and nitrosation. This occurs during the processing of tobacco leaves and in the body of smoker (25Brunnemann K.D. Prokopczyk B. Djordjevic M.V. Hoffmann D. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1996; 26: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Carmella S.G. Borukhova A. Desai D. Hecht S.S.

In contrast to nicotine, NNK is a more potent carcinogen that not only stimulates survival and proliferation of normal lung epithelial and lung cancer cells but also induces single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) and oxidative DNA damage in culture cells as well as whole animals (24West K.A.

The outcome of DNA damage is generally adverse, contributing to degenerative processes such as aging and cancer (36Boiteux S. Guillet M. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are expected to be one of the most frequent lesions in DNA. AP sites can be formed by spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond or as a consequence of the removal of damaged or inappropriate bases by DNA N-glycosylases. The vast majority of damaged and inappropriate bases in DNA are removed by specific DNA N-glycosylases yielding AP sites. Cleavage of AP sites by AP endonucleases or by DNA N-glycosylases/AP lyases results in the formation of SSBs with 3′- or 5′-blocked ends that cannot be used as substrates by DNA polymerases or DNA ligases. The 3′- or 5′-blocked SSBs can be converted into DSBs after DNA replication (36Boiteux S. Guillet M. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The specific DSBs may lead to chromosomal translocations that contribute to genomic instability and/or tumorigenesis (37Richardson C. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9068-9075Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). AP sites are the central intermediate in DNA base excision repair (BER) and are processed by AP endonucleases (38Mol C. Hosfield D. Tainer J. Mutat. Res. 2000; PubMed Google Scholar). Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) is a multifunctional protein possessing both DNA repair and redox regulatory activities and is involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity (39Izumi T. Brown D. Naidu C. Bhakat K. MacInnes M. Saito H. Chen D. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5739-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 40Mol C. Hosfield D. Tainer J. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In BER, APE1 can recognize and bind to abasic DNA and is responsible for processing spontaneous, chemical, or monofunctional DNA glycosylase-initiated AP sites via its 5′-endonuclease activity and 3′-end-trimming activity (41Raffoul J. Cabelof D. Nakamura J. Meira L. Friedberg E. Heydari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, APE1 plays an essential role in the repair of AP sites of DNA damage. We recently discovered that NNK promotes survival and proliferation of human lung cancer cells through phosphorylation of Bcl2 and c-Myc (42Jin Z. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40209-40219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether NNK can induce AP sites in cellular genomic DNA and whether Bcl2 and c-Myc can regulate the repair of NNK-induced DNA damage including AP sites to promote genetic instability. Here we discovered that Bcl2 attenuates DNA repair by a novel mechanism involving c-Myc and APE1. Materials—Bcl2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), anti-Bcl2, c-Myc, APE1, and GST antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-prohibitin antibody was purchased from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Cisplatin and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were obtained from Sigma. NNK was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). The pTA-Luc and pMyc-TA-luc vector was obtained from BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA. The pShooter-pCMV/Myc/Nuc vector was purchased from Invitrogen. The c-Myc siRNA and Silencer™ siRNA transfection kit were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Purified recombinant c-Myc protein was purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Purified recombinant WT, ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3, and ΔBH4 Bcl2 mutant proteins were obtained from ProteinX Lab (San Diego, CA). WT, ΔMBI, and ΔMBII c-Myc DNA mutants were obtained from Dr. Chi Dang (Johns Hopkins). HO15.19 (c-Myc-/-) cells were kindly provided by Dr. John M. Sedivy (Brown University). All reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—NCI-H69, NCI-H82, NCI-H157, NCI-H23, NCI-H358, NCI-H460, and NCI-H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. A549 cells were maintained in F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine. HO15.19 (c-Myc-/-) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Generation of the BH4 Deletion Bcl-2 Mutant (ΔBH4)—The 5′-phosphorylated mutagenic primer for the precise deletion (Δ6-31) mutant was synthesized as follows: 5′-GGA AGG ATG GCG CAA GCC GGG AGA GCT GGA GAT GCG GAC GCG GCG CCC CTG-3′. The WT-Bcl2/pUC19 construct was used as the target plasmid that contains a unique NdeI restriction site for selection against the unmutated plasmid. The NdeI selection primer is 5′-GAG TGC ACC ATG GGC GGT GTG AAA-3′. The ΔBH4 Bcl2 deletion mutant was created by using a mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA. The ΔBH4 Bcl2 deletion mutant was then cloned into the pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI) mammalian expression vector. Creation of Nuclear-targeted Constructs—For generation of nuclear-targeted WT and ΔBH4 mutant Bcl-2, WT or ΔBH4 Bcl2 mutant/pCIneo construct was used as a template for PCR using the Platinium® High Fidelity PCR Supermix (Invitrogen) kit. PCR primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-GTG GCC ACC ATG GCG CAA GCC GGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCG GCC GCC TTG TGG CCC AGG-3′. The PCR mixtures were incubated at 94 °C for 2 min to completely denature the template and activate the enzyme. The conditions for PCR amplification were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 45 s. The samples were run for 30 cycles. PCR products were ligated directly into PCR 2.1-TOPO vector, amplified using TOP10 cells (Invitrogen), and screened by PCR for positive clones. Positive clones in PCR 2.1 TOPO vector were digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI/NotI and subcloned into pCMV/Myc/Nuc vector. Each mutant was verified by DNA sequencing. Stable Transfection—The pCIneo or pCMV/Myc/Nuc plasmid bearing the WT or ΔBH4 Bcl2 mutant was transfected into H1299 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Clones stably expressing WT or the ΔBH4 Bcl2 mutant were selected in a medium containing G418 (0.6 mg/ml). The expression levels of exogenous Bcl2 were analyzed by Western blot analysis using a Bcl2 antibody. Three separate clones for each mutant expressing similar levels of exogenous Bcl2 were selected for further analysis. Preparation of Total Cell Lysate—Cells were washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in ice-cold EBC buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected as the total cell lysate as described (42Jin Z. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40209-40219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Generation of GST-tagged c-Myc Fusion Proteins—pGEX-2T/GST-Myc (N262) and pGEX-2T/GST-/Myc(C176) were kind gifts from Dr. Bernhard Lüscher (43Vervoots J. Luscher-Firzlaff J. Rottmann S. Lilischkis R. Walsemann G. Dohmann K. Austen M. Luscher B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These plasmids contain the amino acids of human c-Myc, indicated in parentheses in the name of each plasmid. Various c-Myc mutants in pGEX vector were transformed into BL21 Star™ (DE3) cells (Invitrogen). GST-c-Myc fusion proteins were produced and purified using BugBuster™ protein extraction reagent (Novagen) and glutathione-Sepharose ® 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Immunofluorescence Staining—H460 cells expressing endogenous c-Myc and Bcl2 or H1299 cells expressing nuclear targeted WT Bcl-2 were seeded and cultured on Lab-Tek® chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell culture medium was removed, and cells were incubated with prewarmed (37 °C) growth medium containing 200 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes). The cells were incubated for 30 min under normal growth conditions. After staining, the cells were washed with prewarmed growth medium and fixed with freshly prepared, prewarmed growth medium containing 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with ice-cold acetone for 5 min. Cells were blocked with PBS containing 10% normal rabbit serum for 20 min at room temperature. Then cells were incubated with a rabbit Bcl2 primary antibody at room temperature for 90 min. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 60 min. Cells were washed with PBS and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Samples were observed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss) or a confocal fluorescent microscope (Leica, TCS SP2). Pictures were taken and colored with the same exposure setting for each experiment. To determine subcellular regions of protein co-localization, individual green-, red-, and blue-stained images derived from the same field were merged using Openlab 3.1.5 software from Improvision, Inc. (Lexington, MA). c-Myc Transcriptional Activity Assay—c-Myc transcriptional activity was assessed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) because this system allows for a more reliable interpretation of the experimental data by reducing extraneous influence. The term “dual reporter” refers to the simultaneous expression and measurement of two individual reporter enzymes within a single system. The “experimental” reporter (i.e. pMyc-TA-Luc luciferase reporter) is correlated with the effect of specific experimental conditions, whereas the activity of the co-transfected “control” reporter (i.e. pTK Renilla luciferase reporter) provides an internal control that serves as a base-line response. Normalizing the activity of the experimental reporter to the activity of the internal control will minimize experimental variability caused by differences in cell viability, transfection efficiency, or other extraneous influences. A 20:1 mixture of the pMyc-TA-Luc luciferase and pTK Renilla control luciferase reporter vectors were cotransfected with Bcl-2/pCIneo or Bcl2/pCMV/Myc/Nuc constructs in various human lung cancer cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The pTA-Luc vector was used as a negative control. After 48 h cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer. Firefly luciferase activity (pMyc-TA-Luc reporter) to Renilla luciferase activity (internal control) was assessed according to the Promega technical manual and analyzed by a Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Biosciences). Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Comet Assay—A single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet Assay) kit was employed for evaluating DNA damage following the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Comet Assay is an effective method for detection of DNA damage in cells. The principle of the assay is based upon the ability of denatured, cleaved DNA fragments to migrate out of the cell under the influence of an electric field, whereas undamaged DNA migrates slower and remains within the confines of the nucleoid when a current is applied. After treatment of cells with DNA damage agents (i.e. NNK, methylmethane sulfonate, or H2O2), cells in 1× PBS (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) at 1 × 105/ml were combined with molten LMAgarose (at 37 °C) at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v) and immediately pipetted 75 μl onto CometSlide™. After a gentle cell lysis, samples were treated with alkali to unwind and denature the DNA and hydrolyze sites of damage. The samples were submitted to electrophoresis, stained with a fluorescent DNA intercalating dye (i.e. SYBR Green I nucleic acid), and visualized by a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan-2 Imaging, Thornwood, NY). AP Site Counting in Genomic DNA—One of the most prevalent lesions in DNA is the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. After treatment of cells with NNK, genomic DNA was purified using a DNA isolation kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The number of AP sites was assessed using a DNA damage quantification (AP Site Counting) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Aldehyde-reactive probe (ARP) reagent (N′-aminooxymethylcarbonylhydrazino-d-biotin) can react specifically with an aldehyde group which is the open ring form of the AP sites. After treating DNA-containing AP sites with ARP reagent, AP sites are tagged with biotin residues. By using an excess amount of ARP, all AP sites can be converted to biotin-tagged AP sites. Standard ARP DNA and purified ARP-labeled sample genomic DNA were fixed on a 96-well plate with DNA binding solution. Then the number of AP sites in the sample DNA was determined by the biotin-avidin-peroxidase assay. The absorbance of the samples was analyzed using a microplate reader with a 650-nm filter. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. RNA Interference (RNAi)—This is a technique for down-regulating the expression of a specific gene in living cells by introducing a homologous double-stranded RNA. H460 cells or H1299 cells expressing WT Bcl2 were transfected with Bcl2 siRNA or c-Myc siRNA, respectively, according to the siPORT lipid siRNA transfection protocol from the manufacturer (Ambion, Inc). A control siRNA (non-homologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of Bcl2 or c-Myc expression were analyzed by Western blotting using a Bcl2 or c-Myc antibody, respectively. DNA damage was assessed by AP Site Counting or Comet Assay after various treatments. Specific silencing of the targeted Bcl2 or c-Myc gene was confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Cell Viability Assay—Apoptotic and viable cells were detected using an ApoAlert annexin-V kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of annexin-Vlow (i.e. viable) or annexin-Vhigh (i.e. apoptotic) cells was determined using the data obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described (42Jin Z. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40209-40219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell viability was confirmed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Treatment of Cells with NNK Enhances c-Myc Transcriptional Activity in Association with Increased DNA Damage—NNK has been demonstrated to induce DNA damage and promote proliferation of human lung cancer cells (22Schuller H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which contribute to tumor development. NNK-induced SSBs could result from hydrolysis of alkali-labile sites, N7-Gua methylation, and enzymatic incision during excision repair (44Castonguay A. Foiles P. Trushin N. Hecht S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1985; 62: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 45Dobrzanski K.D. Castonguay A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because c-Myc has been reported to enhance DNA damage and suppress DNA repair (17Karlsson A. Deb-Basu D. Cherry A. Turner S. Ford J. Felsher D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9974-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and is ubiquitously expressed in both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (Fig. 1A), NNK may stimulate c-Myc to further enhance DNA damage. To test this, the pMyc-TA-Luc luciferase reporter construct was used to monitor the transcriptional activity of c-Myc in the NNK-mediated signal transduction pathway. First, H460 cells expressing endogenous c-Myc and Bcl2 were transfected with a 20:1 mix of the pMyc-TA-Luc luciferase reporter and the pTK Renilla control luciferase report constructs. After 48 h cells were treated with NNK (1 μm) for various times and then lysed in passive lysis buffer. The firefly (pMyc-TA-Luc reporter) activity relative to the Renilla (control) luciferase activity was assessed using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit and analyzed using the Monolight™ 3010 Luminometer. Intriguingly, exposure of cells to NNK significantly enhances c-Myc transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). To evaluate NNK-induced DNA damage, H460 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NNK (i.e. 1-5 μm) for 60 min. DNA damage was analyzed by Comet Assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results reveal that NNK induces DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). Cells that have accumulated DNA damage appear as fluorescent “comets” with tails of DNA fragmentation or unwinding, whereas normal undamaged DNA does not migrate far from the origin (Fig."

https://openalex.org/W2083433634,"The P-type ATPase affected in Wilson disease, ATP7B, is a key liver protein required to regulate and maintain copper homeostasis. When hepatocytes are exposed to elevated copper levels, ATP7B traffics from the trans-Golgi network toward the biliary canalicular membrane to excrete excess copper into bile. The N-terminal region of ATP7B contains six metal-binding sites (MBS), each with the copper-binding motif MXCXXC. These sites are required for the activity and copper-regulated intracellular redistribution of ATP7B. Two proteins are known to interact with the ATP7B N-terminal region: the copper chaperone ATOX1 that delivers copper to ATP7B, and COMMD1 (MURR1) that is potentially involved in vesicular copper sequestration. To identify additional proteins that interact with ATP7B and hence are involved in copper homeostasis, a yeast two-hybrid approach was employed to screen a human liver cDNA library. The dynactin subunit p62 (dynactin 4; DCTN4) was identified as an interacting partner, and this interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells. The dynactin complex binds cargo, such as vesicles and organelles, to cytoplasmic dynein for retrograde microtubule-mediated trafficking and could feasibly be involved in the copper-regulated trafficking of ATP7B. The ATP7B/p62 interaction required copper, the metal-binding CXXC motifs, and the region between MBS 4 and MBS 6 of ATP7B. The p62 subunit did not interact with the related copper ATPase, ATP7A. We propose that the ATP7B interaction with p62 is a key component of the copper-induced trafficking pathway that delivers ATP7B to subapical vesicles of hepatocytes for the removal of excess copper into bile.

Copper is essential for the survival of all organisms because it is required for a number of important copper-dependent enzymes (1Linder M.C. Massaro E.J. Handbook of Copper Pharmacology and Toxicology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 3-32Google Scholar). Disruption of copper homeostasis leads to a number of diseases, including the genetic disorders Wilson disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis, and Menkes disease (2Culotta V. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R.

Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The redox properties that make copper biologically useful as an enzyme cofactor in numerous key cellular reactions (4Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: S797-S811PubMed Google Scholar) also render it potentially toxic. This conflict between toxicity and essentiality requires all organisms to have developed intricate and highly regulated copper homeostatic mechanisms. The copper diseases occur when these systems fail, but in many cases our knowledge of the mechanisms is insufficient to understand disease pathogenesis. In mammals, the overall copper status is mainly regulated by excretion of excess copper into the bile. This process is disrupted in Wilson disease, leading to massive accumulation of copper in the liver. Wilson disease is caused by mutations in ATP7B (reviewed in Ref. 5Gitlin J.D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1868-1877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).

When intracellular copper levels are in excess, it redistributes to a vesicular compartment located toward the biliary canalicular membrane where excess copper is eliminated from the cell into the bile either by exocytosis through fusion of copper-loaded vesicles with the membrane (7Schaefer M.

There are six metal binding domains within the N-terminal regions of ATP7B and the closely related copper ATPase defective in Menkes disease, ATP7A. Each domain is ∼70 amino acids in length, and each contains one MXCXXC motif. The six repeating MXCXXC motifs bind 6 molar equivalents of copper via the conserved cysteines and are involved in regulating the copper transport activity and copper-regulated redistribution of the ATPases (10Guo Y.

Several studies have revealed that a large portion of the N-terminal domain is not critical for the overall transport activity and the intracellular redistribution of the human copper-transporting ATPases (10Guo Y.

For example, the N-terminal region of ATP7B encompassing MBS 1–5 (amino acids 63–540) is not essential for copper-induced trafficking, with only one MBS close to the membrane channel necessary and sufficient to support trafficking (19Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hence the large N-terminal region of the ATPases that contain the six MBS may have additional roles and potentially contains other signals or motifs that could be important for the regulated trafficking and targeting of ATP7A and ATP7B (17Forbes J.R.

Despite their sequence and structural similarity and the presence of six MBS within the N termini of the copper ATPases, clearly there are sufficient differences in sequence and/or structure that confer specificity of interactions with proteins such as COMMD1 and differences in their trafficking pathways. The identification of a putative targeting signal in ATP7B that is not present or is different in ATP7A (20Mercer J.F. Barnes N. Stevenson J. Strausak D. Llanos R.M. Biometals. 2003; 16: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) suggests that additional specific protein interactions are likely to impact on their activity and/or trafficking. Only a limited number of proteins are known to be critical for copper homeostasis, and little is known of the protein/protein interactions required for this process. To better understand the function and regulation of ATP7B in copper homeostasis, we have employed yeast two-hybrid technology to identify additional proteins that interact with ATP7B. The yeast two-hybrid system is a powerful and sensitive tool for investigating protein interaction networks (30Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Here we describe the screening of a human liver cDNA library using the N-terminal region of ATP7B as a bait to search for interacting partners. This screen identified the protein p62 (dynactin 4; DCTN4), a subunit of dynactin as potentially interacting with ATP7B. This interaction was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells. We showed that the p62 subunit of dynactin interacts with the N terminus of ATP7B but not ATP7A. This interaction was copper-dependent and required the CXXC motifs and the region between MBS 4 and MBS 6. We propose that the ATP7B interaction with p62 is a key component of the copper-regulated trafficking pathway that delivers ATP7B to subapical vesicles of hepatocytes for the removal of excess copper into bile.

The cell lines were maintained in Eagle's basal medium (BME; Thermo Trace) supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum (Thermo Trace), 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.2 mm proline, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, and geneticin (400 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. Copper-limited medium was prepared by supplementing BME with 100 μm BCS and 100 μm d-penicillamine (Sigma). Generation of Plasmid Constructs—To generate a bait construct that encoded the entire N terminus of ATP7B, a 1971-bp fragment that encoded amino acids 1–657 was amplified by PCR using pCMB278 (19Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as a template, the forward primer 5′-ccccatatgATGCCTGAGCAGGAGAGACAG-3′ (hWND30) and the reverse primer 5′-gggcagctgCGACGTGTCCTTTCTGAAGAAGGTGAC-3′ (hWND8) (NdeI and SalI restriction sites in lowercase boldface type). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the NdeI/SalI restriction sites of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) vector pAS2-1 (Clontech) to create plasmid pAS2-1/ATP7B-N (pSLB10). A 1.8-kb fragment of ATP7A encoding the N terminus from amino acid 1 to 600 was cloned as a BamHI/PstI fragment from pCMB151 (24Strausak D. Howie M.K. Firth S.D. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Multhaup G. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20821-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) into pAS2-1 to create pAS2-1/ATP7A-N (pSLB34). To create plasmid constructs that encoded mutated or deleted ATP7B N termini as baits, PCR was carried out using the forward primer hWND30, the reverse primer hWND8, and the following plasmids as templates (19Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar): pCMB398, which encoded ATP7B with both cysteines within the CXXC motif of all six of the metal binding domains mutated to serine (i.e. SXXS); pCMB404, which encoded ATP7B with MBS 1–5 deleted leaving only MBS 6; and pCMB405, which encoded ATP7B with MBS 4–6 deleted leaving MBS 1–3 intact. The PCR products were cloned into the NdeI/SalI restriction endonuclease sites of the vector pAS2-1 (Clontech) to create the following plasmids: pAS2-1/MBS1–6c/s (pSLB96); pAS2-1/MBS1–5del (pSLB97); and pAS2-1/MBS4–6del (pSLB98), respectively. The liver cDNA library plasmid isolated in the screen with ATP7B encoded the C-terminal 260 amino acids of p62 fused in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) in the vector pACT2 (Clontech) (pACT2/p62) (pSLB102) and was used in β-galactosidase assays with the various bait plasmids. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The screening procedure employed was a modification of the method described by Gietz and Wood (34Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae YGH1 cells were sequentially transformed with pAS2-1/ATP7B-N and a human liver cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector (Clontech) using the lithium acetate/salmon sperm carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method. Transformants were selected on SD medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine supplemented with 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma). To confirm the interactions, HIS+ transformants were tested for lacZ expression using β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assays (64Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Publication PT3024-1 Clontech, Mountain View, CA2000Google Scholar). True positives were verified by curing the bait plasmid from the positive yeast clones, isolating the library plasmid(s) from Leu+/Trp–/(LacZ+) auxotrophs, and re-transforming library plasmids back into S. cerevisiae YGH1 either with the pAS2-1 vector alone or with pAS2-1/ATP7B-N to confirm the interactions. Transformants were then re-assessed for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids that were confirmed to encode interacting proteins were transformed into E. coli DH10B, and the cDNA inserts were subjected to sequence analysis to determine the nature and identity of the encoded protein. To obtain a quantitative estimate of the extent of the interaction, liquid β-galactosidase assays that employed chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) (Sigma) as the substrate were carried out following the Clontech protocol (64Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Publication PT3024-1 Clontech, Mountain View, CA2000Google Scholar). For each culture within a single experiment, the β-galactosidase activity of triplicate samples was measured. The values obtained represent β-galactosidase activity calculated in Miller units using the average value obtained from at least three independent experiments ± S.D. DNA Sequence Analysis—Sequencing of plasmid DNA was carried out using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems) with reactions analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3730S capillary sequencer apparatus at Micromon DNA Sequencing Facility, Monash University (Melbourne, Australia). Sequence analysis and basic sequence manipulation were performed using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.). Electronic data base searches were conducted using the BLASTN and BLASTP algorithms on the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Immunoblot Analysis of S. cerevisiae YGH1 Transformants—Total protein extracts from S. cerevisiae YGH1 transformants were prepared using the trichloroacetic acid extraction method as described in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (64Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Publication PT3024-1 Clontech, Mountain View, CA2000Google Scholar). Approximately 50 μg of protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (7.5 and 12.5% (v/v) acrylamide). Proteins were transferred to Hybond-C+ nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a Trans-Blot semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) and detected with either sheep-derived, affinity-purified NC36 anti-ATP7B antibody (diluted 1:500 (19Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) or rabbit-derived antibodies directed against the GAL4 DNA-BD (2 μg/ml) (Sigma) or the GAL4 AD (1 μg/ml) (Sigma). Secondary antibodies used for detection were a rabbit anti-goat IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Chemicon), respectively. Protein bands were detected after incubation in Lumi-Light Chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science) and visualized using the Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Raytest Isotopenmessgeraete GmbH). Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Co-immunoprecipitation of interacting proteins from mammalian cells was carried out using the ProFound™ Mammalian Co-immunoprecipitation Kit (Pierce), and experiments were carried out and optimized using the manufacturer's instructions. Specifically, 200 μg of the affinity-purified anti-ATP7B antibody (NC36) (19Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), 200 μg of the sheep-derived, affinity-purified anti-ATP7A antibody (R17-BX) (35Ke B.X. Llanos R.M. Wright M. Deal Y. Mercer J.F. Am. J. Physiol.,. 2006; 290: R1460-R1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and as a control the sheep preimmune serum were covalently immobilized to the amine-reactive antibody coupling gel. Menkes patient fibroblast cells that expressed either ATP7A (A12-H9) or ATP7B (WND-16) (33La Fontaine S.L. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Englezou A. Theophilos M.B. Petris M.J. Howie M. Lockhart P.J.

Cells were lysed, and the lysates were applied to the gel according to the protocol provided. The protein complexes were eluted in the elution buffer provided, boiled in sample buffer with added dithiothreitol (20 mm final concentration), and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% (v/v) and 12.5% (v/v) acrylamide). Proteins were transferred to Hybond-C+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a Trans-Blot semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by immunoblotting with either the NC36 anti-ATP7B antibody (diluted 1:500 (19Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), the R17-BX anti-ATP7A antibody (diluted 1:1000) (35Ke B.X. Llanos R.M. Wright M. Deal Y. Mercer J.F. Am. J. Physiol.,. 2006; 290: R1460-R1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or a goat-derived anti-human dynactin p62 polyclonal antibody N-17 (diluted 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibody used for detection was a rabbit anti-goat IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Protein bands were detected after incubation in Lumi-Light chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science) and visualized using the Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Raytest Isotopen-messgeraete GmbH). Screening of a Human Liver cDNA Library for Binding Partners of the ATP7B N-terminal Domain—To identify proteins that interact with the ATP7B N-terminal domain in vivo, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library was conducted using a bait protein that included the ATP7B N terminus from amino acids 1 to 657. This region includes all six metal binding domains to one amino acid before the first transmembrane domain. The cDNA encoding the entire ATP7B N terminus (ATP7B-N) was cloned into the vector pAS2-1 to create an inframe fusion with the GAL4 DNA-BD (pAS2-1/ATP7B-N). When transformed into S. cerevisiae YGH1 alone, or with the GAL4 AD vector (pACT2), this bait plasmid did not autoactivate expression of the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. The pAS2-1/ATP7B-N plasmid and the liver cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector were sequentially transformed into S. cerevisiae YGH1. Interaction of the bait protein with a library-encoded protein was necessary to bring the GAL4 DNA-BD and -AD into close proximity to activate transcription of the reporter genes. Approximately 3 × 106 transformants were screened for histidine prototrophy. Among the 2,534 colonies isolated as HIS+, 365 were also LacZ+. The bait plasmid was cured from positive transformants, and the library plasmid DNA was isolated from each of these clones, transformed into E. coli, isolated, and then retransformed into S. cerevisiae YGH1 that was pretransformed with either pAS2-1/ATP7B-N or pAS2-1 vector only. Transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity. True positives were those that were positive for β-galactosidase activity when both library and bait plasmids were present but negative for β-galactosidase activity when the library plasmid and pAS2-1 vector were present. Plasmid DNA from the true positive clones was isolated, sequenced, and shown to encode a number of different cDNAs. A library plasmid that encoded the dynactin subunit p62 was chosen for further detailed analysis based on the presence of many cysteine residues within its amino acid sequence and the involvement of dynactin in protein trafficking. This plasmid contained an insert of 3.1 kb, which included 778 bp of a 1380-bp open reading frame plus 2.3 kb of 3′-untranslated sequence. The open reading frame encoded amino acid 200 to the stop codon of dynactin subunit p62 (260 amino acids) (Fig. 1A). Dynactin Subunit p62 Interacts with the N Terminus of ATP7B but Not ATP7A—To confirm the specificity of the ATP7B-N/p62 interaction, S. cerevisiae YGH1 was co-transformed with pACT2/p62 and bait plasmids constructed in pAS2-1 that encoded either ATP7B-N (pAS2-1/ATP7B-N) or ATP7A-N (pAS2-1/ATP7A-N) fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA-BD. The negative control was a transformant that contained pAS2-1/ATP7B-N and the empty library plasmid pACT2. Co-transformants were analyzed for histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity, and the latter was measured qualitatively by the colony-lift filter assay (data not shown) and semi-quantitatively using a liquid culture assay (CPRG assay) (Fig. 1B). These experiments demonstrated a significant and specific interaction between p62 and ATP7B-N (Fig. 1B). The negative control showed that the positive β-galactosidase result with ATP7B-N and p62 did not arise from interaction with vector-derived proteins. There was no interaction between p62 and the copper ATPase ATP7A, which is closely related in structure and function to ATP7B (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C) of the co-transformants confirmed that the appropriate fusion proteins were expressed so that the negative β-galactosidase results cannot be attributed to the lack of protein expression. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to verify the p62/ATP7B interaction in a mammalian cell environment. Using the ProFound™ Mammalian Co-immunoprecipitation Kit (Pierce), cell lysates derived from a human Menkes fibroblast cell line that expressed either ATP7A (A12-H9) or ATP7B (WND-16) (33La Fontaine S.L. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Englezou A. Theophilos M.B. Petris M.J. Howie M. Lockhart P.J. Greenough M. Brooks H. Reddel R.R. Mercer J.F. J. Biol.

SDS-PAGE analysis of the immune complexes eluted from the columns showed that the anti-ATP7B antibody precipitated both ATP7B and endogenous p62 from the lysate, whereas the preimmune serum did not precipitate either protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the anti-ATP7A antibody precipitated ATP7A but not p62 from t"
https://openalex.org/W1993592731,"We have identified PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1), -3, -xalpha, and -xbeta as SOX9-associated polypeptides using the Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system and a cDNA library derived from a chondrocytic cell line. These PIAS proteins were shown to interact directly with SOX9 in two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. SOX9 was sumoylated in cotransfection experiments with COS-7 cells using PIAS and SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier-1) expression vectors. SOX9 was also sumoylated in vitro by PIAS proteins in the presence of SUMO-1, the SUMO-activating enzyme, and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme. In COS-7 cells, PIAS proteins stimulated the SOX9-dependent transcriptional activity of a Col2a1 promoter-enhancer reporter. This increase in reporter activity was paralleled by an increase in the cellular levels of SOX9. Cotransfection with a SUMO-expressing vector further enhanced the transcriptional activity of this SOX9-dependent Col2a1 reporter in COS-7 cells, and this additional activation was inhibited in the presence of either SUMO-1 mutants or PIAS RING domain mutants or by coexpression of a desumoylation enzyme. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SOX9-transfected COS-7 cells showed that the subnuclear distribution of SOX9 became more diffuse in the presence of PIAS1 and SUMO-1. Our results suggest that, by controlling the cellular concentrations of SOX9, PIAS proteins and sumoylation may be part of a major regulatory system of SOX9 functions."

Here we have demonstrated that the Gas1 protein shows high structural similarity to the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptors α, which mediate GDNF responses through the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. We found that Gas1 binds Ret in a ligand-independent manner and sequesters Ret in lipid rafts. Signaling downstream of Ret is thus modified through a mechanism that involves the adaptor protein Shc as well as ERK, eventually blocking Akt activation.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). During development, Gas1 is widely expressed in the nervous system (3Del Sal G. Collavin L. Ruaro M.E. Edomi P. Saccone S. Della Valle G. Schneider C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and is associated with growth inhibition and cell death (4Lee K.K.

In Gas1-/- mice the cerebellum is smaller than in wild type (5Liu Y. May N.R. Fan C.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 30-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating an unexpected role for Gas1 in proliferation. Moreover, Gas1 is induced by Wnt and interacts directly with sonic hedgehog (SHH), antagonizing SHH patterning function (6Lee C.S. Buttitta L. Fan C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11347-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the adult, Gas1 is expressed during physiological apoptosis in some tissues (7Bielke W. Ke G. Feng Z. Buhrer S. Sauer S. Friis R.R. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although not in brain (3Del Sal G. Collavin L. Ruaro M.E. Edomi P. Saccone S. Della Valle G. Schneider C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Aberrant Gas1 expression was nonetheless found in adult neurons during excitotoxicity, and its expression in neuroblastoma cells is associated with proapoptotic effects (8Mellström B. Ceña V. Lamas M. Perales C. González C. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together, this suggests that Gas1 may have different functions within distinct cell contexts and that its mechanism of action depends on its spatiotemporal expression. No mechanisms have yet been proposed by which Gas1 transmits signals that affect decisions about cell proliferation, growth arrest/differentiation, or cell death. The GFRα (GDNF family receptors α) are four GPI-anchored proteins that serve as a link between the neurotrophic factors GFL (GDNF family ligand) and the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase Ret (reviewed in Ref. 9Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). The GFL consist of four proteins, GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin, representing an important class of soluble mediators of neuronal survival, neurite growth, and differentiation. GFL are critical regulators of neurodevelopment and support the survival of midbrain dopaminergic and spinal motor neurons (reviewed in Ref. 10Baloh R.H. Enomoto H. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These effects are mediated through the multicomponent receptor system consisting of GFRα and Ret (11Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo Y. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M.

Nature. 1996; 382: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Activated Ret binds many different adaptor proteins to activate divergent downstream signaling pathways. Recruitment of Ret to lipid rafts seems to be important for the choice of adaptor molecule (13Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Paratcha G. Ledda F. Baars L. Coulpier M. Besset V. Anders J. Scott R. Ibáñez C.F.

Melillo R.M. Fusco A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2954-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To study the Gas1 mechanism of action, we undertook detailed sequence analysis and found a structural relationship between Gas1 and the GFRα. Based on this finding, we analyzed Gas1 involvement in GFRα1-Ret receptor complex formation and downstream effects. Our results suggest that Gas1 is related to the GFRα and may have a regulatory function in Ret signaling. In a ligand-independent manner, Gas1 sequesters Ret to lipid rafts, mediates Shc and ERK recruitment to this membrane domain, and blocks Akt activation without affecting ERK activation. This indicates that the proapoptotic function of Gas1 could be associated to its interaction with Ret and to inhibition of a GDNF-dependent survival pathway. Sequence Analysis—For sequence analysis, we related distant protein families via intermediate searches (16Park J. Teichmann S.A. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using global hidden Markov model profiles (17Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4066) Google Scholar). To improve profile quality, we searched against EST (expressed sequence tag) data bases. Alignment was produced with T-Coffee software (18Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5479) Google Scholar) and was slightly refined manually; it is viewed with the Belvu program (www.cgb.ki.se/cgb/groups/sonnhammer/Belvu.html). Secondary structure was predicted using PhD (19Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The location of predicted signal peptides and transmembrane regions is based on Signal-P and TMHMM2 programs, respectively (20Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5641) Google Scholar, 21Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. 6. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1998: 175-182Google Scholar). Phylogenetic Analysis—To determine the phylogenetic distribution of the domains in homologous proteins, the domains were considered as individual entries. We used standard methods based on progressive alignment (22Feng D.F. Doolittle R.F. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 368-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating Neighbor-Joining trees (23Kumar S. Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar) to establish topologies in 10,000 bootstrap replicates. As the sequences were small and divergent, we used a probabilistic approach using MrBayes (24Ronquist F. Huelsenbeck J.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1572-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (25269) Google Scholar), running for 900,000 generations and four independent Markov chains. We sampled 25,000 trees and generated a consensus. Trees were drawn using the TreeView tool (25Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). For clarity, only the probabilistic unrooted tree is shown (Fig. 2). Molecular Modeling—Fold recognition analyses were performed using the 3D-Jury metaserver (26Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The model was based on the published crystal structure from domain 3 of the GFRα1 receptor protein (27Leppänen V.M. Bespalov M.M. Runeberg-Roos P. Puurand U. Merits A. Saarma M. Goldman A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and obtained using Swiss-Model (28Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar). The model was evaluated using PSQS (www1.jcsg.org/psqs/). Model and template coordinates were superimposed using the DALI server (www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/Interactive.html). Illustrations were generated with MOLMOL. Plasmids—The rat Gas1 expression vector was previously described (8Mellström B. Ceña V. Lamas M. Perales C. González C. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Human GFRα1 was obtained by PCR from a substantia nigra cDNA library (BD Biosciences) with the primers: 5′-TGAACCCCTAAAAGCGGAACC and 5′-GCATATCCCAAAGCCTTCTGAGTT. Isoform GFRα1.1 was subcloned in pcDNA3. The Ret sequence coding for amino acids 1-663 (extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and 5 amino acids of the intracellular domain) was obtained by PCR using the primers 5′-ATGGCGAAGGCGACGT and 5′-AAACTTGTGGTAGCAGTGGA and a human pcDNA3-Ret9 plasmid as the template. The amplified product was subcloned in the pCS2+Myc expression vector to obtain the plasmid pCS-RetMyc. The Gas1-TM expression construct, which codes for rat Gas1 without the putative amino acids susceptible to GPI modification, fused to the transmembrane domain (TM), and a truncated cytosolic tail (CT12) of human LDL receptor (29Benting J.H. Rieveld A.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were generated as follows. The TM and CT12 of human LDL-R were amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GTTGGCGC GCCAGGAAGTAGCGTGAGGGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CGCTCTAGATTATCAGTTGATGCTGTTGATGTTC-3′ with XhoI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy, sequenced, and subsequently ligated with rat Gas1, truncated at the C-terminal residue 357, in pcDNA3. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Treatments—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T and mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a (N2a) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), human neuroectodermic cells SK-N-MC in DMEM/F12 Glutamax, and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y in RPMI; all media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, Glutamax-I, and penicillin/streptomycin. To select for Ret9 stably transfected clones in SK-N-MC, complete medium was supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml of geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). G418-resistant clones were expanded and assayed for Ret expression. For experiments, clone 3 (SK-S3) was selected for moderate Ret expression. Cells were plated at 70% confluence in 60-mm plates. HEK293T and N2a cells were transfected with JetPei reagent (Bridge Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA) for 16 h according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the transfection efficiency was ∼50% for both cell lines. In N2a cells, the GFRα1: Gas1 plasmid ratio was 1:2. Before treatment, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 6 h (HEK293T and SK-S3 cells) or 2-4 h (N2a cells). HEK293T cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of SHH (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or 50 ng/ml of GDNF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 30 min. N2a cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml of GDNF for 15 min, except when otherwise stated. SK-S3 and SH-SY5Y were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of GDNF for 15 min. Chemical Cross-linking—Chemical cross-linking was performed essentially as described (30Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transfected as above and serum deprived for 6 h. The 125I-GDNF ligand (500 nm; Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with cells (30 min) and removed before cross-linking with ethyl-dimethylaminopropyl-carbodiimide supplemented with sulfo-NHS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture Set II), and 1 mm NaO4Va) for 10 min on ice and for an additional 30 min rotating at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation was done using antibodies and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) 4 °C, overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and solubilized in sample buffer. Anti-Gas1 has been described (8Mellström B. Ceña V. Lamas M. Perales C. González C. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Ret, Src, GFRα1, FRS2, ERK-2, thyroglobulin-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, phosphotyrosine (4G10), Shc, and phospho-Shc were from Upstate Biotechnologies; Akt, phospho-Akt, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) were from Cell Signaling. TR was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., Myc, (9E10) was from BD Biosciences, and phospho-ERK was from Sigma. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Dura; Pierce or ECL Advance, GE Healthcare) and quantified using NHI Image software. Fold induction was calculated by ratio of phosphorylated form to total protein, and the ratio in basal condition was set to 1.0. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's posthoc test for the significance of differences. Lentiviral Infection—HEK293 cells were cotransfected with three packaging plasmids and the vector encoding rat antisense Gas1 (pRRLsin.PPT. hCMV.Gas1AS) or GFP (PRRLsin.PPT.hCMV.GFPWpre) as described (31Gómez-Villafuertes R. Torres B. Barrio J. Savignac M. Gabellini N. Rizzato F. Pintado B. Gutierrez-Adán A. Mellström B. Carafoli E. Naranjo J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 47: 10822-10830Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After 36-60 h, viral particles were collected and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Virus concentration was estimated by measuring the amount of p24 protein (PerkinElmer). SH-SY5Y was transduced 12 h after plating using 5 μg of p24/106 cells. Medium was changed 8 h after virus addition, and cells were allowed to express the mRNA of interest for at least 48 h before experiments. Typical infection efficiency was ∼90% as assessed using viral delivery of GFP. Flotation Gradient and Detergent-resistant Membranes—For analysis of detergent-insoluble complexes in flotation gradients, 1.5 × 106 cells were cooled on ice, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 350 μl of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Calbiochem) as described (32Gómez-Mouton C. Abad J.L. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Gallardo E. Jiménez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S.-A. Martinez C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted (20 min, on ice) and the extract subsequently brought to 35% (v/v) Optiprep (Reactiva). The lysate (250 μl) was over-layered sequentially with 3.5 ml of 30% (v/v) Optiprep and 200 μl of TNE with detergent in SW60 tubes. After centrifugation (4 h, 170,000 × g, 4 °C), six 600-μl fractions (1 to 6) were collected from the gradient (top to bottom) and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (all steps performed in a 4 °C cold room, on ice). Normalized protein amounts for each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As controls for the gradients, we used anti-Src (present in the raft-associated fraction one) and anti-transferrin receptor (present in the nonraft-associated fraction six). Detergent-resistant membrane fractions were isolated as described (13Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analysis of Propidium Iodide Incorporation—SH-SY5Y cells were plated and infected after 12 h in culture. At 24 h postinfection, medium was replaced with serum-free medium; at 48 h, cells were treated with GDNF until 72 h postinfection. Cells were collected, prepared for cytometry using the Coulter DNA-Prep Reagents kit (Beckman-Coulter), and analyzed in a Coulter Epics XL-MCL Flow Cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Ten thousand events were counted on the scatter gate. Expo32 was used as statistical analysis software. Experiments were repeated two times in quadruplicates and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni test for the significance of differences. GAS1 Is Related to the GDNF Family Receptors α—Multiple alignment of the GAS1 protein primary sequence from several species identified two cysteine-rich repeats, residues 48-147 and 166-243 in the human sequence, in which the relative positions of the cysteines were highly conserved (Fig. 1). Searches with the global profile HMMer (hidden Markov model) of the cysteine-rich repeat region of GAS1 proteins found GFRα with an E-value of 0.049 (sptrembl_id:Q6UXV0, residues 131-210). Reciprocally, the profile of the GFRα repeat domain detected Gas1 proteins with an E-value of 0.55 (swissprot_id:GAS1_HUMAN, residues 166-243). None of these profile HMMer searches retrieved any other related sequences. The human sequence sptrembl_id:Q6UXV0, GRAL (33Li Z. Wang B. Wu X. Cheng S.Y. Paraoan L. Zhou J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was automatically identified as a new GFRα member by Pfam (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). In addition, secondary structure prediction for the Gas1 protein (Fig. 1) showed good agreement with the crystal structure of GFRα1 domain 3 (27Leppänen V.M. Bespalov M.M. Runeberg-Roos P. Puurand U. Merits A. Saarma M. Goldman A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We used sequence alignment of the repeated domain common to the GFRα and the GAS1 proteins for phylogenetic analysis. Taking into account both the short length and the high divergence of the alignment, low clade confidence values at deep branches of the tree are predicted. Nonetheless, the topology was consistent and sufficient to establish a relation among the GFRα domains (Fig. 2A). In addition to the sequence similarity, we found an overall resemblance in the domain architecture of GFRα and GAS1 proteins (Fig. 2B). We confirmed a signal peptide located at the N terminus of both GAS1 and GFRα1 and a GPI anchor at the C terminus of GFRα (11Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo Y. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z.

Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C. Armanini M.P. Pollock R.A. Hefti F. Phillips H.S. Goddard A. Moore M.W. Buj-Bello A. Davies A.M. Asai N. Takahashi M. Vandlen R. Henderson C.E. Rosenthal A. Nature. 1996; 382: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) and GAS1 proteins (2Stebel M. Vatta P. Ruaro M.E. Sal G. Del Parton R.G. Schneider C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mammalian GRAL has a C-terminal transmembrane domain. To determine whether fold recognition analysis generated consistent results, we submitted the two GAS1 cysteine-rich domains (swissprot_id: GAS1_HUMAN, residues 48-147 and 166-243) as a query to a fold-assignment metaserver. The structure of the GFRα1 protein cysteine-rich domain 3 (Protein Data Bank code 1Q8D) was detected as the optimal template. The disulfide bridges are conserved, and the overall fold is maintained (Fig. 3). Scores were low, as predicted, because of the short length of the domain and the low level of sequence similarity among the proteins. The high degree of sequence divergence can be explained by the fact that the overall fold of the template is sustained by disulfide bridges. This type of protein domain keeps the overall fold as a consequence of spatial restrictions imposed by its conserved disulfide bridges (34Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Considering the E-values of the profile HMMer searches, the common domain architecture, the reliability of the secondary structure prediction, and the fold assignment results, we conclude that the cysteine-rich repeat domains in the Gas1 protein are similar to the GFRα family repeats. Together, the data suggest that Gas1 is related to the GFRα. Gas1 Interacts with Ret in a Ligand-independent Manner—Because the Gas1 repeats showed a fold similar to that of GFRα1, we hypothesized that Gas1 interacts with Ret, the GFRα1 binding partner. To study this possibility, we analyzed Gas1 binding to Ret in HEK293T cells, which are not growth arrested by Gas1 and do not express endogenous Gas1 or Ret proteins. We generated a RetMyc construct in which the C-terminal intracellular domain was replaced by six Myc epitopes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments following Gas1 and RetMyc expression in HEK293T cells showed that RetMyc was precipitated by a Gas1 antibody and Gas1 was precipitated by an anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 4A). To assure that the Gas1-RetMyc interaction was not an artifact due to overexpression of a GPI-anchored protein, we generated a Gas1 construct, Gas1-TM, without the GPI anchor. This construct maintains the signal peptide and the two cysteine-rich domains, but the C-terminal amino acids, including the putative GPI modification sequence, were replaced by the transmembrane domain and 12 cytosolic amino acids of the human LDL receptor (29Benting J.H. Rieveld A.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B, upper panel). The Gas1-TM construct was expressed correctly and was recognized by the Gas1 antibody (not shown). HEK293T cells were transfected with RetMyc and Gas1-TM and analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The c-Myc antibody precipitated Gas1-TM efficiently (Fig. 4B, lower panel), confirming that GPI modification is not decisive for interaction with Ret. Immunoprecipitations were done after cell culture in the presence of serum; we thus cannot rule out the possibility that the interaction is influenced by neurotrophic factors in the serum. To determine whether the interaction is ligand dependent, as is the case for Ret binding to GFRα1, coimmunoprecipitations were repeated after serum deprivation, with or without known ligands. GFRα1 coimmunoprecipitated with RetMyc only after addition of its preferred ligand, GDNF (Fig. 4C), as described (13Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Conversely, Gas1 coimmunoprecipitated with RetMyc both alone and in the presence of its reported ligand, SHH (6Lee C.S. Buttitta L. Fan C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11347-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and with or without GDNF (Fig. 4C and not shown), indicating that Gas1 interacts with RetMyc in a ligand-independent manner. Gas1 is widely expressed in the nervous system during mouse embryonic development (4Lee K.K. Leung A.K. Tang M.K. Cai D.Q. Schneider C. Brancolini C. Chow P.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) at times when Ret expression has also been reported, e.g. in brain at embryonic day 14 (E14) (35Pachnis V. Mankoo B. Costantini F. Development. 1993; 119: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the Gas1-Ret interaction can occur in vivo, we used brain extract from E14 mice for immunoprecipitation with an anti-Ret antibody. Immunoprecipitated Gas1 was detected by Western blot (Fig. 4D, upper panel). To confirm this interaction, Gas1 was immunoprecipitated from E14 mouse brain extract and Ret was detected by Western blot (Fig. 4D, lower panel). These data indicate that Gas1 could interact with Ret in developing mouse brain. Gas1 Does Not Bind to GDNF—As the Gas1-Ret interaction is ligand independent, we tested whether Gas1 interferes with the phosphorylation-competent complex formed by GDNF, GFRα1, and Ret in cross-linking experiments with radiolabeled GDNF in transfected HEK293T cells. GFRα1 bound 125I-GDNF, forming a complex of ∼85 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 3) as described (11Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo Y. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 12Treanor J.J.S. Goodman L. de Sauvage F. Stone D.M. Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C.

Nature. 1996; 382: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), whereas Gas1 did not bind to 125I-GDNF (lane 2). In cells transfected with RetMyc alone or together with Gas1, we observed no binding to 125I-GDNF (lanes 4, 5). Cotransfection of GFRα1 and RetMyc resulted in the formation of two complexes, at ∼85 and 200 kDa, corresponding to the 125I-GDNF-GFRα1 and 125I-GDNF-GFRα1-RetMyc complexes, respectively (lane 6). Cotransfection of Gas1 with GFRα1 and RetMyc showed the same banding pattern as for GFRα1 and RetMyc alone, with no change in the level of the complex at 200 kDa (lane 7). The results indicate that neither Gas1 alone nor the Gas1-RetMyc complex is able to bind 125I-GDNF and that Gas1 does not interfere with GDNF-GFRα1 binding to Ret. Gas1 Modifies Ret Downstream Signaling—Because Gas1 did not affect GFRα1-Ret receptor complex formation, we analyzed whether Gas1 influenced Ret autophosphorylation and activation. We used the N2a neuroblastoma cell line, which expresses Ret and very low GFRα1 levels (11Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo Y. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Gas1 expression in serum-deprived N2a cells did not result in Ret tyrosine phosphorylation, although Gas1 coimmunoprecipitated with Ret (Fig. 6A); cells transfected with GFRα1 and stimulated with GDNF showed robust Ret phosphorylation (Fig. 6A) as described (11Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo Y. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gas1 is involved in the regulation of Ret downstream signaling, we transfected N2a cells with GFRα1 with or without Gas1. We analyzed the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, two major effectors downstream of Ret, after serum deprivation and GDNF stimulation. To permit comparison after GDNF stimulation, we verified similar GFRα1 expression in all samples in each experiment. Coexpression with Gas1 did not modify GFRα1-GDNF-induced Ret autophosphorylation (Fig. 6B). The presence of Gas1 severely decreased GDNF-induced Akt phosphorylation from 2.9- to 1.4-fold compared with control cells (p <0.01, n = 4) (Fig. 6B), whereas ERK phosphorylation increased from 2.0- to 4.5-fold (p <0.01, n = 4). Time course analysis of Ret, Akt, and ERK phosphorylation showed that in the presence of Gas1, Akt phosphorylation was impaired at all times analyzed up to 2 h, whereas ERK phosphorylation took place earlier and lasted longer (not shown). We analyzed the influence of endogenously expressed Gas1 on Ret signaling using the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line, which expresses Ret and GFRα1 and responds to GDNF (36Fukuda T. Kiuchi K.

The PABC domain of PABP recruits various regulatory proteins and translation factors to poly(A) mRNAs through binding of a conserved 12-amino acid peptide motif, PAM2 (PABP-interacting motif 2). In contrast, little is known about the specificity or function of the domain from HYD.

The highly conserved ubiquitin/proteasome pathway controls the degradation of many critical regulatory proteins. Targeted proteins are post-translationally conjugated to a 76-residue ubiquitin moiety through a combined set of reactions involving activating (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), conjugating (ubiquitin carrier protein), and ligating (E3) enzymes. E3 enzymes physically interact with their substrates and are thus critical determinants of the specificity of ubiquitination. Two main groups of E3 ligases are the ring finger and HECT domain ligases (1Kwon Y.T. Reiss Y. Fried V.A. Hershko A. Yoon J.K. Gonda D.K. Sangan P. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Varshavsky A. Proc.

Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been inferred that HYD participates in signal transduction downstream of the signaling receptors to initiate and/or maintain proliferation as well as to terminate proliferation (3Mansfield E. Hersperger E. Biggs J. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that cells with mutations in HYD fail to properly terminate proliferation, leading to tumors. Furthermore, these mutations also result in developmental abnormalities such as adult sterility due to germ cell defects (4Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L.

Conversely, HYD may modulate the ubiquitination of ERK2, as this kinase has been shown to be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (12Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the precise relationship between HYD and ERK2 remains unknown (12Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Despite the accumulating knowledge about HYD, its exact biochemical roles have yet to be determined. Structurally, HYD ligases contain a ubiquitin-associated domain at their N termini, two nuclear localization signals, a zinc finger-like UBR domain involved in recognition of type 1 N-terminal degrons (13Tasaki T. Mulder L.C. Iwamatsu A. Lee M.J. Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. Muesing M. Kwon Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7120-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), a domain highly homologous to the PABC (poly(A)-binding protein C-terminal) domain, and a HECT domain at their extreme C termini (see Fig. 1). The solution and crystal structures of the ∼70-residue long PABC domains from human HYD and various poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) have shown that these domains all consist of a bundle of four or five α-helices (14Kozlov G.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Previous NMR studies showed that the PABC domain is a peptide-binding domain that specifically recognizes a conserved PAM2 (PABP-interacting motif 2) sequence (14Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This PAM2 site was initially identified in the PABP-interacting proteins Paip1 and Paip2 and in eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3). These proteins modulate translational activity by either stabilizing (Paip1 and eRF3) or destabilizing (Paip2) the closed loop structure of mRNA, the formation of which involves the simultaneous interactions of PABP with the poly(A) tail of mRNA and the 5′-cap binding complex (18Roy G.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50286-50292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The structures of the PABC domain from human PABP in complex with peptides from Paip1 and Paip2 revealed that PAM2 binds to the most conserved α2-, α3-, and α5-helices of the PABC domain as a series of two β-turns (21Kozlov G. De Crescenzo G. Lim N.S. Siddiqui N. Fantus D. Kahvejian A. Trempe J.F. Elias D. Ekiel I. Sonenberg N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Gehring K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, a bioinformatics survey highlighted the existence of multiple proteins containing PAM2 sites, including ataxin-2, Tob1 (transducer of Erb1), Tob2, USP10, dNF-x1, TPRD/TTC3, and dMAP205 (22Albrecht M. Lengauer T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The PABC domain of human HYD was shown previously to bind to truncated Paip1 containing PAM2 by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays. This finding suggests that HYD may be able to interact with other PABP-interacting proteins through a similar mechanism (15Deo R.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In common with yeast PABP, which has unusual peptide specificity, the PABC domain of HYD is composed of only four α-helices (16Kozlov G. Siddiqui N. Coillet-Matillon S. Trempe J.F. Ekiel I. Sprules T. Gehring K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22822-22828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The position of the PABC domain directly adjacent to the catalytic HECT domain suggests HYD involvement in substrate recognition. A better understanding of the PAM2 binding properties of HYD should help elucidate its function through identification of novel physiological partners and provide useful insight into the potential competition between HYD and PABP for shared binding partners. This is especially important in the light of recent results demonstrating a role for HYD in the proteasome-mediated turnover of Paip2 (23Yoshida M. Yoshida K. Kozlov G. Lim N.S. De Crescenzo G. Zhiyu P. Kahvejian A. Gehring K. Wing S.S. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of the peptide binding properties of the PABC domain of HYD and identify the anti-proliferative Tob proteins as potential in vivo partners of HYD. PABC Domain Expression, Purification, and Peptide Synthesis—The PABC domain of rat HYD was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and the construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3) expression host (Stratagene). The protein was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography to yield the 60 residues of the PABC domain plus a five-residue (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser) N-terminal extension. The amino acid composition was confirmed by mass spectrometry. For NMR analysis, the protein was exchanged into NMR buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm NaN3, pH 6.8). The final yield of purified protein was ∼7 mg/liter of LB culture medium. PAM2 peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a Vydac C18 column. The composition and purity of the peptides were verified by ion spray quadrupole mass spectroscopy. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR resonance assignments of the PABC domain of the HYD protein were determined by HNCACB and CBCA-(CO)NH experiments (24Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) performed on a Bruker Avance 600 NMR spectrometer using a 13C,15N-labeled protein sample. Additional 1H-15N edited nuclear Overhauser effect and total correlation spectra were used to assign the resonances in the PABC domain-peptide complex. All NMR experiments were recorded at 293 K. Peptide NMR titrations were carried by adding peptides to 1.0-1.5 mm samples of the 15N-labeled PABC domain from the HYD protein and monitored by 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—Experiments were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC titration calorimeter using VPViewer software for instrument control and data acquisition. The buffer used for ITC experiments contained 50 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.8. During a titration experiment, samples of the PABC domain from the HYD protein were thermostatted at 288 K in a stirred (310 rpm) reaction cell of 1.4 ml. Fifty-nine injections (5-μl volume and 10-s duration each, with 5-min intervals between injections) were carried out using a 296-μl syringe filled with the peptide solution. Titration experiments were performed with 30-60 μm PABC domain solution in the cell and 250-550 μm peptide solution in the syringe to ensure a final peptide/PABC domain molar ratio of at least 2:1 in the reaction cell. The binding constants and thermodynamic parameters were determined as described previously (21Kozlov G. De Crescenzo G. Lim N.S. Siddiqui N. Fantus D. Kahvejian A. Trempe J.F. Elias D. Ekiel I. Sonenberg N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Gehring K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance-based Biosensor Analysis—The interaction of the PABC domain from PABP with the synthetic PAM2 peptides was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (25Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. et al.BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) using both Biacore 1000 and Biacore 3000 optical biosensors (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The C2 fragment of PABP (residues 498-636) was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip using amine coupling chemistry as described previously (25Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. et al.BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). For each peptide interaction, the biosensor experiment was repeated three times over different PABC domain surfaces (between 2000 and 4000 resonance units coupled) using the two biosensors. A separate control flow cell was activated and blocked to correct for refractive index changes. The experiments were performed at 25 °C using a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For each peptide, at least five different concentrations were injected over the PABC domain and control flow cells. The ranges of concentrations used were 6.25-100 μm for USP10, dNF-x1, TPRD/TTC3, and dMAP205; 412 nm to 100 μm for ataxin-2; 620 nm to 500 μm for Tob2-(131-147); and 3.7-300 μm for Tob2-(251-267). All peptide dilutions were performed in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20). After each injection, regeneration was performed using two pulses of HCl (120 mm, 15 ml), followed by an EXTRACLEAN and a RINSE procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by Scatchard plot analysis, Req/C = f(Req), using the control-corrected plateau values (Req) corresponding to the injection of the peptide at concentration C. The Kd was derived as the reciprocal of the slope of the linear regression of the plot. GST Pulldown Assay—GST pulldown assays were performed using the MagneGST pulldown system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences) and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in cell lysis reagent containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and DNase (Promega Corp.). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The expressed GST fusion protein in the clear lysate was immobilized on MagneGST particles and then incubated with 5 μl of the in vitro translated protein in 250 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). After incubation with rotation for 1 h at 4°C, the MagneGST particles were washed four times with 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The bound fraction was eluted in 1× SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to show equal loading of the GST fusion protein and then dried for autoradiography to detect the pull-down protein. For in vitro translation, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were produced in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate using an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system (Promega Corp.) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The in vitro translated products were treated with DNase I (0.5 units/μl) and RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 30 °C. Immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were split to a density of 4.5 × 106/100-mm dish 24 h before transfection. For transient transfection, cells were transfected with pcDNA6-V5 or pcDNA6-Tob2-V5 DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 100 nm okadaic acid, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cell suspensions were subjected to freezing/thawing for three cycles, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-V5 antibody-agarose (Sigma) in the presence of RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. Following precipitation, the resin was washed five times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), goat anti-HYD polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). The PAM2-binding Surface of the PABC Domain from HYD Is Similar to That from PABP—To study the PAM2 binding properties of the PABP-homologous domain of HYD, the corresponding fragment of the rat HYD protein (residues 515-574) was cloned and expressed in medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl. This fragment corresponds to residues 2393-2452 of human HYD, with only two amino acids differing in their corresponding sequences (E2443D and V2450I) (Fig. 1B). To be consistent within the family of HYD ligases, the residue numbering for human HYD is used in this study, as the sequence of the full-length 300-kDa rat HYD protein (26Oughtred R. Bedard N. Adegoke O.A. Morales C.R. Trasler J. Rajapurohitam V. Wing S.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3740-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) is currently not available in protein data bases. The 1H-15N correlation spectrum of the unliganded domain showed a good dispersion of signals characteristic of a folded protein (Fig. 2). Standard heteronuclear experiments were performed using triple-labeled protein for the sequence-specific assignments of the signals. As a result, all detectable signals were assigned; the amides of His2393, Arg2404, and Ser2414 were missing from the spectrum. The PABC domain of HYD was shown previously to bind to Paip1 (residues 113-480) by GST affinity assays (15Deo R.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To better characterize this interaction, the 15N-labeled HYD fragment was titrated with a shorter fragment of Paip1 (residues 123-144) containing PAM2. Addition of this peptide caused the appearance in slow exchange of new signals for HYD residues involved in peptide binding (Fig. 3A). The residues displaying the largest chemical shift changes upon Paip1 binding were Ala2396 (0.49), Tyr2402 (0.38), Ala2445 (0.38), and Met2419 (0.35), identifying the peptide-binding site (Fig. 3B). Mapping of chemical shift changes on the available crystal structure of the human HYD fragment (Fig. 3C) clearly indicated that the peptide-binding surface of the PABC domain from HYD is analogous to that from its PABP ortholog (14Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The PAM2 peptides bound to the PABC domain of PABP along the large surface involving the same helices that were affected in the PABC domain of HYD (Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained with the PAM2 peptides from ataxin-2 (residues 912-928) and dMAP205 (residues 234-250) (supplemental Fig. 1), confirming the existence of a single and well defined PAM2-binding site on the HYD PABC domain. Ionic Interactions Have Greater Importance for HYD-PAM2 Binding—To further characterize the binding, we applied ITC to determine the binding constants and thermodynamic parameters of interactions between the PABC domain of HYD and a series of PAM2 peptides (Fig. 4). The binding of PAM2 peptides to the PABC domain of HYD led to favorable enthalpy effects, which gave rise to heat release. This primarily reflects the contributions of van der Waals, hydrogen bond, and electrostatic interactions to the binding. Alternatively, changes in entropy mainly reflect counteracting contributions from solvation entropy (water release upon complex formation) and conformational entropy. Negative entropy values were measured for the Paip1, eRF3, ataxin-2 and dMAP205 peptides (Fig. 4C), indicating that the heat release was accompanied by a loss of disorder due mostly to the immobilization of the peptide backbone. In contrast, we observed an entropy increase in the binding of the Tob2-(251-267), dNF-x1, USP10, and TPRD/TTC3 peptides to the PABC domain of HYD. Here, desolvation effects more likely dominated the conformational restrictions resulting from complex formation. The change in heat capacity upon binding (ΔCp) is determined by changes in the degree of surface hydration in the unliganded versus complexed molecules and can be used to estimate the ratio of polar to non-polar surface buried upon complex formation. The negative ΔCp values for the Paip1 and eRF3 peptides (Fig. 4C) point to an increase in hydrophobic interactions upon binding. Interestingly, ΔCp for eRF3 (-81 cal mol-1 K-1) was significantly higher for HYD binding than for PABP binding (-294 cal mol-1 K-1) (21Kozlov G. De Crescenzo G. Lim N.S. Siddiqui N. Fantus D. Kahvejian A. Trempe J.F. Elias D. Ekiel I. Sonenberg N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Gehring K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This noticeable difference in ΔCp highlights the contribution of ionic interactions in the eRF3-HYD complex. Taken together, the entropy and heat capacity changes hint at small but distinct differences in peptide binding by HYD and PABP that modulate their binding affinity for different PAM2 sequences. Specificity of PAM2 Recognition by HYD and PABP—To address these differences in specificity, the binding constants for the PABC domains of HYD and PABP were measured for 10 PAM2 peptides derived from confirmed and potential binding partners (Table 1). We previously measured the binding constants of the interactions between the Paip1, Paip2, and eRF3 peptides and the PABC domain of PABP using the surface plasmon resonance-based Biacore sensor (21Kozlov G. De Crescenzo G. Lim N.S. Siddiqui N. Fantus D. Kahvejian A. Trempe J.F. Elias D. Ekiel I. Sonenberg N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Gehring K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here, we complemented these data with affinity measurements for other PAM2 peptides by ITC and surface plasmon resonance. The Kd values measured by surface plasmon resonance (Table 1, in parentheses) and ITC are in a very good agreement, underlining the reliability of both techniques for affinity measurements.TABLE 1Comparison of HYD and PABP binding affinities for PAM2 peptidesKdKd(HYD)/Kd(PABP)HYDPABPμmPaip1aPeptide sequences are given in Fig. 43.41.4bFrom Ref. 21 (2.3)cValues in parentheses were obtained using a Biacore sensor2.4eRF35.21.0bFrom Ref. 21 (1.3)5.2Paip26.0dFrom Ref. 230.12bFrom Ref. 21 (0.16)50Ataxin-29.90.76 (0.68)13Tob2-(131–147)No binding28 (84)>30eAssuming Kd = 1 mm as a lower detection limit of binding in the ITC experimentsTob2-(251–267)1216 (20)0.8dNF-x112031 (7.6)3.9dMAP205112.1 (3.0)5.2USP103326 (3.9)1.3TPRD/TTC3375.4 (6.9)6.9a Peptide sequences are given in Fig. 4b From Ref. 21Kozlov G.

De Crescenzo G. Lim N.S. Siddiqui N. Fantus D. Kahvejian A. Trempe J.F. Elias D. Ekiel I. Sonenberg N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Gehring K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggests that all of the proteins are potential physiological partners of HYD and PABP. Indeed, ataxin-2 and Tob2 were shown recently to bind PABP in vivo (27Ralser M. Albrecht M. Nonhoff U. Lengauer T. Lehrach H. Krobitsch S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Okochi K. Suzuki T. Inoue J. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and HYD was shown to interact with Paip2 (23Yoshida M. Yoshida K. Kozlov G. Lim N.S. De Crescenzo G. Zhiyu P. Kahvejian A. Gehring K. Wing S.S. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). The affinity of PAM2 peptides for HYD is generally weaker than for PABP, with notable exceptions for Tob2-(251-267) and USP10, which bind both domains with equal affinity. The largest differences (>10-fold higher affinity for PABP) were observed for the Paip2, ataxin-2, and Tob2-(131-147) peptides. The Tob2-(131-147) sequence was the only one that did not bind HYD. Although differences exist, the data demonstrate a great deal of overlap in PAM2 binding by HYD and PABP and potential cross-talk in their in vivo interactions. Interaction between Tob2 and the PABC Domain of HYD—The anti-proliferative protein Tob2 contains two distinct PAM2 sequences, one at its N terminus (residues 131-147) and the other in its central region (residues 251-267), but only the second sequence binds to HYD. We applied pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays to complement our in vitro binding assays with Tob2. The GST pulldown experiment showed that the PABC domains of both HYD and PABP bound to full-length Tob2 (Fig. 5A). The binding of Tob2 to HYD was somewhat weaker than to PABP, which might reflect the inability of the N-terminal PAM2 site to interact with HYD. The reverse immunoprecipitation experiment showed that V5-tagged Tob2 specifically coprecipitated a small amount of HYD, but not the control abundant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein (Fig. 5B). No band was detected when the cells were transfected with vector alone. NMR titrations confirmed that the Tob2-(251-267) peptide bound to the same surface on the PABC domain of HYD as the other studied PAM2 sequences (Fig. 5C). These experiments demonstrate a specific, albeit weak, interaction between HYD and Tob2 in crude cell extracts. We have presented the first comprehensive study of the PAM2 binding properties of the PABC domain from HYD, an E3 ligase. We have demonstrated that HYD and PABP employ the same surface features to interact with PAM2-containing peptides, bind the peptides in the same way, and have a large degree of overlap in their binding specificity. Careful affinity measurements hint at subtle but distinct differences in peptide specificity for HYD compared with PABP. Two factors are likely to contribute to these differences. The first is the PABC domain primary sequence, which may affect/modify peptide-protein intermolecular contacts, thus altering the weight of charged versus hydrophobic interactions. The second is the absence of the first N-terminal helix in the HYD PABC domain. In PABPs, this helix does not directly contact the bound peptide, but may indirectly affect binding through its effect on the α2-helix. The solution structures of peptides from Paip1 and Paip2 bound to the PABP PABC domain show the greatest differences in the peptide C termini, which bind to the α2-helix (21Kozlov G. De Crescenzo G. Lim N.S. Siddiqui N. Fantus D. Kahvejian A. Trempe J.F. Elias D. Ekiel I. Sonenberg N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Gehring K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The interactions of Paip1, Paip2, and eRF3 with PABP have been well characterized (18Roy G. De Crescenzo G. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. O'Connor-McCourt M. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

These proteins bind to the PABC domain of PABP through PAM2 sequences located at either the N or C termini in unfolded regions of the proteins. Paip1 and Paip2 also bind to a second site in the RNA-binding portion of PABP via a less well characterized motif termed PAM1. One important conclusion of these studies is that PAM2-containing proteins are recruited to the mRNA through binding to PABP and that they compete for binding to PABP. Sequence analysis identified a number of proteins containing PAM2 as potential PABP-binding proteins. Recent in vivo studies have confirmed two of these predictions: ataxin-2 and Tob2 (27Ralser M. Albrecht M. Nonhoff U. Lengauer T. Lehrach H. Krobitsch S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Okochi K. Suzuki T. Inoue J. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T.

The BTG/Tob proteins are a large family of anti-proliferative proteins involved in various functions, including cell cycle control (29Raburn D.J. Hamil K.G. Tsuruta J.K. O'Brien D.A. Hall S.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5769-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and differentiation (30Rodier A. Marchal-Victorion S. Rochard P. Casas F. Cassar-Malek I. Rouault J.P. Magaud J.P.

Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and potentially mRNA metabolism. The family is defined by a highly conserved 110-amino acid N-terminal region designated the BTG/Tob homology domain. Of the BTG/Tob family of proteins, only the Tob proteins contain PAM2 sites. Tob2 contains two distinctive PAM2 sites, whereas Tob1 contains a single PAM2 site, which corresponds to Tob2-(251-267). The Tob2-(131-147) sequence was shown to be important for PABP interactions (28Okochi K. Suzuki T. Inoue J. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas we have shown that HYD specifically binds Tob2-(251-267). In theory, PABP and HYD could be brought together by simultaneously binding Tob2; however, the biological significance of this is untested. Another intriguing observation is that both HYD and Tob2 are targets for the MAPK ERK2 (10Eblen S.T. Kumar N.V. Shah K. Henderson M.J. Watts C.K. Shokat K.M. Weber M.J. J. Biol.

The ERK pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that regulates many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, transcription, and migration (11Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Tob proteins have already been implicated in the negative regulation of the cell cycle via their C-terminal regions; Tob inhibits cell growth by suppressing cyclin D1 expression, whereas ERK1- and ERK2-mediated Tob phosphorylation negatively regulates Tob anti-proliferation (31Maekawa M. Nishida E. Tanoue T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37783-37787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Sasajima H. Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1356-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). HYD and Tob2 could be part of a related signaling pathway that is involved in the control of cell cycle progression. The BTG/Tob proteins are known to be multiubiquitinated and degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (32Sasajima H. Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3596-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our finding that HYD interacts with Tob2 proteins in cell extracts suggests a mechanism that is analogous to the regulation of Paip2 levels by competition between PABP and HYD. When PABP levels are depressed, Paip2, which is bound to the higher affinity site of PABP, is released and ubiquitinated by HYD, leading to degradation by the proteasome (23Yoshida M. Yoshida K. Kozlov G. Lim N.S. De Crescenzo G. Zhiyu P. Kahvejian A. Gehring K. Wing S.S. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). It is plausible that HYD similarly competes with PABP for the PAM2 site on Tob2. More generally, our study suggests that many PAM2-containing proteins may be targets for ubiquitination by HYD through binding to its PABC domain. The intriguing occurrence of the PABC domain in just two proteins, PABPs and HYD E3 ligases, is not coincidental. Recent studies have uncovered several connections between these proteins through shared binding partners (Fig. 6), and more links will undoubtedly surface in the near future. It appears that PABP and HYD are part of a shared network that brings together the fundamental processes of translation, ubiquitination, and cell cycle control.

Specifically, C-terminal, transmembrane residues 45–52 of PLB were individually mutated to Cys, then cross-linked to V89C in the M2 helix of SERCA2a with the thiol-specific cross-linking reagents Cu2+-phenanthroline, dibromobimane, and bismaleimidohexane. V49C-, M50C-, and L52C-PLB all cross-linked strongly to V89C-SERCA2a, coupling to 70–100% of SERCA2a molecules. Residues 45–48 and 51 of PLB also cross-linked to V89C of SERCA2a, but more weakly. Evidence for the mechanism of PLB regulation of SERCA2a was provided by the conformational dependence of cross-linking. In particular, the required absence of Ca2+ for cross-linking implicated the E2 conformation of SERCA2a, and its enhancement by ATP confirmed E2·ATP as the conformation with the highest affinity for PLB. In contrast, E2 phosphorylated with inorganic phosphate (E2P) and E2 inhibited by thapsigargin (E2·TG) both failed to cross-link to PLB. These results with transmembrane PLB residues are completely consistent with cytoplasmic PLB residues studied previously, suggesting that the dissociation of PLB from the Ca2+ pump is complete, not partial, when the pump binds Ca2+ (E1·Ca2) or adopts the E2P or E2·TG conformations. V49C of PLB cross-linked to 100% of SERCA2a molecules, suggesting that this residue might have functional importance for regulation. Indeed, we found that mutation of Val49 to smaller side-chained residues V49A or V49G augmented PLB inhibition, whereas mutation to the larger hydrophobic residue, V49L, prevented PLB inhibition. A model for the interaction of PLB with SERCA2a is presented, showing that Val49 fits into a constriction at the lumenal end of the M2 helix of SERCA, possibly controlling access of PLB to its binding site on SERCA.

This regulation involves physical binding of PLB to the SERCA2a isoform of Ca2+-ATPase (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol.

In particular, dephosphorylated PLB decreases the apparent affinity of the Ca2+ pump for Ca2+ by slowing the E2to E1 transition of the catalytic cycle that couples ATP hydrolysis to Ca2+ transport (8Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, this inhibitory effect of PLB on SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity is reversed, resulting in increased Ca2+ transport into the SR and in stronger heart contraction and relaxation, thus producing the so-called positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of β-adrenergic stimulation (1Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 2Haghighi K. Gregory K.N. Kranias E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PLB contains two major domains, a regulatory, cytoplasmic domain I (residues 1–31), and an anchoring, transmembrane domain II (residues 32–52). At the cytoplasmic domain, several residues are important for PLB inhibitory function (9Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

For example, Ser16 and Thr17 located in domain IA (residues 1–20) represent the phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+/CaM protein kinase, respectively. Phosphorylation at either site reverses PLB inhibition (1Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Moreover, Asn27, Asn30, and Leu31 in domain IB (residues 21–31) are directly involved in the physical interaction with SERCA2a (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Domain II of PLB, the transmembrane domain, contains a heptad repeat of Leu/Ile residues on one face of the helix that participate in a coiled-coil interaction to form a PLB homopentamer (12Simmerman H.K. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Changes to these residues produce monomeric PLB, which is believed to be the active form that binds to SERCA2a and inhibits its Ca2+ transport cycle (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues along the transmembrane helix of PLB can also enhance or attenuate PLB inhibitory function depending on location, and several amino acids distributed throughout the entire length of the helix appear to be directly involved in binding to SERCA2a (6Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10530-10539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By use of chemical cross-linking reagents, we recently identified several sites of interaction between key residues in domain IB of PLB and residues at the cytoplasmic extension of M4 of SERCA2a (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10530-10539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Specifically, two gain-of-function mutants, N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB, cross-linked strongly to Lys328 of the M4 helix of SERCA2a with use of the heterobifunctional Cys to Lys cross-linking agents N-(ϵ-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester (EMCS) and KMUS, respectively (5Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the homobifunctional sulfhydryl cross-linking agent, BMH, coupled both the gain of function mutant N30C-PLB and the loss of function mutant L31C-PLB to Cys318 (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and T317C (6Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10530-10539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) of the SERCA2a M4 helix, respectively, thus identifying domain IB of PLB as an important site of physical and functional interaction with residues in M4 of SERCA2a. Cross-linking between PLB and SERCA2a at all these interaction sites was inhibited by micromolar Ca2+ or by TG, but stimulated by the nucleotides ATP or ADP in the absence of Ca2+ (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10530-10539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we proposed that domain IB residues of PLB interact with SERCA2a only in Ca2+-free, E2 conformation, preferably with bound nucleotide. Interestingly, the TG used to stabilize this E2 conformation for structural studies (15Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) prevented PLB interaction, suggesting that TG induces a unique, non-physiological conformation. Another recent study also showed cross-linking of N27C and N30C of PLB to L321C of the skeletal muscle Ca2+ pump (SERCA1a) using Cu2+-phenanthroline (7Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), consistent with this cytoplasmic interaction region. Val49 is in the transmembrane helix at the C-terminal end of PLB and appears to be an important residue for PLB function. An earlier study suggested that Ala replacement at Val49 results in nearly complete loss of the PLB inhibitory function (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this proposed loss-of-function PLB mutant (V49A-PLB) was used as a dominant-negative probe to reverse WT-PLB inhibition of SERCA2a in failed cardiac cells, and to restore normal cardiomyocyte function in a mouse model of heart failure (16Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J. Kranias E.G. Giles W.R. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In contrast, when a similar mutant, V49G-PLB, was made, gain of PLB function, not loss of function was reported (17Haghighi K. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Brittsan A.G. Yatani A. Lester J.W. Zhai J. Kimura Y. Dorn 2nd, G.W. MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24145-24152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). V49G-PLB caused very strong SERCA2a inhibition, and in fact induced heart failure when overexpressed in the ventricles of transgenic mice (17Haghighi K. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Brittsan A.G. Yatani A. Lester J.W. Zhai J. Kimura Y. Dorn 2nd, G.W. MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24145-24152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These apparently contradictory results suggest an important functional role for Val49 of PLB, but highlight the need to clarify the exact role and mechanism of Val49 in overall SERCA2a inhibition. Recently, Toyoshima et al. (7Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) reported successful cross-linking of V49C-PLB to V89C-SERCA1a (skeletal muscle isoform) with use of Cu2+-phenanthroline (7Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which demonstrated for the first time the close proximity between the C-terminal end of PLB and Val89 in the M2 helix of SERCA. In the work reported here, we have extended our cross-linking approach to examine physical and functional interactions between the C-terminal end of PLB (residues 45–52) and V89C in the M2 helix of SERCA2a, taking advantage of the recent observation of Toyoshima et al. (7Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that coupling can occur here between PLB and SERCA. Results obtained after cross-linking of eight residues at the membrane terminus of PLB are remarkably consistent with results obtained previously after cross-linking of the cytoplasmic domain IB residues of PLB to residues at the cytoplasmic extension of M4 (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10530-10539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At both domains, PLB crosslinks to SERCA2a preferentially in the nucleotide-bound, E2 conformation. Thus, Ca2+ binding by SERCA2a, which stabilizes E1, appears to induce a global dissociation of PLB that accounts for the relief of inhibition, and PLB appears to recognize a single, unique conformation of SERCA2a: E2 stabilized by bound nucleotide. Contrary to previous reports with Val49 (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J.

Ca2+-ATPase Assay—Ca2+-ATPase activity was assayed at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaN3, and 3 μg/ml of the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 (13Autry J.M.

Ca2+-ATPase activities were measured in the presence and absence of anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12, which reverses PLB inhibition (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For each preparation, maximal Ca2+-ATPase activity was also determined in the presence of 50 μm added Ca2+ with no added EGTA, an ionized Ca2+ concentration that totally reverses PLB inhibition (8Cantilina T.

The amount of microsomal protein used for cross-linking and 32Pi labeling experiments was then adjusted for small variations in amounts of Ca2+ pump protein expressed between preparations, based on the maximal Ca2+-ATPase activities determined. Maximal Ca2+-ATPase activities ranged between 10 and 15 μmolofPi/mg of protein/h for all preparations used in this study. All ATPase activities reported are Ca2+-dependent (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cross-linking—Cross-linking between Cys residues of PLB in domain II and V89C of SERCA2a in M2 was conducted using the homobifunctional thiol cross-linking reagents BMH or bBBr, or with Cu2+-phenanthroline. Reactions were conducted with 10–15 μg of microsomal protein (adjusted for equivalent amounts of SERCA2a expressed, see above) in 12 μlof E2 buffer, which contained 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3.2 mm MgCl2,75mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA. In Fig. 3, ionized calcium concentrations were set by adding CaCl2. In some experiments, ATP concentration was varied, as indicated. TG was added from stock solutions in ethanol. Cross-linking reactions were started by adding 0.75 μl of bBBr or BMH from 1.6 mm stock solutions in Me2SO (0.1 mm final cross-linker concentrations), or by adding 0.75 μl of CuSO4 and phenanthroline to yield final concentrations of 0.3 and 0.9 mm, respectively. Reactions were conducted at room temperature for 10 min with BMH or Cu2+-phenanthrolene, and for 1 h at room temperature with bBBr. N30C-PLB was cross-linked to Lys328 of wild-type SERCA2a for 10 min at room temperature using the heterobifunctional cross-linking agent KMUS, in an identical system (5Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 7.5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, which contained 15% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol (omitted when Cu2+-phenanthroline was used), 20% glycerol, 62 mm Tris (pH 6.8), and a trace of bromphenol blue as a tracking dye. After terminating the reactions, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (18Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) followed by immunoblotting with anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12, to detect PLB cross-linked to SERCA2a (4Jones L.R. Cornea R.L.

Phosphorylation of SERCA2a with 32Pi—In some experiments, simultaneous cross-linking of SERCA2a to PLB and phosphorylation of SERCA2a with 32Pi to form E2P was performed. In these experiments, 12 μlof E2 buffer was replaced with 12 μl of buffer promoting E2P formation, which consisted of 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 20% Me2SO, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 0.25 mm radioactive or non-radioactive Pi (E2P buffer). ATP concentration was varied as indicated. Reactions were started by adding 10–15 μg of microsomal protein containing equivalent amounts of SERCA2a per reaction tube, and after a 10-min incubation at room temperature to allow E2P formation, cross-linking of different PLB mutants to SERCA2a was initiated by adding cross-linkers as described above to two duplicate sets of reaction tubes, one containing non-radioactive Pi, and the other 32Pi. For assessment of cross-linking, one set of reaction tubes, which had been incubated with 0.25 mm non-radioactive Pi, was terminated and processed identically as described above. For measurement of E2P formation, a duplicate set of reaction tubes, which had been incubated with 0.25 mm 32Pi, was terminated by adding 7.5 μl of LDS sample loading buffer per tube, which contained 200 mm glycine (pH 2.4), 20% glycerol, 3% LDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and a trace of malachite green as the tracking dye. Gel electrophoresis in 7% polyacrylamide under acidic conditions to retain E2P was then performed by the following method modified from Lichtner and Wolf (19Lichtner R. Wolf H.U. Biochem.

The microtubule destabilizing activity of stathmin is down-regulated by phosphorylation of four serine residues, Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63. Here we have used calorimetric and spectroscopic methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance to analyze the properties of seven stathmin phosphoisoforms to bind tubulin and inhibit microtubule formation. We found that stathmin phosphorylation results in a substantial loss in hydration entropy upon tubulin-stathmin complex formation. Remarkably, a linear correlation between the free energy change of complex formation and the microtubule inhibition activities of stathmin phosphoisoforms was observed. This finding provides a biophysical basis for understanding the mechanism by which local stathmin activity gradients important for promoting localized microtubule growth are established. We further found that phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser63 disrupts the formation of a tubulin-interacting β-hairpin and a helical segment, respectively, explaining the dominant role of these residues in regulating cell cycle progression. The insight into the tubulin-stathmin interaction offers a molecular basis for understanding the nature and the factors that control intrinsically disordered protein systems in general.

The insight into the tubulin-stathmin interaction offers a molecular basis for understanding the nature and the factors that control intrinsically disordered protein systems in general. Intrinsically disordered proteins have gained enormous interest not only because they are recognized to play key roles in many central cellular processes including cell cycle control, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation but also because of their particular importance for cancer development and protein deposition diseases (1Dyson H.J.

Recent genome data base searches indicated that >30% of all eukaryotic proteins may be completely or partially disordered (5Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). This high frequency of occurrence has provoked a change of the paradigm that stable tertiary structure is necessary for protein function.Intrinsically disordered polypeptide chain segments are primarily involved in molecular recognition and posttranslational modification including phosphorylation (6Iakoucheva L.M.

Little is known, however, regarding the nature and mechanism of control of protein-protein interactions involving intrinsically disordered proteins. Stathmin is a key regulator of microtubule dynamics that lacks a stable three-dimensional structure (7Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J.

Interestingly, stathmin is expressed in high amounts in a wide variety of human malignancies, and its overexpression correlates with increased cell motility and invasion of human sarcomas in vivo (21Baldassarre G.

Moreover, stathmin is important in regulating innate and learned fear and is thus implicated in anxiety states of mental disorders (22Shumyatsky G.P. Malleret G. Shin R.M. Takizawa S. Tully K.

These findings underscore the crucial role of stathmin in a wide variety of central microtubule-dependent cellular processes.Characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins, stathmin is devoid of stable tertiary structure in isolation (7Steinmetz M.O.

The curved and capped structure of the ternary tubulin-stathmin complex (see Fig. 1B) provides a structural basis for understanding how stathmin family proteins destabilize microtubules.In vivo, the activity of stathmin is down-regulated by posttranslational phosphorylation in response to a number of signals on four serine residues, Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63 (26Larsson N.

To define how multiple phosphorylation sites control stathmin function, we here have explored seven stathmin phosphoisoforms by using biochemical and biophysical methods.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation—For the production of high amounts of pure and specific human stathmin phosphoisoforms, seven serine-to-alanine mutants were constructed: S25A,S38A,S63A (for p16), S16A,S25A,S38A (for p63), S25A,S38A (for p16,63), S16A,S63A (for p25,38), S63A (for p16,25,38), S16A (for p25,38,63), and S16A,S25A,S38A,S63A (4A). The microtubule-polymerization inhibition and tubulin binding activities, the secondary structure content, and the thermal stability of the quadruple mutant 4A were indistinguishable from the wild-type, justifying the validity of the approach (Table 1). To produce the mutant molecules, two silent nucleotide mutations, G66C and G141C, were introduced by PCR into the human pET-16b (Novagen) stathmin clone (7Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W.

This new plasmid provided the basis for subsequent cloning of all mutants by using synthetic oligonucleotide adapter primers at either NdeI/SacI, SacI/XhoI, or XhoI/BbvCI recognition sites.

Specific phosphorylation by protein kinase A (for phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser63) and a mixture of MAPK 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; SLD, stathmin-like domain. and CdC2 (for phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38) was achieved by incubating the proteins with the respective kinases (2.8, 2.0, and 0.5 units of protein kinase A, MAPK, and/or CdC2, respectively, per μg of stathmin) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm ATP for 6–8 h at 30 °C. Product formation was assessed by native-PAGE. Kinases were heat-inactivated at 75 °C for 10 min. Phosphoisoforms were purified to high homogeneity (>93%) by anion exchange chromatography. Highly pure bovine brain GTP-tubulin was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc.The identities of stathmin proteins were assessed by mass spectral analyses. Concentrations of protein samples were determined by the Advanced Protein Assay (Cytoskeleton Inc.).Tubulin-polymerization Assay—In vitro polymerization of tubulin was performed according to Ref. 26Larsson N.

Briefly, 4 μm tubulin in G buffer (80 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP) supplemented with 4 mm MgCl2 was preincubated with 4 μm of stathmin (in the same buffer) for 30 min at room temperature in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Polymerization was initiated by adding 1 μlofa400 μm taxol stock solution and incubating at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Microtubules were separated from tubulin-stathmin oligomers by sedimentation at 300,000 × g for 15 min at 37 °C in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The protein contents of supernatants and pellets were analyzed with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce).Biophysical Analysis—High sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried out on a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). For each experiment, the temperature-controlled sample cell (volume 1.4 ml) was filled with either ∼10 μm (for WT, 4A, p25,38, S16E, and S63E) or ∼20 μm (for p16, p63, p16,63, p16,25,38, p25,38,63, and p16,25,38,63) GTP-tubulin in G buffer (80 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP). Either 5 μl (for WT, 4A, p25,38, S16E, and S63E) or 10 μl (for p16, p63, p16,63, p16,25,38, p25,38,63, and p16,25,38,63) of ∼100 μm stathmin aliquots (present in the same buffer as tubulin) were injected into the sample cell. Binding isotherms were fitted using a nonlinear least squares minimization method assuming two independent and equal binding sites on stathmin for tubulin (8Honnappa S. Cutting B. Jahnke W. Seelig J.

The apparent molar heat capacity change of the binding reaction, ΔCp, corresponds to the slope of the linear regression obtained form the fitting of the apparent ΔH values at different temperatures.Protein samples (0.35 mg/ml) for CD were in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Far-ultraviolet CD spectra and thermal unfolding profiles were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) equipped with a temperature-controlled quartz cell of 0.1-cm path length. A ramping rate of 1 °C·min–1 was used to record the thermal unfolding profiles.15N,1H-HSQC NMR experiments of 19 mg/ml protein samples in G buffer were carried out at 25 °C on a Varian UnityPlus 600 spectrometer operating at 600 MHz proton frequency. For resonance assignment, three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC using a clean DIPSI-2 mixing sequence and three-dimensional 15N-HSQC-TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC were recorded.Modeling—The 3.5 Ä resolution x-ray crystal structure of the tubulin-RB3 stathmin-like domain (SLD) complex (PDB entry 1SA0), and the PyMol (De-Lano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA) and Moloc (40Gerber P.R. Muller K. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1995; 9: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) software packages were used for modeling studies. The accuracy of the conformations of key residue side chains was verified by inspecting the electron density map for PDB entry 1SA0. Solvent-accessible area calculations were carried out with the program NACCESS V2.1.1 with the default set of atomic radii and parameters. The stathmin residues 29–45 were taken from PDB entry 1SA1. Tyr63 of the RB3-SLD was replaced by a serine to reflect the human stathmin sequence. Stathmin and RB3-SLD share 72% sequence identity, and 82 and 92% of all tubulin-contacting RB3-SLD residues are invariant or similar, respectively, in stathmin.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFor the following studies, milligram amounts of pure and specific single (denoted p16 and p63), double (denoted p25,38 and p16,63), triple (denoted p16,25,38 and p25,38,63), and quadruple (denoted p16,25,38,63) stathmin phosphoisoforms were produced (Fig. 2A). The activities of the proteins were assessed in vitro by a microtubule polymerization assay. Under the experimental conditions applied the efficiency to inhibit microtubule formation decreased from 90 to 0% with a differential combination of stathmin phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). These findings are consistent with stathmin sequestering tubulin dimers into assembly-incompetent complexes (9Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The thermodynamics of the tubulin-stathmin interaction was assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (supplemental Fig. 1). Between 6 and 25 °C, stathmin binds two tubulin subunits and all thermodynamic parameters are thus referred to the ternary tubulin-stathmin T2S complex (supplemental Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2C, the binding reaction is predicted to be driven by both enthalpy and entropy at physiological temperatures. The large apparent negative heat capacity change of ΔCp,T2S,obs =–1504 ± 206 cal mol–1 K–1 suggests that the hydrophobic effect (removal of non-polar surface from water) promotes T2S complex formation (36Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the apparent entropic and enthalpic contributions to the free energy change of complex formation vary with temperature in a linear and nearly parallel manner, changing sign at ∼28 and ∼44 °C, respectively.Empirical studies on proteins showed that the removal of hydrophobic and polar surface from water contributes –45 and 26 cal mol–1/100 Ä2, respectively, to ΔCp (37Luque I. Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 100-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have calculated the total buried hydrophobic and polar surface areas from the 3.5 Ä resolution x-ray crystal structure of the ternary complex formed between the stathmin homologue RB3 and tubulin (denoted T2R, see Ref. 11Ravelli R.B. Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Jourdain I. Lachkar S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Nature. 2004; 428: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) as 5316 and 3074 Ä2, respectively.Accordingly, the estimated heat capacity change ΔCp,T2S,cal amounts –1593 cal mol–1 K–1, in good agreement with the experimentally obtained value for the tubulin-stathmin complex (see above). These findings are consistent with a mechanism in which dehydration of the protein-protein interface is the major driving force of T2S complex formation.Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that each stathmin phosphoisoform bound two tubulin dimers as observed for unmodified stathmin (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD,T2S, of T2S for unmodified stathmin is 5.3 × 10–13 m2 under the conditions applied. This relatively high value underscores the dynamic nature of the tubulin-stathmin equilibrium observed in cellular systems. Single phosphorylation of Ser16 or Ser63 increases KD,T2S 17- and 113-fold, respectively. A strong effect was found with p16,63, which displays a 233-fold reduced binding affinity. Dual phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 reduced KD,T2S only 4-fold, and the down-regulating effect of the single phosphoisoforms, p16 and p63, was only marginally enhanced (on average 1.4-fold) by additional phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38. The isothermal titration calorimetry data of p16,25,38,63 could not be evaluated because binding was too weak. For all measured stathmin phosphoisoforms, a reduced binding entropy that is partially offset by an increased binding enthalpy is observed (Fig. 2D).The finding that phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser63 contributes most to the reduced binding of stathmin explains the dominant role of these residues for in vivo inactivation (26Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 6196-6203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The moderate effect obtained with phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 correlates with their location in the proline/serine-rich loop segment of stathmin (Fig. 1), which is poorly ordered in the T2R complex (11Ravelli R.B. Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Jourdain I. Lachkar S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Nature. 2004; 428: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 12Gigant B. Wang C. Ravelli R.B. Roussi F. Steinmetz M.O. Curmi P.A. Sobel A. Knossow M. Nature. 2005; 435: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The local perturbation caused by phosphorylated Ser25 and Ser38, however, is expected to facilitate phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser16 and Ser63 residues as suggested from in vivo data (26Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Remarkably, a linear correlation between the free energy of T2S complex formation and the tubulin polymerization inhibition activities of stathmin phosphoisoforms is observed (Fig. 3). In agreement with cell biological data (26Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Horwitz S.B.

This conclusion provides a biophysical basis for understanding how spatial gradients of differentially inactive stathmin molecules promote localized microtubule growth, a process essential for, e.g. mitotic spindle assembly (30Andersen S.S.

Thermus thermophilus, a Gram-negative eubacterium originally isolated from hot springs, produces highly thermostable proteins under obligately aerobic conditions (1Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst.

Elsevier, London, UK1989: 82-97Google Scholar). Its respiratory chain contains several major redox complexes, such as an NADH-oxidizing complex I (3Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J.

Karas M. Soulimane T. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For this terminal part of the electron transport chain, T. thermophilus possesses two alternative pathways for oxygen reduction to water, depending on the oxygen partial pressure: (i) the cytochrome ba3 oxidase branch with cytochrome c552 as water-soluble electron donor or (ii) the c1aa3 oxidase, where the c-type cytochrome domain is covalently bound to subunit II of this terminal oxidase (5Soulimane T. von Walter M. Hof P. Than M. Huber R. Buse G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under low aeration conditions, the preferred product in T. thermophilus is the ba3 branch (6Fee J.A. Choc M.G. Findling K.L. Lorence R. Yoshida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Electron transport from the bc1 complex to the ba3 oxidase is mediated by the 14.4-kDa periplasmic cytochrome c552 (8Fee J.A. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Hill M.G. Gomez-Moran E.

This c-type cytochrome contains a covalently bound heme moiety, with thioether linkages to two cysteine residues in a conserved Cys11-Xaa12-Yaa13-Cys14-His15 motif. The heme iron is octahedrally coordinated by the four porphyrin nitrogens and two axial ligands, His15 and Met69, thus representing a “low spin” heme complex (9Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W.

University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1996Google Scholar). In the redox cycle, the iron atom alternates between the reduced, diamagnetic Fe2+ and the oxidized, paramagnetic Fe3+ state. Thereby, the reduced cytochrome c552 transfers one electron to the oxidized CuA domain, the first electron acceptor of the terminal ba3 oxidase. From this solvent-exposed part of subunit II (11Williams P.A. Blackburn N.J. Sanders D. Bellamy H. Stura E.A. Fee J.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct.

The entire ba3 oxidase of T. thermophilus consists of subunits I, II, and IIa (874 residues, 84.9 kDa) and represents one of the smallest known terminal oxidases in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (12Bresser A.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), that the complex formation between cytochrome c552 and the aa3 oxidase of Paracoccus denitrificans is based on electrostatic interactions between the hydrophilic residues surrounding Trp121 in the CuA domain and the positively charged lysine residues encircling the heme cleft in cytochrome c552. In T. thermophilus, on the other hand, the interaction between the corresponding proteins involves mainly hydrophobic and non-ionic contacts (18Maneg O. Ludwig B. Malatesta F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46734-46740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Maneg O. Malatesta F. Ludwig B. Drosou V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), possibly because the electrostatic attractions would rather be weakened at the high temperatures these bacteria are exposed to. This different specificity between the reaction partners is also supported by the fact that cytochrome c552 from P. denitrificans does not interact with the CuA domain of T. thermophilus (18Maneg O. Ludwig B. Malatesta F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46734-46740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Under steady-state turnover conditions at 25 °C, molar redox activities with kmax = 250 s-1 have been reported between cytochrome c552 and the ba3 oxidase of T. thermophilus (5Soulimane T. von Walter M. Hof P. Than M. Huber R. Buse G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The complex therefore has to be short lived to ensure efficient electron transport (ET). 5The abbreviations used are: ET, electron transfer; AIR, ambiguous interaction restraint; DSS, 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear overhauser and exchange spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy; PDB, Protein Data Bank; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. This transient nature of the redox interaction precludes the detection of any intermolecular NOE connectivities to define the contact region between the proteins. However, the highly sensitive amide resonances allow the observation of chemical shift changes as a result of transient alterations in the local environment due to the presence of the redox partner, as previously demonstrated with other systems such as plastocyanin/cytochrome c, plastocyanin/cytochrome f, cytochrome c peroxidase/iso-1-cytochrome c, and CuA domain/cytochrome c552 from P. denitrificans for example (19Wienk H.

Chem. 2005; 280: 18908-18915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore employed two isolated, soluble components, i.e. cytochrome c552 and the CuA domain, to determine the biologically relevant ET complex of the T. thermophilus system. Contrary to the CuA domain from P. denitrificans, which was not sufficiently stable for prolonged NMR data collection at room temperature, the CuA domain from T. thermophilus proved highly stable. Both proteins were complexed under uniform redox conditions that precluded ET; but the transient complex interaction apparently still took place, as in the P. denitrificans system (19Wienk H. Maneg O. Lücke C. Pristovsek P. Löhr F. Ludwig B. Rüterjans H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analogous to the previous P. denitrificans study, in the case of reduced cytochrome c552 from T. thermophilus we again detected the most pronounced shifts at residues located in the protein interior behind the heme ring. These indirect effects are an indication for redox state-dependent alterations of the electron delocalization in the porphyrin system. Based on chemical shift perturbation mapping, protein-protein docking calculations subsequently yielded the first structural characterization of the ET complex between cytochrome c552 and the CuA domain that is founded on experimental data. Using this information, the shortest ET pathway from the heme iron to the CuA center was calculated based on the “pathway model,” revealing an involvement of Phe88, which however does not play such a crucial role as the corresponding Trp121 residue in the P. denitrificans system (24Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5132-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Two alternative ET scenarios, matching our experimental mutagenesis data, will be discussed. Sample Preparation—Cytochrome c552 (133 amino acid residues; 14,405 Da including the heme cofactor) and the CuA domain (136 residues; 15,062 Da including the two copper atoms) of T. thermophilus were both expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified as described previously (18Maneg O. Ludwig B. Malatesta F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46734-46740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Mukrasch M.D. Lücke C. Löhr F. Maneg O. Ludwig B. Rüterjans H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For 15N enrichment, both proteins were expressed in M9 medium. In the case of cytochrome c552, heme maturation was achieved by co-transformation of the E. coli cells with the ccmABCDEFGH gene cluster (26Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Künzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) present on the pEC86 plasmid. Copper atoms were introduced into the apo-CuA domain by addition of Cu(His)2 after cell lysis. The NMR resonance assignments revealed that the soluble cytochrome c552 protein carried an alanine-to-threonine point mutation in position 123; subsequent activity tests, however, showed the same functionality as the wild-type protein. The CuA domain, the water-soluble fragment of the ba3 oxidase, also was fully functional as revealed by redox spectroscopy (18Maneg O. Ludwig B. Malatesta F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46734-46740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by the “altered sites” protocol (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously (24Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5132-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All stopped-flow experiments were carried out in 20 mm BisTris buffer (pH 7.0; 10 mm KCl) at 20 °C, as described elsewhere (18Maneg O. Ludwig B. Malatesta F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46734-46740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For the resonance assignments, NMR samples of 2 mm protein concentration were prepared for each redox partner, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.15 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) as internal chemical shift reference (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and 5% D2O. Depending on the redox state to be investigated, 5 mm sodium ascorbate or 5 mm potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) were added to obtain a fully reduced or oxidized sample, respectively. For the chemical shift perturbation study, the protein samples were prepared according to the following procedures: 1) two samples both containing 0.5 mm 15N-labeled cytochrome c552 in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.15 mm DSS, and 5% D2O were treated in parallel. Non-labeled CuA was added in 4-fold molar excess to one of the two samples. The pH values of both samples were adjusted precisely. To obtain cytochrome c552 sample pairs under reduced or oxidized conditions, the solutions included 4 mm sodium ascorbate or 5 mm potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), respectively. 2) Two samples both containing 0.5 mm 15N-labeled CuA fragment in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.15 mm DSS, and 5% D2O were treated likewise. Non-labeled cytochrome c552 was added in 4-fold excess to only one of the two samples and pH values checked for both solutions. To obtain CuA domain sample pairs under reduced or oxidized conditions, the solutions included 4 mm sodium ascorbate or 5 mm potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), respectively. NMR Experiments and Analysis—For the resonance assignments of both proteins, NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C using Bruker DMX 500 and DMX 600 spectrometers operating at 500.13 and 600.13 MHz proton resonance frequencies, respectively, and both equipped with 5-mm triple-resonance 1H{13C/15N} probes that have XYZ-gradient capability. The following spectra were collected to assign the resonances of cytochrome c552 and the CuA domain in both redox states, as described previously (27Pristovsek P. Lücke C. Reincke B. Ludwig B. Rüterjans H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar): two-dimensional [1H,1H]TOCSY, two-dimensional [1H,1H]NOESY, two-dimensional [15N,1H]TROSY (28Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), three-dimensional TOCSY-[15N,1H]TROSY, and three-dimensional NOESY-[15N,1H]TROSY. In the homonuclear one- and two-dimensional 1H experiments, the water signal was suppressed by selective presaturation during the relaxation delay, with the carrier placed in the center of the spectrum on the water resonance. All heteronuclear experiments made use of pulsed field gradients for coherence selection and artifact suppression and utilized gradient sensitivity enhancement schemes (29Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained either by the States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation) or by the echo/antiecho method. All NMR spectra were acquired and processed on Silicon Graphics computers using the program XWINNMR 3.5 (Bruker Bio-Spin, Rheinstetten, Germany). A 90° phase-shifted squared sine-bell function was used for apodization in all dimensions. Polynomial base-line correction was applied to the processed spectra in the directly detected 1H dimension. Peak picking and data analysis of the transformed spectra were performed using the AURELIA 2.5.9 (Bruker Bio-Spin) software package. The chemical shifts were referenced to internal DSS to ensure consistency among all spectra (30Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). For the chemical shift perturbation mapping, two-dimensional [15N,1H]TROSY spectra were recorded, as described previously (19Wienk H. Maneg O. Lücke C. Pristovsek P. Löhr F. Ludwig B. Rüterjans H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), at 25 °C and pH 6 on a Bruker Avance 900 spectrometer, operating at 900.13 MHz proton resonance frequency and equipped with a 5 mm cryogenic z-gradient 1H{13C/15N} triple-resonance probe. Data acquisition and processing were performed as described above. The backbone amide peaks were picked with the program FELIX 2000 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Chemical shift differences in the amide proton (Δδ1HN) and nitrogen (Δδ15N) resonances of the free and complexed protein forms were combined for each residue by using the expression [(Δδ1HN)2 + (Δδ15N/6.5)2]1/2 (31Mulder F.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These combined chemical shift differences were illustrated with the program MOLMOL (32Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 41: 51-55Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) by color-coding each respective surface residue. Docking Calculations—The structure of the cytochrome c552·CuA domain complex was determined with the program HADDOCK (high ambiguity driven protein-protein docking) (33Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) that has been implemented in the program CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges J. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), making use of python scripts derived from ARIA (35Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) for automation. HADDOCK employs biophysical interaction data, such as chemical shift perturbation resulting from NMR titration experiments, that are introduced into the structure calculation as ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process. In our application, four independent sets of amide proton chemical shift perturbation data were available: 15N-labeled cytochrome c552 titrated with non-labeled CuA domain, both in the reduced and oxidized state, and 15N-labeled CuA domain titrated with non-labeled cytochrome c552, again both in the reduced and oxidized state. From each independent data set, the residues with the strongest chemical shift perturbations were selected as “active AIRs” for the HADDOCK calculations; residues with less than 20% accessible surface area, however, were rejected. In addition, surface residues located next to the selected active AIRs were chosen as “passive AIRs”, if their relative surface accessibility was also above 20%. The x-ray coordinates of cytochrome c552 (PDB ID code 1DT1) and the ba3 oxidase (PDB ID code 1EHK) were used both to calculate the surface accessibilities with the program NACCESS (36Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, UK1993Google Scholar) and for the subsequent docking calculations. First, 100 structures of the cytochrome c552·CuA domain complex were calculated using the rigid docking protocol of HADDOCK. Next, the 20 structures showing the lowest AIR violations were further energy minimized with the side chains of the active and passive residues left flexible. Finally, the 10 best structures were minimized once more in a 8 Å shell of explicit TIP3P (37Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30558) Google Scholar) water molecules (for details, see Ref. 33Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). AIR violations, interaction energies, and buried surface areas of the final structures were compared. In addition, the complexes were characterized in terms of electron transfer by the evaluation of electron-tunneling coupling factors using the program GREENPATH (38Regan J.J. Risser S.M. Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 13083-13088Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the latter program, the highly interconnected network of bonded and non-bonded contacts within the protein matrix is searched to specify the pathways that maximize the electron-tunneling coupling between the electron donor and acceptor (i.e. the iron atom of the cytochrome c552 heme moiety and the copper center of the CuA domain, respectively). This is achieved using the theories and methods developed by Beratan, Onuchic, and Betts (39Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N. Science. 1991; 252: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), which quantify the ET (without interference) using the pathway model. A pathway is defined as a combination of interacting atoms that link the donor with the acceptor via covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and through-space jumps. Rates of non-adiabatic ET reactions can be defined by the expression kET = (2π/h) |TDA|2(FC). Thereby, the term TDA describes the donor-acceptor interaction associated with electron tunneling, while the FC (Franck-Condon) term contains the free energy dependence (reorganization and reaction free energy) related to nuclear motion. To allow chemical shift perturbation mapping, the full set of backbone amide resonance values had to be determined for both proteins, i.e. cytochrome c552 and the CuA domain from T. thermophilus. The resonance assignments were performed according to the classical strategy based on NOE connectivities between adjacent residues (40Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), with 15N labeling used to achieve a better signal dispersion. The resulting 1H and 15N assignments of cytochrome c552 and the CuA domain in both redox states have been deposited at the BioMagResBank data base. Both redox partners investigated in this study had been shown earlier to be fully functional when expressed in a heterologous host organism (18Maneg O. Ludwig B. Malatesta F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46734-46740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the T. thermophilus proteins, in particular the CuA domain, displayed a higher stability compared to the homologous proteins from P. denitrificans, which had been employed in an earlier NMR study (19Wienk H. Maneg O. Lücke C. Pristovsek P. Löhr F. Ludwig B. Rüterjans H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NMR Resonance Assignments—The reduced (i.e. diamagnetic) cytochrome c552 was fully assigned (BMRB-6966); heme proton resonances were determined based on NOE data that agreed with interproton distances in the x-ray structure (PDB ID code 1DT1). Several residues showed highly unusual chemical shift resonances because of ring-current effects; the backbone amide proton resonance of Leu116, for example, is located upfield of the water signal at 4.35 ppm (Fig. 1). The oxidized (i.e. paramagnetic) cytochrome c552 was assigned nearly completely (BMRB-6967), except for the heme ring and three protein residues: His15 and Met69, the two axial ligands of the iron atom, and Cys14, which is bound covalently to the heme ring. Only a few of the heme proton resonances could be identified by using NOE information from the two-dimensional and three-dimensional NOESY data. Certain resonances showed strong line broadening due to the proximity of the paramagnetic center. The reduced (i.e. diamagnetic) CuA domain had been previously assigned using triple-resonance experiments (25Mukrasch M.D. Lücke C. Löhr F. Maneg O. Ludwig B. Rüterjans H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); however, several aromatic ring proton resonances have been additionally identified in the present work based on homonuclear two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra (update of BMRB-5819). Interestingly, the 1H resonances of the Phe88 ring, which is situated close to the CuA center and has been postulated to play a role in the ET (13Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Than M.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), were the only aromatic ring resonances that could not be identified. In the case of the oxidized (i.e. paramagnetic) CuA domain, the assignment of the 1H and 15N resonances was again not complete (BMRB-6965), due to the paramagnetic CuA center. Moreover, as reported elsewhere (41Bertini I. Bren K. Clemente A. Fee J.A. Gray H.B. Luchinat C. Malmström B.G. Richards J.H. Sanders D. Slutter C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11658-11659Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), several resonances are extremely shifted, such as an amide group at 300 ppm and certain Cβ protons at 30 ppm. Nevertheless, except for 9 residues (i.e. the three N-terminal amino acids Met33-Tyr35, Gly115, and Cys149-Cys153), all other backbone amide groups could be identified for the oxidized CuA domain. Chemical Shift Perturbation Mapping—To obtain structural data on the transient complex between cytochrome c552 and the CuA domain, two-dimensional [15N,1H]TROSY spectra comparing the free and the complexed state of each protein were collected. Employing 15N-labeled protein samples, the chemical shift changes upon addition of 4-fold molar excess of the non-labeled reaction partner provided crucial information about the residues that are affected by the formation of the complex. The non-labeled redox partner was always added in excess, to shift the equilibrium toward the associated complex state. Nevertheless, the o"

However, the mechanisms that link macrophage accumulation and plasminogen activator activity with cardiac fibrosis are unclear. We previously reported that mice with macrophage-targeted overexpression of urokinase plasminogen activator (SR-uPA+/o mice) develop cardiac macrophage accumulation by 5 weeks of age and cardiac fibrosis by 15 weeks. We used SR-uPA+/o mice to investigate mechanisms through which macrophage-expressed uPA causes cardiac macrophage accumulation and fibrosis. We hypothesized that: 1) macrophage accumulation and cardiac fibrosis in SR-uPA+/o mice are dependent on localization of uPA by the uPA receptor (uPAR); 2) activation of plasminogen by uPA and subsequent activation of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 by plasmin are critical pathways through which uPA-expressing macrophages accumulate in the heart and cause fibrosis; and 3) uPA-induced cardiac fibrosis can be attenuated by treatment with verapamil. To test these hypotheses, we bred the SR-uPA+/o transgene into mice deficient in either uPAR or plasminogen and measured cardiac macrophage accumulation and fibrosis. We also measured cardiac TGF-β1 protein (total and active), Smad2 phosphorylation, and MMP activity after the onset of macrophage accumulation but before the onset of cardiac fibrosis. Finally, we treated mice with verapamil. Our studies revealed that plasminogen is necessary for uPA-induced cardiac fibrosis and macrophage accumulation but uPAR is not. We did not detect plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-β1, MMP-2, or MMP-9 in hearts of SR-uPA+/o mice. However, verapamil treatment significantly attenuated both cardiac fibrosis and macrophage accumulation.

Cardiac fibrosis, the accumulation of excess extracellular matrix in the heart, is a common feature of end-stage heart disease independent of etiology. Cardiac fibrosis may contribute to impaired systolic and diastolic function and is associated with both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (1Weber K.T. Brilla C.G. Janicki J.S. Cardiovasc.

These pathways could include PA-mediated conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Alternatively, cardiac fibrosis could be caused by plasminogen-independent actions of either PAs or macrophages. Definition of the pathways through which increased cardiac macrophage accumulation and PA activity lead to cardiac fibrosis may clarify the basic mechanisms of cardiac fibrosis and suggest new therapeutic approaches.Here we report the use of mice with macrophage-targeted expression of uPA (SR-uPA+/o mice (13Cozen A.E. Moriwaki H. Kremen M. DeYoung M.B. Dichek H.L. Slezicki K.I. Young S.G. Veniant M. Dichek D.A. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) to investigate the mechanisms through which increased macrophage PA activity causes cardiac macrophage accumulation and fibrosis. SR-uPA+/o mice are an appropriate animal model for these investigations because, in the absence of infarction or any other overt cardiac injury, they develop cardiac macrophage accumulation by 5 weeks of age and cardiac fibrosis by 15 weeks (10Moriwaki H. Stempien-Otero A. Kremen M. Cozen A.E. Dichek D.A. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the uPA receptor (uPAR) (which can facilitate cell migration by focusing uPA and plasmin proteolytic activity to the leading edge of migrating cells (14Blasi F. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar)) is required for both cardiac macrophage accumulation and the subsequent development of fibrosis in SR-uPA+/o mice. Moreover, because transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are plasmin substrates that are implicated as causes of cardiac fibrosis in other settings (15Lijnen P.J. Petrov V.V. Fagard R.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 418-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Kim H.E. Dalal S.S. Young E. Legato M.J. Weisfeldt M.L. D'Armiento J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-β1 and MMPs causes cardiac fibrosis in SR-uPA+/o mice. Finally, because uPA can cause arterial constriction, (17Falkenberg M. Tom C. DeYoung M.B. Wen S. Linnemann R. Dichek D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10665-10670Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that treatment with the calcium channel inhibitor verapamil would reduce uPA-induced cardiac fibrosis and macrophage accumulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Tissue Harvest—The SR-uPA+/o mice were back-crossed into the C57BL/6 background for at least eight generations and then bred with nontransgenic C57BL/6 mates to obtain experimental and control mice. C57BL/6 mice deficient in uPAR or heterozygous for plasminogen deficiency (Plaur –/– or Plg+/–) (18Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L.

Pups were weaned at 4 weeks of age and genotyped for the SR-uPA transgene by Southern blot or PCR of tail DNA. Genotyping of the Plg and Plaur alleles was performed by PCR of tail DNA using published primers (18Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 19Bugge T.H. Suh T.T. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C. Romer J. Solberg V. Dano K. Degen J.L. J. Biol.

Some of the SR-uPA+/o mice (n = 9) were treated with verapamil (1 mg/ml in 10% dextrose as drinking water) beginning at 5 weeks of age. Littermate controls (n = 8) received 10% dextrose alone. After 60 days, the mice were killed and their hearts processed for histologic analysis of macrophage and collagen content as described below. All animal protocols were approved by the University of Washington Office of Animal Welfare.To obtain hearts for histologic and biochemical analysis, deeply anesthetized mice were exsanguinated, and hearts were excised, placed in phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to phosphate-buffered saline with 5% dextrose and 25 mm KCl to produce cardiac arrest, and then placed in sucrose formalin fixative. Hearts were sectioned into three pieces (base, midventricle, and apex) and processed into a single paraffin block.Histologic Analyses—Macrophages were detected with a rat monoclonal antibody (anti-Mac-3, clone M3/84, 2.5 μg/ml; Pharmingen) (10Moriwaki H. Stempien-Otero A. Kremen M. Cozen A.E. Dichek D.A. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry) and diaminobenzidine substrate. Control slides were incubated with isotype-matched primary antibodies (Pharmingen).We quantified cardiac macrophages by counting Mac-3-stained cells in each of two or three sections spaced at least 1 mm apart. Cells were counted in 10 random high power (×400) microscopic fields per section (20–30 fields per heart), and the average macrophage density in each heart was calculated. Collagen accumulation was quantified by picrosirius red staining of a single section from the midventricle of each heart. Computer-assisted image analysis (Image Pro 3.0 software, Media Cybernetics) was used to quantify the red-stained area of each section. Quantification of cardiac macrophages and collagen was done by observers blinded to genotype.Measurement of Plasminogen Activator Activity of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Cultured macrophages were used for this assay, which was performed not as a direct measurement of in vivo uPA activity but to determine whether the SR-uPA transgene was still expressed by macrophages of Plg–/– mice. Bone marrow was harvested from the femurs of 8–10-week-old mice by flushing with RPMI 1640 with 2% fetal bovine serum and 5 IU/ml heparin. The marrow cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% each penicillin/streptomycin and l-glutamine, and 10% L-cell conditioned medium as a source of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (20Hume D.A. Gordon S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Culture media and nonadherent cells were removed, and new medium added at days 4 and 8. This protocol yields 104-106 macrophages/femur. On day 10, the medium was changed to M199. Conditioned medium was collected after 20 h and stored at –80 °C. Cells were counted and lysed, and total lysate protein was measured using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Plasminogen activator activity was detected by incubating aliquots of macrophage-conditioned medium with Glu-plasminogen (0.4 μm; American Diagnostica) and the plasmin substrate S-2251 (0.9 mm; Chromogenix) and measuring the change in absorbance at 405 nm. PA activity was calculated with reference to a standard curve constructed with human single-chain uPA (American Diagnostica).Measurement of TGF-β1 Secreted by Explanted Hearts—The apical half of a heart was minced and placed in M199. After two 30-min incubations in fresh M199, the pieces were transferred to fresh M199 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Conditioned media were collected and stored at –80 °C. Active TGF-β1 (no acid activation) and total TGF-β1 (acid activated) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of conditioned media (Promega).Immunoblot for Phosphorylated Smad2—The basal half of a heart was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground over ice, homogenized with a Polytron, and extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Halt protease inhibitor mixture, 10 μl/ml (Pierce)). Negative and positive controls for the presence of phospho-Smad2 consisted of lysates of AML12 cells treated with vehicle or TGF-β1 (21Romero-Gallo J. Sozmen E.G. Chytil A. Russell W.E. Whitehead R.

Parks (University of Washington), personal communication. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 5% methanol at 85 V for 3 h at 4 °C. Filters were blocked overnight with TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk. Immunoblots were analyzed for phospho-Smad-2 (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 3101) using the antibody at a 1:1000 dilution or a β-actin antibody (Abcam, catalog no. 8227-50) at a 1:5000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Biosciences) using 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antiserum (Abcam, catalog no. 6721-1). Blots were exposed to film for 1–10 min.MMP Detection—The basal half of a heart was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground with a mortar and pestle over liquid nitrogen, homogenized with a Polytron, and placed in lysis buffer (10 mmol/liter cacodylic acid, 0.15 mol/liter NaCl, 20 mmol/liter ZnCl, 1.5 mmol/liter NaN3, and 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 5.0) on ice for 30 min (22Coker M.L.

Extracted protein was measured using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded with nonreducing sample buffer into precast 10% polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin or casein (Bio-Rad). Culture medium from HT-1080 cells stimulated with PMA was loaded as a positive control for gelatinolytic and caseinolytic activity. Gels were run at 4 °C, renatured in renaturation buffer (Bio-Rad) for 90 min at room temperature with shaking, rinsed, and placed in development buffer (Bio-Rad) at 37 °C overnight. The next day gels were stained with Coomassie Blue for 8 h, washed, and placed on a gel-drying rack.Statistical Analysis—Because much of the data were not normally distributed, data are presented as median (25–75% range) and group medians are compared with the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test.RESULTSuPAR Is Not Required for uPA-induced Cardiac Fibrosis or Macrophage Accumulation—To test whether uPAR is a critical mediator of macrophage accumulation and cardiac fibrosis in SR-uPA+/o mice, we began by breeding SR-uPA+/o mice with nontransgenic mice deficient in uPAR (Plaur–/– mice). At 15 weeks of age, SR-uPA+/o Plaur–/– hearts had significantly more fibrosis than hearts of SR-uPAo/o Plaur–/– littermates (8.5 (3.6–13%) versus 0.45 (0.25–1.5%) picrosirius red-positive area; p = 0.001 (Fig. 1A)). To test whether uPAR is a critical mediator of macrophage accumulation in hearts of SR-uPA+/o mice, we counted macrophages in hearts of 15-week-old SR-uPA+/o Plaur–/– and SR-uPAo/o Plaur–/– littermates. SR-uPA+/o Plaur–/– mice had significantly more cardiac macrophages than SR-uPAo/o Plaur–/– littermates (51 (33–85) versus 1.8 (1.2–2.1) Mac-3-positive cells/mm2; p = 0.002 (Fig. 1B)). SR-uPA+/o Plaur–/– mice had a similar degree of cardiac fibrosis and macrophage accumulation as our previously reported SR-uPA+/o Plaur+/+ mice (10Moriwaki H. Stempien-Otero A. Kremen M. Cozen A.E.

F1 mice were then intercrossed to generate SR-uPA+/o Plg+/+, SR-uPA+/o Plg–/–, SR-uPAo/o Plg+/+, and SR-uPAo/o Plg–/– littermates. Hearts of 15-week-old SR-uPA+/o Plg–/– mice had significantly less fibrosis than littermate SR-uPA+/o Plg+/+ mice (0.56 (0.45–0.63%) versus 5.9 (2.4–14%) picrosirius red-positive area; p = 0.01 (Fig. 2)). In addition, SR-uPA+/o Plg–/– mice had the same amount of cardiac fibrosis as nontransgenic Plg–/– littermates (0.56 (0.45–0.63%) versus 0.60 (0.46–0.79%) p = 0.68 (Fig. 2)).FIGURE 2Plasminogen is required for uPA-induced cardiac fibrosis.

In Plg–/– mice, the SR-uPA+/o transgene did not increase cardiac macrophage accumulation (0.69 (0–0.9) Mac-3-positive cells/mm2 for SR-uPA+/o Plg–/– mice versus 0.6 (0.34–0.79) for nontransgenic Plg–/– littermates; p = 1.0 (Fig. 3)).

Media from SR-uPA+/o Plg–/– macrophages had PA activity equal to the PA activity of media from SR-uPA+/oPlg+/+ macrophages (1.5 (1.1–2.0) versus 0.9 (0.7–1.5) IU/106 cells/20 h; p = 0.29 (Fig. 4)). Media from SR-uPA+/o Plg–/– macrophages had significantly greater PA activity than media conditioned by macrophages from nontransgenic Plg–/– mice, in which PA activity was uniformly below the limit of detection (p < 0.02; Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Absence of plasminogen does not affect expression of the SR-uPA transgene.

Total and active TGF-β1 protein were measured in media conditioned by hearts explanted from 5-week-old SR-uPA+/o Plg+/+, SR-uPA+/o Plg–/–, SR-uPAo/o Plg+/+, and SR-uPAo/o Plg–/– littermates. We chose the 5-week time point because it is after the onset of macrophage accumulation but before the onset of fibrosis in SR-uPA+/o mice (10Moriwaki H. Stempien-Otero A. Kremen M. Cozen A.E. Dichek D.A. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Neither total nor active TGF-β1 protein was increased in explant cultures of hearts of 5-week-old SR-uPA+/o mice (Fig. 5, A and B). To gain confidence that we had not missed an increase in cardiac TGF-β1, we repeated this assay with hearts from 7–8-week-old SR-uPA+/o Plg+/+ and SR-uPAo/o Plg+/+ mice. Again, neither total nor active TGF-β1 was increased in media conditioned by SR-uPA+/o hearts (Fig. 5, C and D). Finally, to determine whether cardiac TGF-β1 signaling was increased even in the absence of detectable differences in TGF-β1 protein in conditioned media, we assayed extracts of hearts of 7–8-week-old SR-uPA+/o Plg+/+ and SR-uPAo/o Plg+/+ mice for phosphorylated Smad2 (phospho-Smad2). Phospho-Smad2 was detected in all heart extracts; however, there was no increase in phospho-Smad2 in hearts of SR-uPA+/o mice (Fig. 6).FIGURE 5Total and active TGF-β1 secretion from experimental and control hearts.

Extracts of hearts of SR-uPA+/o Plg+/+, SR-uPA+/o Plg–/–, and SR-uPAo/o Plg+/+ mice had equivalent activity of pro-MMP-2 and no detectable active MMP-2 or MMP-9 (Fig. 7). To measure activity of MMP-3, -7, and -13, aliquots of the same samples were electrophoresed into casein-containing gels. Culture medium from HT-1080 cells was used as a positive control.

Our major findings were as follows. 1) uPAR is not required for uPA/plasmin-induced cardiac macrophage accumulation and fibrosis. 2) Plasminogen is necessary for macrophage accumulation and for the development of cardiac fibrosis. 3) TGF-β1 is not a critical mediator of uPA/plasmin-induced cardiac fibrosis. 4) The activity of gelatinolytic or caseinolytic cardiac MMPs is not increased before the onset of uPA/plasmin-induced cardiac fibrosis. 5) Treatment with verapamil after the onset of macrophage accumulation substantially limits further cardiac macrophage accumulation and fibrosis. Thus, although plasmin is a crucial mediator of uPA-induced cardiac fibrosis, plasmin substrates previously associated with cardiac fibrosis (TGF-β1 and MMPs) do not appear to contribute to either cardiac macrophage accumulation or fibrosis in SR-uPA+/o mice.

These unstable β-tubulins fail to form heterodimers and are predominantly found in association with the chaperonin CCT, suggesting that they cannot undergo productive folding. In agreement with these in vivo observations, we show that the defective β-tubulins do not stably interact with cofactors involved in the tubulin folding pathway and, hence, fail to exchange with β-tubulin in purified αβ heterodimers. Treatment of cells with MG132 causes an accumulation of the aberrant tubulins, indicating that improperly folded β-tubulin is degraded by the proteasome. Rapid degradation of the mutant tubulin does not elicit compensatory changes in wild-type tubulin synthesis or assembly. Instead, loss of β-tubulin from the mutant allele causes a 30-40% decrease in cellular tubulin content with no obvious effect on cell growth or survival.

Microtubules are essential cytoskeletal structures responsible for much of the vesicular traffic in cells, organization of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and segregation of sister chromatids before cell division. They assemble by the endwise concatenation of αβ tubulin heterodimers to form protofilaments, 13 of which associate laterally to form the walls of microtubules in most eukaryotic cells. α- and β-tubulin subunits each follow a complex folding pathway before joining to form assembly-competent heterodimers.

Prefoldin binds to nascent chains and is thought to target newly synthesized tubulin to CCT (1Hansen W.J. Cowan N.J. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which then releases these polypeptides in a quasinative state. The released β-tubulin is captured by either cofactor A or cofactor D. In a parallel pathway, quasi-native α-tubulin polypeptides are captured by either cofactor B or cofactor E. Cofactor E/α and cofactor D/β complexes interact to form a supercomplex. Entry of cofactor C into this supercomplex triggers GTP hydrolysis by β-tubulin, a reaction that results in the release of newly formed assembly-competent αβ tubulin heterodimers (6Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express multiple tubulin genes, each of which encodes a distinct α- or β-tubulin isotype (10Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 11Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As far as is known, these distinct gene products follow a common folding pathway. In addition to their role in the de novo assembly of tubulin dimers, cofactors C, D, and E act in concert on native heterodimers as GTPase-activating proteins. This reaction occurs at a tubulin concentration far below that required for polymerization into microtubules and is thought to act primarily as a quality control mechanism, constantly checking the capacity of heterodimers to productively hydrolyze GTP (12Tian G. Bhamidipati A. Cowan N.J. Lewis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24054-24058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This mechanism would protect the cell from the potentially deleterious consequences of incorporating GTPase-defective subunits into microtubules; however, the means whereby defectively folded tubulin polypeptides are recognized and targeted for degradation is unknown. A new strategy for examining tubulin degradation has emerged from genetic studies. We and others have described a growing number of tubulin mutations that confer resistance to anti-mitotic drugs in mammalian cells and that act by altering microtubule assembly in a manner that counteracts the action of the drugs (13Cabral F. Drug Resist. Updat. 2000; 3: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 14Orr G.A. Verdier-Pinard P. McDavid H. Horwitz S.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7280-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). One of these resistant cell lines, Cmd4, has a D45Y mutation in one allele of its class I β-tubulin (hereafter called β1-tubulin) gene that produces hyperstable microtubules, colcemid resistance, hypersensitivity to paclitaxel, and temperature sensitivity for growth (15Cabral F. Abraham I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Hari M. Wang Y. Veeraraghavan S. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 597-605PubMed Google Scholar). In recent studies, we analyzed revertants of Cmd4 and reported that reversion of colcemid resistance can occur by cis-acting suppressor mutations that destabilize microtubules, by mutations that increase the affinity of tubulin for colcemid, or by mutations that prevent expression of the mutant allele (18Wang Y. Veeraraghavan S. Cabral F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8965-8973Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Wang Y. Cabral F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we report that some revertants produce functionally inactive mutant β1-tubulin because of intra-allelic mutations that interfere with the folding of the protein. We show that misfolded tubulin fails to interact with cofactors A and D after its release from CCT and is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, resulting in a large decrease in cellular tubulin content but no effect on growth. Constructs and Reagents—pRCHAβ1 is a pRC/CMV plasmid (Invitrogen) containing a neomycin resistance gene driven by a constitutive SV40 promoter and a β1 tubulin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U08342) fused at the 3′ end to a sequence encoding a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin (HA) epitope under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The plasmid also contains a T7 promoter that allows it to drive in vitro transcription of cloned sequences (see below). For some experiments mutation of the HA β1-tubulin cDNA was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pGFP-CoD contains tubulin folding cofactor D cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U61233) fused to the 3′ end of green fluorescent protein. MG132 was purchased from Peptides International, Inc, Louisville, KY. Rat anti-TCP-1α (CCTα) monoclonal antibody was from StressGen Biotechnologies, Inc., Victoria, BC. Bovine brain tubulin was from Cytoskeleton Inc., Boulder, CO. TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system was from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibodies recognizing the N terminus of β-tubulin, the C terminus of tyrosinated α-tubulin, and green fluorescent protein were generous gifts from Dr. Don Cleveland, Dr. Jeanette Bulinski, and Dr. William Margolin, respectively. Growth and Derivation of Cell Lines—Cells were grown in α modification of minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cmd4 is a colcemid-resistant and temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant that was previously described (15Cabral F. Abraham I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Spontaneous revertants 6H2, 6H3, A5, and 5L1 were isolated from Cmd4 by selecting cells able to grow at the non-permissive temperature of 40.5 °C (20Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were labeled for 30 min with 20 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (mixture of methionine and cysteine, 1000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) in methionine-free minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and lysed with hot (100 °C) SDS dissociation buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Solubilized proteins were precipitated with 5 volumes of cold acetone, and the protein pellets were resolubilized in urea sample buffer and analyzed by two-dimensional gels as previously described (22Cabral F. Schatz G. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transfection, Immunofluorescence, and Proteasomal Inhibition Experiments—CHO 10001 cells (16Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were transfected with wild-type or mutant pRCHAβ1 using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The efficiency of cell-to-cell expression was monitored 24 h post-transfection using immunofluorescence. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with methanol at -20 °C, rehydrated with PBS, and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of a rabbit antibody specific for the HA tag (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) followed by a 1:50 dilution of Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). To inhibit proteasomal degradation of mutant tubulin, stably transfected cells were isolated in 2 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Cellgro Inc., Herndon, VA) and incubated with or without 25 μm MG132 for 8 h at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in hot (100 °C) SDS, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The transfected mutant tubulin was probed with anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science). Immunoreactive bands were detected using a 1:2000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Measurement of Assembled Tubulin—To measure the distribution of tubulin between nonassembled and polymerized pools, cells were grown to near confluence in 24-well dishes and lysed with microtubule buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2,2mm EGTA) containing 0.14 m NaCl and 4 μg/ml paclitaxel. Cell remnants scraped from the dish in this buffer were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and fractionated into soluble and sedimentable proteins by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and 4 °C as previously described (24Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tubulin was quantified by first adding an equal volume of an Escherichia coli SDS cell lysate containing a GST-α-tubulin fusion protein to each fraction, precipitating the proteins with acetone, and redissolving the precipitated proteins with SDS sample buffer (18Wang Y. Veeraraghavan S. Cabral F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8965-8973Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Proteins were then separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell). The tubulin in each fraction was detected using a monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin (1:2000 dilution of DM1A, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000 dilution, Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). Fluorescence images were acquired using a Storm image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences), and bands were quantified using NIH Image (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). α-Tubulin was normalized by dividing by the GST-α-tubulin in the same fraction, and the percent of tubulin that was polymerized was calculated using the equation %P = [(α/GSTα)P/(α/GSTα)P + S] × 100%, where P denotes the α-tubulin to GST-α-tubulin ratio in the pellet, and P + S denotes the sum of the ratios for pellet and supernatant fractions. DNA Sequencing—Revertant cells were grown to 80% confluence in 60-mm dishes, rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with K buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Tween 20), and digested at 55 °C with 2 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min. The proteinase K was then inactivated by heating to 100 °C for 10 min. This genomic DNA was utilized as a template to amplify different regions of the β1-tubulin gene using pairs of primers homologous to translated and untranslated sequences of the DNA. The PCR-amplified DNA was directly sequenced (DNA Sequencing Core Facility, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Measurement of Tubulin at Steady State—To measure α-tubulin levels, cells were grown to near confluence in 24-well dishes and lysed with 1% SDS. Solubilized proteins were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone, DNA was removed, and the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. Proteins in the pellet were resolubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. α-Tubulin and actin were detected by incubating the blot with mouse monoclonal antibodies DM1A (1:1000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) and C4 (1:50,000 dilution, Chemicon) followed by a Cy5-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (1:2000 dilution, Chemicon). Fluorescent images were acquired with a Storm Imager as described above. The α-tubulin in each sample was normalized by dividing by the actin signal and compared with wild-type cells set at 100%. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Near confluent 35-mm dishes of mutant cell lines 6H2 and 6H3 were lysed in 200 μl of microtubule buffer containing 0.14 m NaCl and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were loaded onto 10 ml of 5-40% glycerol gradients and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions were resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either a mouse anti-β-tubulin N-terminal antibody or a rat anti-TCP-1α antibody. Immunoprecipitation—To search for interactions of mutant β-tubulin with α-tubulin, cell lines 6H2 and 6H3, which produce mutant β-tubulins with a decreased apparent molecular mass, were lysed in microtubule buffer containing 0.14 m NaCl and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatants were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) prebound with rabbit antibody to tyrosinated α-tubulin, and the beads were centrifuged, washed with the same microtubule buffer and stripped with SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the N terminus of β-tubulin. To detect potential interactions between β-tubulin and cofactor D, 6H3 was transfected with pGFP-CoD, and wild type cells were cotransfected with pGFP-CoD and pRC/CMV containing wild-type or mutant (6H2, Y398C) HAβ1-tubulin cDNA. At 36 h post-transfection cell extracts were prepared as described above and incubated with protein G-Sepharose prebound with rabbit antibody to green fluorescent protein. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. For 6H3 the Western blot was probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the N terminus of β-tubulin; in the case of other cell lines, mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science) to the HA tag was used to distinguish transfected tubulin from the co-migrating endogenous tubulin. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Equal amounts of β1-tubulin cDNAs with or without mutations were transcribed and translated in vitro for 90 min in the presence of [35S]methionine using a TnT kit (Promega). The radiolabeled in vitro synthesized proteins were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of purified bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Boulder, CO (0.25 mg/ml, final concentration)) and analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (4Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A portion of each sample was also resolved by SDS-PAGE to demonstrate that all tubulins were efficiently synthesized in the TnT system. Reconstituted in Vitro Folding—Wild-type and mutant HAβ1-tubulin cDNAs were cloned into a pET28a+ bacterial expression vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI), and [35S]methionine labeled proteins were produced in E. coli BL21DE3 cells (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies containing the radiolabeled tubulin were purified and solubilized in 8 m urea as described previously (4Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 6Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These labeled target proteins were folded in vitro in reactions that contained purified CCT and one or more of the components required for reconstitution of the tubulin folding pathway (7Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Reaction products were resolved on 4.5% native polyacrylamide gels (4Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Mutations Affecting the Assembly and Stability of β-Tubulin—Vertebrates express 7 β-tubulin genes that encode closely related, but distinct tubulin proteins or isotypes (10Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Based on their C-terminal sequences, these isotypes have been categorized into classes (I, II, III, IVa, IVb, V, and VI), some of which are ubiquitously expressed, whereas others are tissue-specific (11Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). CHO cells express 3 of these isotypes (I, IVb, and V) in a ratio of 70:25:5 (27Sawada T. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ahmad S. Singh B. Gupta R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cmd4, a colcemid-resistant CHO cell line with increased sensitivity to paclitaxel and temperature sensitivity for growth (15Cabral F. Abraham I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), has a D45Y mutation in one copy of its class I β-tubulin gene such that 35% of its total β-tubulin is altered. Incorporation of this altered tubulin increases microtubule stability, leading to a higher fraction of cellular tubulin in the polymer pool and an increase in microtubule bundle formation (17Hari M. Wang Y. Veeraraghavan S. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 597-605PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous revertants of Cmd4 able to grow at the nonpermissive temperature coreverted to colcemid sensitivity at high frequency, showing that the two phenotypes are linked (20Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel analysis of extracts from four revertant cell lines that were pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine demonstrated that a mutant β-tubulin species was made in these cells and in Cmd4 (Fig. 1). Whereas wild-type cells exhibited a single spot comprising all of the expressed β-tubulin isotypes (Fig. 1A), Cmd4 produced a second, more basic β-tubulin consistent with its D45Y mutation (arrow, Fig. 1B). This mutant tubulin had undergone further alterations in revertants A5 (arrow, Fig. 1D), 6H2 (arrow, Fig. 1E), and 6H3 (arrow, Fig. 1F) as evidenced by the fact that the protein occupied a new position on the gel in each case. The identities of these new spots in the gel as mutant forms of β-tubulin were confirmed by peptide mapping (20Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Revertant 5L1 (arrow, Fig. 1C) produced a mutant tubulin that migrated with the same mobility as the mutant tubulin in Cmd4. Nevertheless, we suspected a second alteration in this tubulin because, like the other revertants, the protein spot was missing when the gels were stained for accumulated protein or radiolabeled to steady state (data not shown). Thus, unlike Cmd4, which produces a stable mutant protein, the mutant β-tubulin in each of the revertant cell lines is synthesized at a normal rate but is unstable and fails to accumulate to appreciable steady state levels. Pulse-chase experiments with strain 6H2 indicated that wild-type β-tubulin has a half-life of more than 50 h, consistent with previous estimates, but the mutant β1-tubulin has a half-life of only 1-2 h (20Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Spiegelman B.M. Penningroth S.M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1977; 12: 587-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of additional mutations, genomic DNA was sequenced; the results are summarized in Table 1. Consistent with the behavior of β-tubulin on two-dimensional gels, revertants were found to have the original D45Y mutation but also possessed an electrophoretically silent Y398C mutation (5L1), a basic L187R mutation (A5), an in-frame deletion of amino acids Thr-351—Lys-362 (6H2), or a C-terminal truncation of ∼120 amino acids (6H3 (see Ref. 30Boggs B.A. Minotti A.M.

Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To extend these observations to an in vivo context, we visually monitored incorporation of the mutant tubulins after their transient overexpression in cultured cells. In addition, we eliminated possible contributions from the original D45Y substitution to the assembly defect (see Table 1) by introducing the point mutations Y398C and L187R and the 12-amino acid deletion characteristic of revertants 5L1, A5, and 6H2 into a wild-type β1-tubulin cDNA using site-directed mutagenesis. The β1-tubulin cDNA also contained a 3′ sequence encoding a C-terminal HA tag so that the transfected tubulin could be easily distinguished from its endogenous wild-type counterpart. Immunofluorescence of cells transiently transfected with each of the cDNAs is shown in Fig. 2. Wild-type HAβ1-tubulin efficiently assembled into the microtubule cytoskeleton (Fig. 2A) and had a distribution identical to the endogenous tubulin (Fig. 2B). In contrast, all three of the mutant HAβ1-tubulins produced diffuse fluorescence with no evidence of incorporation into microtubules. We conclude that the secondary mutations alone are sufficient to preclude assembly of β-tubulin. Steady State Tubulin Levels Are Reduced in Revertant Cell Lines—The presence of assembly-defective and -unstable β-tubulin accounting for 35% of the total could produce at least two potential outcomes, a reduced steady state amount of tubulin in revertant cell lines or compensation for the loss of assembly-defective tubulin by increased expression of wild-type tubulin genes. Using a radiolabeling approach, we previously showed that α- and β-tubulin levels are diminished in revertant 6H2 commensurate with the loss of the assembly-defective β1-tubulin (20Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We confirmed these 6H2 results using an immunological approach to measure the relative α-tubulin content of the cells and found that all the revertant cell lines with unstable assembly-defective β1-tubulin display a similar 30-40% decrease in tubulin levels (Fig. 3A). The magnitude of this decrease is consistent with the expected 35% contribution of the mutant allele to β-tubulin production. We conclude that revertant CHO cells do not compensate for the loss of assembly-defective β1-tubulin by up-regulating the expression of other β-tubulin genes and that α-tubulin is correspondingly reduced to a level equivalent to that of the surviving β-tubulin. Endogenous Tubulin Assembly Is Unaffected by the Presence of Assembly-defective Mutant Proteins—Reduced tubulin levels in revertant cell lines suggest that they might contain less microtubule polymer than wild-type cells. To explore this issue, we measured the extent of tubulin assembly in each of the cell lines. We found that Cmd4 maintains a higher fraction of tubulin in the microtubule polymer compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 3B), consistent with an increased stability of microtubules that incorporate the mutant D45Y β-tubulin. Each of the revertant cell lines, however, has a normal (wild type) extent of microtubule assembly. The results are consistent with the rapid degradation of the mutant β1-tubulin in revertant cell lines, but they indicate that the reduced cellular tubulin content does not trigger any mechanism that increases tubulin assembly to re-establish wild-type levels of microtubule polymer. Thus, revertant cells proliferate normally with a 35% reduction in both soluble and polymerized tubulin. Assembly-defective Tubulin Fails to Form αβ Heterodimers—We considered two possibilities to account for the inability of mutant β1"
https://openalex.org/W2021039405,"Unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial DNA (CpG DNA) induce innate inflammatory responses, including rapid induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Although innate inflammatory responses induced by CpG DNA and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns are essential for the eradication of infectious microorganisms, excessive activation of innate immunity is detrimental to the host. In this study, we demonstrate that CpG DNA, but not control non-CpG DNA, induces a fulminant liver failure with subsequent shock-mediated death by promoting massive apoptotic death of hepatocytes in d-galactosamine (d-GalN)-sensitized mice. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore opening or caspase 9 activity in vivo protects d-GalN-sensitized mice from the CpG DNA-mediated liver injury and death. CpG DNA enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines in d-GalN-sensitized mice via a TLR9/MyD88-dependent pathway. In addition, CpG DNA failed to induce massive hepatocyte apoptosis and subsequent fulminant liver failure and death in d-GalN-sensitized mice that lack TLR9, MyD88, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, or TNF receptor I but not interleukin-6 or -12p40. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that CpG DNA induces a severe acute liver injury and shock-mediated death through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway-dependent death of hepatocytes caused by an enhanced production of TNF-α through a TLR9/MyD88 signaling pathway in d-GalN-sensitized mice.

In addition, CpG DNA failed to induce massive hepatocyte apoptosis and subsequent fulminant liver failure and death in d-GalN-sensitized mice that lack TLR9, MyD88, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, or TNF receptor I but not interleukin-6 or -12p40. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that CpG DNA induces a severe acute liver injury and shock-mediated death through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway-dependent death of hepatocytes caused by an enhanced production of TNF-α through a TLR9/MyD88 signaling pathway in d-GalN-sensitized mice. Innate immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), 3The abbreviations used are: DC, dendritic cells; d-GalN, d-galactosamine; TLR, toll-like receptor; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Z-LEHD-FMK, Z-Leu-Glu(OMe)-His-Asp(OMe)-CH2F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RT, reverse transcription; tBID, truncated Bid; CsA, cyclosporin A; PTP, permeability transition pores; H & E, hematoxylin and eosin; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor; KO, knock out; TNFRI, TNF receptor I; WT, wild type. play a critical role in modulating the host immune response to infection. The innate immune cells recognize conserved molecular patterns present in microbes (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) through a family of proteins known as toll-like receptors (TLRs) that function as pattern recognition receptors and are thereby activated to exert various effector functions, including secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and nitric oxide (1Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar). Production of inflammatory mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells is indispensable for the efficient control of growth and dissemination of invading pathogens. However, excessive and uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines caused by bacterial infection is potentially harmful to the host and may lead to severe systematic inflammatory complications, including microcirculatory dysfunction, tissue damage, septic shock, and death (2Danner R.L.

Vertebrate and bacterial DNA have marked differences in the frequency of CpG dinucleotides and their cytosine methylation (only vertebrate DNA shows extensive under-representation and methylation of CpG dinucleotides, termed CpG suppression) (6Razin A.

Unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in particular sequence contexts (CpG motifs, GACGTT for murine and GTCGTT for human) in bacterial DNA are capable of activating innate immune cells (7Krieg A.M.

The ability of bacterial DNA to activate innate immunity can be mimicked by synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing the unmethylated CpG motif. This unmethylated CpG motif containing bacterial DNA and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG DNA) are endocytosed and then recognized as a conserved molecular pattern by a pattern recognition receptor TLR9 in an endosomal compartment of antigen-presenting cells in the vertebrate innate immune system (8Ahmad-Nejad P.

Upon recognition of CpG DNA, TLR9 recruits the adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), through interaction between their C-terminal toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains. This recruitment of MyD88 to toll/IL-1 receptor domains of TLR9 initiates a signaling pathway that sequentially involves IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family proteins and tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 and TRAF3 (10Hemmi H.

The CpG DNA-mediated activation of innate immune cells and its beneficial effects on our immune system, as well as its therapeutic applications, have been extensively studied. However, its adverse effects because of uncontrolled proinflammatory response under certain conditions have not been extensively addressed. Moreover, direct and indirect biologic effects of CpG DNA on nonimmune cell activation and its detrimental effects on other organs in the body are largely unknown. Two different mouse models of the septic shock-like syndrome induced by CpG DNA or bacterial DNA have been established previously (26Cowdery J.S. Chace J.H. Yi A.-K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4570-4575PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sparwasser T. Miethke T. Lipford G. Erdmann A. Hacker H. Heeg K. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that pretreatment with CpG DNA or bacterial DNA dramatically potentiates the toxicity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by priming mice with IFN-γ, which leads to excessive release of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, that are critical in producing the sepsis-like syndrome and eventual death (26Cowdery J.S. Chace J.H. Yi A.-K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4570-4575PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Wagner and co-workers (27Sparwasser T. Miethke T. Lipford G. Erdmann A. Hacker H. Heeg K. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) elegantly demonstrate that CpG DNA or bacterial DNA induces septic shock-like death caused by TNF-α-mediated hepatic injury in mice sensitized with d-galactosamine (d-GalN). These two in vivo mouse models of the CpG DNA-mediated sepsis probably occur through different mechanisms and may represent different diseases. The CpG DNA/LPS model may more closely mimic the sepsis syndrome caused by overwhelming bacterial infections, whereas the CpG DNA/d-GalN model may represent the sepsis seen in certain genetically predisposed individuals or with fulminant hepatitis, such as viral hepatitis. The mechanisms by which CpG DNA induces shock-mediated death in these two different in vivo mouse models need to be elucidated, and a better understanding of how exaggerated proinflammatory responses caused by microbial components such as LPS and CpG DNA lead to organ damage and septic shock-mediated death in the host would provide information useful in preventing and treating septic shock and certain acute inflammatory liver diseases. In this study, we have investigated whether CpG DNA directly alters levels or activities of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in the livers of d-GalN-sensitized mice, and whether severe acute liver injury and the subsequent shock-mediated death of d-GalN-sensitized mice induced by CpG DNA are mediated through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway-dependent death of hepatocytes caused by an enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines through a TLR9/MyD88 signaling pathway. Mice—BALB/cAnNCr mice and C57BL/6NCr mice at 4-5 weeks of age were obtained from NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health, and were used within 3 weeks. TLR9 gene-deficient mice with a BALB/c background (TLR9KO) were provided by Dr. A. Marshak-Rothstein (Boston University, Boston) with permission from Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). MyD88 gene-deficient mice (MyD88KO) were provided by Dr. S.-C. Hong (Indiana University, Indianapolis) with permission from Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). C57BL/6-Tnfrsf1atm1Mak (TNFRI KO), B6;129S6-Tnf tm1Gkl (TNF KO), B6.129S2-Il6tm1Kopf/J (IL-6 KO), B6.129S1-Il12btm1Jm/J (IL-12p40 KO), and B6129SF2 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animal care and housing requirements set forth by the National Institutes of Health Committee on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources were followed, and animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Tennessee Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell Line and Culture Conditions—Mouse hepatocyte cell line NMH (provided by Dr. N. Fausto at the University of Washington) was cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml selenium, 0.04 μg/ml dexamethasone, 0.1% gentamicin, 10 mm nicotinamide, and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. RAW264.7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and Sigma. Oligodeoxynucleotides and Reagents—Nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) and Coley Pharmaceutical Group (Kanata, Ontario, Canada) and further purified by ethanol precipitation. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides had no detectable endotoxins by Limulus assay. The sequences of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides used are 5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′ (CpG DNA; 1826) and 5′-TCCAGGACTTCTCTCAGGTT-3′ (non-CpG DNA; 1982). LPS (Salmonella enterica serotype Minnesota Re 595) and d-GalN were purchased from Sigma. The purity of LPS was confirmed by its lack of ability to induce IL-6 production in macrophages isolated from LPS nonresponder C3H/HeJ mice. Experimental Protocol—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS (200 μl), CpG DNA (20 μg), control non-CpG DNA (20 μg), or LPS (10 μg) in the presence or absence of d-GalN (20 mg). The viability of mice was observed for the indicated time periods. In some experiments, mice were anesthetized at designated time periods after injection; blood samples were obtained to prepare serum. To investigate the role of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition, mice were injected intraperitoneally with ethanol (17% v/v in PBS, 100 μl) or cyclosporin A (CsA, 500 μg in 100 μl of 17% ethanol, Sigma) for 1 h before the CpG DNA/d-GalN challenge. In the experiment investigating the role of caspase 9, mice were injected intraperitoneally with Me2SO (5% v/v in PBS, 200 μl/injection) or a caspase 9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-fmk; Calbiochem) 1 h before, at the time of, and 1 h after the CpG DNA/d-GalN challenge. Each mouse received a total of 250 μg of Z-LEHD-fmk (100 μg/200 μl of 5% Me2SO/injection in the first two injections and 50 μg/100 μlof5%Me2SO/injection in the last injection). At the end of the designated time periods, mice were killed, and the livers were removed. Liver lobes were excised and then either fixed by submersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher) for histopathological analysis or kept at -80 °C for further analysis. In all experiments, 3-10 mice were used for each condition. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry—Liver specimens fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) for light microscopic examination. Preparation of Cytosolic Extract and Aspartate-specific Cysteine Protease (Caspase) Assays—Cytosolic extracts from liver tissue were prepared by Dounce homogenization in hypotonic extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and subsequently centrifuged (15 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C). The protein concentration of supernatant was adjusted to 1 mg/ml with extraction buffer and stored at -80 °C. Caspase 3/7, caspase 8, and caspase 9 activities in cytosolic extracts of liver tissue were measured using a Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega Co., Madison, WI) and modified protocol. Caspase-Glo assay kit contains a proluminescent-specific caspase substrate. After caspase cleavage of the proluminescent caspase substrate, a substrate for luciferase (aminoluciferin) is released; this results in the luciferase reaction and the production of luminescent signal. The signal generated is proportional to the amount of caspase activity present. To measure caspase 3/7, caspase 8, and caspase 9 activities in liver tissues, an equal volume of reagents containing proluminescent caspase 3/7 substrate (DEVD), caspase 8 substrate (LETD), or caspase 9 substrate (LEHD) and 10 μg/ml cytosolic protein were added to a white-walled 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The luminescence of each sample was measured in an Lmax microplate luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared from liver cells as described previously (13Yi A.-K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the presence of the uncleaved form of Bid and the cleaved forms of caspase 3 and actin, equal amounts (15 μg/lane) of whole cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on a 14% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, and then Western blots were performed using antibodies specific for the uncleaved form of Bid and the cleaved forms of caspase 3 or actin, as described previously (13Yi A.-K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was used as a loading control. Antibody specific for the cleaved caspase 3 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. (Beverly, MA). Antibodies specific for the uncleaved form of Bid and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Preparation of RNA-free DNA and DNA Fragmentation Analysis— RNA-free DNA was isolated from each liver sample by using DNAzol (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol. To detect DNA fragmentation, equal amounts (2 μg/lane) of DNA were subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma). Cytokine-specific Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)— Levels of selected cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12p40) in serum were analyzed by cytokine-specific ELISA as described previously (28Yi A.-K. Chace J.H. Cowdery J.S. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 558-564PubMed Google Scholar). All recombinant murine cytokines and antibodies specific for murine cytokines were purchased from Pharmingen. Preparation of DNA-free RNA and RT-PCR—DNA-free total RNA was isolated from mouse liver cells, MNH cells, and RAW264.7 cells by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. To measure the relative amount of selected gene transcripts, isolated RNA (1 μg from each sample) were reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primer using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen). One-tenth of the cDNA product was then amplified with gene-specific primers. Twenty to 40 cycles of PCR were conducted. PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized. The sequences of RT-PCR primers are listed in supplement 1. All RT-PCR primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Sequence-specific Induction of an Acute Liver Injury and Subsequent Shock-mediated Death by CpG DNA in d-GalN-sensitized Mice—Previous studies have demonstrated that the shock-mediated death in d-GalN-sensitized mice or rats by the TLR4 agonist LPS is because of acute liver injury, including hemorrhagic necrosis and massive apoptosis of liver cells (29Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Reutter W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 30Liu D. Li C. Chen Y. Burnett C. Liu X.Y. Downs S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J.

Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 734-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to LPS, bacterial DNA and CpG DNA induce shock-mediated death in d-GalN-sensitized mice (27Sparwasser T. Miethke T. Lipford G. Erdmann A. Hacker H. Heeg K. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which this induction occurs have not been extensively studied. We have investigated whether CpG DNA induces shock-mediated death in d-GalN-sensitized mice by causing an acute liver injury, including massive hemorrhage and liver cell death by apoptosis in a sequence-specific manner. BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, CpG DNA, d-GalN, CpG DNA plus d-GalN (CpG DNA/d-GalN), or control non-CpG DNA plus d-GalN (nCpG DNA/d-GalN). The survival of mice was observed for 24 h after the challenge, and liver injury was evaluated by histological examination. In agreement with previous observations (27Sparwasser T. Miethke T. Lipford G. Erdmann A. Hacker H. Heeg K. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we found that CpG DNA in the presence of d-GalN induced shock-mediated death of mice between 10 and 16 h after the challenge (Table 1). In addition, microscopic examination of the livers from CpG DNA/d-GalN-treated mice uniformly revealed signs of severe liver injury, including steatosis, massive hemorrhage, and massive apoptosis of hepatocytes characterized by shrinkage and hypereosinophilia of the cytoplasm, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation (Fig. 1d). However, sinusoidal lining cells, endothelium, and/or Kupffer cells were not affected. These signs of liver damage in mice were observed as early as 4 h post-treatment with CpG DNA/d-GalN, and the severity was dramatically increased at later time points (Fig. 1 and data not shown). In contrast, no evidence of hepatic injury was found in mice treated with PBS, CpG DNA alone, d-GalN alone, or control nCpG DNA/d-GalN (Fig. 1). Furthermore, no deaths occurred in mice that received d-GalN alone, CpG DNA alone, non-CpG DNA alone, or nCpG DNA/d-GalN (Table 1 and data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CpG DNA has the ability to induce a severe acute liver injury that may eventually lead to shock-mediated death in d-GalN-sensitized mice.TABLE 1CpG DNA, but not control non-CpG DNA, induces a shock-mediated death in d-GalN-sensitized mice BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, CpG DNA (20 μg), non-CpG DNA (20 μg), and/or d-GalN (20 mg). Viability of mice was observed 24 h after injection. Eight to 10 mice/group were used for the experiment.TreatmentDead/totalPBS0/10CpG DNA0/10d-GalN0/10CpG + d-GalN10/10Non-CpG + d-GalN0/8 Open table in a new tab CpG DNA, in a Sequence-specific Manner, Induces Activation of Initiator and Effector Caspases and DNA Fragmentation in Liver Cells of d-GalN-sensitized Mice—Because histological examination of livers from CpG DNA/d-GalN-treated mice showed all the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death, we have investigated whether CpG DNA induces activation of initiator caspases 8 and 9 and effector caspase 3 and fragmentation of DNA in liver cells of d-GalN-sensitized mice. BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, CpG DNA, d-GalN, CpG DNA/d-GalN, or control nCpG DNA/d-GalN. Activities of caspases 8 and 9 in liver cells were measured using a Caspase-Glo assay kit. Cleavage of Bid and the activation status of caspase 3 were assayed by observing the disappearance of full-length Bid and the presence of cleaved forms of caspase 3, respectively, in liver cell extracts by Western blot using an antibody specific for the uncleaved form of Bid or cleaved forms of caspase 3. As shown in Fig. 2, A-E, CpG DNA induced activation of initiator caspase 8, cleavage of Bid, and activation of caspase 9 and effector caspase 3 in liver cells of d-GalN-sensitized mice. Furthermore, CpG DNA in combination with d-GalN treatment substantially induced typical apoptotic DNA fragmentation in liver cells within 8 h after administration, indicating induction of massive hepatocyte apoptosis (Fig. 2, F and G). In contrast, control non-CpG DNA alone or in combination with d-GalN failed to induce activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9, Bid cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in liver cells (Fig. 2, A-C, E, and G, and data not shown). Neither CpG DNA nor d-GalN alone induced detectable levels of caspases 3, 8, and 9 activation, Bid cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in liver cells (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that CpG DNA, in a sequence-specific manner, induces the process of programmed cell death of hepatocytes by inducing activation of initiator and effector caspases and DNA fragmentation in liver cells of d-GalN-sensitized mice. The Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway Plays a Key Role in the CpG DNA-mediated Acute Liver Injury and Shock-mediated Death in d-GalN-sensitized Mice—Our results demonstrated that CpG DNA induces Bid cleavage in hepatocytes in d-GalN-sensitized mice (Fig. 2B). The truncated form of Bid, tBid, has been known to target mitochondria and cause the release of cytochrome c into cytoplasm, which in turn leads to the activation of caspase 9 and downstream cascades of apoptosis (32Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, we have investigated whether the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway plays a pivotal role in the CpG DNA-mediated hepatic injury and shock-mediated death in d-GalN-sensitized mice. We have employed CsA, which prevents activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pores (PTP) (35Soriano M.E. Nicolosi L. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36803-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle (17% ethanol) or CsA 1 h before the CpG DNA/d-GalN challenge. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4a and in Table 2, CpG DNA/d-GalN treatment in vehicle-pretreated mice caused the expected apoptosis of hepatocytes (assessed from Bid cleavage, caspases 9 and 3/7 activation, and DNA fragmentation), liver tissue damage, and shock-mediated death of the mice. CsA pretreatment did not prevent induction of Bid cleavage"

We described previously that the MyoD-inducible p204 protein is required for the differentiation of cultured murine C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts to myotubes. Here we report that p204 was also required for the differentiation of cultured P19 murine embryonal carcinoma stem cells to beating cardiac myocytes. As shown by others, this process can be triggered by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). We established that DMSO induced the formation of 204RNA and p204. Ectopic p204 could partially substitute for DMSO in inducing differentiation, whereas ectopic 204 antisense RNA inhibited the differentiation. Experiments with reporter constructs, including regulatory regions from the Ifi204 gene (encoding p204) in P19 cells and in cultured newborn rat cardiac myocytes, as well as chromatin coimmunoprecipitations with transcription factors, revealed that p204 expression was synergistically transactivated by the cardiac Gata4, Nkx2.5, and Tbx5 transcription factors. Furthermore, ectopic p204 triggered the expression of Gata4 and Nkx2.5 in P19 cells. p204 contains a nuclear export signal and was partially translocated to the cytoplasm during the differentiation. p204 from which the nuclear export signal was deleted was not translocated, and it did not induce differentiation. The various mechanisms by which p204 promoted the differentiation are reported in the accompanying article (Ding, B., Liu, C., Huang, Y., Yu, J., Kong, W., and Lengyel, P. (2006) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 281, 14893-14906)."
https://openalex.org/W1997674398,"Many sesquiterpene lactone compounds either induce or enhance the cell differentiation of human leukemia cells. However, we reported in a previous study that santonin, a eudesmanolide sesquiterpene lactone, exerts no effects on the differentiation of leukemia cells. In this report, to evaluate the possibility of chemically modifying santonin into its derivatives with differentiation inducing activity, we synthesized a series of santonin derivatives, and determined their effects on cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell system. A diacetoxy acetal derivative of santonin (DAAS) was found to induce significant HL-60 cell differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas santonin in its original form did not. The HL-60 cells were differentiated into a granulocytic lineage when exposed to DAAS. In addition, the observed induction in cell differentiation closely correlated with the levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity inhibited by DAAS. Both Western blot analyses and kinase inhibitor studies determined that protein kinase C, ERK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were upstream components of the DAAS-mediated inhibition of NF-κB binding activity in HL-60 leukemia cells. The results of this study indicate that santonin can, indeed, be chemically modified into a derivative with differentiation inducing abilities, and suggest that DAAS might prove useful in the treatment of neoplastic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2004574190,"What will emerge from using the Internet as a research tool? The answer, Vernor Vinge argues, will be limited only by our imaginations. This week's forward-looking science and computing special takes 2020 as the iconic future date. If the rate of progress in the computing industry is any guide, within 15 years nano-scale circuits will be a reality. And 2020 is now seen as possible for what was unimaginable until recently, the practical quantum computer. Another imminent revolution is ‘smart dust’: tiny sensors that monitor everything everywhere. Stephen Muggleton welcomes the data bonanza generated by automation, but argues that science is an essentially human activity and that progress brings its dangers. Hugo-award-winning novelist Vernor Vinge ponders a future we can barely imagine. Alexander Szalay and Jim Gray argue that we are nearing the limit of what one research group can achieve in data handling. Roger Brent and Jehoshuah Bruck ask what computer science can contribute to biological research and Ian Foster reviews the two-way relationship between science and computing."
