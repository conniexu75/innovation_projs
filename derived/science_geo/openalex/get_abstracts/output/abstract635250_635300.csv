https://openalex.org/W2949339202,"The human gut microbiome is linked to many states of human health and disease1. The metabolic repertoire of the gut microbiome is vast, but the health implications of these bacterial pathways are poorly understood. In this study, we identify a link between members of the genus Veillonella and exercise performance. We observed an increase in Veillonella relative abundance in marathon runners postmarathon and isolated a strain of Veillonella atypica from stool samples. Inoculation of this strain into mice significantly increased exhaustive treadmill run time. Veillonella utilize lactate as their sole carbon source, which prompted us to perform a shotgun metagenomic analysis in a cohort of elite athletes, finding that every gene in a major pathway metabolizing lactate to propionate is at higher relative abundance postexercise. Using 13C3-labeled lactate in mice, we demonstrate that serum lactate crosses the epithelial barrier into the lumen of the gut. We also show that intrarectal instillation of propionate is sufficient to reproduce the increased treadmill run time performance observed with V. atypica gavage. Taken together, these studies reveal that V. atypica improves run time via its metabolic conversion of exercise-induced lactate into propionate, thereby identifying a natural, microbiome-encoded enzymatic process that enhances athletic performance."
https://openalex.org/W2949495393,"The role of dysbiosis in food allergy (FA) remains unclear. We found that dysbiotic fecal microbiota in FA infants evolved compositionally over time and failed to protect against FA in mice. Infants and mice with FA had decreased IgA and increased IgE binding to fecal bacteria, indicative of a broader breakdown of oral tolerance than hitherto appreciated. Therapy with Clostridiales species impacted by dysbiosis, either as a consortium or as monotherapy with Subdoligranulum variabile, suppressed FA in mice as did a separate immunomodulatory Bacteroidales consortium. Bacteriotherapy induced expression by regulatory T (Treg) cells of the transcription factor ROR-γt in a MyD88-dependent manner, which was deficient in FA infants and mice and ineffectively induced by their microbiota. Deletion of Myd88 or Rorc in Treg cells abrogated protection by bacteriotherapy. Thus, commensals activate a MyD88/ROR-γt pathway in nascent Treg cells to protect against FA, while dysbiosis impairs this regulatory response to promote disease. Bacteriotherapy using gut-derived bacteria from healthy human infants, but not infants with food allergies, suppresses food allergy symptoms in mice via induction of Foxp3 + Rorγt + regulatory T cells"
https://openalex.org/W2952354682,"Relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the leading cause of death in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) entering HCT with poor-risk features1–3. When HCT does produce prolonged relapse-free survival, it commonly reflects graft-versus-leukemia effects mediated by donor T cells reactive with antigens on leukemic cells4. As graft T cells have not been selected for leukemia specificity and frequently recognize proteins expressed by many normal host tissues, graft-versus-leukemia effects are often accompanied by morbidity and mortality from graft-versus-host disease5. Thus, AML relapse risk might be more effectively reduced with T cells expressing receptors (TCRs) that target selected AML antigens6. We therefore isolated a high-affinity Wilms’ Tumor Antigen 1-specific TCR (TCRC4) from HLA-A2+ normal donor repertoires, inserted TCRC4 into Epstein–Bar virus-specific donor CD8+ T cells (TTCR-C4) to minimize graft-versus-host disease risk and enhance transferred T cell survival7,8, and infused these cells prophylactically post-HCT into 12 patients (NCT01640301). Relapse-free survival was 100% at a median of 44 months following infusion, while a concurrent comparative group of 88 patients with similar risk AML had 54% relapse-free survival (P = 0.002). TTCR-C4 maintained TCRC4 expression, persisted long-term and were polyfunctional. This strategy appears promising for preventing AML recurrence in individuals at increased risk of post-HCT relapse. Donor-derived, EBV-specific CD8+ T cells engineered to express a high-affinity WT1-specific TCR established persistent T cell responses that safely prevented post-HCT relapse in patients with high-risk AML."
https://openalex.org/W2952388834,"Tumour-derived microvesicles (TMVs) comprise a class of extracellular vesicles released from tumour cells that are now understood to facilitate communication between the tumour and the surrounding microenvironment. Despite their significance, the regulatory mechanisms governing the trafficking of bioactive cargos to TMVs at the cell surface remain poorly defined. Here we describe a molecular pathway for the delivery of microRNA (miRNA) cargo to nascent TMVs involving the dissociation of a pre-miRNA/Exportin-5 complex from Ran-GTP following nuclear export and its subsequent transfer to a cytoplasmic shuttle comprised of ARF6-GTP and GRP1. As such, ARF6 activation increases the pre-miRNA cargo contained within TMVs through a process that requires the casein kinase 2-mediated phosphorylation of RanGAP1. Furthermore, TMVs were found to contain pre-miRNA processing machinery including Dicer and Argonaute-2, which allow for cell-free pre-miRNA processing within shed vesicles. These findings offer cellular targets to block the loading and processing of pre-miRNAs within TMVs."
https://openalex.org/W2953681063,"Microscopic examination of peripheral blood plays an important role in the field of diagnosis and control of major diseases. Peripheral leukocyte recognition by manual requires medical technicians to observe blood smears through light microscopy, using their experience and expertise to discriminate and analyze different cells, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and subjective. The traditional systems based on feature engineering often need to ensure successful segmentation and then manually extract certain quantitative and qualitative features for recognition but still remaining a limitation of poor robustness. The classification pipeline based on convolutional neural network is of automatic feature extraction and free of segmentation but hard to deal with multiple object recognition. In this paper, we take leukocyte recognition as object detection task and apply two remarkable object detection approaches, Single Shot Multibox Detector and An Incremental Improvement Version of You Only Look Once. To improve recognition performance, some key factors involving these object detection approaches are explored and the detection models are generated using the train set of 14,700 annotated images. Finally, we evaluate these detection models on test sets consisting of 1,120 annotated images and 7,868 labeled single object images corresponding to 11 categories of peripheral leukocytes, respectively. A best mean average precision of 93.10% and mean accuracy of 90.09% are achieved while the inference time is 53 ms per image on a NVIDIA GTX1080Ti GPU."
https://openalex.org/W2953727095,"Seed germination is considered the beginning of the spermatophyte lifecycle, and it is a crucial stage in determining subsequent plant growth and development. Although many previous studies have found that melatonin can promote seed germination, the role of melatonin in cotton germination remains unexamined. The main objective of this study is the characterization of potential promotional effects of melatonin (at doses of 0, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 μM) on cotton seed germination. This experiment demonstrated that low concentrations of melatonin can promote germination, while high concentrations failed to promote germination and even inhibited germination. Together, these results indicate that a 20 μM melatonin treatment optimally promotes cotton seed germination. Compared with the control, germination potential (GP), germination rate (GR), and final fresh weight (FW) increased by 16.67%, 12.30%, and 4.81%, respectively. Although low concentrations of melatonin showed some improvement in vigor index (VI), germination index (GI), and mean germination time (MGT), these effects were not statistically significant. Antioxidant enzyme activity during seed germination was most prominent under the 20 μM melatonin treatment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities were significantly increased by 10.37-59.73% and 17.79-47.68%, respectively, compared to the melatonin-free control. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was reduced by 16.73-40.33%. Two important plant hormones in seed germination, abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs), were also studied. As melatonin concentration increased, ABA content in seeds decreased first and then increased, and GA3 content showed a diametrically opposite trend, in which the 20 μM melatonin treatment was optimal. The 20 μM melatonin treatment reduced ABA content in seeds by 42.13-51.68%, while the 20 μM melatonin treatment increased GA3 content in seeds to about 1.7-2.5 times that of seeds germinated without melatonin. This study provides new evidence suggesting that low concentrations of melatonin can promote cotton seed germination by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing the accumulation of MDA and regulating plant hormones. This has clear applications for improving the germination rate of cotton seeds using melatonin."
https://openalex.org/W2950047532,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for analysing the structure and function of molecules, and for performing three-dimensional imaging of their spin densities. At the heart of NMR spectrometers is the detection of electromagnetic radiation, in the form of a free induction decay signal1, generated by nuclei precessing around an applied magnetic field. Whereas conventional NMR requires signals from 1012 or more nuclei, recent advances in sensitive magnetometry2,3 have dramatically lowered the required number of nuclei to a level where a few or even individual nuclear spins can be detected4–6. It is unclear whether continuous detection of the free induction decay can still be applied at the single-spin level, or whether quantum back-action (the effect that a detector has on the measurement itself) modifies or suppresses the NMR response. Here we report the tracking of single nuclear spin precession using periodic weak measurements7–9. Our experimental system consists of nuclear spins in diamond that are weakly interacting with the electronic spin of a nearby nitrogen vacancy centre, acting as an optically readable meter qubit. We observe and minimize two important effects of quantum back-action: measurement-induced decoherence10 and frequency synchronization with the sampling clock11,12. We use periodic weak measurements to demonstrate sensitive, high-resolution NMR spectroscopy of multiple nuclear spins with a priori unknown frequencies. Our method may provide a useful route to single-molecule NMR13,14 at atomic resolution. Periodic weak measurements of just a few carbon-13 nuclear spins in diamond demonstrate sensitive, high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at the molecular level."

https://openalex.org/W2954801389,"Canine circovirus (CanineCV) was detected, together with canine parvovirus (CPV), in samples from an outbreak of fatal gastroenteritis in dogs in Argentina. We obtained the full-length genome of this recently discovered virus by overlapping PCR, designated strain UBA-Baires. Sequence analysis revealed a highly conserved genome but also showed several unique mutations in amino acids from the capsid protein that have not been previously reported. Phylogenetic analysis shows that this strain is more closely related to European strains than to viruses detected in North America or Asia. Although the pathogenic role of CanineCV in dogs is still unclear, this study highlights the importance of CanineCV as a coinfecting virus in disease development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the involvement of CanineCV in severe clinical disease in dogs in South America. Our results expand our information on the geographical extent of this virus and contribute to the understanding of its role in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2955432327,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-9 has been reported to regulate energy balance in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying BMP9-mediated regulation of energy balance remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of BMP9 in energy metabolism. In the current study, we found that hepatic BMP9 expression was down-regulated in insulin resistance (IR) mice and in patients who are diabetic. In mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), the overexpression of hepatic BMP9 improved glucose tolerance and IR. The expression of gluconeogenic genes was down-regulated, whereas the level of insulin signaling molecule phosphorylation was increased in the livers of Adenovirus-BMP9-treated mice and glucosamine-treated hepatocytes. Furthermore, BMP9 overexpression ameliorated triglyceride accumulation and inhibited the expression of lipogenic genes in both human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells treated with a fatty acid mixture as well as the livers of HFD-fed mice. In hepatocytes isolated from sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c knockout mice, the effects of BMP9 were ablated. Mechanistically, BMP9 inhibited SREBP-1c expression through the inhibition of liver X receptor response element 1 activity in the SREBP-1c promoter. Taken together, our results show that BMP9 is an important regulator of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism.—Yang, M., Liang, Z., Yang, M., Jia, Y., Yang, G., He, Y., Li, X., Gu, H.

https://openalex.org/W2955818467,"Background Neuropathology has demonstrated a high rate of comorbid pathology in dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (ADD). The most common major comorbidity is Lewy body disease (LBD), either as dementia with Lewy bodies (AD-DLB) or Alzheimer’s disease with Lewy bodies (AD-LB), the latter representing subjects with ADD and LBD not meeting neuropathological distribution and density thresholds for DLB. Although it has been established that ADD subjects with undifferentiated LBD have a more rapid cognitive decline than those with ADD alone, it is still unknown whether AD-LB subjects, who represent the majority of LBD and approximately one-third of all those with ADD, have a different clinical course. Methods Subjects with dementia included those with “pure” ADD (n = 137), AD-DLB (n = 64) and AD-LB (n = 114), all with two or more complete Mini Mental State Examinations (MMSE) and a full neuropathological examination. Results Linear mixed models assessing MMSE change showed that the AD-LB group had significantly greater decline compared to the ADD group (β = -0.69, 95% CI: -1.05, -0.33, p<0.001) while the AD-DLB group did not (β = -0.30, 95% CI: -0.73, 0.14, p = 0.18). Of those with AD-DLB and AD-LB, only 66% and 2.1%, respectively, had been diagnosed with LBD at any point during their clinical course. Compared with clinically-diagnosed AD-DLB subjects, those that were clinically undetected had significantly lower prevalences of parkinsonism (p = 0.046), visual hallucinations (p = 0.0008) and dream enactment behavior (0.013). Conclusions The probable cause of LBD clinical detection failure is the lack of a sufficient set of characteristic core clinical features. Core DLB clinical features were not more common in AD-LB as compared to ADD. Clinical identification of ADD with LBD would allow stratified analyses of ADD clinical trials, potentially improving the probability of trial success."
https://openalex.org/W2955686027,"Artificial insemination with cryopreserved spermatozoa is a major assisted reproductive technology in many species. In horses, as in humans, insemination with cryopreserved sperm is associated with lower pregnancy rates than those for fresh sperm, however, direct effects of sperm cryopreservation on the development of resulting embryos are largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in gene expression between embryos resulting from fertilization with fresh or cryopreserved sperm. Embryos were obtained at 8, 10 or 12 days after ovulation from mares inseminated post-ovulation on successive cycles with either fresh sperm or frozen-thawed sperm from the same stallion, providing matched embryo pairs at each day. RNA was isolated from two matched pairs (4 embryos) for each day, and cDNA libraries were built and sequenced. Significant differences in transcripts per kilobase million (TPM) were determined using (i) genes for which the expression difference between treatments was higher than 99% of that in the random case (P < 0.01), and (ii) genes for which the fold change was ≥ 2, to avoid expression bias in selection of the candidate genes. Molecular pathways were explored using the DAVID webserver, followed by network analyses using STRING, with a threshold of 0.700 for positive interactions. The transcriptional profile of embryos obtained with frozen-thawed sperm differed significantly from that for embryos derived from fresh sperm on all days, showing significant down-regulation of genes involved in biological pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, DNA binding, DNA replication, and immune response. Many genes with reduced expression were orthologs of genes known to be embryonic lethal in mice. This study, for the first time, provides evidence of altered transcription in embryos resulting from fertilization with cryopreserved spermatozoa in any species. As sperm cryopreservation is commonly used in many species, including human, the effect of this intervention on expression of developmentally important genes in resulting embryos warrants attention."
https://openalex.org/W2953866751,"Background Hypertension contributes significantly to cardiovascular and renal diseases. It can be controlled by lifestyle modifications, however in poor communities there is lack of awareness, and treatment and control of hypertension is often poor. The aim of this study was to determine hypertension knowledge, attitudes and practices in a disadvantaged rural community in Matebeleland South province of Zimbabwe. Methods We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional survey on hypertensive patients in the community. A pre-tested and validated interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect demographic, awareness, treatment and control data among consenting hypertensive patients. Results 304 respondents were enrolled into the study (mean age, 59 years), and a majority were women (65.4%). The treatment default rate was 30.9%, and 25% of respondents on medication did not know their blood pressure control status. Knowledge on hypertension was poor, with 64.8% of respondents stating that stress was its main cause, 85.9% stated that palpitations were a symptom of hypertension and 59.8% of respondents added salt on the table. The more education respondents had received, the more likely they were knowledgeable about hypertension (odds ratio for secondary education, 3.68 [95% CI: 1.61–8.41], and for tertiary education, 7.52 [95% CI: 2.76–20.46], compared to those without formal education). Those who believed in herbal medicines (50.7%) and those who used traditional medicines (14.5%) were 53% (95% CI: 0.29–0.76) and 68% (95% CI: 0.29–0.76) less likely to be knowledgeable about hypertension compared to those who did not believe in or use traditional medicines, respectively. Conclusion Members of the community had poor knowledge on hypertension. This was associated with a lack of education and with strong beliefs in herbal and traditional medicines in the community, which influenced attitudes and practices on hypertension. Dietary risk factors were linked to poor knowledge. Hypertensive medicine shortages at the clinic resulted in worsened hypertension care and poor hypertension outcomes in the community."
https://openalex.org/W2954723069,"Preterm birth incidence has risen globally and remains a major cause of neonatal mortality despite improved survival. Demand and cost of initial hospitalization has also increased. This study assessed the cost of preterm birth during initial hospitalization from care provider perspective in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) of two hospitals in the state of Kedah, Malaysia. It utilized universal sampling and prospectively followed up preterm infants till discharge. Care provider cost was assessed using mixed method of top down approach and activity based costing. A total of 112 preterm infants were recruited from intensive care (93 infants) and minimal care (19 infants) units. Majority were from the moderate (23%) and late (36%) preterm groups followed by very preterm (32%) and extreme preterm (9%). Median cost per infant increased with level of care and degree of prematurity. Cost was dominated by overhead (fixed) costs for general (hospital), intermediate (clinical support services) and final (NICU) cost centers where it constituted at least three quarters of admission cost per infant while the remainder was consumables (variable) cost. Breakdown of overhead cost showed NICU specific overhead contributing at least two thirds of admission cost per infant. Personnel salary made up three quarters of NICU specific overhead. Laboratory investigation was the cost driver for consumables. Gender, birth weight and length of stay were significant factors and cost prediction was developed with these variables. This study demonstrated the inverse relation between resource utilization, cost and prematurity and identified personnel salary as the cost driver. Cost estimates and prediction provide in-depth understanding of provider cost and are applicable for further economic evaluations. Since gender is non-modifiable and reducing LOS alone is not effective, birth weight as a cost predictive factor in this study can be addressed through measures to prevent or delay preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W2955445032,"Interstitial cystitis and/or bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) are characterized by discomfort, abdominal pain, and pelvic pain, and they are often associated with chronic diseases. Pathological conditions related to IC/BPS can occur due to a defect in the integrity of the bladder lining. This defect has been ascribed to damage to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer of the urinary epithelium. In addition, the incipient cascade of inflammation events might prompt extracellular matrix degradation. Several medical devices based on GAG instillation were proposed to re-establish epithelial integrity by GAGs binding to proteoglycans or interacting with structural urothelium. However, to date, only in vitro studies have investigated the GAG, hyaluronic acid (HA). In the present study, TNFα treatment was used to mimic IC/BPS-induced damage in bladder cells in an in vitro model. Highly purified fermentative HA and pharmaceutical grade bovine chondroitin sulfate (CSb), alone or in combination, were evaluated for the ability to counteract bladder cell damage. We evaluated NF-κB with western blots, and we analyzed interleukin 6 and 8 expression at the transcriptional and protein levels with quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and ELISA. We also evaluated the expression of an antibacterial peptide, human β-defensin-2. We confirmed our results in a 3D bladder epithelium model. Our results demonstrated that inflammatory status was reduced in the presence of HA, CSb, and the combination of both (HA/CSb 1.6%/2% w/v). This result suggested that these GAGs might be suitable for treating IC/BPS. All the assayed biomarkers showed that HA/CSb treatment modulated cells towards a more physiological status. Finally, we compared two commercial products suggested for the IC/BPS treatments and found that the product with more Ca++, showed enhanced anti-inflammatory activity and provided superior mucoadhesivity."
https://openalex.org/W2955517788,"The toxicity of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and cadmium (Cd) to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was characterised under single metal and mixture scenarios at different organisational levels. The effects on population size and body length were investigated at two concentrations corresponding to the 24 h LC5 and LC20 levels. Metal toxicity was dependent on metal concentration, exposure time and mixture composition. Populations exposed to LC20 levels of Cd, ZnCu, CuCd and ZnCuCd plummeted, while for all LC5 concentrations, population size continued to increase, albeit that single metals were less harmful than mixtures. Combinations of the LC20 concentration of Cd with a range of Zn concentrations showed concentration dependent mitigating effects on population size and antagonistic effects on mortality. By combining effects at different organisational levels, more insight into metal toxicity was obtained. Metal effects were more evident on population size than on body length or mortality, suggesting that population size could be considered as a sensitive endpoint. Furthermore, our observations of ZnCd mixture effects at the individual and population levels are consistent with literature data on the dose-dependent expression of the cdf-2 gene, which is involved in mediation of Zn and Cd toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2955814037,"Autoantigens are the molecular targets in autoimmune diseases. They are a cohort of seemingly unrelated self-molecules present in different parts of the body, yet they can trigger a similar chain of autoimmune responses such as autoantibody production. We previously reported that dermatan sulfate (DS) can bind self-molecules of dying cells to stimulate autoreactive CD5+ B cells to produce autoantibodies. The formation of autoantigen-DS complexes converts the normally non-antigenic self-molecules to none-self antigens, and thus DS-affinity represents a common underlying biochemical property for autoantigens. This study sought to apply this property to identify potential autoantigens in the kidney. Total proteins were extracted from mouse kidney tissues and loaded onto DS-Sepharose resins. Proteins without affinity were washed off the resins, whereas those with increasing DS-affinity were eluted with step gradients of increasing salt strength. Fractions with strong and moderate DS-affinity were sequenced by mass spectrometry and yielded 25 and 99 proteins, respectively. An extensive literature search was conducted to validate whether these had been previously reported as autoantigens. Of the 124 proteins, 79 were reported autoantigens, and 19 out of 25 of the strong-DS-binding ones were well-known autoantigens. Moreover, these proteins largely fell into the two most common autoantibody categories in autoimmune kidney diseases, including 40 ANA (anti-nuclear autoantibodies) and 25 GBM (glomerular basement membrane) autoantigens. In summary, this study compiles a large repertoire of potential autoantigens for autoimmune kidney diseases. This autoantigen-ome sheds light on the molecular etiology of autoimmunity and further supports our hypothesis DS-autoantigen complexes as a unifying principle of autoantigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2953653667,"Background In some patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer, even if they had substantial of radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake, the RAI therapy response was poor. We investigated the usefulness of FDG PET/CT for the early prediction of RAI therapy response in the patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Methods The 54 metastatic DTC patients who underwent both RAI therapy scan and FDG PET/CT at the same period were enrolled in the study. Clinical information and several parameters from RAI therapy scan and FDG PET/CT were investigated. Therapeutic response of RAI was assessed as two categories: response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR). Results Twenty-two patients (41%) had therapeutic response to RAI therapy, whereas 32 (59%) patients did not. There were no significant differences in age, sex, stage, histology, metastasis site, stimulated Tg or Tg-Ab, therapeutic doses, and even RAI uptake pattern among two groups. However, there was a significant negative correlation between FDG avidity of metastatic lesions and RR (OR = 0.233; p = 0.016). Although the patient group with only RAI uptake showed a significant correlation with RR (OR = 5.833; p = 0.01), the patient group with both RAI and FDG uptake did not show any significant correlation with RR. In the subgroup analysis, uptake grades of RAI or FDG was well correlated with DCR. Conclusions The patient group with FDG uptake in metastatic DTC showed poor response to RAI therapy regardless of the degree of RAI uptake. Therefore, FDG PET/CT may help us identify the patients with radioiodine refractory DTC and establish an appropriate treatment strategy in the early period."

In particular, differentially expressed genes and related to development of follicle (mRNAs) play an important role to explore the key genes in this process; however, the expression profiles of these genes remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was used to investigate the expression levels of duck ovarian genes, and comparative transcriptional analysis was carried out to identify differential genes, and cluster them into groups and function identification. The results showed differential expression of 593 coding genes between young and laying ducks, and of 518 coding genes between laying and old ducks.

https://openalex.org/W2954191020,"Background Perfusion-related complications remain the most common concern in DIEP flap breast reconstruction. Indocyanine green-based fluorescence angiography can be used for the real-time intra operative assessment of flap perfusion. The SPY Elite system is the most widely used device in this setting. The main objective was to describe the use of SPY-Q proprietary software to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of flap perfusion. Methods This retrospective cohort study was performed at the Curie Institute between 2013 and 2017. We included patients undergoing unilateral DIEP flap breast reconstruction for whom indocyanine green-based angiography videos were of sufficient quality for analysis. Videos were recorded with the SPY Elite System and analyzed with SPY-Q proprietary software. Results We included 40 patients. We used real-time dynamic color analysis to describe three different patterns of flap perfusion. SPY-Q proprietary software provides quantitative flap perfusion parameters. Our quantitative analysis confirmed that zone I is the best perfused part of the flap and zone IV the less perfused one. There was no significant association between flap perfusion pattern and perforator anatomy, patients’ clinical characteristics or postoperative outcomes. After exploratory univariate analysis, quantitative perfusion parameters were significantly impaired in young patients with diabetes mellitus or under hormone therapy by tamoxifen. Conclusions We here describe a new approach to assess DIEP flap perfusion using the SPY Elite System proprietary software. It provides interesting qualitative and quantitative analysis that can be used in further studies to precisely assess DIEP flap perfusion."

https://openalex.org/W2954988597,"Background and objective Early detection methods for pancreatic cancer are lacking. We aimed to develop a prediction model for pancreatic cancer based on changes in health captured by healthcare claims data. Methods We conducted a case-control study on 29,646 Medicare-enrolled patients aged 68 years and above with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reported to the Surveillance Epidemiology an End Results (SEER) tumor registries program in 2004–2011 and 88,938 age and sex-matched controls. We developed a prediction model using multivariable logistic regression on Medicare claims for 16 risk factors and pre-diagnostic symptoms of PDAC present within 15 months prior to PDAC diagnosis. Claims within 3 months of PDAC diagnosis were excluded in sensitivity analyses. We evaluated the discriminatory power of the model with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and performed cross-validation by bootstrapping. Results The prediction model on all cases and controls reached AUC of 0.68. Excluding the final 3 months of claims lowered the AUC to 0.58. Among new-onset diabetes patients, the prediction model reached AUC of 0.73, which decreased to 0.63 when claims from the final 3 months were excluded. Performance measures of the prediction models was confirmed by internal validation using the bootstrap method. Conclusion Models based on healthcare claims for clinical risk factors, symptoms and signs of pancreatic cancer are limited in classifying those who go on to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and those who do not, especially when excluding claims that immediately precede the diagnosis of PDAC."

https://openalex.org/W2954039176,"Background Human papillomaviruses are the most important causative agents for invasive cervical cancer development. HPV type-specific vaccination and HPV cervical cancer screening methods are being widely recommended to control the disease but the epidemiology of the circulating HPV types may vary locally. The circulating HPV-strains have never been assessed in Burundi. This study determined the prevalence and genotype-specific distribution of HPV in four different strata in Burundi: HIV-infected or non-infected and women living in rural or urban areas. Implications for HPV diagnosis and vaccine implementation was discussed. Methods Four cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Burundi (2013 in a rural area and 2016 in urban area) among HIV-infected and uninfected women living in rural and urban areas. Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC) and HPV genotyping were performed and risk factors for HPV infection and cervical pre-cancer lesions were determined using logistic regression model. Results HPV prevalence was very high in urban area with significant differences between HIV-positive and negative women (p<0.0001). In fact, 45.7% of HIV-positive participants were infected with any HPV type and all were infected with at least one HR/pHR-HPV type. Among the HIV-negative participants, 13.4% were HPV-infected, of whom, only four women (2.7%) were infected with HR/pHR-HPV types. In rural area, HPV infection did not significantly differ between HIV-positive and negative women (30.0% and 31.3% respectively; p = 0.80). In urban area, multiple infections with HR/pHR-HPV types were detected in 13.9% and 2.7% among HIV-positive and negative women respectively (p<0.0001), whereas in rural area, multiple infections with HR/pHR-HPV types were detected in 4.7% and 3.3% of HIV-positive and negative women respectively (p = 0.56). The most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types in HIV-positive women living in urban area were HPV 52, 51, 56, 18 and 16 types. In HIV-negative women living in urban area, the most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types were HPV 66, 67, 18, 45 and 39 types. In HIV-positive women living in rural area, the most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types were HPV 66, 16, 18 and 33 types. In HIV-negative women living in rural area, the most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types were HPV 16, 66, 18, 35 and 45 types. Independent risk factors associated with cervical lesions were HPV and HIV infections. Conclusions There is a high burden of HR and pHR-HPV infections, in particular among HIV-infected women living in urban area. The study points out the need to introduce a comprehensive cervical cancer control programme adapted to the context. This study shows that the nonavalent vaccine covers most of the HR/pHR-HPV infections in rural and urban areas among HIV-infected and uninfected women."
https://openalex.org/W2955010638,"Nepal has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the South Asia region, partly due to the underutilization of maternal health services and the high number of adolescent pregnancies. This study explores married Nepali adolescent girls' healthcare-seeking behaviour throughout their pregnancies, during their delivery and postpartum.We conducted a prospective qualitative study in Banke district, Nepal. In-depth interviews were conducted with 27 married adolescent girls before and after delivery. In addition, a focus group discussion was conducted with community health works and key-informant interviews were conducted with family members of adolescent girls, representatives from the government and health care providers. We applied the Social-Ecological Model (SEM) as a framework to guide thematic content analysis and presentation of our qualitative data.Several factors in the SEM influenced maternal health care-seeking behaviour of adolescents. At the individual level, girls' perceptions, their lack of knowledge about maternal and reproductive health, certain traditional practices, their sole dependency on their husbands and mothers-in-laws and their low decision-making autonomy towards their own health care negatively influenced their utilization of skilled maternal health services. Mothers-in-law and other family members played a critical role in either encouraging or discouraging the use of skilled maternal health services. At the health systems level, lack of adolescent-friendly maternal health services, difficulties in accessing quality maternal health services, and the fixed operating hours of public health facilities restricted their ability to obtain services. The existence of the Safe Motherhood Programme, knowledge sharing platforms such as ""women's groups"" and the active role of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) positively influenced utilization of skilled maternal health services among these girls.Influences on married adolescent girls' use of skilled maternal health services in Banke District, Nepal were multi-factoral. Ensuring easy access and availability of adolescent-friendly maternal health services are important to encourage adolescent girls to use skilled maternal health services. Moreover, interventions are needed to improve adolescent girls' knowledge of maternal health, keep them in school, involve family members (mainly mothers-in-law) in health interventions, as well as overcome negative traditional beliefs within the community that discourage care-seeking for skilled maternal health services."
https://openalex.org/W2955675687,"The association of Alzheimer disease (AD) and Diabetes (DM) is less clear. Accumulation of beta amyloid (Aβ) and presence of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) are hallmarks of AD, spreading in the region where insulin receptors are also found. Aβ exerts neuron toxicity, and could disturb insulin signaling of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but increase IRS-1-Ser307 phosphorylation which is viewed as insulin resistance marker. Previously we reported dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) mediate insulin resistance signals, and Abelmoschus esculentus (AE) subfractions F1 (rich in quercetin glucosides and triterpene ester) and F2 (containing large amount of polysaccharides) attenuate DPP-4-mediated apoptosis. In the present study, we aim to investigate if Aβ induce neuron death by regulating DPP-4 and insulin resistance signals, and the putative effect of F1 and F2. By MTT, microscopy, and Western blotting, we demonstrate treatment of appropriate doses of AE subfractions prevent Aβ-induced neuron apoptosis. F1 attenuate Aβ-induced caspase 3 expression especially at 25 μg/mL, while F2 attenuate caspase 3 activation even at the low dose of 1 μg/mL. Both AE subfractions decrease Aβ-enhanced DPP-4, but increase Aβ-reduced p-AMPK and p-PI3K. The activity analysis reveals that F2 is more valid than F1 to reduce DPP-4 activity. The inhibition of DPP-4 demonstrates it plays the pivotal role in Aβ-induced neuron apoptosis. Moreover, although both F1 and F2 are effective to inhibit p-IRS-1-Ser307, F2 takes advantage to reduce p-Tau while F1 is superior to enhance p-GSK-3β. This implies AE subfractions act on different targets, and could be developed respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate AE is potential to prevent Aβ-induced neuron damage by regulating DPP-4 and the insulin resistance cascades. AE could be an adjuvant to protect neuron degenerative disease related to Aβ and insulin resistance."

To identify miRNA dysregulation in SLE, we used miR2Disease and PhenomiR for information about miRNAs exhibiting differential regulation in disease and other biological processes, and HMDD for information about experimentally supported human miRNA–disease association data from genetics, epigenetics, circulating miRNAs, and miRNA–target interactions. This information was incorporated into the miRNA analysis. High-throughput sequencing revealed circulating miRNAs associated with kidney damage in patients with SLE. As the main finding of our in silico analysis of miRNAs differentially expressed in SLE and their interactions with disease-susceptibility genes, post-translational modifications, and transcription factors; we highlight 226 miRNAs associated with genes and processes. Moreover, we highlight that alterations of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, and hsa-miR-324-3p are most commonly associated with post-translational modifications. In addition, altered miRNAs that are most frequently associated with susceptibility-related genes are hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-374a-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-31-5p, and hsa-miR-1-3p."
https://openalex.org/W2955998133,"Climate change and the rising food demand provide a need for smart crops that yield more biomass. Recently, two Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with enhanced growth characteristics, VP16-02-003 and the VP16-05-014, were obtained by genome-wide reprogramming of gene expression, which led to the identification of novel biomarkers of these enhanced growth phenotypes. Since the circadian cycle strongly influences metabolic and physiological processes and exerts control over the photosynthetic machinery responsible for enhanced growth, in this study, we investigate the influences of the circadian clock on the metabolic rhythm of eighteen key biomarkers for the larger rosette surface area phenotype. The metabolic profile was studied in intact leaves at seven different time points throughout the circadian cycle using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR. The results show that the circadian rhythm of biomarker metabolites are remarkably robust across wild-type Col-0 and VP16-02-003 and the VP16-05-014 mutants, with widely different metabolite levels of both mutants compared to Col-0 throughout the circadian cycle. Our analysis reveals that robustness is achieved through functional independence between the circadian clock and primary metabolic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2953467816,"Somatostatin analogues (SSA) represent the standard of care for symptom control in patients with functional gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET). In addition, SSA exert significant anti-proliferative effects in mid-gut and pancreatic NET (PanNET). In parallel, molecularly targeted therapies (MTT) have been shown to improve progression free survival (PFS) in patients with PanNET. However, due to either primary or acquired resistance to MTT, their impact on overall survival (OS) remains unclear. To date, various hypotheses exist to explain differences in patient responsiveness to SSA and MTT. However, data addressing one of the most pivotal questions, whether combining SSA with novel MTT will result in synergistic or additive efficacy compared to monotherapy, are lacking. The aim of this study is to characterize the interaction, optimal sequence and dosing of SSA-based and molecularly targeted therapies in PanNET. Somatostatin receptor subtypes 1–5 (SSTR) were evaluated in the neuroendocrine cell lines Bon1, QGP1 and Ins-1 via immunoblot and qRT-PCR. The impact of the SSA-analogue lanreotide alone or in combination with the MTT sunitinib, everolimus and regorafenib on intracellular signalling, hormone secretion and cell proliferation was determined in cell lysates and supernatants. In addition, synergistic effects of SSA and MTT in various sequential therapeutic approaches were investigated. SSTR were differently expressed in the examined neuroendocrine tumor cell lines. SSTR modulation via lanreotide moderately influenced proliferation, mainly via modulating AKT and ERK signalling, which was paralleled by decreased chromogranin A (CgA) expression and secretion. Interestingly, MTT treatment with regorafenib upregulated the expression of SSTR-2 and -5, while sunitinib and everolimus did not significantly alter SSTR expression. Cell viability was significantly reduced by all MTT, with regorafenib exerting the most significant effects. However, compared to the marked effects of MTT alone, synergistic effects of combined MTT and lanreotide treatment were only modest and time- and dose-dependent. SSTR are differentially expressed in various NEN cell lines. Their expression is influenced by MTT treatment. Various sequential or simultaneous combinations of lanreotide and MTT did not lead to significant synergistic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2954058077,"Background Behçet’s disease (BD) is a recurrent, multisystemic, inflammatory disorder that mainly affects blood vessels. Because recurrent inflammation of blood vessels in the brain plays a crucial role in the development of ischemic stroke, we hypothesized that patients with BD might have an elevated risk of ischemic stroke. This potential association has been suggested in a few case reports, but not epidemiological studies. Hence, the present study aimed to examine the relation between BD and subsequent ischemic stroke in Taiwan using a nationwide, population-based database. Methods To establish a study cohort, the longitudinal data of 306 patients newly diagnosed with BD during 2000–2010 were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan. For comparison of ischemic stroke incidence, a control cohort of 1224 subjects without BD was established using a frequency-matched ratio of 1:4 for age, sex, and pre-existing comorbidities. Results During the 10-year follow-up, 13 (4.2%) patients with BD and 20 (1.6%) control subjects experienced ischemic stroke. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed the higher prevalence of ischemic stroke in the BD group (log-rank test, p = 0.001). After adjusting for comorbidities and demographic characteristics, Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with BD had a 2.77-fold risk of ischemic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.57) compared to control subjects. Conclusions Patients with BD have an elevated risk of ischemic stroke. Hence, BD may affect the vascular system in the brain, resulting in a stroke event."

PSPTO_0820 is a predicted multidrug transporter from the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Orthologs of this protein are conserved within many Pseudomonas species that interact with plants. To study the potential role of PSPTO_0820 in plant-bacteria interaction, a mutant in this gene was isolated and characterized. In addition, with the aim to find the outer membrane channel for this efflux system, a mutant in PSPTO_4977, a TolC-like gene, was also analyzed. Both mutants were more susceptible to trans-cinnamic and chlorogenic acids and to the flavonoid (+)-catechin, when added to the culture medium. The expression level of both genes increased in the presence of (+)-catechin and, in the case of PSPTO_0820, also in response to trans-cinnamic acid. PSPTO_0820 and PSPTO_4977 mutants were unable to colonize tomato at high population levels. This work evidences the involvement of these two proteins in the resistance to plant antimicrobials, supporting also the importance of chlorogenic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, and (+)-catechin in the tomato plant defense response against P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 infection."

This study evaluates the impact of a multi-pronged adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) strategy implemented by government of Zimbabwe between 2010 and 2015 to improve ASRH in terms of the uptake of condoms and HIV testing as well as outcomes in terms of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence and HIV prevalence. We combine the difference in difference and propensity score matching methods to analyse repeated Zimbabwe demographic health survey cross-sectional datasets. Young people aged 15-19 years at baseline in 2010, who were exposed for the entire five-year strategy are designated as the treatment group and young adults aged 25-29 at baseline as the control. We find that the ASRH strategy increased HIV testing amongst youth by 36.6 percent, whilst treatment of STIs also increased by 30.4 percent. We also find that the HIV prevalence trajectory was reduced by 0.7 percent. We do not find evidence of impact on condom use and STI prevalence. The findings also suggest that although HIV testing increased for all socio-economic groups that were investigated, the effect was not the same. Lastly, we do not find evidence supporting that more resources translate to better ASRH outcomes. We recommend designing future ASRH strategies in a way that differentiates service delivery for youths in HIV hotspots, rural areas and out of school. We also recommend improving the strategy's coordination and monitoring, as well as aligning and enforcing government policies that promote sexual and reproductive health rights."
https://openalex.org/W2953871561,"The identification of the genes responsible for complex traits is highly promising to accelerate crop breeding, but such information is still limited for popcorn. Thus, in the present study, a mixed linear model-based association analysis (MLMA) was applied for six important popcorn traits: plant and ear height, 100-grain weight, popping expansion, grain yield and expanded popcorn volume per hectare. To this end, 196 plants of the open-pollinated popcorn population UENF-14 were sampled, selfed (S1), and then genotyped with a panel of 10,507 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers distributed throughout the genome. The six traits were studied under two environments [Campos dos Goytacazes-RJ (ENV1) and Itaocara-RJ (ENV2)] in an incomplete block design. Based on the phenotypic data of the S1 progenies and on the genetic characteristics of the parents, the MLMA was performed. Thereafter, genes annotated in the MaizeGDB platform were screened for potential linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs associated to the six evaluated traits. Overall, seven and eight genes were identified as associated with the traits in ENV1 and ENV2, respectively, and proteins encoded by these genes were evaluated for their function. The results obtained here contribute to increase knowledge on the genetic architecture of the six evaluated traits and might be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2954164537,"Bats, with highly articulated wings, are some of the most agile flyers in nature. A novel three-dimensional geometric decomposition framework is developed to reduce the complex kinematics of a bat wing into physical movements used to describe flapping flight: namely flapping, stroke plane deviation and pitching, together with cambering and flexion. The decomposition is combined with aerodynamic simulations to investigate the cumulative effect of each motion on force production, and their primary contribution to the unsteady vortex dynamics. For the nearly straight and level flight of Hipposideros pratti, results show that the flapping motion by itself induced a moderate drag and lift. Stroke plane deviation increased lift, and nullified the drag. With the inclusion of the pitching motion into the kinematics, lift production further increased by a factor of more than 2.5, and exhibited a positive net thrust by virtue of the favorable wing orientation during the upstroke. The primary contribution of cambering, which included a maximum chord line displacement of ≈40% standard mean chord, was the stabilization of the leading edge vortex during the downstroke. This increased mean lift by about 35% at the expense of net thrust. Flexion was perhaps the most complex motion with maximum displacements of 75% standard mean chord. This was instrumental in reducing the negative lift during the upstroke by preventing the formation of strong leading edge vortices. The aerodynamic effective angle of attack emerged as a heuristic parameter to describe lift and net thrust production across movements."
https://openalex.org/W2955105587,"The original Barbie doll’s unrealistic body shape can negatively affect young girls’ body image. Mattel produced new Barbie dolls with “tall”, “curvy”, and “petite” body types, yet how girls perceive and evaluate the three new Barbie body types remains unknown. This study investigated whether young girls engage in an automatic “self-other matching” process when viewing the different Barbie doll representations. Female children and adolescents (N = 38; Mage = 10; 6–14 years old; SD = 2.24 years) completed a body-part compatibility task to provide an index of how they implicitly relate cognitive representations of their own body to the different doll images. Significant (p < .05) body-part compatibility effects emerged for the original, curvy and petite dolls, but not for the tall Barbie. These findings indicate that girls engage in a self-other body matching process when viewing Barbie, but that the strength of this matching is influenced by the doll’s body type. Results provide new evidence on the underlying cognitive mechanisms that occur when girls are exposed to physique-salient toys, and may have implications for young girls’ body image development and use of appearance-based social comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W2954929401,"Objective While the major policy changes in the Indonesian healthcare system over the last 25 years have been well documented, less is known about the accompanying changes in inequalities in healthcare utilisation during this period. Our study aimed to describe the trends in income-related inequalities in healthcare utilisation in Indonesia during the period 1993–2014. Methods A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Indonesian Family Life Surveys from 1993, 2000, 2007, and 2014. We measured outpatient and inpatient healthcare utilisation in public and private provider as well as the overall utilisation. Standardised prevalence rate and relative index of inequality (RII) were used to measure the extent of inequalities in healthcare utilisation by income level (income-related inequalities). Results Relatively large income-related inequalities were observed in the utilisation of private outpatient care and public and private inpatient care in 1993. Income-related inequalities in public and private outpatient care utilisation decreased between 1993 and 2007 but increased in 2014. Income-related inequalities in public and private inpatient care utilisation continued to decrease between 1993 and 2014. The largest decrease was observed in private inpatient care utilisation. Conclusion Income-related inequalities in all types of healthcare utilisation decreased until 2007. This trend continued until 2014 only for public and private inpatient care utilisation. This phenomenon may be explained by the changes to the healthcare system (e.g. expansion of the government health insurance programme and health sector decentralisation), which coincided with the changes in inequalities in healthcare utilisation in Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W2955594103,"Excessive alcohol consumption contributes significantly to premature mortality, injuries and morbidity, and a range of U.S. state policies have been shown to reduce these behaviors. Monitoring state alcohol policy environments is essential, but methodologically challenging given that new laws may be passed (or repealed) each year, resulting in considerable variation across states. Existing measures have not been made public or have only a single year available. We develop a new replicable measure, the state alcohol policy score, for each state and year 2004–2009, that captures the essential features of a state’s evidence-based alcohol policies. We evaluate its similarity to two existing alcohol policy measures and validate it by replicating findings from a previous study that used one of those measures to assess its relationship with several binge drinking outcomes. Estimates of the association between one-year lagged state alcohol policy scores and state binge drinking outcomes, obtained from the 2005–2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys (n = 440,951, 2010), were produced using Generalized Linear Models that controlled for state and individual-level co-variates, with fixed effects for year and region. We find a 10-percentage point increase in the state alcohol policy score was associated with a 9% lower odds of binge drinking (aOR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.89, 0.92; N = 1,992,086), a result consistent for men, women and for most age and race subgroups. We find that gender gaps in binge drinking behaviors narrowed in states with higher state alcohol policy scores. These results were nearly identical to those found in other studies using different scores obtained with the aid of expert opinions. We conclude that the score developed here is a valid measure that can be readily updated for monitoring and evaluating the variation and impact of state alcohol policies and make available our state scores for the years of the study."
https://openalex.org/W2953871137,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate and invertebrate nervous system. GABAA receptors are activated by GABA and their agonists, and modulated by a wide variety of recognized drugs, including barbiturates, anesthetics, and benzodiazepines. The phenols propofol, thymol, chlorothymol, carvacrol and eugenol act as positive allosteric modulators on GABAA-R receptor. These GABAergic phenols interact with the lipid membrane, therefore, their anesthetic activity could be the combined result of their specific activity (with receptor proteins) as well as nonspecific interactions (with surrounding lipid molecules) modulating the supramolecular organization of the receptor environment. Therefore, we aimed to contribute to a description of the molecular events that occur at the membrane level as part of the mechanism of general anesthesia, using a molecular dynamic simulation approach. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the presence of GABAergic phenols in a DPPC bilayer orders lipid acyl chains for carbons near the interface and their effect is not significant at the bilayer center. Phenols interacts with the polar interface of phospholipid bilayer, particularly forming hydrogen bonds with the glycerol and phosphate group. Also, potential of mean force calculations using umbrella sampling show that propofol partition is mainly enthalpic driven at the polar region and entropic driven at the hydrocarbon chains. Finally, potential of mean force indicates that propofol partition into a gel DPPC phase is not favorable. Our in silico results were positively contrasted with previous experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2954254118,"We previously identified PEPCK-M (encoded by the Pck2 gene) to be highly up-regulated in skeletal muscle of pigs treated with Ractopamine, an anabolic beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. To determine whether PEPCK-M had a causative role in modulating the skeletal muscle growth response to Ractopamine, we used adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) to over-express Pck2 (AAV-Pck2) in murine skeletal muscle. A contralateral limb design was employed, such that each mouse served as its own control (injected with a GFP-only expressing AAV1, labelled AAV-GFP). Daily injections of Clenbuterol (1 mg/kg for 21 days) or vehicle control were also carried out to assess the effects of AAV-Pck2 overexpression on the anabolic response to a beta-adrenergic agonist. AAV-Pck2 overexpression in leg muscles of male C57BL6/J mice for 4 weeks (6–10 weeks of age) increased Pck2 mRNA (~100-fold), protein (not quantifiable) and enzyme activity (~3-fold). There was a trend (p = 0.0798) for AAV-Pck2 overexpression to reduce TA muscle weights, but there was no significant effect on muscle fibre diameters or myosin heavy chain isoform (MyHC) mRNA expression. When skeletal muscle growth was induced by daily administration of Clenbuterol (for 21 days), overexpression of AAV-Pck2 had no effect on the growth response, nor did it alter the expression of Phosphoserine Aminotransferase-1 (Psat1) or Asparagine Synthetase (Asns) mRNA or the Clenbuterol-induced decreases in MyHC IIa and IIx mRNA expression (p = 0.0065 and p = 0.0267 respectively). However AAV-Pck2 overexpression reduced TA muscle weights (p = 0.0434), particularly in the Control (vehicle treated) mice (p = 0.059 for AAV x Clenbuterol interaction) and increased the expression of Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (Sars) mRNA (p = 0.0477). Hence, contrary to the original hypothesis, AAV-Pck2 overexpression reduced TA muscle weights and did not mimic or alter the muscle hypertrophic effects of the beta-adrenergic agonist, Clenbuterol."
https://openalex.org/W2954527457,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to the burden from non-communicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa and hypertension is the leading risk factor for CVD. The objective of this modeling study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a risk stratified approach to medication management in Kenya in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control to reduce CVD events. Methods We developed a microsimulation model to evaluate CVD risk over the lifetime of a cohort of individuals. Risk groups were assigned utilizing modified Framingham study distributions based on individual level risk factors from the Kenya STEPwise survey which collected details on blood pressure, blood glucose, tobacco and alcohol use and cholesterol levels. We stratified individuals into 4 risk groups: very low, low, moderate and high risk. Mortality could occur due to acute CVD events, subsequent future events (for individual who survive the initial event) and other causes. We present cost and DALYs gained due to medication management for men and women 25 to 69 years. Results Treating high risk individuals only was generally more cost-effective that treating high and moderate risk individuals. At the anticipated base levels of effectiveness, medication management was only cost-effective under the low cost scenario. The incremental cost per DALY gained with low cost ranged from $1,505 to $3,608, which is well under $4,785 (3 times GPD per capita) threshold for Kenya. Under the low cost scenario, even lower levels of effectiveness of medication management are likely to be cost-effective for high-risk men and women. Conclusions In Kenya, our results indicate that the risk stratified approach to treating hypertension may be cost-effective especially for men and women at a high risk for CVD events, but these results are highly sensitive to the cost of medications. Medication management would require significant financial investment and therefore other interventions, including lifestyle changes, should be evaluated especially for those with elevated blood pressure and overall 10-year risk that is less than 20%."
https://openalex.org/W2954962000,"(-)-Incarvillateine (INCA) is a natural product that has garnered attention due to its purported analgesic effects and historical use as a pain reliever in China. α-Truxillic acid monoesters (TAMEs) constitute a class of inhibitors targeting fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5), whose inhibition produces analgesia in animal models. The structural similarity between INCA and TAMEs motivated us to assess whether INCA exerts its antinociceptive effects via FABP inhibition. We found that, in contrast to TAMEs, INCA did not exhibit meaningful binding affinities toward four human FABP isoforms (FABP3, FABP4, FABP5 and FABP7) in vitro. INCA-TAME, a putative monoester metabolite of INCA that closely resembles TAMEs also lacked affinity for FABPs. Administration of INCA to mice produced potent antinociceptive effects while INCA-TAME was without effect. Surprisingly, INCA also potently suppressed locomotor activity at the same dose that produces antinociception. The motor suppressive effects of INCA were reversed by the adenosine A2 receptor antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine. Collectively, our results indicate that INCA and INCA-TAME do not inhibit FABPs and that INCA exerts potent antinociceptive and motor suppressive effects at equivalent doses. Therefore, the observed antinociceptive effects of INCA should be interpreted with caution."

Because of this inpatient focus, graduate medical education clinical training often fails to expose physicians-in-training to the challenges that patients may face in the outpatient or home setting. This is a descriptive study in which we explore what participating students and resident doctors learned through our brief home-based teaching experience.From June 2016 to December 2017, attending physicians on the internal medicine service had medical students and resident doctors accompany them on home care visits. Participants were selected by convenience sampling based on their rotation availability. After the home visit and the interactive discussion, the participants were expected to prepare a reflective journal on their experience and learning. Thematic analysis was applied, and key themes were developed based on Kolb's ELT (Experiential learning theory). Three months after completion of the experience, semi-structured interviews were individually conducted assessing participants' self-perceived changes.Thirty-two medical students(10) or residents(22)participated in a home visit. Thirty of these learners were able to complete a reflective journal. Using thematic analysis, we identified 2 domains and 6 key themes from the participants' perceptions. Participants recognized the importance of patient-centered care, inter-professional collaboration of the home care team, and reconceptualized the meaning of medical practice and their professional identity as a doctor. Three month post-experience interviews were completed on 12 of the original 30 participants who completed the reflective journal. 2 domains and 6 key themes from the residents' experiences and perceptions were generated. The participants reported an increased attention to the daily lives and social situations of their hospitalized patients, and an extension of their focus beyond the clinical medical treatment of the patient.The experience of a brief visit to a patient's home is a novel educational approach that may potentially provide medical students and resident doctors with opportunities to learn about out-of-hospital, patient-centered, home-based medical care."
https://openalex.org/W2955986165,"The complement-like protein thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) is a key factor in the immune response of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae to pathogens. Multiple allelic variants of TEP1 have been identified in laboratory strains and in the field, and are correlated with distinct immunophenotypes. TEP1 is tightly regulated by conformational changes induced by cleavage in a protease-sensitive region. Cleaved TEP1 forms exhibit significant variation in stability from hours to days at room temperature. In particular, the refractory allele TEP1*R1 is significantly more stable than the susceptible allele TEP1*S1. This raises the question of whether the stability of cleaved TEP1 is linked to allelic variation and varying immunophenotypes. We have analyzed the stability of the cleaved form of additional TEP1 alleles and constructs. We show that stability is correlated with allelic variation within two specific loops in direct proximity to the thioester bond. The variable loops are part of an interface between the TED and MG8 domains of TEP1 that protect the thioester from hydrolysis. Engineering specific disulfide bonds to prevent separation of the TED-MG8 interface stabilizes the cleaved form of TEP1 for months at room temperature. Cleaved TEP1 forms a soluble complex with a heterodimer of two leucine-rich repeat proteins, LRIM1 and APL1C, and precipitates in the absence of this complex. The molecular structure and oligomeric state of the TEP1/LRIM1/APL1C complex is unclear. The C-terminal coiled-coil domain of the LRIM1/APL1C complex is sufficient to stabilize the cleaved form of TEP1 in solution but cleaved forms of disulfide-stabilized TEP1 do not interact with LRIM1/APL1C. This implies that formation of the TEP1cut/LRIM1/APL1C complex is related to the conformational change that induces the precipitation of cleaved TEP1."

A recently developed cell patterning technology uses patterns of an organic polymer, parylene-C, on a background of SiO2. When cells are cultured on the parylene-C/SiO2 substrate they conform to the underlying parylene-C geometry. Parylene-C is, however, just one member of a family of parylene polymers that have varying chemical and physical properties. In this work, we investigate whether two commercially available mainstream parylene derivatives, parylene-D, parylene-N and a more recent parylene derivative, parylene-HT to determine if they enable higher fidelity hNT astrocyte cell patterning compared to parylene-C. We demonstrate that all parylene derivatives are compatible with the existing laser fabrication method. We then demonstrate that parylene-HT, parylene-D and parylene-N are suitable for use as an hNT astrocyte cell attractive substrate and result in an equal quality of patterning compared to parylene-C. This work supports the use of alternative parylene derivatives for applications where their different physical and chemical properties are more suitable."
https://openalex.org/W2953747380,"In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is driven by the actions of several cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and an array of regulatory proteins called cyclins, due to the cyclical expression patterns of the latter. In yeast, the accepted pattern of cyclin waves is based on qualitative studies performed by different laboratories using different strain backgrounds, different growing conditions and media, and different kinds of genetic manipulation. Additionally, only the subset of cyclins regulating Cdc28 was included, while the Pho85 cyclins were excluded. We describe a comprehensive, quantitative and accurate blueprint of G1 cyclins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that, in addition to validating previous conclusions, yields new findings and establishes an accurate G1 cyclin blueprint. For the purposes of this research, we produced a collection of strains with all G1 cyclins identically tagged using the same and most respectful procedure possible. We report the contribution of each G1 cyclin for a broad array of growing and stress conditions, describe an unknown role for Pcl2 in heat-stress conditions and demonstrate the importance of maintaining the 3'UTR sequence of cyclins untouched during the tagging process."

The importance of including young people in this complex process is recognized in all relevant documents (i.e. Agenda 21), however it is not an easy task to elicit opinions and preferences from the youth. Furthermore, the assessment of the sustainable development goals itself presents a challenge for the noisy data and nonlinear relationships in data. Popular approach is fuzzy set models where expert knowledge is presented with comprehensible rules; however expert knowledge elicitation takes a long time too. Several studies proposed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approach that combines the fuzzy set theory to model expert knowledge with neural networks for inferring rules and membership functions from data to assess the sustainable development performance. We base our assumptions that ANFIS can be used to predict the importance of sustainable development pillars from the demographic data of young people. For this purpose, we have conducted an online survey on sustainable development goals opinions and importance of young people in Serbia. The sample of 386 respondents has been split into a training sample of 300 instances (to generate membership functions and fuzzy rules) and a testing sample of 86 instances to predict the importance of the three pillars. We have conducted a trace-driven simulation test to validate the results of the proposed ANFIS model. Results of the study provided insights into how the young people in Serbia assess the importance of sustainable development goals. Secondly, the results suggest that ANFIS can be applied to predict values of importance of the three sustainable development pillars with the relative error of Rel Err < 5%. It must be noted that the considered model could be further improved by using training samples with more data."
https://openalex.org/W2954328078,"Although many influenza-related deaths are attributable to secondary bacterial infection with S. pneumoniae, vaccines that simultaneously protect against influenza and pneumococcal infection are currently not developed. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possibility to prevent post-influenza pneumococcal infection using an associated vaccine based on live influenza vaccine (LAIV) combined with recombinant polypeptides derived from superficial factors of Group B streptococcus (GBS) determining pathogenicity. We demonstrated in a model of post-influenza pneumococcal pneumonia that intranasal pneumococcal super-infection seriously complicated the course of A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9) CDC-RG virus infection in mice. Associated immunization using LAIV and GBS vaccine (GBSV) prevented post-influenza pneumococcal pneumonia better than mono-LAIV or GBSV immunization. At the same time, parenteral pneumococcal post-influenza infection of immune mice was more severe in the groups immunized using recombinant GBS peptides which can be explained by antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. In this case, the introduction of blockers of histamine receptors type 1 and 2 reduced the burden of secondary pneumococcal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2954366984,"Background Little is known about HIV treatment outcomes in Indonesia, which has one of the most rapidly growing HIV epidemics worldwide. Methods We examined possible differences in loss to follow-up (LTFU) and survival between HIV-infected females and males over a 7-year period in an HIV clinic in Bandung, West Java. Data imputation was performed on missing covariates and a multi-state Cox regression was used to investigate the effects of sex and other covariates on patient transitions among four states: (1) clinic enrollment with HIV, (2) initiation/continuation/re-initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), (3) LTFU, and (4) death. Results We followed 3215 patients (33% females), for a total of 8430 person-years. ART was used by 59% of patients at some point. One-year retention was 73% for females and 77% for males (p = 0.06). One-year survival was 98% for both females and males (p = 0.15). Females experienced a higher relative hazard to transition from HIV to LTFU (adjusted hazard ratio 1.21; 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.45), but this decreased after adjustments for clinical variables (aHR 0.94; 95% CI 0.79–1.11). Similarly, a lower relative hazard in females to transition from ART to death (aHR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35–0.99) decreased after adjustments for demographic variables. Conclusion This Indonesian cohort has low ART uptake and poor overall pre- and post-ART retention. Female-male differences in survival and retention were gone after adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic factors such as CD4 count and education level. Efforts should be made to improve retention among patients with lower education."
https://openalex.org/W2955579951,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder. Our previous study reported novel loci as genetic markers associated with increased susceptibility to CML. The present study conducted an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to confirm that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at these loci affect the expression of candidate CML-susceptible genes. We identified that three SNPs (rs963193, rs6931104, and rs9371517) were related to the gene expression pattern of RMND1 (Required For Meiotic Nuclear Division 1 Homolog) in both granulocytes and mononuclear cells from 83 healthy donors. Furthermore, reduced expression of RMND1 expression was noted in CML patients compared with that in healthy individuals. We used the eQTL browsing tool to assess the regulatory information on the three associated significant SNPs, out of which rs6931104 showed strong evidence of regulatory effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that A alleles of rs6931104 could significantly change the binding affinity of transcription factor (TF) RFX3 compared to the G alleles. Then, we performed in vitro experiments on BCR-ABL1-positive (BCR-ABL1+) cell lines. We found that expression of the CML-susceptible gene RMND1 is affected by the binding affinity of TF RFX3, suggesting that RFX3 plays a role in RMND1 expression. Our findings suggest potential target genes for associations of genetic susceptibility risk loci and provide further insights into the pathogenesis and mechanism of CML."

However, proper statistical techniques are needed to make sense of this large amount of data and translate them into usable recommendations. Here, we apply Functional Data Analysis (FDA), a novel branch of Statistics that analyses functions-to identify drivers of residential electricity load curves. We evaluate a real time feedback intervention which involved about 1000 Italian households for a period of three years. Results of the FDA modelling reveal, for the first time, daytime-indexed patterns of residential electricity consumption which depend on the ownership of specific clusters of electrical appliances and an overall reduction of consumption after the introduction of real time feedback, unrelated to appliance ownership characteristics."
