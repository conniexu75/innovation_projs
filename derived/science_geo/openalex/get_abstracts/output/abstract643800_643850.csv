https://openalex.org/W2993894543,"The high-dimensional data created by high-throughput technologies require visualization tools that reveal data structure and patterns in an intuitive form. We present PHATE, a visualization method that captures both local and global nonlinear structure using an information-geometric distance between data points. We compare PHATE to other tools on a variety of artificial and biological datasets, and find that it consistently preserves a range of patterns in data, including continual progressions, branches and clusters, better than other tools. We define a manifold preservation metric, which we call denoised embedding manifold preservation (DEMaP), and show that PHATE produces lower-dimensional embeddings that are quantitatively better denoised as compared to existing visualization methods. An analysis of a newly generated single-cell RNA sequencing dataset on human germ-layer differentiation demonstrates how PHATE reveals unique biological insight into the main developmental branches, including identification of three previously undescribed subpopulations. We also show that PHATE is applicable to a wide variety of data types, including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, Hi-C and gut microbiome data."

https://openalex.org/W2994157012,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are important in discerning the genetic architecture of complex traits such as biomass allocation for improving drought tolerance and carbon sequestration potential of wheat. The objectives of this study were to deduce the population structure and marker-trait association for biomass traits in wheat under drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions. A 100-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotype panel was phenotyped for days to heading (DTH), days to maturity (DTM), shoot biomass (SB), root biomass (RB), root to shoot ratio (RS) and grain yield (GY). The panel was sequenced using 15,600 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers and subjected to genetic analysis using the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) at false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05). Population structure analysis revealed six sub-clusters with high membership ancestry coefficient of ≤0.65 to their assigned sub-clusters. A total of 75 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified with a linkage disequilibrium threshold of 0.38 at 5cM. Thirty-seven of the MTAs were detected under drought-stressed condition and 48% were on the B genome, where most quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for RB, SB and GY were previously identified. There were seven pleiotropic markers for RB and SB that may facilitate simultaneous selection. Thirty-seven putative candidate genes were mined by gene annotation on the IWGSC RefSeq 1.1. The significant MTAs observed in this study will be useful in devising strategies for marker-assisted breeding for simultaneous improvement of drought tolerance and to enhance C sequestration capacity of wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2992788344,"Abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis and function has been linked to multiple diseases including diabetes. Recently, we demonstrated the role of renal (Pro)renin receptor (PRR) in the dysregulation of mitochondria. We hypothesized that PRR contributes to the reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in diabetic kidney via PGC-1α/AMPK/SIRT-1 signaling pathway. In vivo and in vitro studies were conducted in C57BL/6 mouse and mouse renal mesangial cells (mRMCs). Control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were injected with scramble or PRR shRNA and followed for a period of eight weeks. PRR mRNA and protein expression increased by 44% and 39% respectively (P<0.05) in kidneys of diabetic mice, and in mRMCs exposed to high glucose by 43 and 61% respectively compared to their respective controls. These results were accompanied by reduced mRNA and protein expressions of PGC-1α (67% and 75%), nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1, 48% and 53%), mitochondrial transcriptional factor A (mtTFA, 56% and 40%), mitochondrial DNA copy number by 75% (all, P<0.05), and ATP production by 54%, respectively in diabetic kidneys and in mRMCs exposed to high glucose. Compared to non-diabetic control mice, PRR knockdown in diabetic mice and in mRMCs, not only attenuated the PRR mRNA and protein expression but also normalized mRNA and protein expressions of PGC-1α, NRF-1, mtTFA, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and ATP production. Treatment with AMPK inhibitor, Compound C, or SIRT-1 inhibitor, EX-527, alone, or combined with PRR siRNA caused marked reduction of mRNA expression of PGC-1α, NRF-1 and mtTFA, and ATP production in mRMCs exposed to high glucose. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the contribution of the PRR to the reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in diabetic kidney disease via decreasing AMPK/SIRT-1/ PGC-1α signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2993365240,"Overweight and obesity are important risk factors of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Clustering of metabolic risk factors in early pregnancy may be a potential pathogenesis between the link of overweight/obesity and GDM. Since it remains unexplored, we investigated if overweight and obesity are associated with clustering of metabolic risk factors in early pregnancy and the risk of GDM in this cohort study.Total 527 women who visited National Taiwan University Hospital for prenatal care in between November 2013 to April 2018 were enrolled. Risk factors of GDM in the first prenatal visit (FPV) were recorded. Overweight/obesity was defined if body mass index ≥24 kg/m2. GDM was diagnosed from the result of a 75g oral glucose tolerance test in 24-28 gestational weeks.Overweight/obesity was associated with clustering of metabolic risk factors of GDM, including high fasting plasma glucose, high HbA1c, insulin resistance, high plasma triglyceride and elevated blood pressure in FPV (p<0.05). There was a positive relationship between the number of metabolic risk factors and the incidence of GDM (p <0.05). The odds ratios of HbA1c and diastolic blood pressure were higher in overweight/obese women, compared with those in normal-weight women.Overweight/obesity is associated with clustering of metabolic risk factors in early pregnancy, which is correlated with higher risk of GDM. Our findings suggest that metabolic risk factors during early pregnancy should be evaluated in overweight/obese women."

https://openalex.org/W2993681226,"Objectives Sexualized intravenous drug use, also known as slamsex, seems to be increasing among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Physical and psychopathological symptoms have previously been reported in this population, although research on the subject of slamsex is scarce. The objectives of our study were to describe the psychopathological background of a sample of HIV-positive MSM who engaged in slamsex during the previous year and to compare physical, psychopathological, and drug-related symptoms between these participants and those who engaged in non-injecting sexualized drug use. Design and methods Participants (HIV-positive MSM) were recruited from the U-Sex study in 22 HIV clinics in Madrid during 2016–17. All participants completed an anonymous cross-sectional online survey on sexual behavior and recreational drug use. When participants met the inclusion criteria, physicians offered them the opportunity to participate and gave them a card with a unique code and a link to access the online survey. The present analysis is based on HIV-positive MSM who had engaged in slamsex and non-injecting sexualized drug use. Results The survey sample comprised 742 participants. Of all the participants who completed the survey, 216 (29.1%) had engaged in chemsex, and of these, 34 (15.7%) had engaged in slamsex. Participants who engaged in slamsex were more likely to have current psychopathology (depression, anxiety, and drug-related disorders) than participants who engaged in non-injecting sexualized drug use. In addition, participants who engaged in slamsex more frequently reported high-risk sexual behaviors and polydrug use and were more often diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and hepatitis C than those who did not inject drugs. Compared with participants who did not inject drugs, participants who engaged in slamsex experienced more severe drug-related symptoms (withdrawal and dependence), symptoms of severe intoxication (loss of consciousness), and severe psychopathological symptoms during or after slamsex (eg, paranoid thoughts and suicidal behaviors). Conclusion Slamsex is closely associated with current psychiatric disorders and severe drug-related and psychiatric symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2992152394,"Machine learning (ML) is poised as a transformational approach uniquely positioned to discover the hidden biological interactions for better prediction and diagnosis of complex diseases. In this work, we integrated ML-based models for feature selection and classification to quantify the risk of individual susceptibility to asthma using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Random forest (RF) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm were implemented to identify the SNPs with high implication to asthma. K-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were trained to classify the identified SNPs whether associated with non-asthmatic or asthmatic samples. Feature selection step showed that RF outperformed RFE and the feature importance score derived from RF was consistently high for a subset of SNPs, indicating the robustness of RF in selecting relevant features associated with asthma. Model comparison showed that the integration of RF-SVM obtained the highest model performance with an accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of 62.5%, 65.3%, and 69%, respectively, when compared to the baseline, RF-kNN, and an external MeanDiff-kNN models. Furthermore, results show that the occurrence of asthma can be predicted with an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 0.62 and 0.64 for RF-SVM and RF-kNN models, respectively. This study demonstrates the integration of ML models to augment traditional methods in predicting genetic predisposition to multifactorial diseases such as asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2993159127,"Background Cystinosis is a rare disorder caused by recessive mutations of the CTNS gene. Current therapy decreases cystine accumulation, thus slowing organ deterioration without reversing renal Fanconi syndrome or preventing eventual need for a kidney transplant.15-20% of cystinosis patients harbour at least one nonsense mutation in CTNS, leading to premature end of translation of the transcript. Aminoglycosides have been shown to permit translational read-through but have high toxicity level, especially in the kidney and inner ear. ELX-02, a modified aminoglycoside, retains it read-through ability without the toxicity. Methods and findings We ascertained the toxicity of ELX-02 in cells and in mice as well as the effect of ELX-02 on translational read-through of nonsense mutations in cystinotic mice and human cells. ELX-02 was not toxic in vitro or in vivo, and permitted read-through of nonsense mutations in cystinotic mice and human cells. Conclusions ELX-02 has translational read-through activity and produces a functional CTNS protein, as evidenced by reduced cystine accumulation. This reduction is comparable to cysteamine treatment. ELX-02 accumulates in the kidney but neither cytotoxicity nor nephrotoxicity was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2993617796,"Bacteria within the digestive tract of adult honey bees are likely to play a key role in the digestion of sugar-rich foods. However, the influence of diet on honey bee gut bacteria is not well understood. During periods of low floral abundance, beekeepers often supplement the natural sources of carbohydrate that honey bees collect, such as nectar, with various forms of carbohydrates such as sucrose (a disaccharide) and invert sugar (a mixture of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose). We compared the effect of these sugar supplements on the relative abundance of bacteria in the gut of bees by feeding bees from a single colony, two natural diets: mānuka honey, a monofloral honey with known antibacterial properties, and a hive diet; and artificial diets of invert sugar, sucrose solution, and sucrose solutions containing synthesised compounds associated with the antibacterial properties of mānuka honey. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based sequencing showed that dietary regimes containing mānuka honey, sucrose and invert sugar did not alter the relative abundance of dominant core bacteria after 6 days of being fed these diets. However, sucrose-rich diets increased the relative abundances of three sub-dominant core bacteria, Rhizobiaceae, Acetobacteraceae, and Lactobacillus kunkeei, and decreased the relative abundance of Frischella perrara, all which significantly altered the bacterial composition. Acetogenic bacteria from the Rhizobiaceae and Acetobacteraceae families increased two- to five-fold when bees were fed sucrose. These results suggest that sucrose fuels the proliferation of specific low abundance primary sucrose-feeders, which metabolise sugars into monosaccharides, and then to acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2994525661,"Threatened chondrichthyan diversity is high in developing countries where scarce resources, limited data, and minimal stakeholder support often render conservation efforts challenging. As such, data on many species, including many evolutionarily distinct endemics, is poor in these countries and their conservation status and habitat needs remain uncertain. Here, we used baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs; n = 419) conducted at 167 sites over two years to assess the frequency of occurrence (FO), relative abundance, diversity, and structure of chondrichthyan assemblages in one of the world’s chondrichthyan biodiversity and endemism hotspots, South Africa. We compared chondrichthyan assemblages across three habitat types, and between unprotected and protected areas (a small marine protected area [MPA] and a larger, seasonal whale sanctuary). Although in total we observed 18 chondrichthyan species (11 families), over half of all observations were of just two species from the same family of mesopredatory endemic catsharks; only 8.8% were larger shark species. These mesopredatory species do not appear to be threatened, but some skates and larger shark species, including some endemics, were much rarer. Overall chondrichthyan FO was high (81% of all BRUVs); FO was higher in kelp (100% of BRUVS) and reef (93%) sites than at sites in sandy habitat (63%), which had a distinct chondrichthyan community. Independent of habitat, the chondrichthyan community did not relate strongly to protection. Because sites with kelp and reef habitat were rare in the whale sanctuary, this protected area had a lower chondrichthyan FO (67% of BRUVs) than either unprotected sites (81%) or those in the small MPA (98%), as well as having lower chondrichthyan relative abundance and species richness. Our study provides evidence of the importance of distinct habitat types to different chondrichthyan species, and suggests that even small MPAs can protect critical habitats, such that they may provide safe refuge for endemic species as anthropogenic pressures increase."
https://openalex.org/W2994275779,"Ketorolac has been associated with a lower risk of recurrence in retrospective studies, especially in patients with positive inflammatory markers. It is still unknown whether a single dose of pre-incisional ketorolac can prolong recurrence-free survival.The KBC trial is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial in high-risk breast cancer patients powered for 33% reduction in recurrence rate (from 60 to 40%). Patients received one dose of ketorolac tromethamine or a placebo before surgery. Eligible patients were breast cancer patients, planned for curative surgery, and with a Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio≥4, node-positive disease or a triple-negative phenotype. The primary endpoint was Disease-Free Survival (DFS) at two years. Secondary endpoints included safety, pain assessment and overall survival.Between February 2013 and July 2015, 203 patients were assigned to ketorolac (n = 96) or placebo (n = 107). Baseline characteristics were similar between arms. Patients had a mean age of 55.7 (SD14) years. At two years, 83.1% of the patients were alive and disease free in the ketorolac vs. 89.7% in the placebo arm (HR: 1.23; 95%CI: 0.65-2.31) and, respectively, 96.8% vs. 98.1% were alive (HR: 1.09; 95%CI: 0.34-3.51).A single administration of 30 mg of ketorolac tromethamine before surgery does not increase disease-free survival in high risk breast cancer patients. Overall survival difference between ketorolac tromethamine group and placebo group was not statistically significant. The study was however underpowered because of lower recurrence rates than initially anticipated. No safety concerns were observed.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01806259."
https://openalex.org/W2889181260,"With approximately half of the world’s population at risk of contracting dengue, this mosquito-borne disease is of global concern. International travellers significantly contribute to dengue’s rapid and large-scale spread by importing the disease from endemic into non-endemic countries. To prevent future outbreaks and dengue from establishing in non-endemic countries, knowledge about the arrival time and location of infected travellers is crucial. We propose a network model that predicts the monthly number of dengue-infected air passengers arriving at any given airport. We consider international air travel volumes to construct weighted networks, representing passenger flows between airports. We further calculate the probability of passengers, who travel through the international air transport network, being infected with dengue. The probability of being infected depends on the destination, duration and timing of travel. Our findings shed light onto dengue importation routes and reveal country-specific reporting rates that have been until now largely unknown. This paper provides important new knowledge about the spreading dynamics of dengue that is highly beneficial for public health authorities to strategically allocate the often limited resources to more efficiently prevent the spread of dengue."
https://openalex.org/W2993218046,"Angler (RVA) and Red-and-White dual-purpose (RDN) cattle were in the past decades crossed with influential Red Holstein (RH) sires. However, genome-wide diversity studies in these breeds are lacking. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the genome-wide diversity and population structure of the three German cattle breeds. Using 40,851 single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 337 individuals, runs of homozygosity (ROH) were analysed in each breed. Clustering and a high-resolution network visualisation analyses were performed on an extended dataset that included 11 additional (outgroup) breeds. Genetic diversity levels were high with observed heterozygosity above 0.35 in all three breeds. Only RVA had a recent past effective population size (Ne) estimate above 100 at 5 generations ago. ROH length distribution followed a similar pattern across breeds and the majority of ROH were found in the length class of >5 to 10 Mb. Estimates of average inbreeding calculated from ROH (FROH) were 0.021 (RVA), 0.045 (RDN) and 0.053 (RH). Moderate to high positive correlations were found between FROH and pedigree inbreeding (FPED) and between FROH and inbreeding derived from the excess of homozygosity (FHOM), while the intercept of the regression of FROH on FPED was above zero. The population structure analysis showed strong evidence of admixture between RVA and RH. Introgression of RDN with RH genes was minimally detected and for the first time, the study uncovered Norwegian Red Cattle ancestry in RVA. Highly heterogeneous genetic background was found for RVA and RH and as expected, the breeds of the extended dataset effectively differentiated mostly based on geographical origin, validating our findings. The results of this study confirm the impact of RH sires on RVA and RDN populations. Furthermore, a close monitoring is suggested to curb further reduction of Ne in the breeds."
https://openalex.org/W2992147860,"Objectives Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequently occurring fetal chromosomal abnormality and different prenatal screening strategies are used for determining risk of DS worldwide. New non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which uses cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood can provide benefits due to its higher sensitivity and specificity in comparison to conventional screening tests. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of using population-level NIPT in fetal aneuploidy screening for DS. Methods We developed a microsimulation decision-analytic model to perform a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies for DS. The model followed individual simulated pregnant women through the pregnancy pathway. The comparators were serum-only screening, contingent NIPT (i.e., NIPT as a second-tier screening test) and universal NIPT (i.e., NIPT as a first-tier screening test). To address uncertainty around the model parameters, the expected values of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the base case and all scenario analyses were obtained through probabilistic analysis from a Monte Carlo simulation. Results Base case and scenario analyses were conducted by repeating the micro-simulation 1,000 times for a sample of 45,605 pregnant women per the population of British Columbia, Canada (N = 4.8 million). Preliminary results of the sequential CEAs showed that contingent NIPT was a dominant strategy compared to serum-only screening. Compared with contingent NIPT, universal NIPT at the current test price was not cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over $100,000/QALY. Contingent NIPT also had the lowest cost per DS case detected among these three strategies. Conclusion Including NIPT in existing prenatal screening for DS is shown to be beneficial over conventional testing. However, at current prices, implementation of NIPT as a second-tier screening test is more cost-effective than deploying it as a universal test."
https://openalex.org/W2991995672,"An important question for our understanding of Roman history is how the Empire’s economy was structured, and how long-distance trading within and between its provinces was organised and achieved. Moreover, it is still unclear whether large construction timbers, for use in Italy, came from the widespread temperate forests north of the Alps and were then transported to the sparsely-wooded Mediterranean region in the south. Here, we present dendrochronological results from the archaeological excavation of an expensively decorated portico in the centre of Rome. The oak trees (Quercus sp.), providing twenty-four well-preserved planks in waterlogged ground, had been felled between 40 and 60 CE in the Jura Mountains of north-eastern France. It is most likely that the wood was transported to the Eternal City on the Saône and Rhône rivers and then across the Mediterranean Sea. This rare dendrochronological evidence from the capital of the Roman Empire gives fresh impetus to the ongoing debate on the likelihood of transporting timber over long distances within and between Roman provinces. This study reconstructs the administrative and logistic efforts required to transport high-quality construction timber from central Europe to Rome. It also highlights an advanced network of trade, and emphasises the enormous value of oak wood in Roman times."
https://openalex.org/W2993572739,"Changes in eating behavior of adolescents are associated with high consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods. This study evaluated the association between these foods and the prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake in adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 444 adolescents from public schools in the city of Natal, northeastern Brazil. The adolescents' habitual food consumption was evaluated using two 24-hour dietary recalls. Foods were categorized according to the degree of processing (processed and ultra-processed) and distributed into energy quartiles, using the NOVA classification system. Inadequacies in micronutrient intake were assessed using the estimated average requirement (EAR) as the cutoff point. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationship between energy percentage from processed and ultra-processed foods and prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake. The mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) consumption of total energy from processed foods ranged from 5.8% (1.7%) in Q1 to 20.6% (2.9%) in Q4, while the mean consumption of total energy from ultra-processed foods ranged from 21.4% (4.9%) in Q1 to 61.5% (11.7%) in Q4. The rates of inadequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and selenium were above 80% for both sexes across all age groups. Energy consumption from processed foods was associated with higher prevalence of inadequate selenium intake (p < 0.01) and lower prevalence of inadequate vitamin B1 intake (p = 0.04). Energy consumption from ultra-processed foods was associated with lower prevalence of inadequate zinc and vitamin B1 intake (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). An increase in the proportion of energy obtained from processed and ultra-processed foods may reflect higher prevalence of inadequate selenium intake and lower prevalence of vitamin B1 and zinc inadequacy."
https://openalex.org/W2992692156,"This paper investigates the correlation between climate, environment and human land use in the Westernmost Mediterranean on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar during the Late Glacial. Using a multi-proxy approach on a sample of 300 sites from the Solutrean and Magdalenian of the Iberian Peninsula and from the Iberomaurusian in Morocco, we find evidence for significant changes in settlement patterns and site density after the Last Glacial Maximum. In Southern Iberia, during Heinrich Stadial 1, hyperarid zones expanded drastically from the south-eastern coast to the West through the Interior. This aridification process heavily affected Magdalenian settlement in the South and caused a strong decline of hunter-gatherer population. Southern Iberia during Heinrich Stadial 1 turned out to be a high-risk environment when compared to Northern Iberia. At the same time, the Late Iberomaurusian of Morocco, although considered to be situated in a high-risk environment as well, experiences an increase of sites and expansion of settlement area."
https://openalex.org/W2992648827,"Natural Cordyceps sinensis, which is a valuable anti-tumor, immunomodulatory, and antiviral agent in Asia, has been overexploited in recent years. Therefore, it is important for cultivated C. sinensis to be recognized in the market. In this research, the main components of entirely cultivated, naturally grown C. sinensis, and stiff worms across different sampling years were detected and compared by HPLC-MS and UV spectrometry. The results indicated that the mean levels of adenosine and cordycepin were significantly higher, whereas the mean levels of mannitol and polysaccharides were remarkably lower in the cultivated type than in the natural type. No distinct difference in the average soluble protein content was observed. The composition of the stiff worms was similar to that of the natural herb, except that the total soluble protein content was higher, and that of mannitol was lower. In addition, the ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy of the three types showed high similarity at 260 nm. This research indicates that the main nutritional composition of cultivated and natural C. sinensis is identical and that cultivated type can be used as an effective substitute."
https://openalex.org/W2993067019,"Introduction The objective of this study was to determine the growth patterns, rates of malnutrition, and factors associated with malnutrition in children born to HIV-infected mothers in western Kenya using data from an electronic medical record system. Methods This study was a retrospective chart review of HIV-infected (HIV+) and–exposed (HEU) children (<5 years) using data collected prospectively in the course of routine clinical care and stored in the electronic medical record system in western Kenya between January 2011 and August 2016. Demographics and anthropometrics were described, with Chi-square testing to compare proportions. Multiple variable logistic regression analysis was used to identify correlates of children being stunted, underweight, and wasted. We also examined growth curves, using a resampling method to compare the areas under the fitted growth curves to compare males/females and HIV+/HEU. Results Data from 15,428 children were analyzed. The children were 51.6% (n = 7,955) female, 5.2% (n = 809) orphans, 83.3% (n = 12,851) were HEU, and 16.7% (n = 2,577) were HIV+. For HIV+ children assessed at 24 months, 50.9% (n = 217) were stunted, 26.5% (n = 145) were underweight, and 13.6% (n = 58) were wasted, while 45.0% (n = 577) of HEU children were stunted, 14.8% (n = 255) were underweight, and 5.1% (n = 65) were wasted. When comparing mean z-scores, HIV+ children tended to have larger and earlier dips in z-scores compared to HIV-exposed children, with significant differences found between the two groups (p<0.001). Factors associated with an increased risk of malnutrition included being male, HIV+, and attending an urban clinic. Maternal antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy and mixed feeding at 3 months of age decreased the risk of malnutrition. Conclusions HIV+ and HEU children differ in their anthropometrics, with HIV+ children having overall lower z-scores. Continued efforts to develop and implement sustainable and effective interventions for malnutrition are needed for children born to HIV+ mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2993367563,"PlsX plays a central role in the coordination of fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. PlsX is a peripheral membrane acyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of acyl-ACP to acyl-phosphate, which is in turn utilized by the polytopic membrane acyltransferase PlsY on the pathway of bacterial phospholipid biosynthesis. We have recently studied the interaction between PlsX and membrane phospholipids in vivo and in vitro, and observed that membrane association is necessary for the efficient transfer of acyl-phosphate to PlsY. However, understanding the molecular basis of such a channeling mechanism remains a major challenge. Here, we disentangle the binding and insertion events of the enzyme to the membrane, and the subsequent catalysis. We show that PlsX membrane binding is a process mostly mediated by phospholipid charge, whereas fatty acid saturation and membrane fluidity remarkably influence the membrane insertion step. Strikingly, the PlsXL254E mutant, whose biological functionality was severely compromised in vivo but remains catalytically active in vitro, was able to superficially bind to phospholipid vesicles, nevertheless, it loses the insertion capacity, strongly supporting the importance of membrane insertion in acyl-phosphate delivery. We propose a mechanism in which membrane fluidity governs the insertion of PlsX and thus regulates the biosynthesis of phospholipids in Gram-positive bacteria. This model may be operational in other peripheral membrane proteins with an unprecedented impact in drug discovery/development strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2993806898,"Existing studies show how population growth and rising incomes will cause a massive increase in the future global demand for food. We add to the literature by estimating the potential effect of increases in human weight, caused by rising BMI and height, on future calorie requirements. Instead of using a market based approach, the estimations are solely based on human energy requirements for maintenance of weight. We develop four different scenarios to show the effect of increases in human height and BMI. In a world where the weight per age-sex group would stay stable, we project calorie requirements to increases by 61.05 percent between 2010 and 2100. Increases in BMI and height could add another 18.73 percentage points to this. This additional increase amounts to more than the combined calorie requirements of India and Nigeria in 2010. These increases would particularly affect Sub-Saharan African countries, which will already face massively rising calorie requirements due to the high population growth. The stark regional differences call for policies that increase food access in currently economically weak regions. Such policies should shift consumption away from energy dense foods that promote overweight and obesity, to avoid the direct burden associated with these conditions and reduce the increases in required calories. Supplying insufficient calories would not solve the problem but cause malnutrition in populations with weak access to food. As malnutrition is not reducing but promoting rises in BMI levels, this might even aggravate the situation."
https://openalex.org/W2993919582,"Exposure to air pollutants is known to have adverse effects on human health; however, little is known about the association between hydrocarbons in air and an ischemic stroke (IS) event. We investigated whether long-term exposure to airborne hydrocarbons, including volatile organic compounds, increased IS risk. This retrospective cohort study included 283,666 people aged 40 years or older in Taiwan. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to fit single- and multiple-pollutant models for two targeted pollutants, total hydrocarbons (THC) and nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and estimated the risk of IS. Before controlling for multiple pollutants, hazard ratios (HRs) of IS with 95% confidence intervals for the overall population were 2.69 (2.64–2.74) at 0.16-ppm increase in THC and 1.62 (1.59–1.66) at 0.11-ppm increase in NMHC. For the multiple-pollutant models controlling for PM2.5, the adjusted HR was 3.64 (3.56–3.72) for THC and 2.21 (2.16–2.26) for NMHC. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to THC and NMHC may be a risk factor for IS development."

Physiological and hormonal responses to cold temperature storage in pear have been well characterized, but the molecular underpinnings of these phenomena remain unclear. An established low-temperature conditioning model was used to induce ripening of ‘D’Anjou’ and ‘Bartlett’ pear cultivars and quantify the expression of key genes representing ripening-related metabolic pathways in comparison to non-conditioned fruit. Physiological indicators of pear ripening were recorded, and fruit peel tissue sampled in parallel, during the cold-conditioning and ripening time-course experiment to correlate gene expression to ontogeny. Two complementary approaches, Nonparametric Multi-Dimensional Scaling and efficiency-corrected 2-(ΔΔCt), were used to identify genes exhibiting the most variability in expression. Interestingly, the enhanced alternative oxidase (AOX) transcript abundance at the pre-climacteric stage in ‘Bartlett’ and ‘D’Anjou’ at the peak of the conditioning treatments suggests that AOX may play a key and a novel role in the achievement of ripening competency. There were indications that cold-sensing and signaling elements from ABA and auxin pathways modulate the S1-S2 ethylene transition in European pears, and that the S1-S2 ethylene biosynthesis transition is more pronounced in ‘Bartlett’ as compared to ‘D’Anjou’ pear. This information has implications in preventing post-harvest losses of this important crop."
https://openalex.org/W2993742781,"Several recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, current evidence that describes general demographics in blood pressure and mortality with chronic kidney disease is sparse in Japan. Using a population-based longitudinal cohort that received annual health checkups in Japan in 2008, hypertensive status, self-reported use of antihypertensive drugs, and prognosis were examined through 2012. Chronic kidney disease was defined as positive proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Subjects were 40 to 74 years old (n = 227,204) with median 3.6 years follow-up period, and patients with and without chronic kidney disease were analyzed separately (n = 183,586 and n = 43,618, respectively). Cardiovascular disease mortality, comprising coronary heart diseases and stroke as entered in the national death registry using ICD-10 coding, was examined. Among all subjects, 346 deaths (96 in chronic kidney disease and 250 in non-chronic kidney disease) due to cardiovascular disease occurred. Compared with cardiovascular disease mortality in chronic kidney disease patients with untreated normal blood pressure, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio was 3.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.75-5.41) for those with untreated hypertension, 2.30 (1.31-4.03) for those who became normotensive after treatment, and 3.28 (1.91-5.64) for those who remained hypertensive despite treatment. In non-chronic kidney disease subjects, the ratios were 1.90 (1.33-5.41), 1.95 (1.35-2.80), and 1.77 (1.18-2.66), respectively. These results from a nationwide cohort could be one of representative demographics of controlling blood pressure and cardiovascular disease deaths when treating patients with chronic kidney disease in Japan in recent years. Even after development and spread of anti-hypertensive drugs, preventing development of hypertension is preferable, because any hypertension treatment status comparing untreated normal blood pressure was a risk of cardiovascular mortality at baseline year."

Antiphagocytic protein 1 (App1) is a virulence factor produced by C. neoformans that inhibits phagocytosis of the yeast by host macrophages. Treatment of cryptococcosis includes amphotericin B, fluconazole, and flucytosine. Virulence factors have been shown to affect the susceptibility of the pathogen to antifungal drugs. In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between App1 and antifungal drugs. We found that short-term exposure to amphotericin B downregulates APP1 expression while exposure to fluconazole upregulates APP1. In addition, App1 was found to increase the susceptibility of the yeast to amphotericin B and fluconazole. This study provides evidence of an intricate relationship between App1 and antifungal drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2992807639,"Background and aim Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is predicted to become the most common cause of cirrhosis and liver failure. Risk factors include obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. Macrophages and other myeloid cells play crucial roles in initiating and driving inflammation. Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT) is a transcription factor which binds to a range of partners to mediate responses to environmental signals, including the diet. In people with diabetes it is decreased in liver. We hypothesised that myeloid cell ARNT activity may contribute to the development of liver pathology. Methods Floxed-ARNT mice were bred with LysM-Cre mice to generate mice with reduced ARNT in myeloid cells. Animals were fed a high fat diet (HFD) and liver pathology was assessed. Histology, mRNA, fat accumulation and metabolism were studied. Results Animals with reduced myeloid ARNT developed steatohepatitis on a HFD, with additional alterations of metabolism and fat deposition. Steatohepatitis was accompanied by hepatic macrophage infiltration and expression of both M1 and M2 markers. Expression of mRNAs for Cxcl1, Mcp-1, Tnf-α and Tgf-β1 were increased. Human livers from controls and people with NASH were tested; ARNT mRNA was decreased by 80% (p = 0.0004). Conclusions Decreased myeloid ARNT may play a role in the conversion from non-alcoholic fatty liver to steatohepatitis. Increasing ARNT may be a therapeutic strategy to reduce NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2993260308,"Introduction Across the African Diaspora, hair is synonymous with identity. As such, Black women use a variety of hair products, which often contain more endocrine-disrupting chemicals than products used by women of other races. An emerging body of research is linking chemicals in hair products to breast cancer, but there is no validated instrument that measures constructs related to hair, identity, and breast health. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the Black Identity, Hair Product Use, and Breast Cancer Scale (BHBS) in a diverse sample of Black women to measure the social and cultural constructs associated with Black women’s hair product use and perceived breast cancer risk. Methods Participants completed a 27-item scale that queried perceptions of identity, hair products, and breast cancer risk. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were conducted to establish the underlying component structures, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to determine model fit. Results Participants (n = 185) were African American (73%), African, and Caribbean Black women (27%) aged 29 to 64. PCA yielded two components that accounted for 61% of total variance. Five items measuring sociocultural perspectives about hair and identity loaded on subscale 1 and accounted for 32% of total variance (α = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.77–0.86). Six items assessing perceived breast cancer risk related to hair product use loaded on subscale 2 and accounted for 29% of total variance (α = 0.82 (95% CI = 0.74–0.86). CFA confirmed the two-component structure (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.03; Comparative Fit Index = 0.91; Tucker Lewis Index = 0.88). Conclusions The BHBS is a valid measure of social and cultural constructs associated with Black women’s hair product use and perceived breast cancer risk. This scale is useful for studies that assess cultural norms in the context of breast cancer risk for Black women."
https://openalex.org/W2992692587,"Longitudinal data is commonly analysed to inform prevention policies for diseases that may develop throughout life. Commonly methods interpret the longitudinal data as a series of discrete measurements or as continuous patterns. Some of the latter methods condition on the outcome, aiming to capture ‘average’ patterns within outcome groups, while others capture individual-level pattern features before relating these to the outcome. Conditioning on the outcome may prevent meaningful interpretation. Repeated measurements of a longitudinal exposure (weight) and later outcome (glycated haemoglobin levels) were simulated to match three scenarios: one with no causal relationship between growth rate and glycated haemoglobin; two with a positive causal effect of growth rate on glycated haemoglobin. Two methods that condition on the outcome and one that did not were applied to the data in 1000 simulations. The interpretation of the two-step method matched the simulation in all causal scenarios, but that of the methods conditioning on the outcome did not. Methods that condition on the outcome do not accurately represent a causal relationship between a longitudinal pattern and outcome. Researchers considering longitudinal data should carefully determine if they wish to analyse longitudinal data as a series of discrete time points or by extracting pattern features."
https://openalex.org/W2992857715,"Kemp's ridley sea turtles were on the verge of extinction in the 1960s. While these sea turtles have slowly recovered, they are still critically endangered. In the last few years, the number of strandings on the beaches of Cape Cod, Massachusetts has increased by nearly an order of magnitude relative to preceding decades. This study uses a combination of ocean observations and a well-respected ocean model to investigate the causes and transport of cold-stunned sea turtles in Cape Cod Bay. After validating the model using satellite-tracked drifters and local temperature moorings, ocean currents were examined in Cape Cod Bay in an attempt to explain stranding locations as observed by volunteers and, for some years, backtracking was conducted to examine the potential source regions. The general finding of this study is that sub 10.5°C water temperatures in combination with persistently strong wind stress (>0.4 Pa), results in increased strandings along particular sections of the coast and are dependent on the wind direction. However, it is still uncertain where in the water column the majority of cold-stunned turtles reside and, if many of them are on the surface, considerable work will need to be done to incorporate the direct effects of wind and waves on the advective processes."
https://openalex.org/W2993917792,"The conceptualization of hospital quality indicators usually includes some form of risk adjustment to account for hospital differences in case mix. For binary outcome variables like in-hospital mortality, frequently utilized risk adjusted measures include the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), the risk standardized mortality rate (RSMR), and excess risk (ER). All of these measures require the estimation of expected hospital mortality, which is often based on logistic regression models. In this context, an issue that is often neglected is correlation between hospital performance (e.g. care quality) and patient-specific risk factors. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of such correlation on the adequacy of hospital rankings based on different measures and methods.Using Monte Carlo simulation, the impact of correlation between hospital care quality and patient-specific risk factors on the adequacy of hospital rankings was assessed for SMR/RSMR, and ER based on logistic regression and random effects logistic regression. As an alternative method, fixed effects logistic regression with Firth correction was considered. The adequacies of the resulting hospital rankings were assessed by the shares of hospitals correctly classified into quintiles according to their true (unobserved) care qualities.The performance of risk adjustment approaches based on logistic regression and random effects logistic regression declined when correlation between care quality and a risk factor was induced. In contrast, fixed-effects-based estimations proved to be more robust. This was particularly true for fixed-effects-logistic-regression-based ER. In the absence of correlation between risk factors and care quality, all approaches showed similar performance.Correlation between risk factors and hospital performance may severely bias hospital rankings based on logistic regression and random effects logistic regression. ER based on fixed effects logistic regression with Firth correction should be considered as an alternative approach to assess hospital performance."

https://openalex.org/W2994411757,"Whiplash injury is a common consequence of motor vehicle crashes (MVC), yet it is also one of the most poorly understood. While more than 50% of those injured should expect to rapidly recover, others are not as fortunate with approximately 25% of those exposed to and injured in an MVC transitioning from acute to chronic pain and disability. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine if the severity and direction of collisions involving participants enrolled in a longitudinal study of recovery from whiplash are able to differentiate between different recovery groups based on the neck disability index (NDI) percentage scores at 3-months, and if these crash specific parameters are associated with known risk factors for recovery. Here, we examined objective collision data, repair invoices, and characteristics of the crash for 37 acutely injured participants consented and enrolled at their emergency department visit and further assessed at three time points; < 1 week, 2-weeks, and 3-months post MVC. Collision data were used to reconstruct and estimate the severity of the crash and determine if they aligned with the heterogeneity of whiplash injury recovery. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine if % scores on the Neck Disability Index (NDI) at 3-months post MVC were associated with the following variables: sex, head turned at time of impact, seatbelt use, whether or not airbags deployed, if the vehicle was struck while stopped or while turning, or the principle direction of force (PDOF). Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to determine if NDI at 3-months post MVC was associated with age, Body Mass Index, pain-related disability at baseline, signs of post-traumatic distress, intrusion/hyperarousal, negative affect, pain intensity, estimated speed change from the impact, and damage estimates (in US$). There was a significant positive association between self-reported neck disability at 3-months post MVC, post-traumatic distress, negative affect and uncontrolled pain. There was no direct effect of participant characteristics, arousal, intrusion/hyperarousal sub-score, damage, PDOF, speed change, or other crash characteristics. Established crash parameters were not associated with the heterogeneity of whiplash injury recovery in a small sample of injured participants."

https://openalex.org/W2994302865,"WRI1 is a plant-specific transcription factor that enhances the accumulation of oils through the upregulation of the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, the EgWRI1 promoter from oil palm was isolated and characterized in transgenic Arabidopsis. The sequence analysis results revealed that various putative plant regulatory elements are present in the EgWRI1 promoter region. The EgWRI1 promoter and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene were transcriptionally fused and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana. Histochemical analysis revealed that GUS staining was very strong in whole seedlings, especially the stems, leaves, and siliques. Moreover, GUS staining was strong in the silique coats but weak in the seeds. Furthermore, to detect whether EgWRI1 was induced by environmental stress, we detected the expression efficiency of the EgWRI1 promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature, darkness, and exogenous ethylene. The results showed that the activity of the EgWRI1 promoter was induced by darkness but suppressed significantly when exposed to exogenous ethylene. When treated with low temperature, the activity of the EgWRI1 promoter was first reduced after 24 hours but recovered after 48 hours. Taken together, these results reveal the features of the EgWRI1 promoter from oil palm, which will be helpful for improving oil accumulation in oil palm via reasonable cultivation methods."
https://openalex.org/W2994576363,"ABO blood group has been associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, whether ABO blood group is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unknown. The present study aimed to clarify this issue.A hospital-based case-control study was performed in southwestern China. A total of 583 newly ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD cases and 2068 controls were included. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing NAFLD were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. A propensity score was developed for adjustment and matching.The proportions of blood groups A, B, AB and O were 31%, 26%, 8% and 35%, respectively. Non-O blood groups were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (the fully adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.91); moreover, compared with blood group O, the fully adjusted ORs of developing NAFLD were 1.50 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.99) for blood group A, 1.59 (95% CI: 1.19, 2.14) for blood group B, and 1.37 (95% CI: 0.86, 2.18) for blood group AB. Similar results were obtained in both propensity-score-adjusted and propensity-score-matched analyses. No evidence of significant effect modification for the association of ABO blood group with the risk of NAFLD was found (all Pinteraction>0.05).Non-O blood groups are significantly associated with an increased risk of NAFLD. Our findings provide some epidemiological evidence for a possible role of ABO glycosyltransferase in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, these findings need to be validated by future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2991049722,"The nonprofit Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) sponsors a series of Science Research Conferences (SRCs) each year. These conferences offer scientists a collegial and relaxing environment to discuss and explore new findings and approaches to specific research areas. The TGF-β Superfamily Conference: Signaling in Development and Disease was held in West Palm Beach, Florida, from July 28 to August 2, 2019, at the West Palm Beach Marriot hotel (Fig. 1). The conference focused on the roles that members of the TGF-β superfamily, such as TGF-β, Nodal, activin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and growth differentiation factor (GDF), exert in development and disease. Topics of discussion ranged from TGF-β signaling networks, crosstalk, and regulation to roles of TGF-β signaling on tissue growth, morphogenesis, and microenvironment dynamics, including inflammation, bone formation, vasculature development, and metabolism in development and diseases, as well as therapeutic frontiers of TGF-β signaling. The meeting was organized by Mary Mullins (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and Gareth Inman (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom). There were 29 invited and 1 keynote speaker, 22 speakers selected from the abstracts, and 48 poster presentations over the course of four and a half days. Newly added to this meeting were poster flash sessions, which were well received. Due to the format of this summary, we regret that only a few talks can be included here from this vibrant meeting. The European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) keynote lecture on the opening evening was given by Dr. Angela Nieto, PhD (Institute of Neuroscience, Spanish National Research Council-Miguel Hernández University, Elche, Spain). Dr. Nieto first gave an overview on epithelial plasticity in health and disease and reflected about how the field of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has developed over the last decades. EMT plays an important role in morphogenesis, stem cells, and tissue homeostasis, as well as in diseases like fibrosis and cancer, although universal markers to follow the EMT process have been difficult to identify. Dr. Nieto discussed this aspect and elaborated on the topic of partial vs. complete EMT. She also discussed the crucial role of the transcription factor Snail1 in renal fibrosis. Finally, she described novel and exciting data on the molecular mechanisms underlying left/right asymmetry pathways regulating the localization of the heart on the left side of the body in vertebrates. Nodal and BMP control a well-organized and asymmetric expression of a network of EMT transcription factors such as Snail1, paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 also known as pituitary homeobox 1 (Pitx1), and Pitx2, as well as several microRNAs, which together drive heart morphogenesis and laterality in a contextual and species-dependent manner. One of the major themes that emerged from the conference is the extensive crosstalk between TGF-β signaling and other signaling pathways and between different TGF-β family members. Following the keynote lecture, Dr. Rik Derynck from University of California San Francisco (UCSF; San Francisco, CA, USA) discussed the cooperation between Smad, a family of proteins similar to the gene products of the Drosophila gene “mothers against decapentaplegic” (Mad) and the Caernohabditis elegans gene Sma, and protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in completing EMT, as prolonged TGF-β exposure completes or stabilizes EMT, conferring enhanced stem cell characteristics and cancer drug resistance. He went on to emphasize that cells also control the TGF-β receptor availability at the cell surface and hence the responsiveness to (autocrine) TGF-β. Intriguingly, Akt, when activated, induces transport of TGF-β receptors from intracellular stores to the cell surface, thus representing a novel mode of signaling amplification. Moreover, he also reported evidence that insulin, as a potent inducer of Akt signaling, promotes enhanced TGF-β responsiveness and that enhanced autocrine TGF-β signaling participates extensively in the cellular gene expression and angiogenic response to insulin. The knowledge of a synergistic crosstalk between TGF-β and insulin is expected to have future impact on our understanding of key events occurring in cancer cells. Dr. Joan Massaguè (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA), discussed the potent role of rat sarcoma (RAS)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling acting together with TGF-β signaling to strongly activate a very specific subset of target genes including Snail1 in order to trigger EMT plus fibrogenesis in adult epithelial progenitors and EMT plus differentiation in embryonic mesoderm progenitors. The MAPK input through a previously underappreciated RAS effector transcription factor leads to recruitment of TGF-β-activated Smads to specific gene loci driving the aforementioned responses in different contexts. The work promises to advance our knowledge of TGF-β-activated EMT programs in development, fibrosis, and cancer. Dr. Carl-Henrik Heldin (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) then further discussed the crosstalk between TGF-β-Smad canonical signaling and JunB proto-oncogene, AP-l transcription factor subunit in regulating gene expression and cell invasion, from work done in collaboration with Peter Ten Dijke's laboratory. He also discussed the ways known today to interfere with TGF-β signaling that are causing cancer while leaving the growth inhibitory TGF-β signaling pathways intact. Multiple talks discussed the roles of TGF-β signaling and its regulation in cancer and various diseases. Dr. Peter ten Dijke (Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) described recent research from his laboratory on the identification of a deubiquitinating enzyme that promotes TGF-β–induced extravasation and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Significantly, higher levels of this enzyme were detected in the serum of patients with triple-negative breast cancer compared with normal control serum. Ten Dijke also discussed their findings regarding GREM1, DAN family BMP antagonist, an inhibitory regulator of BMP signaling whose elevated expression correlates with poorer breast cancer survival rates. GREM1 protein is produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts and promotes their fibrogenic activation and also the invasion of adjacent breast cancer cells. These novel data might become useful in the future to identify risk factors for women with breast cancer. Dr. Xia Lin (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA) presented their novel findings on how the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tumor-promoting protein counteracts the tumor-suppressing effects of the TGF-β-canonical Smad signaling pathway by binding to Smad4 and phosphorylating Smad4 on Tyr95 in its Mad homology 1 (MH1) at the N-terminus, thereby counteracting the DNA-binding capability of Smad4. Similarly, they found that other tyrosine kinases can also phosphorylate Smad4 and inhibit the antiproliferative activity of TGF-β signaling. These findings provide insight into the interplay between oncoproteins and tumor suppressors in tumorigenesis. Further insights in the crosstalk between different TGF-β family members were provided by Dr. Caroline Hill (The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom). She presented interesting data from genetic studies in zebrafish in which CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) was used to knock out Smad4a, the major Smad4 in early embryos. Zebrafish deficient of both maternal and zygotic Smad4a showed a severe phenotype, and a high number of genes were found to be deregulated, demonstrating the crucial role for Smad4 in normal embryogenesis. Surprisingly though, not all transcription downstream of TGF-β family ligands was equally affected. In Smad4a mutant embryos, the BMP-induced transcriptional response was substantially reduced, whereas Nodal-induced transcription was much less affected, with Nodal target genes simply showing delayed kinetics in the Smad4a mutants relative to wild type. The data suggest that Nodal-induced transcription is substantially Smad4 independent. Dr. Petra Knaus (Freie Universität, Berlin, Germany) discussed the powerful physiologic effects of various kinds of mechanical forces that cells are exposed to, which impact on gene regulation. Loss of BMP receptor (BMPR) 2 expression in endothelial cells or endothelial cells from patients with pulmonary artery hypertension carrying BMPR2 mutations led to a gain of TGF-β-Smad signaling and a change of biophysical properties of the cells. In particular, these cells showed up-regulation of fibrillin1 and β1 integrin expression, the latter facilitating retrieval of active TGF-β from its latent deposits following a mechanical input. Fibrillin1 itself acts as a scaffold to bind the latent TGF-β binding protein. Dr. Knaus also described the intriguing role of the guidance receptor Unc-5 netrin receptor B, which brings TGF-β and BMP receptors together into higher-order clusters to thereby enhance expression of the antiangiogenic factors Hes related family BHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif (HEY) 1/2 and Jagged1 to promote vascular homeostasis. Dr. David Dichek (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) reported on the essential role of physiologic TGF-β signaling via the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) for normal development of the heart and aorta. In their recent research, they have found that postnatal smooth muscle TβRII expression is absolutely required to preserve aortic homeostasis, as 40% of smooth muscle from TβRII–/– mice develops early aortic intramural bleeding and 100% goes on to develop aneurysmal dilation. Dr. Dichek also discussed the sophisticated crosstalk between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall that dictates the normal contractility of the vessels and the involvement of TGF-β signaling in this crosstalk. These data may have great impact on our understanding of mechanisms of aneurysm formation and may affect future therapeutic interventions aimed at treating aneurysmal disease. Dr. Maurizio Pacifici (The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA) discussed the roles of heparan sulfate (HS) in regulating bioavailability and signaling of TGF-β superfamily members through its interactions with their Cardin-Weintraub HS-binding domain. He talked about the presence of distinct Cardin-Weintraub domains in different TGF-β family members and the antagonistic effects of HS on BMP signaling. The latter is particularly relevant to the pediatric congenital disorder multiple osteochondroma, in which loss-of-function mutations in the Golgi HS polymerases exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 or 2 (EXT1/2) cause HS deficiency, higher BMP signaling, and osteochondroma formation. These findings provide insights for possible therapeutic interventions on multiple osteochondroma and other diseases caused by deregulated TGF-β signaling. Several talks at the conference focused on studies that provide insight into the mechanistic understanding of the signal transduction mechanism at the ligand-receptor level. Dr. Thomas Thompson (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA) discussed the structural basis of ligand-receptor interactions. In particular, he talked about the crystal structure of the ternary complex of an activin class member. The structure, which consists of Activin A receptor, type IIB (ActRIIB)/ activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/GDF11, revealed insight into how the activin class utilizes a third binding paradigm for receptor specificity, which includes novel interactions with the ligand fingertips and the type I receptor. These structural studies also revealed how TGF-β and activin class ligands differently engage the common type I receptor Alk5. Whereas TGF-β relies on cooperative interactions with TβRII, GDF11 utilizes a “knob-in-hole” mechanism. These structural insights allowed them to create mutations in Alk5 that ablated GDF11 signaling but with limited effect on TGF-β. In a short talk selected from the abstracts, Benjamin Tajer from Dr. Mary Mullins' laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania presented elegant studies on the roles of type I and type II receptors in a BMP heterodimer-receptor complex. The Mullins group has previously shown that BMP2/7 heterodimers function in dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish embryos and that these heterodimers act through 2 different type I receptors, Bmpr1 and Activin A receptor type 1 (Acvr1). Intriguingly, these type I receptors exhibit differential kinase activity requirements. These studies raised important questions regarding the specific roles of each of the 2 type I and 2 type II receptor molecules in the tetrameric receptor complex in BMP signaling. Dr. Hamed Jafar-Nejad from Baylor College of Medicine discussed the roles of deglycosylation in the regulation of BMP signaling. Their work is focused on N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1), an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic enzyme that removes N-glycans from glycoproteins. Using Drosophila and mammalian cells as models, Dr. Jafar-Nejad's group has found that NGLY1 is required in BMP signal-sending cells to promote BMP signaling. These findings highlight the importance of glycosylation in regulating BMP signaling and provide a framework for understanding the basis for the human disease caused by NGLY1 deficiency. The Anita Roberts travel award, which was established to celebrate the pioneering work of Dr. Anita Roberts (1942–2006) in the TGF-β field and her contribution in mentoring the next generation of scientists, was given to Dr. Iacovos Michael, postdoc at Ecole polytechnique féderalé de Lausanne (EPFL)-Lausanne (Lausanne, Switzerland), with a talk titled MicroRNA-Mediated Suppression of the ALK7 Homeostatic Tissue Barrier Enables Tumorigenesis and Metastasis; to Giulia Boezio, graduate student at Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research-Bad Nauheim (Bad Nauheim, Germany), with a talk titled Endothelium-Smooth Muscle Cross-talk in the Developing Cardiac Outflow Tract is Orchestrated by ALK5 Signaling; to Dr. Luisina Ongaro Gambino, postdoc at McGill University (Montreal, Quebec, Canada), with a talk titled Mice Lacking ALK4 and ALK5 in Gonadotropes are FSH Deficient and Hypogonadal; and to Erich Goebel, graduate student at the University of Cincinnati, with a talk titled Structural Characterization of an Activin Class Ternary Receptor Complex Reveals a Third Paradigm for Receptor Specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2992166612,"The 3’-end of the coding sequence in several species is known to show specific codon usage bias. Several factors have been suggested to underlie this phenomenon, including selection against translation efficiency, selection for translation accuracy, and selection against RNA folding. All are supported by some evidence, but there is no general agreement as to which factors are the main determinants. Nor is it known how universal this phenomenon is, and whether the same factors explain it in different species. To answer these questions, we developed a measure that quantifies the codon usage bias at the gene end, and used it to compute this bias for 91 species that span the three domains of life. In addition, we characterized the codons in each species by features that allow discrimination between the different factors. Combining all these data, we were able to show that there is a universal trend to favor AT-rich codons toward the gene end. Moreover, we suggest that this trend is explained by avoidance from forming RNA secondary structures around the stop codon, which may interfere with normal translation termination."
https://openalex.org/W2992949664,"Leptospira genus contains species that affect human health with varying degrees of pathogenicity. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the differences in the modulation of host gene expression by strains of Leptospira varying in virulence. Our data showed a high number of differentially expressed transcripts in murine macrophages following 6h of infection. Leptospira infection modulated a set of genes independently of their degree of virulence. However, pathway analysis indicated that Apoptosis, ATM Signaling, and Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation were exclusively regulated following infection with the virulent strain. Taken together, results demonstrated that species and virulence play a role during host response to Leptospira spp in murine macrophages, which could contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of leptospirosis."

https://openalex.org/W2993221680,"Although maternal survival has improved in the last decades, evidence on illnesses and the use of health services during pregnancy remains scarce. Therefore, we aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors for illnesses among pregnant women and measure the use of health services. A prospective cohort study was conducted in three kebeles in rural southern Ethiopia among 794 pregnant women from May 2017 to July 2018. Each woman was followed every two weeks at home. Poisson and survival regression models were used for analysis. The incidence rate of episodes of illnesses was 93 per 100 pregnant-woman-weeks (95%CI: 90.6, 94.2), with an average of eight episodes of illnesses per woman. Anaemia accounted for 22% (177 of 794 women), and hypertension 3% (21 women of 794 women). However, utilization of health services for any illness episodes was only 8% (95%CI: 7.6%, 8.9%). The main reasons for not using health services were that the women thought the illness would heal by itself, women thought the illness was not serious, women could not afford to visit the health institutions, or women lacked confidence in the health institutions. The risk factors for illnesses are having many previous pregnancies in life time (ARR = 1.42; 95%CI = 1.02, 1.96), having history of stillbirth (ARR = 1.30; 95%CI = 1.03, 1.64), having history of abortion (AHR = 1.06; 95%CI = 1.02, 1.11), and walking more than 60 minutes to access the nearest hospital (AHR = 1.08; 95%CI = 1.03, 1.14). The risk factors for low use of health services are also having history of abortion (AHR = 2.50; 95%CI = 1.00, 6.01) and walking more than 60 minutes to access the nearest hospital (AHR = 1.91; 95%CI = 1.00, 3.63). Rural Ethiopian pregnant women experience a high burden of illness during pregnancy. Unfortunately, very few of these women utilize health services."
https://openalex.org/W2991493956,"Each year, a series of Science Research Conferences (SRCs) are sponsored by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), a nonprofit federation of 29 research societies representing 130,000 scientists. These meetings allow experimental biologists to meet in a relaxing, collegial atmosphere and explore new approaches to current research areas. The Smooth Muscle Conference was held in Palm Beach, Florida, July 14–19, 2019 at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel (Fig. 1). This conference continued a tradition of FASEB SRCs focused on smooth muscle research that began in 1982. This year's conference was the 13th in this highly successful series and focused on physiologic functions and pathologic alterations in smooth muscle cells. Goals were to explore physiological signaling and functions of smooth muscle cells, to examine pathologic alterations in smooth muscle function, and to develop novel approaches to target signaling networks in smooth muscle cells to alleviate diseases. Presenters discussed research into a variety of different types of smooth muscle cells, including those in the vasculature, airways, bladder, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and lymphatic system. There was 1 keynote speaker, 32 invited speakers, 4 new and notable/young investigator talks, 8 short talks, and 45 poster presentations over the course of the five and a half days. Sessions were divided into the following foci: ion channels, intracellular signaling, intercellular communication, phenotypic modulation, mechanosensing and regulation of contractility, pathophysiology and disease, microRNAs/long noncoding RNAs/novel regulators, and circulation. The conference also included a Career-Oriented Workshop and a “Meet the Expert” session for trainees to meet speakers. A group photograph of the conference attendees is provided with this summary. Dr. John G. McCarron (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland) set the stage for the conference with his keynote lecture, which took place on the first evening of the conference. Dr. McCarron described studies in which his laboratory had used novel approaches to measure the properties, structure, and dynamics of mitochondria in differentiated and dedifferentiated arterial smooth muscle cells in health and disease. He illustrated how mitochondria size, shape, density, positioning, clustering, and motility can alter associated calcium signaling and function. He also described how hypertension and aging are associated with changes in the properties of mitochondria in smooth muscle cells. On the first full day, Dr. Fernando Santana (University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA) explained studies in his laboratory that have used superresolution microscopy and modeling to examine ion channel cluster formation. Their data revealed that voltage-dependent calcium (Ca2+, CaV1.2), transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), and large-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (BK) channels are randomly inserted in the plasma membrane, where they form homogeneous clusters of steady-state size. This clustering mechanism is common to a wide range of cell types, including smooth muscle cells. Dr. Scott Earley (University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, NV, USA) gave a talk on the second day describing mechanisms that regulate brain regional blood flow. He outlined studies which concluded that reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels in cerebral capillary endothelial cells leads to the stimulation of small-conductance (SK) and intermediate-conductance (IK) channels that contributes to functional hyperemia in the brain. The importance of the histone acetyltransferases p300 and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) in the regulation of smooth muscle cell plasticity was presented in great detail by Dr. Kathleen Martin (Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA). She showed that CBP and p300 perform opposite functions in regulating vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. CBP and p300 are distinctly regulated by dedifferentiation and prodifferentiation stimuli, with p300 acting in part via interaction with tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2). The importance of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) editing in the study of smooth muscle was provided by Dr. Joseph Miano (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA). He shared his laboratory's recent progress in the modeling of single nucleotide polymorphisms and the insertion of epitope tags to study difficult-to-detect proteins. He also expanded upon the insertion of loxP sites to generate conditional alleles and the significance of embryonic stem cells for new mouse models that are difficult to make with the CRISPR/Cas9. Ionic mechanisms that control lymphatic smooth muscle pacemaking were described by Dr. Michael Davis (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA). He outlined work from his laboratory that showed the Ca2+-activated chloride channel, Ano1, contributes a depolarizing current that drives diastolic depolarization to trigger CaV1.2-dependent action potentials. Dr. Curt Sigmund (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA) opened day 4 by speaking in a session he also chaired. His discussion centered around defining a mechanism of action of Rho-related BTB domain-containing protein 1 (RhoBTB1), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) target gene, in vascular smooth muscle. He concluded that RhoBTB1 can protect from vascular smooth muscle dysfunction and arterial stiffness during hypertension. Dr. Iris Jaffe (Tufts University Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA) talked about the involvement of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) during aging. Her laboratory found that smooth muscle cell mineralocorticoid receptors regulate blood pressure during aging. This occurs through miR-155-mediated promotion of vasoconstriction and vascular stiffness via vascular fibrosis gene expression. The fifth day of the meeting was a morning-only session, in which Dr. Brant Isakson (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA) began with the role of pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels, which localize to afferent arterioles and juxtaglomerular cells and form transmembrane conduits that support ATP release in the kidney and the vasculature. He discussed that Panx1 channels in renin-expressing cells affect renin dynamics and can suppress autonomous renin secretion and regulate renin-cell fate and plasticity. Results from the feedback evaluation were very positive regarding the organization of the meeting and its interesting and diverse topics. More than 95% of attendees gave favorable comments regarding the general sessions, poster sessions, and scientific content. It is astounding that virtually all respondents indicated that they plan to attend this meeting in 3 years time and would recommend attending this meeting to other researchers. Special thanks go to FASEB for a truly supportive and encouraging role throughout the organization of the 2019 conference. This 2019 FASEB meeting was supported by generous contributions from Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH and Sanofi-Aventis.

https://openalex.org/W2992184412,"'This study aims to establish an open-source algorithm using Python to analyze the accuracy of guided implantation, which simplifies interstudy comparisons.Given ≥3 landmark pairs, this Tri-Point (TriP) method can register images. With ≥4 landmark pairs, TriP can calculate system errors for image registration. We selected 8 indicators from the literature. Considering development errors in new bone on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), we added the indicators of apical rectified deviation (ARD) and coronal rectified deviation (CRD), providing accurate references but neglecting depth deviations. Our program can calculate and output these indicators. To evaluate the TriP method's feasibility, an implantation group assisted by a Visual Direction-INdicating Guide (VDING) was analyzed. Accuracy was measured with the traditional and proposed TriP methods. Factors affecting the system error of the method were then analyzed.Comparisons with paired-sample t-tests showed that our TriP method was similar to the traditional method in evaluating implantation accuracy, with no significant difference (P>0.05). The average system error was 0.30±0.10 mm when the TriP method evaluated the VDING template. The results showed that increasing the provided landmarks from 4 to 5 pairs decreased the between-group differences significantly (P<0.05). With ≥6 pairs of landmarks, the system error tended to be stable, and the groups showed no statistically significant differences (P>0.05). Large distances between landmarks are helpful in reducing system error, as demonstrated with a geometric method.This study established an open-source algorithm to analyze the accuracy of guided implantation with system errors reported."
https://openalex.org/W2992250344,"In transgenic research, selection markers have greatly facilitated the generation of transgenic animals. A prerequisite for a suitable selection marker to be used along with a test gene of interest is that the marker should not affect the phenotype of interest in transformed animals. One of the most common selection markers used in C. elegans transgenic approaches is the rol-6 co-injection marker, which induces a behavioral roller phenotype due to a cuticle defect but is not known to have other side effects. However, we found that the rol-6 co-injection marker can cause expression of GFP in the test sequence in a male-specific interneuron called CP09. We found that the rol-6 gene sequence included in the marker plasmid is responsible for this unwanted expression. Accordingly, the use of the rol-6 co-injection marker is not recommended when researchers intend to examine precise expression or perform functional studies especially targeting male C. elegans neurons. The rol-6 sequence region we identified can be used to drive a specific expression in CP09 neuron for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2992885419,"Tourism is a worldwide practice with international tourism revenues increasing from US\$495 billion in 2000 to US\$1340 billion in 2017. Its relevance to the economy of many countries is obvious. Even though the World Airline Network (WAN) is global and has a peculiar construction, the International Tourism Network (ITN) is very similar to a random network and barely global in its reach. To understand the impact of global distances on local flows, we map the flow of tourists around the world onto a complex network and study its topological and dynamical balance. We find that although the WAN serves as infrastructural support for the ITN, the flow of tourism does not correlate strongly with the extent of flight connections worldwide. Instead, unidirectional flows appear locally forming communities that shed light on global travelling behaviour inasmuch as there is only a 15% probability of finding bidirectional tourism between a pair of countries. We conjecture that this is a consequence of one-way cyclic tourism by analyzing the triangles that are formed by the network of flows in the ITN. Finally, we find that most tourists travel to neighbouring countries and mainly cover larger distances when there is a direct flight, irrespective of the time it takes."
