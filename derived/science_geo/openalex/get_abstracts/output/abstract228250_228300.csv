C75, a fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor, causes weight loss and anorexia, implying a novel central nervous system pathway(s) for sensing energy balance. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of peripheral energy balance, is phosphorylated and activated when energy sources are low. Here, we identify a role for hypothalamic AMPK in the regulation of feeding behavior and in mediating the anorexic effects of C75. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an activator of AMPK, increased food intake, whereas compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, decreased food intake. C75 rapidly reduced the level of the phosphorylated AMPK α subunit (pAMPKα) in the hypothalamus, even in fasted mice that had elevated hypothalamic pAMPKα levels. Furthermore, AICAR reversed both the C75-induced anorexia and the decrease in hypothalamic pAMPKα levels. C75 elevated hypothalamic neuronal ATP levels, which may contribute to the mechanism by which C75 decreased AMPK activity. C75 reduced the levels of pAMPKα and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) in the arcuate nucleus neurons of the hypothalamus, suggesting a mechanism for the reduction in NPY expression seen with C75 treatment. These data indicate that modulation of FAS activity in the hypothalamus can alter energy perception via AMPK, which functions as a physiological energy sensor in the hypothalamus.

Despite significant advances in the understanding of appetite and satiety at molecular levels (1Wilding J.P. Diabet. Med. 2002; 19: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.

In addition to FAS inhibition, C75 also stimulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity, increasing fatty acid oxidation and ATP levels (8Thupari J.N. Landree L.E. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9498-9502Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Since enzymes of the fatty acid metabolic pathways are highly expressed in hypothalamic neurons that regulate feeding behavior (9Kim E.K. Miller I. Landree L.E. Borisy-Rudin F.F. Brown P. Tihan T. Townsend C.A. Witters L.A. Moran T.H. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E867-E879Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that C75-induced alterations in fatty acid metabolism may affect neuronal energy flux, which could signal a change in energy status, leading to changes in feeding behavior. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is activated by metabolic stresses such as nutrient starvation (10da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Salt I.P. Doiron B. Hardie D.G. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. Proc. Natl.

Specifically, increases in the AMP/ATP ratio, decreases in cellular pH, and increases in the creatine/phosphocreatine ratio are known to activate AMPK via allosteric activation of AMPK by AMP and by phosphorylation of AMPK by AMPKK (14Ponticos M.

Once activated, AMPK switches off ATP-consuming biosynthetic pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and switches on ATP-generating metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation to preserve ATP levels (20Corton J.M.

Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) make it a candidate metabolic sensor in the hypothalamus to relay changes in metabolism. Furthermore, emerging reports (24Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Kraegen E.W. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 25Andersson U. Filipsson K. Abbott C.R. Woods A.

Therefore, we chose to study AMPK as a candidate metabolic sensor in the hypothalamus, which might perceive changes in energy status caused by C75. Animals—All animal experiments were done in accordance with guidelines on animal care and use established by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male BALB/c mice (7–9 weeks) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (and housed in a controlled-light (a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle) environment (lights on 0200 to 1400 h) and allowed ad libitum access to standard laboratory chow and water. For fasting, food was withdrawn from cage at the onset of the dark cycle for 24 h, but ad libitum access to water was allowed. Measurement of Food Intake—Mice were implanted with permanent stainless steel cannulae into the lateral ventricle of the brain 0.6 mm caudal to Bregma, 1.2 mm lateral to the midline, and sunk to a depth of 2.2 mm below the surface of the skull. Implanted mice were housed in individual cages and utilized for intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections as indicated. C75 dissolved in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.), or compound C (26Fraley M.E. Rubino R.S. Hoffman W.F. Hambaugh S.R. Arrington K.L. Hungate R.W. Bilodeau M.T. Tebben A.J. Rutledge R.Z. Kendall R.L. McFall R.C. Huckle W.R. Coll K.E. Thomas K.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12 (K. L.): 3537-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (FASgen, Inc.) in saline was injected i.c.v. such that the desired dose could be administered in a volume of 2.5 μl, while control groups received vehicle only. Injections were done immediately preceding dark onset, and food intake measurements were taken at 1 h (0–1-h interval), 3 h (1–3-h interval), and 24 h (3–24-h interval) after dark onset. C75 i.p./AICAR i.c.v. treatment groups were i.p. injected with 5 mg/kg of body weight C75 dissolved in 200 μl of glucose-free RPMI 1 h before the dark onset, followed by 3 μg/2.5 μl of saline i.c.v. AICAR immediately preceding the dark onset. Control groups received 200 μl of glucose-free RPMI 1 h before lights off and 2.5 μl of saline. Administration of i.p. compound C (10 or 30 mg/kg of body weight) or C75 (10 mg/kg of bodyweight) was followed by food intake measurement at the same times indicated. Western Blot Analysis—Hypothalami were dissected using as land-marks the optic chiasm rostrally, and the mammillary bodies caudally to a depth of 2 mm. Dissected hypothalamic and liver tissue were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). SDS detergent was added to a final 0.2%, and lysates were boiled for 5 min. After the supernatant was harvested, protein concentration was determined by BCA kit (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylation of AMPKα was determined on a 4–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel using anti-phospho-AMPKα (α1 and α2, Thr172) antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling). Anti-AMPKα antibody (α1 and α2, 1:1000, Cell Signaling) was used as a loading control. Primary Hypothalamic Neuron Cultures and ATP Measurement— Hypothalami were dissected from E17 Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) and dissociated by trypsin (0.125%)-DNA (0.001%) solution and trituration as described previously (27Landree L.E. Hanlon A.L. Strong D.W. Rumbaugh G. Miller I.M. Thupari J.N. Connolly E.C. Huganir R.L. Richardson C. Witters L.A. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3817-3827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 6 × 104 on poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Corning Inc.) in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). To limit non-neuronal cell proliferation, cells were treated with cytosine arabinoside furanoside (1 μm) on day 4 after plating, and 6–8-day-old cells were assayed for ATP. Hypothalamic neurons were lysed in TE (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA), and ATP levels were measured within the linear range using the ATP BioLuminescence Kit CLSII (Roche Applied Science) by following the manufacture's recommendation. Data were analyzed by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor2 1420. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Hypothalamic total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and Northern blot analysis using 15 μg of total RNA was performed as described previously (9Kim E.K. Miller I. Landree L.E. Borisy-Rudin F.F. Brown P. Tihan T. Townsend C.A. Witters L.A. Moran T.H. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E867-E879Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). RNA was hybridized with random primed 32P-labeled DNA probes made from cloned plasmids of mouse AGRP (GenBank™ accession number U89486), human NPY (GenBank™ accession number XM004941), rat CART (GenBank™ accession number U10071), and mouse POMC (GenBank™ accession number AH005319). As a loading control, the probe for mouse GAPDH gene was used at the same blot. The signals were quantified using an image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences) and Imagequant software. Immunohistochemistry—Floating brain sections were prepared as described previously (9Kim E.K. Miller I. Landree L.E. Borisy-Rudin F.F. Brown P. Tihan T. Townsend C.A. Witters L.A. Moran T.H. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E867-E879Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with modifications (28Shimizu-Albergine M. Ippolito D.L. Beavo J.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free-floating sections were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with anti-phospho-AMPKα (α1 and α2) antibody (1:100) or anti-phospho-CREB antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF overnight at 4 °C. Signal was visualized by using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector). In Situ Hybridization—Antisense digoxigenin-labeled NPY riboprobe was generated from a plasmid containing the NPY gene (GenBank™ accession number XM004941). Hybridization and washing were performed as described previously (9Kim E.K. Miller I. Landree L.E. Borisy-Rudin F.F. Brown P. Tihan T. Townsend C.A. Witters L.A. Moran T.H. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E867-E879Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For double fluorescent in situ hybridization, digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe was generated from plasmid containing AMPKα2 gene (pEBGα2, a gift from L. A. Witters) for AMPKα2 (FITC), and biotin-labeled riboprobe was used for NPY (Texas Red). Sheep FITC-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:50, Roche Applied Science) was incubated in TNB buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% blocking reagent) for FITC detection. Streptavidin-Texas Red (1:50, Amersham Biosciences), rabbit anti-Texas Red antibody (1: 50, Molecular Probes), goat biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and streptavidin-Texas Red (1:30) were incubated serially in TNB buffer for Texas Red detection. Analysis and Quantification of Images—Images of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were visualized using an Axiocam HRc digital camera (Carl Zeiss), and images were acquired using Improvision Openlab software and quantified by NIH Image program (Macro). Statistical Analysis—All values are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or t test. Feeding Behavior Is Changed by C75, AICAR, or Compound C Treatment—We investigated the relationships among C75-induced alterations in fatty acid metabolism, AMPK activation or inhibition, and feeding behavior. We utilized mice implanted with i.c.v. cannulae to measure food intake after dark onset administration of C75 (Fig. 1a). All mice had access to food ad libitum during the 24-h cycle. C75 significantly reduced food intake during the 1–3- and 3–24-h time intervals in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). Injection of 5 and 10 μg of C75 caused a 20.3% (p < 0.05) and 37.7% (p < 0.01) reduction in food intake over 24 h, respectively. The 10-μg dose also produced a reduction in bodyweight (Fig. 1d). Consistent with our previous report (4Loftus T. Jaworsky D. Frehywot G. Townsend C. Ronnett G. Lane M. Kuhajda F. Science. 2000; 288: 2379-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), these results indicate that C75 reduces food intake via central mechanism(s). AICAR, a compound that stimulates AMPK activity, is taken up into cells and phosphorylated to form ZMP (29Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which mimics the effects of AMP on AMPK activation (30Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We chose a pharmacological approach to alter AMPK activity, as opposed to a genetic approach, as we wished to be able to reverse the effects of inhibition on a rapid time scale. We determined the time course of action of AICAR, as its effect may be transient, since it is further metabolized (31Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In contrast to the feeding inhibition produced by C75, i.c.v. administration of AICAR increased food intake. A dose of 3 μg increased food intake to 230% (p < 0.01) within 1 h and 135% (p < 0.01) at 3–24 h, and total 24-h food intake was increased to 130% of control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1b). Consistent with the recent finding (25Andersson U. Filipsson K. Abbott C.R. Woods A. Smith K. Bloom S.R. Carling D. Small C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12005-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), the i.c.v. injection of AICAR increased food intake. Despite this increase in food intake, this single dose of AICAR has no significant effect on body weight (Fig. 1d). Body weight does not always change in proportion to food intake (32Abu-Elheiga L. Matzuk M.M. Abo-Hashema K.A. Wakil S.J. Science. 2001; 291: 2613-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). A previous report noted that chronic subcutaneous injection of AICAR (1 g/kg body weight) for 4 weeks had no impact on either food intake or body weight (33Winder W.W. Holmes B.F. Rubink D.S. Jensen E.B. Chen M. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) but that there was a reduction in fat pad mass and an increase in liver mass. Thus, i.c.v. administration of a single dose of AICAR may have an effect on the mass of these peripheral tissues, such that body weight does not change despite increased food intake. To confirm the effect of AMPK on food intake, we used compound C, which is a selective AMPK inhibitor (34Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4407) Google Scholar, 35Lee M. Hwang J.T. Lee H.J. Jung S.N. Kang I. Chi S.G. Kim S.S. Ha J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39653-39661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 36Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar). The i.c.v. injection of 5 μg of compound C caused a 36.2, 37.8, and 35.6% reduction in food intake at 0–1, 3–24 h and over 24 h, respectively (Fig. 1c). This dosage of compound C led to a weight loss (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, as with the stimulatory effect of AICAR on feeding, the inhibitory effect of compound C on feeding was profound at 0–1 h and 3–24 h. The i.p. injection of compound C also had a similar reduction in food intake (Fig. 1e), showing that a higher dose (30 mg/kg body weight) decreased food intake during all time intervals (27.4, 3.68, 65.7, and 57.8% of control during 0–1, 1–3, 3–24 h and total, respectively). Even though AICAR or compound C may have additional cellular effects that cannot be excluded, the opposite results on food intake obtained using an AMPK activator and inhibitor supports the hypothesis that AMPK is involved in feeding behavior. We determined the time course of action of the i.p. C75 administration, with the intention of utilizing this route of administration for C75 in further experiments designed to compare the central and peripheral effects of C75 on the change in AMPK activation and to combine C75 and AICAR treatments. Administration of C75 i.p. (10 mg/kg of body weight) caused a dramatic decrease in food intake during all intervals measured (8.3, 23.3, and 30.1% of control during 0–1, 1–3, and 3–24 h, respectively) (Fig. 1f). Total 24-h food consumption was significantly reduced to 26.3% of control (p < 0.001). The effect of C75 on food intake was more pronounced and lasted longer than that of compound C. The greater magnitude of the effect following peripheral administration of C75 on food intake compared with the i.c.v. route of administration may reflect the larger dose that can be administered via this route or an additional peripheral effect of this compound. Collectively, these results demonstrate that C75 and compound C (administered either i.c.v. or i.p.) produce opposite effects on food intake over similar time courses compared with i.c.v. administration of AICAR. C75 Decreases the Phosphorylation of Hypothalamic AMPK— The hypothalamus plays an important role in monitoring energy balance and integrating peripheral signals that affect food intake (1Wilding J.P. Diabet. Med. 2002; 19: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M. Woods S. Porte D.J. Seeley R. Baskin D. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4865) Google Scholar). Although the expression of AMPK in brain has been reported (37Turnley A.M. Stapleton D. Mann R.J. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1707-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 38Culmsee C. Monnig J. Kemp B.E. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), its function in the brain is unknown. C75 inhibits FAS and stimulates CPT-1, the enzyme that imports palmitate into the mitochondrion for β-oxidation (8Thupari J.N. Landree L.E. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9498-9502Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Both of these actions may signal a positive energy balance in neurons of the hypothalamus, which may inactivate hypothalamic AMPK. To examine the effect of C75 on hypothalamic AMPK activity, we determined the effect of C75 treatment on the level of phosphorylation of the α catalytic subunit (18Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol.

Mice received vehicle, 5 μg, or 10 μg of C75 i.c.v., and the levels of hypothalamic pAMPKα were determined by Western blot. The level of AMPKα (α1 and α2 subunits) served as a loading control. Compared with levels of pAMPKα in vehicle-treated control animals, C75 reduced the levels of pAMPKα (α1 and α2) in the hypothalamus 3- and 6-fold at 30 min and 3-h, respectively (Fig. 2, a and b). As seen with central administration of C75, i.p. injection of C75 (10 mg/kg of body weight) significantly reduced the levels of pAMPKα in the hypothalamus at 30 min and 3 h (Fig. 2, c and d). In contrast, C75 had little effect on pAMPKα levels in the liver 30 min after administration but increased pAMPKα levels at 3 h (Fig. 2, e and f). These results demonstrated that C75 treatment rapidly decreased AMPK activity in the hypothalamus. The decrease in hypothalamic pAMPKα levels could result from the metabolic changes that occur as a result of FAS inhibition, which would diminish energy expenditure and signal a favorable energy balance. These results also indicate that the phosphorylation of AMPK is regulated differently in the hypothalamus than in the liver in response to C75. This difference most likely reflects differences between metabolic pathways, or the flux through those pathways, found in neurons and in liver. By 3 h, the decreased food intake seen with C75 treatment may signal an energy poor state in liver (Fig. 2e), leading to AMPK activation, indicating an attempt to preserve energy levels through the stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, for example. C75 Decreases the Fasting-induced Phosphorylation of Hypothalamic AMPK—It has been shown that the activity of AMPK is elevated in fasted rat liver (39Witters L.A. Gao G. Kemp B.E. Quistorff B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate whether hypothalamic AMPK is responsive to fasting, the level of pAMPKα was monitored after withdrawal of food at the onset of dark cycle in mice fed ad libitum. There was no change in pAMPKα levels within 3 h of food withdrawal (Fig. 3, a and b). However, fasting for 24 h resulted in a 2-fold stimulation in the level of hypothalamic pAMPKα (Fig. 3, a and b). While one report (40Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) noted no difference in AMPK activity between dark and light cycles in rats fed ad libitum, only one time point (6 h) was investigated, without correlation to feeding profile in the interval before this measurement was made. Our results suggest that the activation of hypothalamic AMPK could be involved in the fasting-induced stimulation of food intake. We next examined whether C75 could reduce AMPK phosphorylation in the setting of fasting, when AMPK phosphorylation is increased. This is important in establishing a link between C75-induced FAS inhibition and AMPK activity, as C75 does inhibit feeding even in fasted mice (4Loftus T. Jaworsky D. Frehywot G. Townsend C. Ronnett G. Lane M. Kuhajda F. Science. 2000; 288: 2379-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 8Thupari J.N. Landree L.E. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9498-9502Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After 24 h of fasting, either vehicle (RPMI) or C75 was administrated i.p. and the levels of hypothalamic pAMPKα were determined. C75 treatment profoundly reduced the level of pAMPKα compared with that of control (Fig. 3, c and d). Given our observation that C75 suppresses food intake even in fasted mice, the ability of C75 to reduce the levels of pAMPKα in fasted mice supports the hypothesis that C75 might inhibit feeding, at least in part, by an AMPK-mediated mechanism. C75 Increases the Hypothalamic Neuronal ATP Level—It has been shown that C75 increases ATP levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8Thupari J.N. Landree L.E. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9498-9502Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and even in primary cortical neurons (27Landree L.E. Hanlon A.L. Strong D.W. Rumbaugh G. Miller I.M. Thupari J.N. Connolly E.C.

Since an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio is known to activate AMPK (15Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 16Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a C75-induced increase in hypothalamic ATP levels could contribute to a decrease in AMP/ATP, resulting in reduced hypothalamic AMPK activity. Treatment of primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons with 40 μg/ml C75 led to a significant increase in neuronal ATP levels to 118 and 128% of control at 30 min and 2 h, respectively (Fig. 4a). C75 treatment caused a similar change in ATP levels in primary cortical neurons (27Landree L.E. Hanlon A.L. Strong D.W. Rumbaugh G. Miller I.M. Thupari J.N. Connolly E.C. Huganir R.L. Richardson C.

However, a causal relationship between elevated plasma FFAs and IL-6 has not been shown. Because skeletal muscle represents a major target of impaired insulin action, we studied whether FFAs may affect IL-6 expression in human myotubes. We demonstrate that specifically saturated FFAs, <i>e.g.</i> palmitate (0.25 mm), induce IL-6 mRNA expression and protein secretion by a proteasome-dependent mechanism that leads to a rapid and chronic activation of nuclear factor-κB. Insulin, high glucose concentrations, or unsaturated FFAs did not activate IL-6 expression. In fact, the unsaturated FFA linoleate inhibited palmitate-induced IL-6 production. Because inhibition of palmitate metabolism by the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor triacsin C did not abolish IL-6 expression, it appears that the palmitate molecule <i>per se</i> exerts the observed effects. Furthermore, we show that in human myotubes, IL-6 activates the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in concentrations similar to hepatocytes. However, no inhibitory effect of IL-6 on insulin action, determined as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase association with insulin receptor substrate-1, Akt phosphorylation, and glycogen synthesis, was detected. We conclude that IL-6 expression may be modulated by the composition of circulating FFA, <i>e.g.</i> by diet, and that skeletal muscle cells could be target cells for IL-6."

https://openalex.org/W2090003699,"Previous studies have shown that the adaptor protein Shb is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that Shb is phosphorylated in an Src-dependent manner upon vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulation using porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing the human VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) (KDR). In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we could detect an interaction between Shb and the VEGFR-2 in human telomerase-immortalized microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, in a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, the Src homology 2 domain of Shb was shown to interact with phosphorylated tyrosine 1175 in the C-terminal tail of VEGFR-2. VEGF-induced Shb phosphorylation was lost in porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing a chimeric murine VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) with a mutation at the corresponding position. Shb expression was specifically decreased by 80%, in a transient manner, by using the short interfering RNA technique. Reduced Shb expression led to a loss of stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at tyrosine 576, the generation of focal adhesions, and stress fiber formation in response to VEGF. Furthermore, we show that VEGF-induced migration is inhibited in Shb short interfering RNA-treated cells. Our data demonstrate that Shb is important for VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. This is achieved by Shb binding to tyrosine 1175 in the VEGFR-2, which regulates VEGF-induced formation of focal adhesions and cell migration, of which the latter occurs in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that the adaptor protein Shb is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.

In this study we have investigated the role of Shb in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling. Shb consists of a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a central phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, four central putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and a proline-rich N terminus (5Welsh M.

It can bind directly to the FGFR-1, via its SH2 domain, and regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and mitogenicity (2Cross M.J. Lu L. Magnusson P. Nyqvist D. Holmqvist K. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 8: 2881-2893Crossref Google Scholar). It can also bind directly to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), via its PTB domain, and regulate cell spreading (11Holmqvist K. Cross M. Riley D. Welsh M. Cell.

Activation of VEGFR-2 is known to lead to cytoskeletal reorganization and increased cellular migration. This process has been shown to require the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (8Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L.

In this study, we demonstrate that Shb is phosphorylated and binds directly to tyrosine 1175 upon VEGF stimulation in PAE/VEGFR-2 cells. By use of the siRNA technique, we find that Shb is required for VEGF-mediated PI 3-kinase activity, stress fiber formation, and cellular migration.

Telomerase-immortalized human microvascular endothelial (TIME) cells (17Venetsanakos E. Mirza A. Fanton C. Romanov S.R. Tlsty T. McMahon M. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes (1% gelatin in PBS) in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM) MV2 containing 5% FCS, epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml), VEGF (0.5 ng/ml), FGF-2 (10 ng/ml), insulin-like growth factor-1 (20 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.2 μg/ml), and ascorbic acid (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C in humidified air/CO2 (19:1). The TIME cells were serum-starved overnight in EBM MV2 media containing 1% FCS, without addition of growth factors, prior to the experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were seeded on tissue culture dishes or 24-well plates and serum-starved overnight in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 0.2% BSA before agonist stimulation experiments. Cells were stimulated with or without 50 ng/ml VEGF for 10 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μm Na3VO4 and lysed in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 500 μm Na3VO4, 1% aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μm calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal) for 10 min on ice before transfer to Eppendorf tubes. The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were either mixed with sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue) or incubated with antibodies against Shb on ice for 2 h before a final 1-h mixing with protein A-Sepharose. The antibody complex was washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The beads were resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon membrane, which were blocked in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) containing 5% BSA. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody, diluted in TBS-T containing 1.5% BSA, for 2 h, followed by washing in TBS-T. The membranes were then probed with the appropriate secondary horse-radish peroxidase-labeled antibody, extensively washed in TBS-T, and the bound antibodies visualized by ECL. Before reprobing, the membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min. Preparation of Fusion Protein and Pull-down Experiments—Fusion proteins corresponding to the SH2 domain and p55 Shb with the SH2 domain deleted (GST-Shb ΔSH2) were produced, as described (5Welsh M.

PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were seeded on plastic dishes and grown to near confluence, serum-starved, and stimulated with either nothing (control) or 50 ng/ml VEGF for 10 min and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates from 106 cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatant was collected and mixed with 10 μg of fusion protein (GST (control), GST-Shb SH2, or GST-Shb-ΔSH2 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose), and either 50 mm HEPES or phosphotyrosine was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. Samples were mixed for 60 min at 4 °C. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides corresponding to tyrosine 1175 in the VEGFR-2 (KDR) were synthesized and used in pull-down experiments to compete the Shb-VEGFR-2 interaction at both concentrations, 100 and 200 μm. The beads were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once in TBS. Sample buffer was added, and electrophoresis was performed. The samples were transferred onto Immobilon membrane and probed for phosphotyrosine content. siRNA—Target sequences for the siRNA were designed by using the Ambion web site. The sequences used were 5′-AAGUACUUCAGCUUGGGCAAC (Shb1), 5′-AAGAGUAACCAGGGCUUCAUG (Shb6), and 5′-CAGUCGCGUUUGCGACUGG (Scrambled). The oligonucleotides had been converted to the 2′-hydroxyl form, annealed, purified, and desalted. Sterile RNase-free water was added to give a final concentration of 20 μm duplex in 1× annealing buffer (100 mm KOAc, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgOAc). Twenty thousand PAE/VEGFR-2 cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were transfected the next day using Lipofectin® reagent. One hundred μl of Opti-MEM was mixed with 5 μl of Lipofectin®, and 100 μl of Opti-MEM was mixed with 3 μl (0.84 μg) of siRNA duplex. The two solutions were carefully mixed and incubated for 20 min at 20 °C before 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM was added, and the mixture was added to cells dropwise. The media was switched to Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS after 5.5 h. After 24, 48, and 72 h, the cells were lysed in sample buffer, sonicated, and analyzed for Shb and actin expression by Western blotting. Alternatively, 24 h post-transfection the cells were serum-starved in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 0.2% BSA. The following day (48 h post-transfection), the cells were stimulated with either 50 ng/ml VEGF for 10 min or 10% FCS for 5 min. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in sample buffer, sonicated, boiled, and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Alternatively, PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were transfected with fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides, and after different time points, the cells were trypsinized and diluted with Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 0.2% BSA. The samples were analyzed using a FACSICalibur. PI 3-Kinase Assay—Cells were transfected with scrambled or Shb1 siRNA as above. At 46 h, the cells were serum-starved for 1 h, after which they were stimulated for 10 min with 50 ng/ml VEGF or kept unstimulated. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer, and nuclei were pelleted, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated using a phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to the PI 3-kinase assay as described (1Hooshmand-Rad R. Lu L. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Incorporation of 32P into PI 3-phosphate is shown after extraction of phospholipids and separation on thin layer chromatography. Aliquots of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess protein loading. Paxillin and Actin Staining—Two thousand PAE/VEGFR-2 cells per well were seeded in 8-well chamber glass slides in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The following day, the cells were transfected with different siRNA sequences using Lipofectin® reagent. The cells were serum-starved using Ham's F-12 media with 0.2% BSA the next day; 48 h post-transfection the cells were stimulated or not with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 5 or 15 min. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized using acetone at -20 °C for 3 min. The slides were air-dried, and nonspecific interactions were blocked by incubating for 1 h with 10% FCS. Fluorescently labeled rhodamine-phalloidin was added for 1 h. The cells were extensively washed; fluoromount G was added, and the slides were mounted. The samples were examined using the ×40 lens in a Nikon microscope. Alternatively, the cells were transfected in tissue culture dishes and plated on collagen-coated slides 24 h after transfection. After an additional 18-h culture period, the cells were serum-starved for 4 h prior to stimulation with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 0, 60, and 240 min. The cells were fixed in zinc buffer (37 mm ZnCl, 23 mm ZnAc, and 3.2 mm CaAc containing 0.2% Triton X-100). For fluorescent staining, the fixed cells were incubated in TNB blocking reagent, followed by incubation with primary anti-paxillin antibody diluted in blocking buffer, and followed by incubation with the secondary goat anti-mouse 488. After several washes, cultures were mounted in Fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology) and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse E1000 microscope. Migration Assay—PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were transfected with either siRNA (Shb1) or scrambled sequence or kept untransfected (control) as described above. The cells were kept in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS for 48 h post-transfection, when the cells where trypsinized, counted, and seeded out on a collagen-coated membrane in a Boyden chamber. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were fixed in ethanol, stained with Giemsa, and washed in H2O. The non-migrating cells, on the upper surface of the membranes, were wiped off, and the membrane was mounted on a coverglass using EUKITT. Migrating cells were counted using ×400 magnification. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—For the migration data, results were expressed as percentage of basal response (means ± S.E.) in three independent experiments. Shb Is Phosphorylated upon VEGF Stimulation—Previous studies have demonstrated that the adaptor protein Shb is phosphorylated in response to a number of different agonists, i.e. FGF-2 (19Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nerve growth factor (20Karlsson T. Kullander K. Welsh M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 757-766PubMed Google Scholar), PDGF (1Hooshmand-Rad R. Lu L. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and IL2 (4Lindholm C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to determine whether Shb has a role in VEGF signaling. For this purpose we utilized PAE cells stably transfected with the human VEGFR-2 (KDR) cDNA (16Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of VEGFR-2 in these cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of PAE/VEGFR-2 cells with VEGF resulted in a prominent phosphorylated protein of 220 kDa, which corresponds to the activated VEGFR-2 (Fig. 1B). PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were then stimulated with VEGF, and the phosphorylation status of Shb was analyzed. Shb was rapidly phosphorylated in response to VEGF stimulation (Fig. 1C), peaking at 5 min. A phosphorylated band of 220 kDa, probably corresponding to the VEGFR-2, was co-immunoprecipitated with Shb. To demonstrate further an interaction between Shb and the VEGFR-2, we utilized telomerase-immortalized human microvascular endothelial (TIME) cells. These cells were stimulated or not with VEGF, lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-2 (KDR) antibody, and probed with Shb antibody. The experiment demonstrated that Shb co-immunoprecipitated with the activated VEGFR-2 (Fig. 1D), suggesting that Shb and VEGFR-2 interact in a VEGF-dependent manner. VEGF-induced Shb Phosphorylation Is Src-dependent—We have shown previously that FGF-induced Shb phosphorylation is Src-dependent (11Holmqvist K. Cross M. Riley D. Welsh M. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential role of Src in VEGF-induced Shb phosphorylation was investigated by use of the Src family selective kinase inhibitor PP2. PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were either pre-treated with PP2 or kept untreated before stimulation with or without VEGF. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with Shb antibody, and Western blot analysis was performed. VEGF-induced Shb phosphorylation was prevented by prior incubation with PP2 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, inhibition of Src activity did not prevent the association of Shb with a phosphotyrosyl protein migrating at 220 kDa (Fig. 2A), because the amount of co-immunoprecipitated 220-kDa product correlated with the amount of total Shb in the immunoprecipitates. The membrane was also probed with an antibody directed against phosphorylated tyrosine 1175 of the VEGFR-2, which confirmed that Shb and phosphorylated VEGFR-2 co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2A). Analysis of total cell lysate from the same experiment revealed that PP2 did not directly affect the phosphorylation status of the VEGFR-2 (Fig. 2B). Our data clearly show that Src family kinase activity is necessary for VEGF-stimulated Shb phosphorylation but not for the direct association of Shb and VEGFR-2 in PAE/VEGFR-2 cells. Shb Binds Directly to Tyrosine 1175 in the VEGFR-2—The Shb adaptor protein SH2 domain has been shown previously to bind to the consensus motif pY(T/V/I)XL (6Karlsson T. Songyang Z. Landgren E. Lavergne C. DiFiore P.P. Anafi M. Pawson T. Cantley L.C. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 475-483Google Scholar). This corresponds to tyrosine 766 in the FGFR-1 (2Cross M.J. Lu L. Magnusson P. Nyqvist D. Holmqvist K. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 8: 2881-2893Crossref Google Scholar) and tyrosine 720 in the PDGF receptor-α (1Hooshmand-Rad R. Lu L. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the human VEGFR-2 (KDR), tyrosine 1175 has the sequence pYIVL, suggesting that it may be a potential Shb-binding site. To investigate this further, PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were stimulated with VEGF, lysed, and mixed with GST fusion proteins either encompassing the SH2 domain of Shb or p55 Shb with a deletion of the SH2 domain. The potential binding was competed with the addition of 20 mm free phosphotyrosine or phosphorylated or unphosphorylated (control) peptides at 0.1 (data not shown) or 0.2 mm directed against the tyrosine 1175 site in the VEGFR-2 (Fig. 3A). The experiment confirmed that the Shb SH2 domain bound to tyrosine 1175 in the VEGFR-2 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. Furthermore, Shb with an SH2 domain deletion also appeared to bind to the VEGFR-2, although this association was only partly phosphotyrosine-dependent. To confirm further the role of tyrosine 1175 in regulating Shb activation, we utilized PAE cells expressing a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of the human colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor and the intracellular domain of the murine VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) (21Meyer R.D. Latz C. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16347-16355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The tyrosine 1175 (pYIVL) site in the human VEGFR-2 (KDR) is conserved and corresponds to tyrosine 1173 in the murine VEGFR-2 (Flk1). We also utilized a murine receptor mutant in which tyrosine 1173 was mutated to phenylalanine (Y1173F). Activation of the chimeric receptors with CSF-1 resulted in receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Analysis of Shb phosphorylation revealed that although activation of the chimeric receptor resulted in Shb phosphorylation, activation of the Y1173F mutant receptor did not stimulate Shb phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Analysis of the degree of activation/phosphorylation of other intracellular signaling proteins revealed that although the mutant receptor could evoke a normal activation of p44/42 MAPK, it was not able to stimulate the phosphorylation of FAK at position tyrosine 576 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Shb binds to the pYIVL site in the VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR). Gene Silencing by siRNA Specifically Lowers Shb Expression—To determine the physiological role of Shb in VEGFR-2 signaling, we decided to utilize siRNA technology using a synthetic oligonucleotide RNA duplex. We selected two sequences directed against different parts of the Shb gene (Shb1 and Shb6) and a control (scrambled) sequence. PAE/VEGFR-2 cells were transfected with a fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide, and FACS analysis was carried out, which revealed a transfection efficiency of at least 80% (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Shb protein expression was specifically decreased upon treatment with the siRNA technique in a transient fashion. By using the Shb1 sequence, we managed to decrease Shb expression by 80% (24 h), 70% (48 h) and 40% (72 h post transfection) compared with a scrambled sequence (Fig. 4B). Another sequence, Shb6, caused a weaker inhibition of Shb expression. The blot was also probed for actin content in order to confirm the specificity of the Shb sequences. Our data show successful transient inhibition of Shb protein expression in PAE/VEGFR-2 cells using the siRNA technique. VEGF-induced Phosphorylation of FAK Tyrosine 576 Is Decreased in siRNA Shb1-treated Cells—In order to determine the consequences of Shb protein reduction, different intracellular signaling pathways were examined. Because Shb has been shown to bind and regulate FAK phosphorylation (11Holmqvist K. Cross M. Riley D. Welsh M. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we investigated the phosphorylation status of FAK under these conditions. We found that VEGF-induced phosphorylation of FAK tyrosine 576 was reduced in the siRNA Shb1-treated cells by 40% (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in the untransfected (results not shown) and in the scrambled oligonucleotide-treated cells, VEGF increased FAK tyrosine 576 phosphorylation by 20%. FCS caused increased FAK phosphorylation in all cells, indicating that in the siRNA Shb1-treated cells, FAK tyrosine 576 could still be phosphorylated. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an antibody directed against FAK, which confirmed equal loading. We also determined the effect of lowering Shb expression on VEGF-stimulated VEGFR-2, phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), and MAPK phosphorylation. Fig. 5B shows that lowering Shb expression with the siRNA technique did not affect VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and the subsequent activation of PLC-γ and MAPK. The data suggest that, in the case of VEGFR-2 signaling, Shb regulates FAK activity. Shb Is Required for VEGF-dependent PI 3-Kinase Activation—In addition to FAK, PLC-γ, and MAPK, it was of interest to investigate the role of Shb in VEGF-induced PI 3-kinase activation, because it was shown previously (6Karlsson T. Songyang Z. Landgren E. Lavergne C. DiFi"
https://openalex.org/W1987815728,"Water has many kinetic and thermodynamic properties that exhibit an anomalous dependence on temperature, in particular in the supercooled phase. These anomalies have long been interpreted in terms of underlying structural causes, and their experimental characterization points to the existence of a singularity at a temperature of about 225 K. Further insights into the nature and origin of this singularity might be gained by completely characterizing the structural relaxation in supercooled water. But until now, such a characterization has only been realized in simulations that agree with the predictions of simple mode-coupling theory; unambiguous experimental support for this surprising conclusion is, however, not yet available. Here we report time-resolved optical Kerr effect measurements that unambiguously demonstrate that the structural relaxation of liquid and weakly supercooled water follows the behaviour predicted by simple mode-coupling theory. Our findings thus support the interpretation of the singularity as a purely dynamical transition. That is, the anomalous behaviour of weakly supercooled water can be explained using a fully dynamic model and without needing to invoke a thermodynamic origin. In this regard, water behaves like many other, normal molecular liquids that are fragile glass-formers."
https://openalex.org/W2103500761,"Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) are hypothesized to affect intracellular structures in living cells providing a new means to modulate cell signal transduction mechanisms. The effects of nsPEFs on the release of internal calcium and activation of calcium influx in HL-60 cells were investigated by using real time fluorescent microscopy with Fluo-3 and fluorometry with Fura-2. nsPEFs induced an increase in intracellular calcium levels that was seen in all cells. With pulses of 60 ns duration and electric fields between 4 and 15 kV/cm, intracellular calcium increased 200–700 nm, respectively, above basal levels (∼100 nm), while the uptake of propidium iodide was absent. This suggests that increases in intracellular calcium were not because of plasma membrane electroporation. nsPEF and the purinergic agonist UTP induced calcium mobilization in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium with similar kinetics and appeared to target the same inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and thapsigargin-sensitive calcium pools in the endoplasmic reticulum. For cells exposed to either nsPEF or UTP in the absence of extracellular calcium, there was an electric field-dependent or UTP dose-dependent increase in capacitative calcium entry when calcium was added to the extracellular media. These findings suggest that nsPEFs, like ligand-mediated responses, release calcium from similar internal calcium pools and thus activate plasma membrane calcium influx channels or capacitative calcium entry.

These findings suggest that nsPEFs, like ligand-mediated responses, release calcium from similar internal calcium pools and thus activate plasma membrane calcium influx channels or capacitative calcium entry. The release of internally stored calcium in mammalian cells can stimulate responses to agonists, activate growth, and initiate release of key factors in the apoptosis pathway (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). This calcium mobilization also triggers the influx of calcium from the external medium into the cell as a means of further propagating calcium signals and to replenish depleted pools of calcium and is termed capacitative calcium entry. The continuing effort to manipulate cell signaling pathways for therapeutic benefit has led to the exploration of electric field effects on cells (2Weaver J.C. Bronzino J.D.

The pulse lengths for this kind of electric field treatment are in the range of 0.1 to 20 ms (5Dev S.B. Rabussay D.A. Widera G. Hofmann G.A. IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 2000; 28: 206-223Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). With advances in pulsed power technology, it has been proposed that pulsed electric fields of ultrashort duration (<1 μs) may manipulate specific intracellular functions (13Schoenbach K.H. Beebe S.J. Buescher E.S. Bioelectromagnetics. 2001; 22: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 14Beebe S.J. Fox P.M. Rec L.J. Somers K. Stark R.H. Schoenbach K.H. IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 2002; 30: 286-292Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Current modeling of how these pulsed electric fields affect cells depict a cell as an excitable circuit (15Schoenbach K.H. Katsuki S. Stark R.H. Buescher E.S. Beebe S.J. IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 2002; 30: 293-300Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this model, the electric fields administered to a cell charge the plasma and internal membranes which act as dielectric layers, and between these the cytoplasm acts as a conductive medium. With these ultrashort pulses the plasma membrane is not exposed to an electric field of sufficient duration to charge it to such a voltage that significant electroporation occurs (15Schoenbach K.H. Katsuki S. Stark R.H. Buescher E.S. Beebe S.J. IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 2002; 30: 293-300Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Based on molecular modeling of nanosecond duration pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: nsPEF, nanosecond pulsed electric field; PI, propidium iodide; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCE, capacitative calcium entry; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free calcium; PLC, phospholipase C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TRP, transient receptor potential; TRPC, TRP canonical; TRPV, TRP (vanilloid); TRPM, TRP melastatin.1The abbreviations used are: nsPEF, nanosecond pulsed electric field; PI, propidium iodide; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCE, capacitative calcium entry; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free calcium; PLC, phospholipase C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TRP, transient receptor potential; TRPC, TRP canonical; TRPV, TRP (vanilloid); TRPM, TRP melastatin. the effects seen should be largely targeted on internal organelle membranes. To study calcium signaling, applied electric fields could be used to manipulate the movement of ions, such as calcium, by interaction with intracellular membranes. Therefore, because of the increasing interest in electric field effects on biological systems, nsPEFs were used to provoke calcium mobilization in mammalian cells.Previous studies showed that nsPEF treatment increased apoptosis signaling mechanisms in both Jurkat and HL-60 cells through assays for caspase activation, annexin binding, and cytochrome c localization (16Beebe S.J. Fox P.M. Rec L. Willis L. Schoenbach K.H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Other studies using electric fields weaker than those that induce apoptosis have been shown to cause a proliferative effect on cells. 2J. A. White, P. F. Blackmore, K. H. Schoenbach, and S. J. Beebe, unpublished observations.2J. A. White, P. F. Blackmore, K. H. Schoenbach, and S. J. Beebe, unpublished observations. Therefore, with these pulses it may be possible, depending on the duration and intensity of the electric field applied, to induce varied cell signaling mechanisms resulting in non-apoptotic cellular responses in the same cell type.In order to enact such responses to nsPEF treatment, the cell may use physical and/or chemical signals to initiate signal transduction cascades within the cell. Calcium signaling is ubiquitous in all cell types and plays a key role in several cellular events (17Berridge M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). Because many cellular functions are dependent on calcium signaling to achieve an effect, the response of internal calcium levels to nsPEF stimulation was examined.To compare nsPEF-induced effects on intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i), we used the purinergic agonist UTP (18Alemany R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21831-21838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which has been shown previously to induce calcium fluxes and capacitative calcium entry in HL-60 cells. These agonists induce calcium signaling by binding to a specific purinergic receptor of the P2Y2 (previously called P2U) subtype (18Alemany R. Sichelschmidt B. zu Heringdorf D.M. Lass H. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Verghese M.W. Kneisler T.B. Boucheron J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15597-15601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). P2Y2 receptors were shown previously to be present in HL-60 cells (22Suh B.C. Kim T.D. Lee I.S. Kim K.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This receptor signaling involves G-protein activation of phospholipase C (PLC) with a subsequent increase in the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (for review see Ref. 17Berridge M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). IP3 then initiates the release of calcium from IP3-sensitive calcium stores into the cytoplasm. This increase in calcium stimulates the opening of store-operated channels in the plasma membrane allowing influx of calcium into the cell for replenishment of the internal stores. This influx is believed to be via a CCE mechanism. The precise molecular nature of the CCE pathway in many cells is unknown. However, there is much evidence suggesting that members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of proteins may act as the plasma membrane calcium channel. The TRP proteins are classified as TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), and TRPM (melastatin) (23Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The transmembrane architecture of the TRPs is similar to voltage-gated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. HL-60 cells are positive for TRPC1, TRPC2, TRPC3, TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV5, TRPV6, and TRPM2 (24Heiner I. Eisfeld J. Halaszovich C.R. Wehage E. Jungling E. Zitt C. Luckhoff A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). From this collection of channel proteins, TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPV6 have been shown to participate in CCE (25Heiner I. Eisfeld J. Luckhoff A. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, HL-60 cells possess several candidates that could act as CCE channels.How the internal calcium store depletion communicates to the CCE process in the plasma membrane is still being studied. Two main theories exist for this coupling as follows: the first suggests physical interaction between the IP3 receptor in the ER and the CCE channel, and the second suggests the existence of a secondary messenger molecule or calcium-inducing factor (26Itagaki K. Hauser C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27540-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).Preliminary reports showing that nsPEF stimulation of HL-60 cells increased [Ca2+]i were presented at ElectroMed (28Beebe S.J. White J.A. Blackmore P.F. Deng Y. Somers K. Schoenbach K.H. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and SPRBM (29Buescher E.S. Schoenbach K.H. IEEE Trans. on Dielectrics and Electr. Insul. 2003; 10: 788-794Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) conferences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which nsPEF increased [Ca2+]i. The data show that nsPEF can induce calcium transients similar to those seen following purinergic receptor stimulation and thapsigargin. This response was observed in the absence of classical plasma membrane electroporation. Previous studies in HeLa cells showed that classical electroporation pulses (100 μs, 500 V/cm) also stimulated calcium responses similar to those seen with hormones (30Bobanovic F. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Parkinson N.A. Lipp P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The results presented here further support the hypothesis that when nsPEFs that are below the threshold for plasma membrane electroporation and apoptosis induction are applied, intracellular signal transduction cascades can be triggered, resulting in signaling events that are common with natural ligands. The application of nsPEFs to cells and tissues provides a new tool to investigate signal transduction mechanisms, including calcium signaling, by modulating intracellular release, and capacitative calcium entry through receptors in the plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Non-transformed HL-60 cells were used for this study and were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). They were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks in phenol red RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech Cellgro) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech Cellgro) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HL-60 cells in log-phase were removed from the culture and resuspended in a physiological buffer containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 6 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) prior to experimentation. 1.5 mm CaCl2 was added to this buffer when loading cells with fluorescent indicators unless otherwise stated. In some experiments extracellular calcium was omitted by washing the cells at least once in the same physiological buffer without added calcium. The addition of 1.5 mm EGTA prior to nsPEF treatment in a few of the initial experiments ensured that the small amount of calcium that was present in the calcium-deficient buffer was chelated. Total calcium in the buffer was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and was found to be 1.5 ± 0.05 mm in the presence of calcium and 3.06 ± 0.35 μm in buffer without added calcium (n = 3).Administration of nsPEF—Cell suspension (7.7 × 106 cells/ml) was added into the Bio-Rad gene pulser cuvettes prior to nsPEF treatment. nsPEF was delivered by means of a cable pulse generator to a cuvette with two parallel plate electrodes, separated by 0.4 cm, containing cell suspensions. The electric fields administered were 4, 6.5, 10, and 15 kV/cm. The generator consisted of a 10-ohm pulse-forming network (five 50-ohm cables in parallel) and a spark gap in atmospheric air as a nanosecond closing switch (16Beebe S.J. Fox P.M. Rec L. Willis L. Schoenbach K.H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Post-pulse, the cell suspension was removed from the nsPEF cuvette and assayed. Cell viability was ≥95% indicating that these nsPEF conditions were below the threshold for apoptosis or necrosis.Microscopic Analysis of Internal Calcium Response—An Olympus photomicroscope with a Kodak DC-120 digital camera was used with the fluorescent indicator Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to assess changes in intracellular free calcium. HL-60 cells were suspended in the above-described physiological buffer containing 2 mm calcium. Fluo-3/AM (2 μm) was added to the cells, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were then washed and resuspended in the physiological buffer with or without 2 mm calcium. An aliquot of HL-60 cell suspension was loaded into a space between metal electrodes affixed to a slide for real time monitoring of calcium transients. A description of this nsPEF apparatus can be found in the article by Deng et al. (31Deng J. Schoenbach K.H. Buescher E.S. Hair P.S. Fox P.M. Beebe S.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2709-2714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To analyze the cell response, Merlin software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect changes in gray scale of the selected cell areas, and we compared these changes to a background region.Assessment of Membrane Integrity—Propidium iodide (PI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, was added to HL-60 cell suspension (7.7 × 106 cells/ml) in a 0.4-cm BioSmith cuvette. For each of the four electric field settings, the cells were given one 60-ns pulses. Immediately following nsPEF stimulation, the cells were then removed from the cuvettes and transferred to flow cytometry vials for analysis (CellQuest software) on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). As a positive control, 0.1% Triton was added to the cells to induce membrane disruption in the presence of PI. The cell suspensions were analyzed within 2 min of treatment.Fluorometric Analysis of Internal Calcium Response—To analyze the response of a greater number of cells, the fluorescent indicator Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used with a fluorometer. HL-60 cells were incubated with Fura-2/AM (2 μm) in the physiological buffer described above containing 2 mm calcium for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed and resuspended in calcium-free or calcium-containing buffer at a concentration of 7.7 × 106 cells/ml. Calcium measurements were performed in a SPEX ARCM spectrofluorometer, similar to that described previously (32Dobrydneva Y. Blackmore P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 541-552PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were first placed in the fluorometer cuvette, to obtain a base-line reading, and cells were then removed from the fluorometer cuvette with a Pasteur pipette and added to the BioSmith cuvette. Cells were treated with nsPEF (13Schoenbach K.H. Beebe S.J. Buescher E.S. Bioelectromagnetics. 2001; 22: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and then immediately removed from the BioSmith cuvette and added back to the fluorometer cuvette (located in close proximity to the pulse generator, which took between 5 and 10 s), and the fluorescence measurements were continued. For those experiments that included the addition of UTP, an aliquot of UTP was pipetted into the BioSmith cuvette and mixed by pipetting up and down gently. For Fig. 3, A and B, BioSmith electroporation cuvettes were used to perform calcium measurements in the fluorometer by using a fiber optic light guide. The cells were excited at 340 and 380 nm through the clear side of the cuvette between the aluminum plates. The light emitted from the top of the cuvette was transmitted to the photomultiplier by using a fiber optic light guide. HL-60 cells were placed in the cuvette to which 1.5 mm EGTA was added and mixed into the cell suspension, and a base-line fluorescence reading was acquired. The cuvette was then removed from the fluorometer and treated with nsPEF (13Schoenbach K.H. Beebe S.J. Buescher E.S. Bioelectromagnetics. 2001; 22: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and then immediately replaced into the fluorometer (located in close proximity to the pulse generator, which took between 5 and 10 s), and the fluorescence measurements were continued. Although this method produced reliable results, the fluorescence signals contained noise. This was reduced significantly by removing the cell suspension from the BioSmith cuvette after treatment and transferring it to the fluorometer cuvette. Figs. 1 and 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 were prepared by using this method.Fig. 1HL-60 cells respond to nsPEF treatment by increasing intracellular calcium. HL-60 cells, loaded with Fluo-3 fluorescent indicator in the presence of extracellular calcium, were stimulated with one 60-ns pulse (30 kV/cm) and analyzed in real time. Images were taken as frames at 10-s intervals. Where an nsPEF pulse was administered, the majority of cells showed an increase in fluorescence compared with base line (p value 0.004). The average response of 22 untreated cells is shown as a dashed line with error bars representing S.E. Data are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Effect of one 60-ns pulse at 15 kV/cm, 10 μm UTP, and 0.1 μm thapsigargin on [Ca2+]i in Fura-2-loaded HL-60 cells incubated with and without extracellular calcium. HL-60 cells (incubated with and without extracellular calcium) were placed in the fluorometer cuvette to obtain a base-line [Ca2+]i value and then were moved into the BioSmith cuvette. The cells were pulsed for 60 ns at 15 kV/cm and then moved back into the fluorometer cuvette, and [Ca2+]i was again measured (A). The effect of 10 μm UTP on [Ca2+]i was measured in HL-60 cells in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium (B). Shown in B is a dose-response curve of UTP to increase [Ca2+]i in HL-60 cells in the presence of extracellular calcium. Various concentrations of UTP were added to Fura-2-loaded cells, and at 15 s the [Ca2+]i calcium was measured. The effect of 0.1 μm thapsigargin on [Ca2+]i was measured in HL-60 cells in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium (C). Representative traces of at least three experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Capacitative calcium entry into HL-60 cells treated with one 60-ns pulse each of 6.4 and 15 kV/cm and cells treated with UTP. HL-60 cells were incubated in the absence of extracellular calcium. Cells, incubated in calcium-deficient media, were treated with one 60-ns pulse at 6.4 and 15 kV/cm. After [Ca2+]i had returned to near basal values, 2.0 mm calcium was added to the cells (A). Untreated cells acted as a control and show that some basal calcium influx occurred in this calcium-deficient situation. Cells were treated with 10 μm UTP, and when [Ca2+]i had returned to basal values 2 mm calcium was added (B). The increase in [Ca2+]i was similar to that observed when cells were given UTP in the presence of extracellular calcium (Fig. 4B). 0.1 μm thapsigargin was also used for comparison to show capacitative calcium influx (C). Representative traces of at least three experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Effect of one 60-ns pulse each of 4.0, 6.4, 10.0, and 15.0 kV/cm on [Ca2+]i in HL-60 cells. The three conditions shown are as follows: □, when 1.5 mm extracellular calcium was present; •, in the absence of extracellular calcium; ○, when 2 mm calcium was added to cells after stimulation in the absence of extracellular calcium (see Fig. 4A for representative experiment). This represents the entry through the CCE. Data represent the mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 7Effect of UTP on [Ca2+]i after one 60-ns pulse each of 4 and 15 kV/cm. Fura-2-loaded HL-60 cells were incubated in calcium-containing media. Cells were either pulsed at 15 or 4 kV/cm. Shortly after nsPEF treatment, the increase in [Ca2+]i was measured and then 10 μm UTP was added. Representative traces are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 8Effect of one 60-ns 15 kV/cm pulse followed by 10 μm UTP, and the effect of 10 μm UTP followed by one 60-ns 15-kV/cm pulse on [Ca2+]i in HL-60 cells incubated in calcium-deficient media and in the presence of 1.5 mm extracellular calcium. Both the 15 kV/cm pulse and UTP produced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. The addition of UTP to the 15 kV/cm pulsed cells produced an effect on [Ca2+]i that was less than that observed when UTP was added alone. Stimulating the cells with one 15 kV/cm pulse after UTP stimulation also produced an effect on [Ca2+]i that was less than that seen with a pulse alone (A). B, both the 15 kV/cm pulse and UTP produced rapid and sustained increases in [Ca2+]i. The addition of UTP to the 15 kV/cm pulsed cells produced an effect on [Ca2+]i that was less than that observed when UTP was added alone to the cells. Stimulating the cells with one 60-ns pulse after UTP stimulation also produced an effect that was less than that observed with one pulse given alone. This heterologous desensitization suggests that both stimuli are mobilizing the same calcium pool. A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RESULTSSingle Cell Analysis of the Effect of nsPEF on Intracellular Free Calcium—In order to assess how nsPEF stimulation affects internal events in cells, real time microscopic analysis of cells with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-3 was utilized. HL-60 cell suspension was loaded into the nsPEF slide (31Deng J. Schoenbach K.H. Buescher E.S. Hair P.S. Fox P.M. Beebe S.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2709-2714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and a group of cells in the field of vision between the electrodes was chosen to analyze. Typically 10–15 cells could be viewed at one time, and their response to nsPEF was recorded. All cells that were present in the field of view of the microscope were analyzed for changes in internal calcium. In Fig. 1, each cell in the field of view of the microscope is represented as an individual line, and the average response was presented as a heavy line. The fluorescence of each cell was monitored over the time of the experiment and was compared with background. Following the nsPEF pulse (Fig. 1, black arrow), all of the cells responded with an increase in [Ca2+]i. This coordinated increase in [Ca2+]i was not seen in untreated cells. This increase in [Ca2+]i following nsPEF could result from intracellular calcium mobilization followed by CCE.nsPEF Does Not Induce Electroporation of the Plasma Membrane at Low Electric Fields—From Fig. 1 a rise in intracellular calcium is seen when cells are treated with nsPEF. The next step was to determine whether this increase was because of influx from the extracellular media or from internal store release. Our hypothesis states that nsPEF should affect internal membranes; therefore, the increase in [Ca2+]i because of nsPEF stimulation would result from internal store release. To test this theory, evidence of plasma membrane electroporation at the electric fields used in this study was investigated. Classical electroporation experiments applied electric fields of sufficient duration to induce dielectric breakdown in the plasma membrane (33Tsong T.Y. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 34Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1779-1783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess plasma membrane integrity under our experimental conditions, the indicator PI was used with flow cytometry. The data revealed no increase in PI uptake when compared with control (control averaged 1.5 ± 0.5% and the highest electric field used for treatment averaged 0.9 ± 0.3% fluorescence gated for PI). In all subsequent experiments in this study, cells were treated within this electric field range to ensure plasma membrane integrity.Effect of UTP on HL-60 Cells in the Presence and Absence of Extracellular Calcium—Because evidence of plasma membrane electroporation was not found, the increase in [Ca2+]i due to nsPEF stimulation, in the absence of extracellular calcium, is likely to be coming from the release of internal stores. A traditional agonist, UTP, which induces internal store release, was used as a stimulus, and the response of the cell was compared with the response to nsPEF. Fig. 2 shows a representative experiment of HL-60 cells that were treated with 10 μm UTP in the presence of 1.5 mm calcium and in the absence of ca"

The interaction with the membrane-water interface strongly modulates folding and aggregation of the protein. The present study investigates the lipid binding and the coil-helix transition of αS, using titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Titration of the protein with small unilamellar vesicles composed of zwitterionic phospholipids below the chain melting temperature of the lipids yielded exceptionally large exothermic heat values. The sigmoidal titration curves were evaluated in terms of a simple model that assumes saturable binding sites at the vesicle surface. The cumulative heat release and the ellipticity were linearly correlated as a result of simultaneous binding and helix folding. There was no heat release and folding of αS in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles, indicating that a small radius of curvature is necessary for the αS-membrane interaction. The heat release and the negative heat capacity of the protein-vesicle interaction could not be attributed to the coil-helix transition of the protein alone. We speculate that binding and helix folding of αS depends on the presence of defect structures in the membrane-water interface, which in turn results in lipid ordering in the highly curved vesicular membranes.

The majority of cases are idiopathic, whereas mutations in the αS gene are known to be responsible for rare inherited, early onset variants of Parkinson's disease (2Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C.

Although the molecular mode of action of αS and of its homologs is as yet unknown, it was assumed that the protein modulates the dopamine neurotransmission by regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) mobilization from the presynaptic reserve pool (5Murphy D.D.

However, attempts to identify a specific SV-binding protein, e.g. by protein cross-linking, have been unsuccessful so far. At a certain threshold concentration, αS tends to aggregate into amyloid fibrils (10Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), whereas the homolog βS, which lacks a stretch of amino acids within the central portion of αS, has a much lower fibrillization propensity (11Serpell L.C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3696-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), indicating that the hydrophobic central part of αS is essential for its fibrillar aggregation (16Kahle P.J. Haass C. Kretzschmar H.A. Neumann M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A recent study on the structure of mature fibrillar aggregates, using site-directed spin labeling, indicates that the N terminus of αS is less ordered than the central portion and that the C terminus is completely unfolded in the fibrillar aggregates (17Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). According to circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the monomeric αS protein is unfolded in buffer solution (18Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A.

Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In the presence of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles, however, the protein undergoes a transition into a partially α-helical state (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to the presence of positive amino acid charges in six imperfectly conserved repeats in the N-terminal region of the protein, which may account for the formation of a sided α-helix upon interaction with negatively charged membrane interfaces (19Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, lipid binding and helix formation were barely detectable when αS was added to noncharged vesicles consisting of zwitterionic phospholipids in the liquid crystalline state (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the surface curvature of the vesicles is important for αS binding, i.e. there was little binding and helix folding in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles containing phosphatidylglycerol, in contrast to small unilamellar vesicles of the same composition (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). This result may be not generally applicable, however, as αS binding to large unilamellar vesicles and even to multilamellar membranes containing negatively charged lipids other than phosphatidylglycerol was shown in later studies (24Narayanan V. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Jo E. Fuller N. Rand R.P. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Investigation of the aggregation kinetics revealed the formation of oligomeric intermediates of αS fibrillization (26Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Such intermediates (“protofibrils”) potentially incorporate into unilamellar vesicle membranes, resulting in vesicle permeabilization and metal ion influx (27Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4595-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) or release of encapsulated dopamine (28Volles M.J. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the observation that small amounts of an αS-dopamine adduct that forms under oxidizing conditions stabilize the protofibrillar intermediates (29Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Thus, retardation of the protofibril-fibril transition may promote membrane permeation and release of cytotoxic amounts of dopamine from SV. Binding of αS to phospholipid membranes inhibited fibril formation (24Narayanan V. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Zhu M. Fink A.L. J.

Therefore, it will be important to pursue the investigation of the αS-lipid interaction with emphasis on the competition between helix folding and protofibrillar aggregation. The binding of αS to vesicular lipid membranes has been demonstrated by different techniques, including size exclusion chromatography, CD spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (20Davidson W.S.

In the present study calorimetric techniques, i.e. isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), provide another, more direct proof of protein-lipid interaction. The shape of the ITC curves depends characteristically on the binding mode, which can be either construed as a partition equilibrium or as specific binding with a limited number of saturable binding sites. Accordingly, a partition coefficient or a binding constant can be obtained, which yields the free energy and entropy of the binding reaction. Simultaneously with the calorimetric measurements, we have monitored the conformational transition of the protein to assess the contribution of helix folding to the overall heat release. The combination of ITC, DSC, and CD spectroscopy revealed an unexpected protein-lipid interaction, suggesting that not only negatively charged lipids but also defect structures in the membrane water interface are capable of inducing interfacial binding and helix folding of αS. These results will be discussed regarding the putative stabilization of intracellular, e.g. SV membranes by αS. Materials—Phospholipids, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-glycerol (POPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Bovine brain sphingomyelin (BBSM) as well as other chemicals were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Expression and Purification of Wild-type (wt) and A30P Mutant αS—The coding regions of human wt and A30P mutant αS (35Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J.

Amplimers were subcloned into the NdeI site of pET-5a (Promega, Madison, WI), and constructs used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLys. All constructs were sequenced (Medigenomix, Munich/Martinsried, Germany). Bacterial cultures were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h, and lysed by freeze/thaw and sonication. After 15 min of boiling, the heat-stable 17,000 × g supernatant was loaded onto Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 25–500 mm salt gradient. The pooled synuclein peak fractions were desalted by Superdex 75 gel filtration as described (36Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L. Müller V. Odoy S. Jacobsen H. Iwatsubo T. Trojanowski J.Q. Takahashi H.

Pathol. 2001; 159: 2215-2225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and a final purification was achieved using a Sephacryl S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentration was determined photometrically at 275 nm using an extinction coefficient of ϵ = 5120 m–1 cm–1 (19Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Vesicle Preparation—Phospholipids, sphingomyelin, and lipid/cholesterol mixtures were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The solvent was completely evaporated on a vacuum line, and the lipid films were resuspended in buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.2), followed by sonication with a tip sonicator (Branson Cell Disrupter B15). Typically, 1-ml volumes were sonicated above the respective phase transition temperatures (Tm) of the phospholipids for 20 min with a 30% duty cycle. The quality of the resulting small unilamellar vesicles was checked by dynamic light scattering. Sonicated vesicles prepared from DPPC or BBSM were stored at 45 °C and used within 2 h. The vesicles were rapidly cooled to the desired temperature below Tm prior to the titrations. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion of phospholipid suspensions using 100-nm polycarbonate membranes (LFM-100) and a LiposoFast™ extruder device (Armatis GmbH, Weinheim, Germany). ITC—A VP-ITC instrument equipped with a motor driven syringe (MicroCal, Amherst, MA) was employed for titration calorimetry. The volume of the calorimeter cell was 1.41 ml. Small volumes of the vesicle suspensions were injected with the computer-controlled syringe into the protein solution in the calorimeter cell. Typically, 40 injections of 7 μl each were executed and the integration of the calorimeter signals, base-line corrections, and normalization with respect to protein and lipid concentrations were done using MicroCal ORIGIN software. Only five to seven injections were necessary for the determination of the reaction heat by injection of protein into a suspension of lipid vesicles. Control titrations were performed, i.e. vesicles into buffer alone or protein into buffer alone, and the results were subtracted from the experimental data. The sigmoidal titration curves obtained with gel state vesicles were evaluated assuming independent saturable protein binding sites in the outer vesicle interface. First, the ligand concentration was equated with the total lipid concentration in the syringe, neglecting the aggregational state of the lipids. Second, N independent lipid binding sites on the protein were assumed. The fractional occupancy of lipid binding sites on the protein, Φ, and the free lipid and total protein concentrations [L] and [P]t, respectively, then yield the microscopic binding constant K′ = Φ/(1 – Φ)[L] and the total lipid concentration [L]t = [L] + NΦ[P]t. The fractional saturation of the protein is related to the total heat Q being released by Q = NΦ [P]t ΔH′ V0, where ΔH′ and V0 denote the molar enthalpy of ligand binding and the total volume of the cell. After elimination of [L] and Φ, the heat content of the cell can be expressed as a function of the total ligand concentration [L]t, where a = [L]t/N[P]t. Q=1/2N[P]tΔH′V0[1+a(1+K′−1)−{(1+a(1+K′−1))2−4a}](Eq. 1) Incremental heat values ΔQ = Qi – 1 – Qi were calculated and the experimental data was fitted by variation of N, K′, and ΔH′ according to the standard Marquard-Levenberg algorithm (37Bevington P.E. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969Google Scholar). Taking account of the spillover of liquid from the calorimeter cell during the titration (MicroCal tutorial guide), the “number of binding sites” N was identified with the total number of lipid molecules associated with one protein molecule, which yields the enthalpy (per mole of protein) ΔH0 = NΔH′, the association constant K = NK′, and the free energy (ΔG0 =–RT lnK) and entropy (ΔS0 = (ΔH0 –ΔG0)/T) of the binding reaction with respect to the protein. DSC—Differential scanning calorimetry was performed with a VPDSC instrument (MicroCal). Vesicles were used immediately after sonication. Base lines were corrected using the MicroCal software. CD—Spectra were recorded with a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). A cuvette with 0.2-cm path length was filled with 500 μl of the protein solution. The proteins were titrated with phospholipid vesicles using a syringe for lipid addition and mixing of the protein and vesicle solutions. Control spectra obtained with vesicle suspensions in buffer alone were subtracted from the experimental spectra. Temperature control with an accuracy of ±0.5 °C in the cuvette was achieved with a heating/cooling accessory using a Peltier element. The helicity of the protein (i.e. the percentage of the entire protein sequence in an α-helical state) was obtained from the mean residue ellipticities, [Θ]222, according to Equations 2 and 3. Helicity (%)=100 fhelix(Eq. 2) fhelix=([Θ]222−[Θ]coil)/([Θ]coil−[Θ]helix)(Eq. 3) The mean residue ellipticities at 222 nm for the completely unfolded and for the completely folded protein were calculated from [Θ]coil = 640 – 45t and [Θ]helix = –40,000(1 – 2.5/n) + 100t (38Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), where the parameters n and t denote the number of amino acids in the protein (140 for αS) and the temperature in degrees Celsius, respectively. Titration of αS with Negatively Charged Vesicles—It has been reported that phospholipid vesicles bearing negative lipid charges bind monomeric αS with a concomitant transition of the protein from a random coil into a partially helical conformation. For a quantitative assessment of the thermodynamics of this lipid-protein interaction, we employed ITC as shown in Fig. 1. Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles obtained by sonication of an equimolar mixture of POPC and POPG were taken up into the syringe of the ITC instrument. Aliquots were titrated into the calorimeter cell containing a solution of wt-αS. The negative heat flow obtained after each vesicle injection (in μcal/s) indicates that the protein-lipid interaction is accompanied by an exothermic enthalpy. Integration of the individual calorimeter signals yielded the heat release per titration step (in μcal). In a parallel experiment, vesicles were injected into the buffer solution alone, which accounts for the effect of vesicle dilution. Enthalpy values in terms of kcal/mol of injected lipid were then obtained by dividing the integrated heat values by the respective molar amounts of lipid injected. As shown in Fig. 1B, the magnitude of the exothermic heat decreases monotonically with increasing phospholipid concentration in the calorimeter cell and vanishes when the total molar ratio exceeds 300 mol of phospholipid/mol of protein. The titration curve in Fig. 1 can be ascribed to a partition equilibrium, i.e. the amount of protein available for vesicle binding decreases with increasing vesicle concentration in the solution. The enthalpy for complete binding, ΔH0, was measured by titration of a dilute protein solution into a vesicle suspension in the calorimeter cell. Five injections were sufficient for an accurate determination. The data were further analyzed as described in detail by Seelig and colleagues (39Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 40Wieprecht T. Seelig A. Curr. Top. Membr. 2002; 52: 31-56Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the bound fractions, Xp, of the protein were calculated using the cumulative heat values, as shown in Equation 4, where δhi is the ith integrated calorimeter peak. Xp=∑i=1nδhi/ΔH0(Eq. 4) The unbound concentration of αS, cf, and the ratio of bound protein per total lipid in the calorimeter cell, Xb = n bP/n totL, was obtained from Xp (39Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which yielded the binding isotherm (Fig. 1B, inset). A simple partition equilibrium would result in a linear relation, Xb = Kp·cf, from which the binding constant Kp can be derived. A nonlinear relation was found, however, which must be attributed to electrostatic attraction of the protein by the negative charges at the vesicle surface, resulting in the effective protein concentration being higher close to the membrane-water interface than in bulk solution (Fig. 1, inset). For the binding of small peptides to charged vesicle membranes, the interfacial electrostatics were successfully taken into account using the Gouy-Chapman theory (41Seelig J. Nebel S. Ganz P. Bruns C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9714-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A quantitative analysis along these lines is not feasible for αS, as it requires knowledge of the effective protein charge and of the surface potential of the membrane. Qualitatively, it turns out that the binding ratio Xb increases in a nonlinear and nonsaturable manner, as can be expected for a partition equilibrium that is modulated by the surface potential of the vesicle membrane. The conformational rearrangement of αS as a consequence of the protein-vesicle interaction can be conveniently followed by CD spectroscopy (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Fig. 2 shows CD titrations of wt- and A30P-αS with vesicles consisting of binary mixtures of POPC and POPG at molar ratios 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. The CD data are presented in terms of the mean residue ellipticities ([Θ]222) to account for slightly different concentrations of the protein solutions in the cuvette. At low vesicle concentrations, the ellipticities decrease almost linearly as a function of the total lipid/protein molar ratio. The ratio of the initial slopes obtained with vesicles composed of POPC and POPG at molar ratios 2/1 and 1/1, respectively, is ∼1.4 for both the wt and the mutant protein. This compares favorably with the ratio of the POPG concentrations of the two different vesicle preparations (1.34), indicating that helix formation is a function of the interfacial charge density. More notably, the initial slope is significantly smaller for A30P-αS versus wt-αS for either vesicle composition, suggesting a lower affinity of the mutant protein for the charged membrane interface. In the presence of equimolar POPC/POPG vesicles, the ellipticities approach constant values at total lipid/protein molar ratios >200:1. Lipid/protein ratios resulting in maximum helix folding of the proteins were difficult to attain at the lower POPG content, as scattering from the more concentrated vesicle suspension resulted in unacceptably noisy CD spectra. Earlier work suggested that a highly curved membrane interface as obtained by sonication of phospholipid dispersions is required for vesicle binding and concomitant α-helix folding of monomeric αS (20Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Our calorimetric data are in line with this observation but are at variance with later reports (24Narayanan V. Scarlata S.

A recent report has also described the ability of mouse GrC (most closely related to human GrH) to cause cell death characterized by the rapid externalization of phosphatidylserine, nuclear condensation and collapse, and single-stranded DNA nicking (33Johnson H. Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The protease specificity of this Gr has not been defined. Collectively, these data suggest that at least three Gr may induce cell death by distinct pathways. Intriguingly, lymphocytes from mice deficient in GrA, GrB, and GrC still kill tumor targets (34Davis J.E. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that additional Gr or granule components may contribute to cell death. GrM is highly expressed in NK cells but is not expressed in activated primary human, rat, or mouse T cells (17Smyth M.J. Wiltrout T. Trapani J.A. Ottaway K.S. Sowder R. Henderson L.E. Kam C.M.

Given the unique cellular expression and protease specificity of GrM, we undertook to study the cytotoxic potential of GrM in the presence of perforin. Surprisingly, GrM induced a novel form of perforin-dependent cell death that was independent of caspases and mitochondrial disruption and occurred in the absence of discernable DNA fragmentation. Human Jurkat, Jurkat.pgk, and K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Jurkat cells expressing human Bcl-2 (Jurkat.Bcl-2) were derived and cultured as described (36Davis J.E. Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recombinant human GrM and the enzymatically inactive mutant, GrM-SA, were produced in baculovirus Sf21 cells and purified as previously described (37Rukamp B.J. Kam C.M. Natarajan S. Bolton B.W. Smyth M.J. Kelly J.M. Powers J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 422: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recombinant human GrB was produced in Pichia Pastoris yeast (38Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and recombinant human perforin (pfp) was produced in baculovirus as described (39Liu C.C. Persechini P.M. Young J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell lines were first titrated with recombinant human perforin to define a sublytic dose (<15% lysis in a 4-h 51Cr release assay). That sublytic dose of perforin was then used in combination with one of recombinant GrM, GrM-SA, or GrB (generally to a final concentration of 10-83 nm). The assays were performed in triplicate with 2 × 104 cells (unless otherwise stated) in a 96-well plate. The cells were re-suspended in Hanks' buffered salt solution (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.04% bovine serum albumin. The Gr and pfp were added in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl (HE buffer). Clonogenic Assays—These were performed to ultimately determine that target cells were undergoing cell death. After exposure to Gr and pfp, cells were pelleted and resuspended in media. 1200 cells were added to 1.5 ml of molten soft agar (20% fetal calf serum, 0.3% Bacto agar (Difco) in RPMI), and 0.5 ml were plated in triplicate in a 24-well plate. The set agar was overlaid with 1 ml of complete RPMI, and the plate was incubated for 7 days. The number of viable colonies was counted in triplicate. Trypan blue exclusion counts were also performed on a sample of cells from the same assay. The number of dead cells (blue) were expressed as a percentage of the total cell number. 51Cr and 125I Release Assays—Assays measuring the release of 51Cr- and 125I-labeled DNA from apoptotic cells were performed as described (40Sutton V.R. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar, 41Trapani J.A. Jans P. Smyth M.J. Froelich C.J. Williams E.A. Sutton V.R. Jans D.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To measure membrane perturbation, target cells were radiolabeled with 51Cr for 1 h, then washed thoroughly to remove free label and incubated with Gr and pfp in 96-well round bottom plates for various periods of time as indicated. The supernatants were harvested using a Skatron Cell Harvester (Lier, Norway), and the specific release of 51Cr into the supernatant was measured using a Wallac Wizard 1470 automatic gamma counter (PerkinElmer). To additionally measure 125I release, target cells were co-labeled with 51Cr- and 125I-labeled 2′ deoxyuridine. After harvesting manually for 51Cr release, cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min as previously described (41Trapani J.A. Jans P. Smyth M.J. Froelich C.J. Williams E.A. Sutton V.R. Jans D.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and cells were centrifuged. For caspase inhibition experiments, radiolabeling and assay was performed in the presence or absence of final concentration of 200 μm Z-VAD-fmk or Z-FA-fmk inhibitor. The spontaneous release was determined by incubating target cells with buffer alone. The maximum release was determined by adding SDS to a final concentration of 5%. The percent specific lysis was calculated as follows: 100 × [(experimental release - spontaneous release)/(maximum release - spontaneous release)]. Apoptosis—Apoptosis was measured by DNA content and cell surface phosphatidylserine exposure. Target cells were treated with Gr and pfp for 2 h after which cells were washed once in PBS, re-suspended in 200 μl of PBS, and fixed with 200 μl of ice-cold 100% ethanol and left for 30 min on ice. The cells were re-suspended in propidium iodide (PI) (46 μg/ml) with 50 μg of RNase. The cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. For the analysis of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of apoptotic cells, target cells were double-stained with annexin V-Fluos (Roche Diagnostics) and PI. Cells were pelleted after incubating with Gr and pfp for 4 h at 37 °C, washed, and treated with Annexin V-Fluos on ice for 30 min. After washing, PI was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Live cells were considered to be PI- and annexin V-Fluos-. Mitochondrial Function—Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry after treatment with the mitochondrion-specific fluorescent dye, tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (Molecular Probes), at a final concentration of 100 nm. A control sample was stained with carbamoyl cyanide n-chlorophenylhydrazone at 10 μm to determine the level of fluorescence in target cells with depolarized mitochondria. Determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was performed with H2DCFDA dye (C-400, Molecular Probes) as described (42Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Morphology—To examine the morphological aspects of cell death, target cells undergoing GrM- and pfp-mediated death were assessed by light and electron microscopy. Jurkat target cells were treated with Gr and pfp for 1 and 4 h. To examine the morphological changes in the nucleus, the nuclear DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Roche Diagnostics). Jurkat cells (5 × 104) were treated with Gr and pfp for 4 h. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' buffered salt solution and once with methanol, and finally the cells were re-suspended in 200 μl of 1 μg/ml DAPI (in methanol) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. After spinning, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed in methanol and re-suspended in 100 μl of PBS plus 100 μl paraformaldehyde and left for 20 min in the dark. After washing in PBS the cells were re-suspended in 20 μl of PBS, pipetted onto a microscope slide, left to dry, and a drop of mounting solution (glycerol pyrogallol) was added. The DAPI staining was observed on a Zeiss microscope (Model Axioskop 2) under a 40× lens. For transmission electron microscopy cells were fixed in a modified Karnovsky's fixative consisting of 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.08 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer. Post-fixation was in 2% buffered osmium tetroxide and processed for routine electron microscopy. Cells were embedded in Spurrs (ProScitech) resin. Ultrathin sections of 70-90-nm thickness were cut on a Leica Ultracut S ultramicrotome (Leica Instruments, North Ryde, Australia), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Hitachi H600 transmission electron microscope. Cytostasis—Jurkat cells (2 × 105) were treated with Gr and pfp (125μl) for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were spun and re-suspended in 1 ml of RPMI media and incubated in a 24-well plate for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were treated with PI as described in the apoptosis method and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine whether the cells showed any evidence of cell cycle arrest. Cells (6 × 104) were resuspended in 100 μl of plasma membrane lysis buffer (50 μg/ml digitonin, 120 mm KCl in PBS) and incubated on ice for 5 min (43Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Samples were tested by trypan blue to ensure that >95% of cells were permeabilized. Cells were fixed by adding 100 μl of paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS), pelleted (800 × g for 5 min in V-bottom 96-well plates), and incubated in paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS) for 20 min. The cells were washed three times in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% saponin in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-cytochrome c (clone 6H2.B4 BD, PharMingen) diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. Cells were washed three times in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in phycoerythrin (PE) antimouse secondary antibody (Silenus, Melbourne, Australia) diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. The cells were washed 3× in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. PE fluorescence was detected in FL2. Recombinant pfp was added to a 96-well plate and serially diluted in Hepes/saline buffer (20 mm Hepes/150 mm NaCl). Twenty million sheep red blood cells were added to each well followed by GrM (final 60 nm), and lysis was initiated by adding CaCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 1400 × g for 4 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh plate, and hemoglobin release was evaluated as the absorbance measured at 405 nm. Maximal hemoglobin release was defined as that occurring after re-suspending the sheep red blood cell in double distilled water. Western blotting was performed essentially as described (44Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 2378-2385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat.pgk cells (1 × 106) were loaded with pfp and Gr (60 nm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCL, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing complete-mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was retained. Equal amounts of protein (determined by means of a Bradford reaction) were separated on 12.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted on to nitrocellulose transfer membranes. Immunoblots were probed with mouse monoclonal antibody C31720 to human caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), mouse monoclonal antibody clone 10-1-87 to human caspase-9 (a kind gift from Dr. Y. Lazebnik, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY), mouse monoclonal antibody to human Bid (Junying Yuan, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), or mouse monoclonal antibody to human α-tubulin (Sigma) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Caspase-3 activity in cell lysates was measured using a caspase assay. Jurkat.pgk cells (2 × 106), treated with pfp and Gr for 2 h at 37 °C, were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer without protease inhibitors. An equal amount of protein for each sample was incubated with or without 1.25 mm Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide substrate (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) in buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.1 m Hepes, 0.05 m CaCl2 at 37 °C. The absorbance at 405 nm was read at 15-min intervals for 2 h, and the substrate cleavage was measured by the change in absorbance in the presence or absence of the caspase-3 substrate. GrM Induces Cytolysis and Death of Target Cells—Cell-free assays have been extremely useful in the analysis of granule serine proteases that induce cell death in the presence of pfp (23Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 45Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Cancilla M. Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Sedelies K. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus far GrA, GrB, GrC, and GrK have been shown by a variety of assays to trigger cell death in the presence of pfp (7Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4127-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 33Johnson H. Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Initially, we compared the cytolytic activity of human GrM and GrB in the presence of sublytic (<15% lysis) concentrations of pfp against Jurkat target cells in a 4-h 51Cr release assay (Fig. 1A). Clearly, increasing concentrations of GrM (10-83 nm) caused 51Cr release in the presence of pfp. This level of cytolytic activity was comparable with similar concentrations of GrB in the presence of pfp (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the highest concentration of GrM alone (83 nm) displayed only background levels of cell death (Fig. 1A) as did the highest concentration of active site serine-mutated GrM (GrM-SA, 83 nm) in combination with pfp (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when loss of viability was assessed by trypan blue uptake (data not shown). Given the rapid cell death mediated by NK cells, we next assessed the kinetics of cytolysis by incubating Gr and pfp for various periods of time before harvest (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, Jurkat target cells exposed to GrM and pfp displayed measurable 51Cr release within 20 min, and by 1 h cell death had approximated maximal levels. By contrast, GrB and pfp did not induce detectable cell death until after 1 h of exposure, and death had reached a maximum after ∼4 h (Fig. 1B). Similar levels and kinetics of cell death were also observed for other human target cells (HeLa, K562) exposed to GrM and pfp (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Because clonogenic assays provide a reliable and definitive method of measuring cell death (4Trapani J.A. Davis J. Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 46Newton K. Strasser A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we exposed Jurkat target cells to GrM or GrB and pfp for 4 h and assessed the number of colonies grown that arose in soft agar 7 days later (Fig. 1D). Both GrM and GrB reduced colony number by more than 50% in the presence of pfp, whereas pfp alone or in the presence of GrM-SA was without effect. GrM Does Not Enhance pfp Lytic Function and Mediates Death in the Absence of DNA Fragmentation—We next set about characterizing the features of cell death induced by pfp and GrM. NK cells have been reported to cause target cell necrosis (47Vujanovic N.L. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 415-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and/or apoptosis (48Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 59: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and some previous studies suggest that serine proteases may be required for optimal pfp function (49Woodard S.L. Fraser S.A. Winkler U. Jackson D.S. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4988-4993PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, initially we examined the ability of GrM to simply potentiate the lytic function of pfp against red blood cell membranes. Over a broad range of pfp concentrations we demonstrated that neither GrM nor GrB was able to simply enhance the lytic activity of pfp (Fig. 2A). To further characterize the death of nucleated Jurkat cells exposed to pfp and GrM we next analyzed their scatter properties and DNA content. Consistent with previous findings (45Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Cancilla M. Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Sedelies K. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), Jurkat cells exposed to both pfp and GrB for 2 h developed apoptotic changes, including DNA fragmentation (87% sub-G1), reduced size (reduced forward scatter), and increased granularity (increased side scatter) (Fig. 2B). By contrast, no such changes in propidium iodide staining, forward scatter, or side scatter were observed in target cells incubated in the presence of pfp or pfp and GrM in combination. GrM/pfp also failed to cause any cytostatic effect after 4 h of exposure as determined by assessing the cell cycle after 24 h by PI staining (data not shown). Staining with the vital dye PI and Fluos-coupled annexin V, which detects externalized phosphatidylserine, is a further hallmark of apoptotic cells. It has been recognized that cells undergoing apoptosis transit from an annexin V+/PI- stage to terminate as annexin V+/PI+. After 2 h of exposure we detected an equivalent number of live cells (annexin V- PI-)in cultures incubated with GrB/pfp and GrM/pfp (46 and 53%, respectively) compared with control cultures (Fig. 2C). Strikingly, however, Jurkat cells exposed to GrB/pfp were 26% single annexin V+ and 27% annexin V+PI+, compared with 8% single annexin V+ and 36% annexin V+PI+ for GrM/pfp-exposed cultures (Fig. 2C). These data indicated that GrM/pfp killed Jurkat target cells but did not induce a detectable single annexin V+ stage of cell death. A similar lack of transition of Jurkat cells through a single positive stage was also observed in cells exposed to GrM/pfp for shorter periods (15 min to 1 h) of time (data not shown). GrM Does Not Activate the Mitochondria-dependent Apoptotic Pathway—Mitochondria have been shown to play a role in GrB-induced cell death. In this instance Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the release of proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (e.g. cytochrome c and smac), which then participate in the activation of caspases (50Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Bcl-2 could inhibit GrM/pfp-mediated lysis in Jurkat cells. Consistent with previous reports (40Sutton V.R. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar), Bcl-2 inhibited GrB/pfp-mediated DNA fragmentation and lysis (Fig. 3A). By contrast, GrM/pfp was equally effective in killing Jurkat-Bcl-2 and parental Jurkat target cells (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins were released during GrM-induced cell death, we followed cytochrome c release by immunocytochemistry. For immunocytochemistry, the pellets of digitonin-treated samples were stained for the presence of cytochrome c and analyzed by flow cytometry (43Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this assay the percentage of cells that have maintained cytochrome c within the mitochondria can be quantitated. We found that after 2 h, 31% of GrB/pfp-treated cells had released cytochrome c (Fig. 3B). At this point, when GrM/pfp had caused significant 51Cr release, there was no evidence of cytochrome c release (Figs. 1B and 3B). To determine whether GrM/pfp induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, release of the mitochondrion-specific fluorescent dye, TMRE, was measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 3C). Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was maintained in the majority of untreated Jurkat cells or those exposed to pfp alone, GrM/pfp, or Gr"

This process, called “three-dimensional domain swapping,” has also been suggested to play a part in the generation of amyloid fibrils. One variant of cystatin C, L68Q cystatin C, is highly amyloidogenic, and persons carrying the corresponding gene suffer from massive cerebral amyloidosis leading to brain hemorrhage and death in early adult life. The present work describes the production of two variants of wild type and L68Q cystatin C with disulfide bridges at positions selected to inhibit domain swapping without affecting the biological function of the four cystatin C variants as cysteine protease inhibitors. The capacity of the four variant proteins to form dimers was tested and compared with that of wild type and L68Q cystatin C. In contrast to the latter two proteins, all four protein variants stabilized by disulfide bridges were resistant toward the formation of dimers. The capacity of the two stabilized variants of wild type cystatin C to form amyloid fibrils was investigated and found to be reduced by 80% compared with that of wild type cystatin C.

The heart acquires fatty acids associated with albumin or derived from lipoprotein lipase (LpL)-mediated hydrolysis of lipoprotein triglyceride (TG). We generated heart-specific LpL knock-out mice (hLpL0) to determine whether cardiac LpL modulates the actions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and affects whole body lipid metabolism. Male hLpL0 mice had significantly elevated plasma TG levels and decreased clearance of postprandial lipids despite normal postheparin plasma LpL activity. Very large density lipoprotein-TG uptake was decreased by 72% in hLpL0 hearts. However, heart uptake of albumin-bound free fatty acids was not altered. Northern blot analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-response genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. Surprisingly, the expression of glucose transporters 1 and 4 and insulin receptor substrate 2 was increased and that of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and insulin receptor substrate 1 was reduced. Basal glucose uptake was increased markedly in hLpL0 hearts. Thus, the loss of LpL in the heart leads to defective plasma metabolism of TG. Moreover, fatty acids derived from lipoprotein TG and not just albumin-associated fatty acids are important for cardiac lipid metabolism and gene regulation.

Moreover, fatty acids derived from lipoprotein TG and not just albumin-associated fatty acids are important for cardiac lipid metabolism and gene regulation. The heart, unlike most skeletal muscles, is constantly undergoing contraction and relaxation, events that require a large amount of energy. Under normal conditions, the heart derives ∼70% of its energy from the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (FA) 1The abbreviations used are: FA, fatty acids; VLDL, very large density lipoproteins; LpL, lipoprotein lipase; TG, triglyceride; hLpL0, cardiac-specific LpL knock-out; ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; CD36, fatty acids translocase; PPARα and PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ; GLUT1 and GLUT4, glucose transporters 1 and 4; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; IRS-1 and IRS-2, insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2; PKB, protein kinase B. and the remainder comes from glucose and lactate metabolism (1van der Vusse G.J. van Bilsen M.

However, a number of conditions including fasting, aerobic exercise, and diabetes increase the contribution of FA to ATP production by the heart (3Lopaschuk G.D. Belke D.D. Gamble J. Itoi T.

We used the Cre-loxP recombination system to generate mice with a cardiac-specific ablation of the LpL gene to elucidate the role of cardiac LpL in heart and plasma lipoprotein metabolism and gene expression. This allowed us to investigate the role of LpL in the heart without directly altering LpL function and activity in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. Our data show that the loss of LpL in the heart leads to hypertriglyceridemia and postprandial lipemia. In addition, there was a marked reduction in the expression of key enzymes required for FA metabolism, attesting to the importance of TG-derived FA in cardiac energy metabolism and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Generation of LpL loxP Mice—A targeting vector was constructed to enable cardiac-specific Cre-mediated deletion of mouse LpL-exon 1. A 6.5-kb HpaI-BamHI LpL-genomic fragment (including LpL promoter sequences and exon 1) derived from isogenic S129/J DNA (8Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setala K. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R.

A single loxP site (including a HindIII recognition sequence at the 3′ end for later screening) was introduced into the LpL-NheI site within intron 1. A XbaI-digested gene cassette containing the neomycin resistance gene and thymidine kinase gene flanked by two loxP sites (9Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) was inserted into the LpL-SpeI site ∼0.8 kb upstream of the first exon. The final targeting vector was linearized with NdeI for electroporation into embryonic stem cells. Clones with homologous recombination of the LpL loxP gene were identified, and the neomycin selection cassette was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase. pCre-Pac plasmid containing a puromycin resistance gene was electroporated into homologous recombinant embryonic stem cells. Seven clones positive for the loxP flanked LpL exon 1 and a deletion of the selection cassette were screened by PCR and injected into the blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice. Chimera mice were obtained, and germ line transmission was confirmed by Southern blotting. Cardiac-selective LpL-ablated Mice—Mice with cardiomyocyte-selective deletion of LpL were generated by crossing mice heterozygous for the floxed LpL allele with transgenic mice in which cardiac-specific expression of cre recombinase was driven by the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (cre) (provided by Dr. Michael Schneider, Baylor University) (10Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Cardiac-specific LpL knock-outs (hLpL0) were then generated by crossing cre+/lox mice with LpL loxP heterozygous mice (+/lox). The presence of the cre transgene and the modified LpL alleles were verified by PCR and Southern blotting of digested genomic DNA with a 3′-BamHI-HindIII probe (Fig. 1A). For the cre transgene, the following PCR primers were used: 5′-ATG ACA GAC AGA TCC CTC CTA-3′ and 5′-CTC ATC ACT TCG TTG CAT CGA C-3′. The primers used for identifying the presence of the third loxP site are as follows: 5′-CGG CTT AGC TCA GTA CTC AA-3′ and 5′-TCT AGG CAG AGA GCA GCA GA-3′. Heart and Plasma Lipids, FA, and Glucose—We collected blood from 6-h fasted 2-month-old mice and measured plasma lipoproteins by fast performance liquid chromatography as described previously (11Yagyu H.

Heart and plasma TG, cholesterol, FA, and glucose were measured enzymatically as described previously (4Augustus A.S. Kako Y. Yagyu H. Goldberg I.J. Am. J.

We injected fasting male mice intravenously with 10 units of heparin and collected blood 10 min later. Plasma samples were assayed in triplicate for LpL activity. LpL activity in homogenized tissues was measured as described by Hocquette et al. (14Hocquette J.F. Graulet B. Olivecrona T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1998; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Murine LpL protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously by van Vlijmen et al.

Cardiac Muscle Gene Expression—Total RNA (15 μg) was isolated from hearts using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing formamide and transferred to nylon filters (Amersham Biosciences). We used the following probes for Northern blotting: murine LpL, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, fatty acid transport protein (FATP), fatty acid translocase (CD36), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ (PPARα and PPARγ), glucose transporters 1 and 4 (GLUT1 and GLUT4), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2). Results are normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Postprandial Lipid Metabolism—We gavaged 2-month old 6-h fasting male hLpL0 and wild type mice with corn oil (10 mg/kg), collected blood from the retro-orbital plexus at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h, and measured plasma TG concentration. In Vivo Kinetic Studies—In vivo labeling of [3H]VLDL was performed as described previously (15Aalto-Setala K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]Palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was complexed to 6% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as described previously (16Coburn C.T. Knapp Jr., F.F. Febbraio M. Beets A.L. Silverstein R.L. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32523-32529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We injected fasted hLpL0 and wild type mice intravenously with 1 × 106 cpm of [3H]VLDL and 333,000 cpm of [14C]palmitate-bovine serum albumin and collected blood at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 min after injection. 5 min after injection, we perfused the body cavity with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline by cardiac puncture and excised tissues. Immunoblotting—Tissue lysates (40 μg) from fed and 6-h fasted mice were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting under reducing conditions on 10% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and blots were incubated with primary antibodies to phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In Vivo Assessment of Cardiac Glucose Metabolism—Basal glucose uptake was measured in hearts following an intravenous administration of 3 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blood was collected 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min following injection, hearts were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, tissues were excised, and radioactive counts were measured. A 120-min hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was conducted in awake hLpL0 mice (n = 5) and wild type littermates (n = 5) by infusing human insulin (Humulin, Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ) at a rate of 15 pmol/kg/min. To determine whole body glucose turnover and heart-specific glucose metabolism, [3-3H]glucose and 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose were administered during clamps as described previously (17Kim J.K. Michael M.D. Previs S.F. Peroni O.D. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Neschen S. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Tissues were taken at the end of clamps to assess rates of whole body and cardiac glucose metabolism. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons were made using Student's t test. Generation and Characterization of Mice with Cardiac-specific LpL Ablation (hLpL0)—Chimeric mice containing the LpL-floxed allele were crossed with C57BL/6 mice. We then crossed F1 mice, which contained one wild type and one loxP-containing LpL allele (+/lox) (Fig. 1A) with myosin heavy chain cre-transgenic mice. The offspring were crossed with mice heterozygous for the modified LpL gene, generating mice with a cardiac-specific LpL ablation (hLpL0). This breeding scheme produced six genotypes: cre-transgenic, cre +/lox, cre lox/lox, +/+ (wild type), +/lox, and lox/lox. HLpL0 (cre lox/lox) mice were born with the expected Mendelian frequency (12.5%), indicating that the absence of cardiac LpL did not cause embryonic lethality. In addition to genotyping mice by PCR, we performed a Southern blot on murine tail DNA to assess the presence of the second loxP site (Fig. 1B). Hearts from hLpL0 mice had a dramatic reduction in LpL message compared with wild type, cre, and lox/lox mice, which expressed LpL in abundance (Fig. 1C). In addition, hearts from hLpL0 mice had 78% less LpL activity than wild type (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1D). The small amount of residual LpL might be because of translocation of LpL from other organs such as muscle or adipose tissue. However, it probably is more because of the expression of the LpL gene in non-myocytes, e.g. macrophages or adipocytes, found in the heart (18Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). LpL expression and protein content in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue did not differ between the groups (Fig. 1, E and F). Male hLpL0 mice had significantly elevated plasma TG compared with wild type controls (n = 9) (192 ± 24 versus 76 ± 5 mg/dl; p < 0.001) (Table I). This was attributed to an increase in VLDL-TG as indicated by fast performance liquid chromatography analysis (Fig. 2A). Female hLpL0 mice tended to have increased TG, but this was not significant (p = 0.15) (Table I).Table IPlasma lipids, glucose, and free fatty acid profileNumberTriglyceride cholesterolGlucoseFFAmg/dlmg/dlmmol/literWild type976 ± 5120 ± 7109 ± 80.9 ± 0.1hLpL09192 ± 24ap < 0.01.125 ± 8119 ± 150.8 ± 0.2a p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab We obtained postheparin plasma from hLpL0 and wild type mice (n = 5) and assayed for LpL activity (Fig. 2C) and protein (Fig. 2D). Although in hLpL0 mice LpL activity was 16% less and LpL protein was 20% less, this was not statistically significant. Postheparin plasma LpL activity was 58 ± 7 versus 49 ± 5 mmol/ml/h, and mass was 115 ± 28 versus 92 ± 17 ng/ml. Lipoprotein TG and FA Metabolism—Plasma postprandial TG was increased markedly in the hLpL0 mice (Fig. 3A). Plasma TG levels peaked 4 h following gavage and remained elevated in hLpL0 mice compared with wild type. Thus, the loss of LpL in the heart dramatically altered whole body metabolism of postprandial TG. We assessed the tissue uptake of labeled VLDL and FFA. This was assessed over 5 min to allow us to determine the heart accumulation of [14C]palmitate and [3H]TG-VLDL prior to any recycling of the labels (4Augustus A.S. Kako Y. Yagyu H. Goldberg I.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E331-E339Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Heart uptake of [3H]VLDL-TG was decreased significantly by 72% in hLpL0 mice compared with wild type (Fig. 3B), whereas heart uptake of [14C]palmitate did not differ between the groups (Fig. 3C). Despite the normal level of LpL activity, there was also a slight reduction in muscle VLDL uptake. Perhaps the hypertriglyceridemia led to extensive product inhibition of LpL in this tissue. Heart content of both TG and FA, but not cholesterol, was reduced in hLpL0 hearts (Fig. 3, D and E). Therefore, the loss of cardiac LpL dramatically decreased the uptake of lipoprotein-derived FA and reduced heart lipid content. Northern Blot Analysis of Genes Involved in Lipid and Glucose Metabolism—To determine whether the decrease in lipoprotein TG uptake by the heart altered cardiac gene expression, we assessed the expression of several genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. We observed a decrease in the expression of ACO, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, FATP, and CD36 in hearts from hLpL0 mice (Fig. 4, A–D). The expression of PPARγ, but not PPARα, was reduced markedly (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, the loss of LpL altered the expression of PPARα-responsive genes and decreased PPARγ expression. GLUT4, but not GLUT1 expression, was increased in these hearts (Fig. 4, G and H). Moreover, PDK4 expression was reduced markedly in hearts lacking LpL (Fig. 4I). These data suggest that hearts lacking LpL have increased glucose oxidation. Surprisingly, IRS-1 expression was reduced dramatically and IRS-2 expression was increased (Fig. 4, J and K). To determine whether the loss of IRS-1 expression affected down-stream insulin signaling molecules required for the translocation of GLUT4 transporters, we assayed for phosphorylated Akt/PKB protein content by immunoblotting. Active Akt/PKB protein content did not differ between groups during the fasted (Fig. 5A) or fed (Fig. 5B) state. In Vivo Glucose Metabolism in hLpL0 Hearts—To determine the effects of heart LpL deletion on glucose metabolism in vivo, we studied basal uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose into control and hLpL0 hearts in fasting mice. The two groups of mice had identical basal plasma glucose (Table I) and insulin levels (Fig. 6A). However, there was a dramatic increase in basal glucose uptake into hLpL0 hearts, an 8-fold increase (Fig. 6B). Greater cardiac glucose metabolism is consistent with elevated expression of GLUT4 and reduction in PDK4 in the hLpL0 mice. Thus, LpL deficiency changed heart substrate preference. We next assessed whether glucose uptake also was altered under stimulated conditions, i.e. in the presence of high concentrations of insulin. In part, this allowed us to assess the effects of the alterations in IRS expression. A 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiment was conducted in awake hLpL0 mice and wild type littermates. Insulin-stimulated whole body glucose turnover (Fig. 6C) and insulin action in liver (data not shown) were not altered in the hLpL0 mice, indicating that heart-specific deletion of LpL did not affect whole body glucose homeostasis. In contrast, insulin-stimulated heart-specific glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis showed a tendency to increase in the hLpL0 mice as compared with the wild type mice (p = 0.08 for both glucose uptake and glycolysis) (Fig. 6, D–F). Thus, the most dramatic changes in cardiac glucose metabolism were found under basal conditions. We have created a cardiac specific LpL knock out mouse using cre-loxP gene targeting. hLpL0 mice are viable and have normal development. We observed several important physiological roles of LpL using this mouse model. 1) Cardiac LpL is an important modulator of plasma TG levels. 2) Decreased uptake of lipoprotein-derived FA reduced expression of genes required for FA oxidation. 3) Cardiac glucose uptake was increased without alteration in whole body glucose homeostasis. 4) Surprisingly, the insulin-signaling pathway was altered and IRS-1 expression was reduced while IRS-2 expression was increased. Our data show an important and little appreciated role of heart LpL in regulating plasma TG levels. hLpL0 mice exhibited increased plasma TG levels, even though postheparin plasma LpL activity and mass were similar to wild type. The observation that heart LpL is a major determinant of plasma lipoprotein levels is surprising because it is widely believed that most TG hydrolysis occurs in skeletal muscle and adipose capillaries (19Heeren J. Niemeier A. Merkel M. Beisiegel U. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, our observations are consistent with studies by Levak-Frank et al. (6Levak-Frank S. Hofmann W. Weinstock P.H. Radner H. Sattler W. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3165-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) who reported that moderate LpL expression in the heart alone was sufficient to maintain normal plasma TG levels despite the absence of skeletal muscle and adipose LpL and reduced postheparin plasma LpL activity. Thus, cardiac LpL has a tremendous capacity for lipoprotein TG hydrolysis and appears to be more active than LpL in other tissue capillary beds. The reasons for this are unclear but might relate to differences in cardiac capillary blood flow, the relative density of LpL molecules, or reduced FA inhibition of LpL because of efficient uptake of FA via CD36 and/or other FA transport proteins (20Gimeno R.E. Ortegon A.M. Patel S. Punreddy S. Ge P. Sun Y. Lodish H.F. Stahl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16039-16044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The loss of LpL expression in the heart markedly decreased the clearance of postprandial TG (Fig. 3A). In contrast, mice heterozygous for the LpL gene have relatively normal post-prandial TG clearance despite having a much greater defect in total body LpL (8Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setala K. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenburg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These data highlight the importance of cardiac LpL in regulating plasma TG levels as well as clearing postprandial lipoproteins. The high energy demands of the heart require a readily accessible and large supply of FA for the production of ATP. FA bound to albumin are thought to be the primary source of FA delivered to the heart (3Lopaschuk G.D. Belke D.D. Gamble J. Itoi T. Schonekess B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) with a second source of FA coming from lipoproteins. Because acute inhibition of LpL activity decreased heart-specific uptake of TG-derived FA (4Augustus A.S. Kako Y. Yagyu H. Goldberg I.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E331-E339Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), this second pathway must be highly dependent on LpL. The effects of chronic ablation of heart LpL on cardiac gene expression had not been investigated until now. By knocking out LpL specifically in cardiac muscle, we have shown that loss of lipoprotein TG uptake by the heart down-regulates the expression of key enzymes involved in FA metabolism including ACO, FATP1, and CD36. This occurred with no change in PPARα expression, consistent with LpL loss leading to decreased activation of this transcription factor. Thus, LpL provides lipid for intracellular gene regulation. Unexpectedly, PPARγ expression was markedly down-regulated in hLpL0 hearts. The reasons for this are unclear. Several groups of long chain FA have been implicated as natural ligands for PPARα and PPARγ (21Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). These include saturated and unsaturated FA and eicosanoid metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (21Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). The reduced expression of PPARα-regulated genes with no change in PPARα mRNA in hLpL0 hearts suggests that LpL-mediated hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins is providing a ligand for PPARα activation. This finding suggests that lipoprotein-derived lipids, perhaps in preference to albumin-associated FA or other molecules, activate PPARα. These results are in agreement with some recent in vitro data implicating LpL-generated fatty acids as activators of PPARs in cultured endothelial cells and macrophages (22Ziouzenkova O. Perrey S. Asatryan L. Hwang J. MacNaul K.L. Moller D.E. Rader D.J. Sevanian A. Zechner R. Hoefler G. Plutzky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, our data demonstrate that LpL activation of PPARs occurs (a) in vivo, (b) in the presence of physiologic levels of plasma lipoproteins and FA, and (c) with amounts of LpL expressed in normal hearts. Interestingly, hLpL0 hearts exhibited a trend toward increased GLUT4 expression (p = 0.07). Hearts overexpressing LpL (24Yagyu H. Chen G. Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Augustus A. Kako Y. Seo T. Hu Y. Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Bensadoun A. Homma S. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the converse situation, had a decrease in GLUT4 gene expression. In addition, GLUT4 mRNA was decreased in hearts overexpressing PPARα (25Finck B.N. Lehman J.J. Leone T.C. Welch M.J. Bennett M.J. Kovacs A. Han X. Gross R.W. Kozak R. Lopaschuk G.D. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Acute regulation of GLUT4 actions is primarily via insulin-mediated translocation of this protein from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (26Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar, 27Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular lipids are thought to interfere with insulin signaling, perhaps via alteration in protein kinase C phosphorylation of IRS (28Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Our data suggest, that aside from the well known modulation of insulin signaling by muscle lipid content (28Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), lipid regulation of glucose transport also occurs via changes in gene transcription. The changes PDK4 expression suggested that glucose oxidation was increased in hLpL0 hearts. Indeed, despite normal plasma glucose and insulin, heart glucose uptake was dramatically elevated in fasting mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps showed a tendency toward greater cardiac glucose uptake and metabolism in hLpL0 hearts; however, the differences between wild type and hLpL0 animals were much less dramatic than those observed under basal conditions. PDK4 is a known PPARα-response gene that tightly regulates glucose oxidation in the heart. Decreased expression of this gene in the hLpL0 hearts indicated increased glucose oxidation. GLUT4 primarily mediates insulin-stimulated but not basal glucose uptake. Therefore, it is possible that other GLUTs are responsible for the increase glucose uptake in hLpL0 hearts. Taken together, our results suggest that reduced cardiac lipid metabolism because of the deletion of cardiac LpL led to transcriptional changes associated with greater cardiac glucose metabolism. Thus, increased glucose utilization substituted for reduced TG-derived FA metabolism in these hearts. Surprisingly, hLpL0 hearts had reduced IRS-1 and increased IRS-2 gene expression. Normally, IRS-1 is the primary mediator of insulin signaling in the heart (29Velloso L.A. Carvalho C.R. Rojas F.A. Folli F. Saad M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). IRS-2 is also expressed in the heart (29Velloso L.A. Carvalho C.R. Rojas F.A. Folli F. Saad M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but is more important in the pancreas and liver. Within an individual tissue, the actions of these signaling molecules are not thought to be compensatory (30Giovannone B. Scaldaferri M.L. Federici M. Porzio O. Lauro D. Fusco A. Sbraccia P. Borboni P. Lauro R. Sesti G. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 2000; 16: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Sesti G. Federici M. Hribal M.L. Lauro D. Sbraccia P. Lauro R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that increased IRS-2 expression in the hLpL0 hearts allowed for normal insulin signaling despite the reduction in IRS-1 expression. Akt/PKB phosphorylation, which is required for intracellular trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (32Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar), was normal in hLpL0 hearts. Moreover, we observed normal cardiac glucose metabolism in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies. Greater uptake of glucose under basal conditions was also observed in IRS-1 knock-out mice. They have elevated basal uptake of 2-deoxyglucose into skeletal muscle (33Dumke C.L. Wetter A.C. Arias E.B. Kahn C.R. Cartee G.D. Horm. Metab. Res. 2001; 33: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) but reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (34Previs S.F. Withers D.J. Ren J.M. White M.F. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38990-38994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein were normal, but other GLUTs were not assessed. Thus, compensatory processes that occur with IRS-1 loss elevated basal glucose uptake both in IRS-1 knock-out and hLpL0 mice. Whereas this compensation could be mediated by the IRS-2 up-regulation, it is also possible that non-insulin-stimulated pathways are involved. Such pathways were found in mice having heart-specific deletion of insulin receptors (35Belke D.D. Betuing S. Tuttle M.J. Graveleau C. Young M.E. Pham M. Zhang D. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Litwin S.E. Taegtmeyer H. Severson D. Kahn C.R. Abel E.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Despite loss of insulin actions, basal glucose uptake in these hearts was normal. The functional consequences of decreased IRS-1 expression in the heart have not been reported. A reduction in FA oxidation and increased glucose utilization by the heart has been observed in several pathological conditions including ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardiac hypertrophy (36Liao R. Jain M. Cui L. D'Agostino J. Aiello F. Luptak I. Ngoy S. Mortensen R.M. Tian R. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In our model, loss of LpL in the heart increased glucose utilization. This finding suggests that changes in glucose metabolism are driven by an initial depression of FA uptake and demonstrate the interdependence of glucose and FA metabolism. Perhaps for this reason, we have found no alterations in cardiac functions in these mice because the hearts have switched substrate preference from FA to glucose. In summary, we have created for the first time mice with a tissue-specific deletion of LpL of the heart. Studies in these mice show that cardiac LpL is important for regulating plasma TG levels as well as clearing postprandial lipoproteins. LpL generates lipolysis products that modulate PPAR actions. Finally, LpL activity regulates metabolic switching between glucose and FA uptake in the heart."

Defects in repairing these lesions are associated with human chromosome fragility syndromes such as Werner syndrome (WS), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), ataxia telangiectasia (AT), and ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD).

We show that Nbs1 is essential for bridging the interaction between WRN and the Mre11 complex in vivo and in vitro and for the Mre11 complex stimulation of WRN helicase activity. We show co-localization and increased association between WRN and Nbs1 in response to DNA DSBs or ICLs. We also show that cells deficient in WRN and/or Nbs1 respond similarly to these types of DNA damage. Our results provide molecular support for a model in which Nbs1 recruits WRN to deal with DNA DSBs and ICLs and for the observed partially overlapping phenotypes among these chromosome fragility syndromes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, siRNA, and Transfections—The primary NBS (GM07166B) and normal (GM00038B, MRC-5/AG05965E) fibroblasts were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. HeLa and the SV-40-transformed NBS and Nbs1-complemented fibroblasts (17Kobayashi J. Tauchi H. Sakamoto S. Nakamura A. Morishima K. Matsuura S. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Tanimoto K. Komatsu K. Curr.

The Sf9 insect cells were coinfected with baculoviruses containing WRN (19Orren D.K. Brosh Jr. R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A.

The sequence for the hairpin siRNA (UAGAGGGAAACUUGGCAAAUU) targeted against WRN mRNA was cloned into the pSilencer 3.0-H1 vector (Ambion Inc.). NBS and Nbs1-complemented NBS cells were transfected with either the control (Ambion) or the WRN siRNA vector using a Nucleofector™ normal human dermal fibroblast kit (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant, histidine-tagged wild type and mutant WRN proteins were purified using a baculovirus/insect expression system as described previously (19Orren D.K. Brosh Jr. R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The K-WRN mutant (K577M) lacks the helicase activity, and the X-WRN mutant (E84A) lacks the exonuclease activity. The Mre11 complex (M/R/N), the Mre11 complex lacking Nbs1 (M/R), and the HD125LV exonuclease-inactive Mre11 complex (X-M/R/N) were expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system with the Mre11 complex and Nbs1 containing C-terminal hexahistidine tags. The complex was purified by a combination of Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography.Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblot Analysis, and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Experiments—Lysates from 2 × 106 cells were prepared in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors. Pre-cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with WRN (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Nbs1, Mre11, or Rad50 (Novus) polyclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by 2 h of incubation with protein A-Sepharose. For co-immunoprecipitation of the purified proteins, both the proteins and the protein A-Sepharose were pre-incubated in the buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin. For separation of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, we used the NE-PER™ extraction reagents (Pierce). We used mouse monoclonal antibodies (WRN, clone 30; Nbs1, clone 34; Mre11, clone 18; Rad50, clone 13; BD Transduction Laboratories) for immunoblotting analyses. Membranes were stripped by the Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) when necessary. The GST-WRN fragments were expressed and purified as described (18von Kobbe C. Karmakar P. Dawut L.

Briefly, purified GST and GST-WRN fragments were incubated with 750 ng of purified Nbs1 protein, and the adsorbates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to detect the bound Nbs1, followed by Amido Black staining.Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 15-mm dishes. Cells were treated with γ-irradiation (20 Gy, using Gammacell 40, a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.82 Gy/min; Nordion International Inc.) or mitomycin C (0.5 μg/ml). After 1–16 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with ice-cold 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and incubated with rabbit antiserum against WRN, Mre11, or Nbs1 (Novus) or with goat antiserum against WRN (Santa Cruz, N-19). Immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described previously (18von Kobbe C. Karmakar P. Dawut L. Opresko P. Zeng X. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22035-22044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescence was visualized by using a laser scan confocal microscope (Zeiss 410) with deconvolution, and images were processed using the Metamorph imaging system 4.1 (Universal Imaging Corp.). Three to six independent experiments were conducted. Single cell images are representatives of at least 50 randomly selected cells.3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assays—We used the Vybrant® MTT Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the siRNA vector-transfected cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 1,000 cells/well. Three days after the transfection, cells were treated with γ-irradiation (0–5 Gy) or mitomycin C (0–125 ng/ml, 24 h). MTT assays were performed 2 days after the drug treatments.Catalytic Activity Assays—Proteins were pre-incubated with their binding partners for 5 min at room temperature prior to the standard assays for WRN catalytic activities. WRN helicase and exonuclease activities were conducted using the 22- and the 34-bp forked duplex with a blunt end as a substrate, respectively, as described previously (21Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide was 5′-end labeled with 32P at the non-complementary end, followed by an annealing step to generate the forked duplex. Exonuclease assays were performed in the standard MgCl2 containing buffer with additional MnCl2 (5 mm). ATPase assays were conducted by incubating proteins in a buffer (40 mm Tris pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 ng of DNA, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at 37 °C for 30 min. After stopping the reaction by adding EDTA to 150 mm, samples were analyzed with polyethylenimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography by developing them in 750 mm KH2PO4. Results were visualized by PhosphorImager and quantitated by ImageQuant. Values are average of at least two independent experiments.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInteraction of WRN with the Mre11 Complex via Nbs1—To examine whether a linkage exists between WRN and the Mre11 complex, we first conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates from HeLa cells. Analyses of anti-WRN immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with antibodies against Nbs1, Mre11, or Rad50 demonstrated associations of WRN with all three components of the Mre11 complex (Fig. 1A). When anti-Nbs1, anti-Mre11, and anti-Rad50 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-WRN antibody in reciprocal experiments, the results confirmed the association between WRN and the Mre11 complex (Fig. 1B, top panel). As expected, all three Mre11 components were associated with each other (4Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, middle and bottom panels). To determine the partner of the Mre11 complex that directly interacts with WRN, we co-infected Sf9 insect cells with pairwise combinations of baculoviruses for WRN together with Nbs1, Mre11, or Rad50. Each of the three pairs of human proteins was successfully overexpressed (Fig. 1C, lanes 6, 12, and 18). Immunoblotting analyses of anti-WRN immunoprecipitates from the insect cell lysates demonstrated that WRN significantly associated with Nbs1 (Fig. 1C, lane 5), but only very minimally with Mre11 (lane 11) or Rad50 (lane 17). The coimmunoprecipitation between WRN and Nbs1 was not disrupted by ethidium bromide or DNaseI treatment (Fig. 2B, and data not shown), suggesting that this interaction was not due to DNA bridging. These results suggested a direct association between WRN and Nbs1 in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates from NBS and normal fibroblasts. Analyses of anti-WRN immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting showed that WRN associated with Mre11 and Rad50 only in the normal fibroblasts, but not in the NBS fibroblast (Fig. 1D). The protein levels of WRN, Rad50, and Mre11 were comparable between the two cell lines (Figs. 1, D and E). Next, we compared the protein levels using nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from NBS (GM07166) and normal fibroblasts (GM00038) before or after γ-irradiation (20 Gy for 8 h). Consistent with an earlier report showing that Mre11 was mis-located to the cytoplasm in the W1799 NBS fibroblasts by immunostaining (4Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), we detected a significant portion of the Mre11 and Rad50 proteins in the cytoplasmic fraction from the NBS, but not in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 1E). This is concomitant with a decrease in the levels of Mre11 and Rad50 proteins in the nuclear fraction in the NBS fibroblasts, as compared with the normal fibroblasts. The WRN protein level was detected only in the nuclear fraction, and the amount is comparable between these two fibroblasts. Treatment of the cells with γ-irradiation did not affect any of the four protein levels in either of the cells. Therefore, the defect of the WRN association with Mre11 and Rad50 in NBS cells is not due to the lack of Mre11 and Rad50 proteins. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that WRN associates with the Mre11 complex via binding to Nbs1 in vivo.Fig. 2Co-localization of and increased association between WRN and Nbs1 in cells treated with γ-irradiation (20 Gy) or mitomycin C (MMC; 0.5 μg/ml for 16 h). A, MRC-5 cells were fixed either untreated at 4 or 8 h post-irradiation (IR) or 16 h after the MMC treatment and stained with goat antiserum against WRN (red) and rabbit antiserum against Nbs1 (green). B, increased association between WRN and the Mre11 complex 8 h after treatment of HeLa cells with γ-irradiation (20 Gy). The lysates were incubated in the presence or absence of ethidium bromide (10 μg/ml) during the immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates (IP) were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) using the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm a direct protein interaction in vitro, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using purified WRN protein together with a purified Mre11 complex or an Mre11 complex lacking Nbs1. Analyses of anti-WRN immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting showed that the association of WRN with Mre11 and Rad50 did not occur if the Mre11 complex did not contain Nbs1 (Fig. 1F). Therefore, WRN binds directly to the Mre11 complex via Nbs1 in vitro. To investigate how WRN interacts with Nbs1, we fused WRN domains to GST and incubated them with purified Nbs1 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1G, the WRN helicase (fragment labeled 5) and exonuclease (fragments 2 and 3) domains bound Nbs1 strongly, whereas the C-terminal WRN (fragment 6) bound weakly to Nbs1. Neither GST alone nor the WRN acidic region (Fig. 1G, fragments labeled 1 and 4) bound Nbs1. These data indicate that the Mre11 complex binds WRN via Nbs1 in vitro, and this physical interaction is most likely mediated by the exonuclease and helicase domains of WRN.Co-localization and Increased Association between WRN and Nbs1 after DNA Damage—DNA DSBs are introduced into the genome during normal DNA metabolism or by exogenous sources, including ionizing radiation and oxidative stress. Because cells from either WS or NBS individuals are hypersensitive to γ-irradiation (3Varon R. Vissinga C. Platzer M. Cerosaletti K.M. Chrzanowska K.H. Saar K. Beckmann G. Seemanova E. Cooper P.R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we tested whether WRN co-localized with the Mre11 complex by immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 2A). Prior to damage, the majority of WRN was in the nucleolus, whereas Nbs1 was distributed in the nucleoplasm in a scattered form. In response to γ-irradiation (20 Gy), WRN was confined to the nucleoli at 2 h (data not shown) but began to re-localize to the nucleoplasm and formed distinct nuclear foci thereafter, whereas the patterns of Nbs1 immunostaining changed from the smaller dots at 2 h (data not shown) to distinct foci at 8 h. Nbs1 was found to be nucleolus-excluded before and after the γ-irradiation treatment. Kinetic analyses revealed that WRN and Nbs1 did not co-localize at 2 h, but partially co-localized at 4 h and co-localized at distinct foci extensively at 8 h (Fig. 2A). We also treated EGFP-WRN-expressing HeLa cells with γ-irradiation (20 Gy). Consistently, these direct fluorescence results showed that EGFP-WRN relocalized to the nucleoplasm and co-localized with Nbs1 and Mre11 (data not shown) at 8 h after the treatment. Therefore, WRN co-localizes with Nbs1 after γ-irradiation treatment in a time-dependent manner.Repair of DNA ICLs presents a challenge for cells, partially due to the involvement of both DNA strands and the requirement for several DNA repair pathways, including nucleotide excision and recombinational repair (16McHugh P.J. Spanswick V.J. Hartley J.A. Lancet Oncol. 2001; 2: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The chemotherapy drug mitomycin C induces DNA ICLs and predisposes WS and NBS cells to death (2Poot M. Yom J.S. Whang S.H. Kato J.T. Gollahon K.A. Rabinovitch P.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1224-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Williams B.R. Mirzoeva O.K. Morgan W.F. Lin J. Dunnick W. Petrini J.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 648-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). At 16 h after treatment of the MRC-5 primary cells with mitomycin C (0.5 μg/ml), WRN left the nucleolus, and both WRN and Nbs1 formed distinct nuclear foci. As a result, WRN co-localized with Nbs1 to a great extent (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that WRN leaves the nucleolus and co-localizes with the Nbs1 foci in response to γ-irradiation and the DNA interstrand cross-linker.To further investigate the nature of the interaction between WRN and the Mre11 complex, we tested for their association before and after cellular stress. Cells were treated with γ-irradiation, and the lysates were used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether the association between WRN and the Mre11 complex was altered. We found that treatment of HeLa cells with γ-irradiation (20 Gy; Fig. 2B) substantially increased the amount of Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50 in the anti-WRN immunoprecipitates at 8 h. The γ-irradiation treatment had no effect on the level of WRN (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Incubation of the immunocomplexes with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2B) or DNaseI (data not shown) did not affect the protein associations,. Thus, although the yeast Nbs1 ortholog Xrs2 was reported to bind to the sites of DNA DSBs (25Nakada D. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1957-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), our results demonstrated that the increased interactions observed were not due to DNA bridging. Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, these biochemical results demonstrate that the association between WRN and the Mre11 complex is increased in cells after treatment with γ-irradiation.Convergence of the Nbs1 and WRN Pathways in Response to DNA Damage—To examine a functional role for the interplay between WRN and Nbs1 in vivo, siRNA was used to decrease WRN levels in NBS and Nbs1-complemented NBS cells. Cells were transiently transfected (2–4 days) with either a control or a WRN siRNA-containing vector. Immunoblotting showed that WRN protein levels were almost completely depleted 3 days after transfection (Fig. 3A) in both NBS and Nbs1-complemented cells. Neither WRN siRNA nor Nbs1 complementation affected the control BRCA1 protein levels. Next, siRNA-transfected cells were seeded onto 96-well plates, treated with mitomycin C or irradiated with γ-irradiation, and assessed for their ability to recover by MTT viability assays. Cellular WRN levels began to increase gradually 4 days after the transient transfection (data not shown). Because of the transient nature of the WRN silencing, we were compelled to use a short-term assay like MTT for assessment of cellular resistance. Although a colony formation analysis would have been preferable, the observed effects tend to be underscored in the MTT assay as compared with the long-term (weeks) assays of colony formation. In parallel experiments we have observed that the MTT assay and the colony formation assay give similar results in WRN-depleted human cell lines. 2G. Beck and V. A. Bohr, unpublished observations. Here, we showed that cells deficient in WRN or Nbs1 exhibited hypersensitivity (p < 0.05) to mitomycin C to a similar extent when compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). Cells deficient in both WRN and Nbs1 exhibited a similar sensitivity to mitomycin C when compared with cells deficient in either protein alone. These results suggest that WRN and Nbs1 facilitate cellular viability and proliferation similarly in response to mitomycin C and, thus, may participate in the same repair pathway.Fig. 3Convergence of the WRN and Nbs1 pathways in the cellular response to γ-irradiation and mitomycin C treatment.

We here identified a crystal protein that is non-insecticidal and non-hemolytic but has strong cytocidal activity against various human cells with a markedly divergent target specificity, e.g. highly cytotoxic to HepG2 and Jurkat and less cytotoxic to the normal hepatocyte (HC) and HeLa. In slices of liver and colon cancer tissues, the toxin protein preferentially killed the cancer cells, leaving other cells unaffected. The cytocidal effect of the protein is non-apoptotic with swelling and fragmentation of the susceptible cells, although the apoptotic process does occur when the cell damage proceeded slowly. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene of the protein has little sequence homology with the insecticidal crystal proteins of B. thuringiensis. These observations raise the presence of a new group of the B. thuringiensis toxin and the possibility of new applications for the protein in the medical field.

These observations raise the presence of a new group of the B. thuringiensis toxin and the possibility of new applications for the protein in the medical field. Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that forms a parasporal crystal during the stationary phase of its growth cycle. The crystal proteins studied so far are toxic to the larvae of certain insects of several orders, and even to nematodes, mites, and protozoa, but not pathogenic to mammals, birds, amphibians, or reptiles (1Schnepf E.

Thus, this bacterium is a valuable source of insecticidal proteins for use in conventional sprayable formulations and in transgenic crops and may even be the most promising alternative to synthetic chemical pesticides used in commercial agriculture and forest management as these proteins are beneficial and friendly to the environment relative to chemical pesticides (1Schnepf E.

Genes of the crystal proteins of B. thuringiensis appear to reside on plasmids, often as parts of composite structures that include a variety of transportable elements (2de Maagd R.A. Bravo A.

Genetica (Dordrecht). 1994; 93: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This high degree of genetic plasticity results in the remarkable diversity of B. thuringiensis strains and crystal proteins, and a growing number of the strains and toxin proteins are being isolated and cloned (1Schnepf E.

Earlier studies have shown that non-insecticidal B. thuringiensis strains are ubiquitous in natural environments and are even more widely distributed than insecticidal strains (5Ohba M. Aizawa K.J.

Microbiol. 1992; 58: 1344-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the non-insecticidal B. thuringiensis isolates, we found isolates with a novel property, non-hemolytic but highly cytotoxic to a wide range of mammalian cells, including human cancer cells (7Mizuki E.

The cytotoxic proteins were heterogeneous in cytotoxicity spectra, and some were active on a wide range of human cells, whereas the others killed a few specific cells. These proteins are not allied to the class of Cyt proteins, which also exhibit cytotoxicity against mammalian cells but do have hemolytic and insecticidal activities (1Schnepf E. Crickmore N.

The B. thuringiensis A1547 (designated previously as strain 94-F-45-14), belonging to serovar dakota, is one of the strains with parasporal crystal proteins that are non-hemolytic but are cytocidal against human leukemic T cells, MOLT-4 (7Mizuki E.

In the present study, we obtained the gene for the purified toxin protein, examined the cytotoxic activity of the expressed recombinant toxin protein against the cultured human cells and the cancer tissues, and found that the toxin protein has strong cytocidal activity against various human cells with markedly divergent target specificity and preferentially kills the liver and colon cancer cells, leaving the normal cells in the tumor tissue slice unaffected. Bacterial Strains and Culture Media—The organisms used in this study was the soil isolate B. thuringiensis A1547, belonging to serovar dakota (7Mizuki E. Ohba M. Akao T. Yamashita S. Saitoh H. Park Y.S. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Mizuki E. Park Y.S. Saitoh H. Yamashita S. Akao T. Higuchi K. Ohba M. Clin. Diagn. Lab.

The bacteria were grown on nutrient medium, containing 0.1% meat extract, 0.1% polypeptone, and 0.2% NaCl, pH 7.6, at 27 °C for 8 days. Human Cells and Culture of the Cells—Human cells used, MOLT-4, Jurkat, HL60, Sawano, HepG2, HeLa, TCS, HC, A549, MRC-5, and Caco-2 cells, were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). All cells were maintained under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Normal T-cells were prepared from buffy coats obtained from the Fukuoka Red Cross Blood Center (Fukuoka, Japan) and were separated from lymphocytes and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 30 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. Isolation of Toxin Protein from Parasporal Crystals—Sporulated cells of B. thuringiensis strain A1547 were harvested and washed three times and disrupted in distilled water. After purification of the parasporal crystals using a biphasic separation technique (12Goodman N.S. Gottfried R.J. Rogoff M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 94: 485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the crystals were solubilized with 50 mm Na2CO3 (pH 10.0) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA and were treated with proteinase K (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to stop the proteolysis. The protease-treated proteins were applied to DE-52 ion-exchange column, and the toxin protein was eluted with 50 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The active fraction was then subjected to gel filtration with Sephacryl S-300. Assay of Cytocidal Activity—The cytocidal activity was measured by the 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-dipheny-2H tetrazolium bromide (MTT) 1The abbreviations used are: MTT, 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-dipheny-2H tetrazolium bromide; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone. method (13Behl C.

Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 3177-3178PubMed Google Scholar), using a non-radioactive cell proliferation assay system (Promega). Briefly, each well of a microtest plate contained 90 μl of cell suspension containing 2 × 104 cells. After preincubation for 16 h at 37 °C, 10 μl of the proteinase K-activated sample was added to the well, and the cell proliferation was measured 24 h after the administration. Determination of N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence—The purified protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the N-terminal sequence was determined using an automatic sequencer Model 473A (Applied Biosystems). Cloning of the Toxin Protein—The library for plasmid DNA of the bacteria was prepared from a mixture of size-selected (2-8-kb) fragments of the plasmid integrated into Lambda ZAP II vector. Selection of positive plaques was done using a Gene Images CDP-star detection module (Amersham Biosciences). The degenerate primer, designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 30-kDa toxin protein, was labeled using Gene Images 3′-oligolabeling module then used for selection of positive plaques. DNA sequencing of the positive clone was done with the Thermo sequenase per mixed cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an automated SQ-5500 DNA sequencer (Hitachi). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Toxin Proteins—Plasmids, pET-37k and pET-30k, were constructed from pET-23a. pET-37k contains a gene of the full-length toxin protein, and pET-30k contains a gene for the proteinase K-activated protein with the initiation methionine codon at the 5′-terminus. A hexahistidine tag was introduced into the C termini of both proteins. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with each plasmid were cultured in LB medium containing 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h at 25 °C. After harvesting the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g, the cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgSO4, 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol, and then lysed by sonication followed by solubilization with 50 mm Na2CO3 (pH 10.0) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA. The soluble extract was recovered by centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The extract was loaded on a nickel-chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences; His-trap) and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Culture of Human Liver Tissue Slice—The cancer tissue was isolated immediately after surgical resected. The cancer tissue was cut into about 3-mm-diameter pieces. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the fragments were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and an antibiotic mixture containing 100 ng/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 5 mg/ml fungizone, at 37 °C. The toxin protein was added to the culture medium (final concentration, 0.3 μg/ml), and the tissue fragments were further incubated for 8 h. The tissues were then fixed with 20% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. After being stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the tissue was observed under a light microscope. Assay of Caspase Activity—Cells were incubated with the toxin protein (0.1 or 10 μg/ml), staurosporine (10 μg/ml), Triton X-100 (0.1%) at 37 °C for the indicated times. After lysis of the cells, the fluorogenic peptide substrate, z-DEVD-rhodamine 110, was added and incubated at the room temperature. The caspase activation (fold) was determined on the basis of the relative intensity of fluorescence to the mock-incubated cells. For inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated with or without caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm), at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with the toxin protein (0.1 or 10 μg/ml), staurosporine (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 h. A half-portion of each sample was subjected to the caspase assay, and for another half, the cell proliferation was measured as described above. Cloning of a Cytocidal Protein of B. thuringiensis A1547 and Its Expression in E. coli—After treatment of the parasporal inclusions of B. thuringiensis A1547 strain with proteinase K, the toxin protein was purified through two column chromatographies, measuring their cytotoxic effects on MOLT-4 cells using the MTT assay system. The cytocidal activity was associated with a protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa. Without protease digestion, the inclusion proteins, like the Cry toxins, exhibited no cytocidal activity (15Lecadet M.M. Dedonder R. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1966; 48: 631-660PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tojo A. Aizawa K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 45: 576-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the proteinase K-activated 30-kDa protein was determined to be Asp-Val-Ile-Arg-Glu-Tyr-leu-Met-Phe-Asn. The gene for the cytocidal 30-kDa protein was cloned from a phage library prepared from a plasmid DNA of the bacteria, using as the probes degenerated oligonucleotides designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene is shown in Fig. 1. The gene was 1,014 bp long and encoded a polypeptide of 338 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 37,446. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the proteinase K-activated protein appears in the deduced sequence. Proteinase K would cleave between threonine 51 and aspartic acid 52, and the molecular weight of the N-terminal truncated protein was calculated to be 31,703. The block sequences conserved in the Cry proteins (1Schnepf E. Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 775-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mahillon J. Rezsohavy R. Hallet B. Delcour J. Genetica (Dordrecht). 1994; 93: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were not detectable in the sequence of the 37-kDa precursor protein. The protein exhibits a weak sequence homology only with Cry 15Aa (17Brown K.L. Whiteley H.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 457-549Crossref Google Scholar) among the established Cry and Cyt proteins (3Mahillon J. Rezsohavy R. Hallet B. Delcour J. Genetica (Dordrecht). 1994; 93: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recombinant toxin proteins of the full-length and N-terminal truncated proteins, tagged with a hexa-histidine at the C terminus, were expressed in Esherichia coli strain BL21 and purified on a nickel-chelating column. The full-length protein had no apparent cytocidal activity, and the proteolytic processing was essential for activation of the toxic protein. On the other hand, the N-terminal truncated protein had a molecular mass of 31 kDa, as seen by SDS-PAGE, and had substantially the same cytocidal activity against MOLT-4 cells as that of the activated 30-kDa protein from the parasporal inclusion of B. thuringiensis A1547 strain. Cytocidal Activity of the Recombinant Toxin Protein against Human Cells—Dose responses of the recombinant N-terminal-truncated toxin protein against various cultured human cells were monitored using the MTT assay and the LD50 values 24 h after the administration are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. The cytotoxity largely varied from cells to cells. Among the cells examined, the toxin protein was highly cytotoxic to MOLT-4, Jurkat, Sawano, and HepG2 cells, and the LD50 values against those cells were as low as 10-40 ng/ml. On the other hand, some cells, including HeLa, TCS, HC, A549, and MRC-5, were resistant to the toxin protein. Although we found no general rule for specificity of the cells or no common characteristics for sensitive or resistant cells, some cells derived from the tumor tissues seem more sensitive to the toxin protein than did those from the normal tissues, i.e. HepG2 versus HC cells.Table ICytocidal activity of B. thuringiensis parasporal toxin protein to various cultured human cellsCellCharacteristicsLD50μg/mlMOLT-4Leukemic T cell0.044JurkatLeukemic T cell0.015HL-60Leukemic T cell0.066T cellNormal T cell0.148HCNormal hepatocyte>10HepG2Hepatocyte cancer0.023HeLaUterus (cervix) cancer>10SawanoUterus cancer0.041TCSUterus (cervix) cancer>10UtSMCNormal uterus9.28MRC-5Normal embryonic lung fibroblast7.15A549Lung cancer>10CACO-2Colon cancer4.86 Open table in a new tab Cytotoxity to the cancer cells was shown when we applied the toxin protein to cancer tissues isolated from moderately and well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (Edmondson type II and type I, respectively). The tissue pieces were treated with various concentrations of the toxin protein for 8 h at 37 °C, fixed, stained, and observed under a light microscope (Fig. 3). In the moderately differentiated cancer tissue, which has eosinophilic and abundant cytoplasm with enlarged atypical nuclei and forms glandular structures, treatment with the toxin protein (0.3 μg/ml) caused markedly degenerative appearance of the cells, and the nuclei and cell border of cytoplasm of the cells disappeared (Fig. 3A), as compared with the untreated cancer cells (Fig. 3B). Injury to non-neoplastic liver cells (Fig. 3C) and chronic inflammatory cells, blood vessels, and bile ducts in fibrous Gleeson's sheath in non-neoplastic areas affected by chronic active hepatitis (Fig. 3D) was negligible, even after treatment with the toxin protein. Essentially the same observations were obtained with colon cancer tissues (Fig. 4). In the cancer tissue exposed to the toxin protein (Fig. 4, A and B), there are markedly degenerative and desquamative appearances of the tall columnar cancer cells, and the number of dead cells was larger than the number of cells without toxin exposure (Fig. 4C). Some cancer cells had small, pyknotic, and irregular-shaped nuclei in a higher magnification (Fig. 4B). Little morphological change was observed in endothelial cells of the blood vessels, fibroblastic cells, and infiltrating inflammatory cells in the non-cancer areas of the same tissue shown in Fig. 4A, even after treatment with the toxin protein (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the toxin protein kills preferentially liver and colon cancer cells, leaving other cells in those tissues unaffected.Fig. 4Cytotoxic effect of parasporal toxin protein on colon cancer cells. The cancer tissue was isolated from a front portion of advanced carcinoma in the serosa of the colon immediately after surgical resection.

Fig. 5A shows the time course of effects of the toxin protein on HepG2 cells, one of the most sensitive cells, measured using the MTT assay. With 10 μg/ml of the toxin protein, the cells rapidly lost respiratory activity, and none of the cells were viable within 8 h. Yet with a low dose (0.1 μg/ml), the cells gradually died, and half the number died at around 15 h. This time course is similar to that of staurosporine, an apoptosis inducer, used at the concentration of 10 μg/ml. The toxin protein led the cells to large morphological changes, and consequently, they died. Fig. 5B shows changes in the morphology of HepG2 cells to the toxin protein (0.1 μg/ml). The cells ballooned and started to detach from the dish around 4 h after exposure to the toxin administration, and then burst open and fragmented to death within 20 h. Such morphological changes were more clearly observed with HL60 cells, in which the cells ballooned at around 2 h and burst within 4 h (Fig. 5C). No morphological change was observed in the resistant cells (data not shown). Morphological observations suggest that the cytotoxic effect of the toxin protein is non-apoptotic. To examine this in more detail, we studied DNA fragmentation and caspase activation. The faint ladder pattern was observed at the low dose of the toxin protein, whereas at the high dose, no ladder was apparent, even at the time most of the cells were killed (Fig. 5D). This is also the case with caspase activation. Activation of caspase 3 and 7 activities was observed with a low dose of the toxin protein, at later than 8 h after the administration, whereas at the higher dose, activation of those enzyme activities was nil (Fig. 5E). Even when the enhanced caspase activities at the low dose of the toxin protein were inhibited by the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, to 10% of the cells without the inhibitor, the survival ratio of the cells was unaffected, whereas in the cell death induced with staurosporin, suppression of the caspase activity was accompanied by a recovery leading to cell survival (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that the cytocidal effect of the parasporal toxin protein is primarily non-apoptotic, although the apoptotic process did occur when the cell damage was slowly induced, probably as side effects of the toxin. At a high concentration of the toxin protein, the cells died even before the apoptotic process had begun. We find that the toxin protein of parasporal crystal from B. thuringiensis strain A1547 has strong cytocidal activity against various human cells with markedly divergent target specificity and that this toxin preferentially kills the liver and colon cancer cells, leaving the normal cells in the tumor tissue slice unaffected. This, taken together with the mammalian cell-recognizing parasporal proteins reported previously (7Mizuki E. Ohba M. Akao T. Yamashita S. Saitoh H. Park Y.S. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Mizuki E. Park Y.S. Saitoh H. Yamashita S. Akao T. Higuchi K. Ohba M. Clin. Diagn. Lab.

Rezsohavy R. Hallet B. Delcour J. Genetica (Dordrecht). 1994; 93: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each toxin protein has its specific and distinct target spectrum against mammalian cells, and some proteins are strictly specific to certain human cancer cells, as the toxin protein reported in this report. This raises the possibility that we could screen the strains (and toxin proteins) cytocidal to the specific cancer cell and use those proteins in the medical and biological fields. Strict specificity on target cells suggests the presence of receptor-like protein and/or lipid at the surface of the sensitive cells, as in the case of the insecticidal Cry toxins. Non-apoptotic cytocidal action with swelling and fragmentation of the susceptible cells suggest that the protein changes ion permeability of the cells, also as the Cry toxins (1Schnepf E.

Membrane phospholipids influence the activity of several types of ion channels, including GIRK, IRK, KATP, ROMK, and KCNQ K+ channels, as well as CNG and TRP non-selective cation channels (reviewed in Ref. 1Hilgemann D.

Most phospholipid-modulated channels, including ENaC, respond directly to PtdIns(4,5)P2 with this phospholipid countering channel run-down and thus, being permissive for normal channel function. Defects in channel-phosphoinositide interactions, importantly, have been shown to lead to disease (4Lopes C. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Logothetis D. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). ENaC is a non-inactivating, voltage-independent, highly Na+-selective ion channel localized to the apical plasma membrane of electrically tight epithelial cells, such as that lining the distal renal nephron and colon, alveolar sacs, salivary glands, and sweat ducts (5Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 6Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). ENaC, together with neuronal Degenerin channels, comprise the ENaC/Deg superfamily of ion channels. ENaC activity is rate-limiting for vectorial Na+ reabsorption across transporting epithelia; consequently, its activity is a critical determinant of fluid movement and epithelia surface hydration (reviewed in Refs. 7Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar and 8Stockand J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F559-F576Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The significance of ENaC to human health is highlighted by inherited diseases caused by: 1) gain-of-function mutations in this channel (e.g. Liddle's syndrome) and its upstream regulatory pathways, manifested by inappropriate Na+ conservation and eventual hypertension and 2) loss-of-function mutations in the channel and its regulatory pathways (e.g. pseudohyperaldosteronism), manifested by hypotension and electrolyte disorders (9Hansson J.H.

Phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the D-3 position producing PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (16Fruman D. Meyers R. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 507Crossref Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). PI3K signaling via production of these phospholipids and subsequent activation of a downstream kinase cascade is critical for many cellular processes, including proliferation, growth, and protein synthesis. PI3K signaling, also, plays an important role in insulin, IGF-I, and aldosterone stimulated Na+ reabsorption and aldosterone increases PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in epithelial cells (17Blazer-Yost B.L.

Application of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was recently demonstrated to slow run-down of ENaC in excised patches made from renal A6 epithelial cells and to increase activity of ENaC heterologously expresses in Xenopus laevis oocytes independent of effects on channel expression levels in the plasma membrane (3Ma H.P. Saxena S. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7641-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, PI3K signaling regulates several types of ion channels, often through a trophic response involving modulation of vesicular movement and/or channel synthesis (24Ishii M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4325-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Lhuillier L. Dryer S. J.

The phospholipid products of PI3K, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are not themselves widely considered to be direct modulators of ion channel activity. We test here whether the phospholipid products of PI3K directly influence the activity of a membrane resident target ion channel, ENaC. In addition, we ask if IGF-I, a physiological activator of PI3K signaling known to increase Na+ reabsorption (19Blazer-Yost B.L. Esterman M.A. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1645-C1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Record R.D. Froelich L.L. Vlahos C.J. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E611-E617PubMed Google Scholar), activates ENaC through PI3K and its products, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We demonstrate that ENaC is directly activated by PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and that these phospholipids activate ENaC by increasing open probability. This direct effect of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on ENaC agrees well with the previous findings of others investigating phospholipid regulation of ENaC (2Yue G. Malik B. Yue G. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 277: 11965-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Ma H.P. Saxena S. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7641-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and represents a novel transduction mechanism for PI3K. This mechanism enables growth factors, such as IGF-I, to rapidly modulate final effectors independent of slower trophic responses elicited by downstream signaling pathways. Electrophysiology—The plasmids encoding human ENaC, a kind gift from P. M. Snyder, have been described previously (29McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-tagged ENaC constructs have been described previously (28Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in culture in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 μm amiloride. Electrophysiological measurements were made 24-72 h after transfection. Transfected cells were identified by fluorescence from co-transfected GFP. For excised inside-out patches, extracellular pipette and internal bath solutions were (in millimolar): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) and 140 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 ATP, 0.1 GTP, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), respectively. For whole cell experiments testing IGF-I, the bath and pipette contained (in millimolar): 105 sodium methanesulfonate, 20 Cs-methanesulfonate, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) plus 10 μm erbstatin analog and 160 Cs-methanesulfonate, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 2 ATP, 0.1 GTP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), respectively. Voltage clamp experiments were performed with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier interfaced with a PC running PULSE (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) or an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) interfaced with a PC running pClamp 8.1 (Axon Instruments). In some instances, a family of test pulses, stepping from a holding potential of 30 mV to -100 mV to 60 mV by increments of 20 mV, was used. For whole cell experiments, data were digitized at 2 or 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. For excised patch recordings, data were digitized at 500 Hz and filtered at 100 Hz. In some instances, data were subsequently software filtered at 20 Hz for display. In excised patches, channel activity was expressed as NPo = I/i, where I is mean current in a patch and i is unitary current as determined by all-point histograms. Water-soluble, short-chain, dioctanoyl phospholipids were from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Aqueous phospholipid stocks were prepared at 1 mm by sonication for 30 min and stored at -70 °C. For outside-out experiments, stock phospholipids were mixed just prior to use with an equal volume of a carrier solution containing histone H1 (0.2 mm, Echelon Biosciences Inc.) and sonicated again for 10 min. Phospholipids were sonicated and applied to the bath of inside-out patches in the absence of carrier. Renal A6 epithelial cells were cultured in complete media supplemented with aldosterone as described previously (23Tong Q. Booth R.E. Worrell R.T. Stockand J.D. Am. J.

Imaging Experiments—We used evanescent field fluorescence microscopy to selectively illuminate the plasma membrane to quantify the membrane levels of specific phospholipids. Fusion proteins of EGFP and the pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain of phospholipid-binding proteins (e.g. Akt and PLCδ) were used as specific phospholipid reporters. Cells used for real-time evanescent field fluorescence microscopy were transfected with plasmids encoding either a membrane-localized variant of EGFP (EGFP-F, Clontech) plus DsRed2 (Clontech), or fusion proteins consisting of EGFP fused with either the PH domain of Akt/PKB, which senses PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, or of PLCδ, which senses PtdIns(4,5)P2, in the absence and presence of constitutively active PI3K and the M1R muscarinic receptor. The M1R muscarinic receptor was used to introduce a mechanism for decreasing PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels via activation of endogenous PLC. The cDNAs encoding PH fusion proteins were a kind gift from T. Meyer and have been described previously (32Haugh J. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Methods used in the current study followed closely those described previously by W. Almers and colleagues (33Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 34Taraska J.W. Perrais D. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nagamatsu S. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In brief, evanescent field illumination was generated with through-the-lens total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). Samples were viewed through a Plan Apo TIRF 60× oil-immersion, high resolution (1.45 numerical aperture) objective on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) inverted microscope. DsRed2 and EGFP were excited with green helium/neon and argon lasers, respectively, with appropriate dichroic mirrors and emission filters. This system was also interfaced with a mercury lamp with appropriate excitation and emission filter sets enabling wide-field epifluorescence imaging of DsRed2 and eGFP-F. Images were collected and processed with a Cascade Photometric charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) interfaced with a PC running MetaMorph software. CHO cells used for real-time indirect epifluorescence microscopy were transfected with the Akt/PKB PH domain-EGFP fusion protein plus constitutively active PI3K and imaged using a 60× (1.3 numerical aperture) oil-immersion lens on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 inverted microscope fitted with a Cascade Photometric charge-coupled device camera. EGFP was visualized with a single pass emission filter in conjunction with a single pass excitation filter. Biochemistry—All Western blot analysis and membrane labeling experiments followed established protocols (28Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells overexpressing Myc-tagged ENaC subunits were extracted with detergent with proteins in whole cell lysates separated by SDS-PAGE. For labeling experiments, membrane ENaC was labeled with 1 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C and separated from whole cell lysate with streptavidin-agarose. All lanes within a gel were loaded with equal amounts of total protein. Nitrocellulose blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Statistics—All data are mean ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant with population data, and paired data were analyzed with appropriate t tests. IGF-I and PI3K Increase ENaC Activity—ENaC is a heteromeric channel composed of three distinct but related subunits (α, β, and γ) that is blocked by the diuretic amiloride (5Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 6Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). We reconstituted human ENaC in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to examine its regulation by PI3K and phospholipids produced by this lipid kinase. Co-transfection of cDNA encoding each of the three human ENaC subunits into CHO cells resulted in large, amiloride-sensitive, inward Na+ currents measured in whole cell clamp that were absent in untransfected cells (Fig. 1, a and b). Inward Na+ currents were sensitive to amiloride in a reversible and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1d, IC50 ∼ 200 nm) consistent with that reported previously (5Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 35Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen.

Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). We quantified ENaC activity as the amplitude of such amiloride-sensitive, inward Na+ currents. Co-expression of constitutively active PI3K together with ENaC increased amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ currents at -80 mV from 1.3 ± 0.15 (n = 16) to 4.2 ± 0.46 nA (n = 29; Fig. 1, a-c). CHO cells in the absence and presence of PI3K had little leak current with none of it sensitive to amiloride and co-expression of PI3K had no effect on cell capacitance (not shown). Whole cell I-V relations for ENaC both in the absence and presence of constitutively active PI3K showed marked Goldman rectification and a reversal potential greater than 40 mV as expected for a highly Na+-selective channel (Fig. 1b). Reconstituted ENaC, in addition, had the hallmark of greater Li+ compared with Na+ conductance and no K+ conductance (not shown). Two structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, decreased ENaC activity in cells co-expressing constitutively active PI3K (Fig. 2, a-d). These compounds also decreased ENaC activity in cells not expressing exogenous PI3K, indicating basal activity of endogenous PI3K that acts on ENaC (not shown). The amiloride-sensitive, inward Na+ currents at -80 mV in cells expressing constitutively active PI3K after sustained treatment (3-6 h) with wortmannin (0.2 μm) and LY294002 (50 μm) of 0.74 ± 0.17 (n = 4) and 0.72 ± 0.20 nA (n = 9), respectively, were significantly less than that observed in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 2e). In contrast to LY294002, its inactive analog LY303511 (iLY, 50 μm) had no effect on ENaC currents (4.0 ± 1.0 nA; n = 5; Fig. 2c). Vehicle (Me2SO) also had no effect on ENaC activity, and none of these reagents affected cellular capacitance (not shown). LY294002 is a reversible inhibitor of PI3K that competes for the ATP-binding site of this enzyme (37Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

Thus, LY294002 was readily reversible with ENaC activity rapidly and significantly recovering to 2.5 ± 0.60 nA (n = 9) within 2 min following washout of inhibitor (Fig. 1, a and b). In contrast, ENaC activity failed to recover following removal of wortmannin (0.75 ± 0.17; n = 4; Fig. 1d), which is an irreversible inhibitor of the kinase (16Fruman D. Meyers R. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 507Crossref Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The rapid rate of recovery of ENaC activity following removal of LY294002 is consistent with PI3K activity, in our experimental model, overwhelming opposing lipid phosphatase activity. Under these conditions, as expected, acute (5 min) application of LY294002 (5.7 ± 1.1 before and 5.6 ± 1.2 nA after; n = 9) and wortmannin (3.2 ± 1.4 before and 3.3 ± 1.3 nA after; n = 3) had little effect on ENaC with their inhibitory actions presumably manifesting only after lipid phosphatases significantly reduced PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in the continued presence of inhibited kinase (see also Fig. 5d below). An alternative that cannot be excluded with the current data set is that the channel has a high affinity for phospholipids as Yue and colleagues (2Yue G. Malik B. Yue G. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 277: 11965-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have suggested that ENaC does for PtdIns(4,5)P2 leading to a slow loss of activity upon blockade of PI3K. Nonetheless, the current results demonstrate that PI3K inhibitors do not directly block ENaC but affect the channel by modulating PI3K and that prolonged increases in PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in response to overexpression of constitutively active PI3K provide the cellular mechanism for sustained activation of the channel.Fig. 5ENaC is activated by PI3K.a, current recording of ENaC in an excised outside-out patch from a cell expressing both the channel and active PI3K pretreated with wortmannin for 4 h before and after washout of inhibitor and subsequent application of amiloride (10 μm).

Indeed, bath application of IGF-I (100 ng/ml; 5 min) increased ENaC activity from 2.2 ± 0.50 to 3.7 ± 0.80 nA (n = 8; Fig. 3, a and c). Consistent with this action being through PI3K, enhanced current in response to IGF-I was sensitive to PI3K blockade by wortmannin with inward Na+ currents in wortmannin-treated cells being 1.2 ± 0.68 and 1.1 ± 0.62 nA, respectively, before and after IGF-I for 5 min in the continued presence of wortmannin (n = 3; Fig. 3, b and c). Similar to its effects on ENaC reconstituted in CHO cells, IGF-I increased Na+ reabsorption across A6 epithelial cells. The summary graph in Fig. 3d shows the relative open circuit current across A6 monolayers before and 1 h after treatment with IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) in the absence and presence of wortmannin (200 nm). Sodium reabsorption across these native epithelia significantly increased 2-fold in response to IGF-I in a PI3K-sensitive manner (n = 12). Co-expression of constitutively active PI3K (Fig. 2f) and treatment with IGF-I for 30 min (Fig. 3e) did not affect ENaC expression levels. Moreover, constitutively active PI3K and LY294002 had no effect on the levels of ENaC in the plasma membrane (not shown). Thus, the results in Figs. 1, 2, 3 suggest that active PI3K enhances ENaC activity in a manner unrelated to any slower trophic effects and that IGF-I receptors can regulate ENaC activity via PI3K activation. PI3K Activity Affects ENaC Open Probability—To determine whether signaling from PI3K to ENaC is membrane delimited or localized closely to the plasma membrane, we investigated the actions of PI3K on ENaC in excised, outside-out patches. Prolonged treatment (3-6 h) of cells co-overexpressing ENaC and constitutively active PI3K with wortmannin (Fig. 5a) and LY294002 (Fig. 4a) but not its inactive analog LY303511 (Fig. 5b) significantly decreased ENaC activity (NPo) compared with control (untreated cells expressing ENaC plus PI3K; summarized in Fig. 5c). The respective activities were 7.6 ± 1.8 (n = 10) for control, 0.86 ± 0.24 (n = 10) for wortmannin, 0.44 ± 0.14 (n = 7) for LY294002, and 5.3 ± 1.6 (n = 6) for LY303511. Similar to whole cell experiments, LY294002 (Fig. 4a), but not wortmannin (Fig. 5a), was readily reversible with channel activity quickly recovering to 3.90 ± 1.10 (n = 7) upon washout of LY294002. Vehicle (Me2SO) had no effect on ENaC in outside-out patches and neither PI3K inhibitor acutely (5 min) affected activity (see Fig. 5d; NPo = 4.1 ± 0.6 before and 3.9 ± 0.91 after; n = 5, wortmannin and LY294002 results combined), again demonstrating that these reagents do not directly block this channel but decrease channel activity via modulation of PI3K. The time course of recovery of ENaC activity upon removal of LY294002 in excised patches was similar to that observed for channel recovery upon washout of inhibitor in whole cell experiments and paralleled increases in membrane PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (compare Figs. 2a and 4a; see also Fig. 7 below). Moreover, removal of LY294002 qualitatively increased channel open probability. ENaC in an untreated control cell is shown for comparison (in Fig. 4b). Together, these results strongly argue that PI3K and its phospholipid products are in relatively close proximity to the channel and are capable of enhancing channel activity rapidly.Fig. 7Changes in ENaC activity parallel changes in plasma membrane levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Summary graph comparing the time course of ENaC activation, in both excised (open circles) and whole cell patches (black circles and black squares), and relative membrane PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels (gray circles and gray squares) upon washout of LY294002 (circles) and addition of IGF-I (squares).

Other data were normalized to final levels and are shown as relative activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ENaC Activity Reflects Membrane PtdIns(3,4)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3Levels—Having established that IGF-I and activation of PI3K strongly enhance ENaC activity, we next investigated their mechanism of action.

https://openalex.org/W2035460899,"Each cone photoreceptor in the retina responds to light in a limited range of wavelengths, giving it a spectral phenotype. This phenotype is determined by the most prevalent of the photoreceptor's visual-pigment proteins (opsins) and is assumed to remain unchanged during an animal's lifetime. Here we show that in the Pacific pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, single cones can switch their spectral phenotype from ultraviolet to blue by regulating the production of the appropriate opsins as the fish grow older. This photoreceptor plasticity may operate to modulate colour vision as the salmon's lifestyle changes."

However, the mechanisms are unclear. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the potential involvement of the serine threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) signaling pathway in the mechanisms of β-synuclein neuroprotection. For this purpose, Akt activity and cell survival were analyzed in synuclein-transfected B103 neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons. β-Synuclein transfection resulted in increased Akt activity and conferred protection from the neurotoxic effects of rotenone. Down-regulation of Akt expression resulted in an increased susceptibility to rotenone toxicity, whereas transfection with a lentiviral vector encoding for β-synuclein was protective. The effects of β-synuclein on the Akt pathway appear to be by direct interaction between these molecules and were independent of upstream signaling molecules. Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanisms of β-synuclein neuroprotection might involve direct interactions between β-synuclein and Akt and suggest that this signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic target for neurological conditions associated with parkinsonism and α-synuclein aggregation.

In addition to α-synuclein, the synuclein family of peptides includes two related proteins, β- and γ-synuclein (16Jakes R. Spillantini M. Goedert M.

Although these molecules are highly homologous, β-synuclein lacks the middle region of α-synuclein, previously identified in the Alzheimer's disease brain as the non-amyloid β-component (22Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Otero D. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The precise physiological role of α- and β-synuclein in synaptic plasticity is not completely understood. However, recent studies have demonstrated that although α-synuclein is aggregated under oxidative stress conditions, β-synuclein does not aggregate to form amyloid fibrils, and it is capable of blocking α-synuclein aggregation and potentially protecting cells from the neurotoxic effects of α-synuclein oligomers (23Hashimoto M.

The mechanisms by which α-synuclein accumulation might lead to neurodegeneration are currently under investigation. Among them, one possibility is that alterations in signaling pathways might play a pivotal role in α-synuclein-related neurodegeneration. Supporting this possibility, previous studies have shown that overexpression of α-synuclein in cell culture models resulted in suppression of signaling molecules such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (25Iwata A. Maruyama M. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45320-45329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Hashimoto M. Takenouchi T. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and that α-synuclein might regulate Bcl-2 expression via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signaling (27Seo J.H. Rah J.C. Choi S.H. Shin J.K. Min K. Kim H.S. Park C.H. Kim S. Kim E.M. Lee S.H. Lee S. Suh S.W. Suh Y.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1826-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that ERK plays a central role in various neuronal functions, such as neuronal growth, synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, and long term potentiation (28Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 29Opazo P. Watabe A.M. Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3679-3688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dysregulation of ERK activity might be especially important. Because α-synuclein might interfere with signaling pathways such as ERK and PI3-K/Akt, which may underlie some aspects of neurodegeneration (26Hashimoto M. Takenouchi T. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), β-synuclein might be protective by regulating these same neuronal signaling pathways. Recently, a number of substrates for Akt have been identified, including Bad, caspase-9, NF-κB signaling, and the transcription factor Forkhead (30Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar), suggesting that this kinase promotes neuroprotection by blocking apoptosis, promoting cell proliferation, and initiation of a number of metabolic responses (31Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). In this context, the main objective of the present study was to investigate the involvement of the Akt signaling pathway in the mechanisms of β-synuclein neuroprotection. Unless otherwise noted, all of the chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Tissue Culture—B103 cells were stably transfected with either human α-synuclein, β-synuclein, or empty vector (pCEP4; Invitrogen) (32Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This cell line was selected because in previous experiments we have shown that at comparable levels of expression, α-synuclein interferes with neuronal plasticity, whereas β-synuclein is protective (32Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in the presence of 50 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Additional experiments were performed in primary neuronal cultures (ScienCell, San Diego, CA). Evaluation of Cell Viability and Cytotoxicity—To investigate the mechanisms of neuroprotection mediated by β-synuclein, transfected neuronal cells were treated with the neurotoxic drug rotenone. This inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex I was selected because the mitochondrial deficits triggered by this compound are similar to those observed in patients with PD (34Hoglinger G.U. Carrard G. Michel P.P. Medja F. Lombes A. Ruberg M. Friguet B. Hirsch E.C. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, this drug promotes selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and also causes intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein, both characteristic features of PD (13Betarbet R. Sherer T.B.

Briefly, 2.5 × 103 cells/well were plated in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in 96-well microtiter plates. The next day the cells were treated with neurotoxins according to the experimental design. The cells were then incubated with 10 μl of MTT solution (2.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h followed by the addition of 100 μl of solubilization solution (50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS, pH 4.8). As a negative control, parallel evaluation was performed on cells in the same conditioned medium but not incubated in MTT. The next day absorption values were read at 570 nm, which were corrected by subtraction of the value obtained for the negative control. The experiments were done in quadruplicate and statistically analyzed by Student's t test. Trypan blue exclusion assays were performed as previously described (23Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Rockenstein E.

Briefly, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 3% skim milk or bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, the membranes were subjected to either enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) or 125I-protein A (Amersham Biosciences) followed by quantification with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (37Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E.

The lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Two hundred micrograms of the supernatant was preabsorbed with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and the precleared lysates were incubated with Akt monoclonal antibody 5G3 or mouse IgG (or rabbit IgG) (each 1 μg) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose. The immune complexes were then washed three times with the lysis buffer. The samples were then heated in the SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Kinase activity assays were performed as previously described with some modifications (35Hashimoto M. Sagara Y. Everall I.P. Mallory M. Everson A. Langford D. Masliah E. J. Biol.

Briefly, for the Akt and PDK-1 assays, the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer. The precleared lysates (200 μg) were incubated with either anti-Akt monoclonal antibody (5G3, 1:200) or anti-PDK-1 polyclonal antibody (H-328, 1:200) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4,10mm glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA). Finally, the immune complexes were incubated in 30 μl of the kinase buffer containing either 1.0 μg of GSK-rapamycin fusion protein (Cell Signaling) as a substrate for Akt activity assays or recombinant serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as a substrate for PDK-1 activity assays, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) analysis followed by autoradiography. Quantification was performed with the PhosphorImager using the Image Quant software (Amersham Biosciences). For the GSK-3β assay, the precleared lysates (200 μg) were incubated with anti-GSK-3β monoclonal antibody (1:200), followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose. After washing, the immune complexes were incubated in 30 μl of the kinase buffer containing either 2.5 μg of phosphoglycogen synthase-2 peptides (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 500 mm EDTA and 5 mm ATP. The samples were then spotted onto Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose filter paper. The filters were washed with 180 mm phosphoric acid, dried with acetone, and analyzed by scintillation counting. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Studies—siRNA for Akt (siRNA SMART pool™ Akt1) was obtained from DHARMACON (Lafayette, CO). siRNA for β-synuclein was prepared by PROLIGO (Boulder, CO). The siRNA sequence targeting human β-synuclein corresponded to the coding region 139-157 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon (16Jakes R. Spillantini M. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the oligonucleotides used were 5′-GGUGUGGUACAAGGUGUGGTT-3′ and 5′-CCACACCUUGUACCACACCTT-3′, respectively. These synthetic 21-nucleotide oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized, deprotected, and gel-purified. Equal amounts of the sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed to form duplex siRNA. For control siRNA, the sequence of the same region of β-synuclein was randomized, and the sense and antisense strands were 5′-GUGAGUGUGAUGGCGAGUGTT-3′ and 5′-CACUCGCCAUCACACUCACTT-3′, respectively. The randomized siRNA duplex was used as a negative control for both β-synuclein and Akt experiments. Transfection of the siRNA duplex (final concentration, 100 nm) was carried out using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 48 h, and the cells were subjected to further analyses. Lentivirus-mediated Transfection—Lentivirus-mediated transfection was performed as previously described. 2M. Hashimoto, P. Bar-on, G. Ho, T. Takenouchi, E. Rockenstein, L. Crews, and E. Masliah, submitted for publication. Briefly, cells growing in 6-well plates at 50% confluence were incubated with either lentivirus encoding β-synuclein (lenti-βsynuclein), lentivirus encoding green fluorescent protein (lenti-GFP) (both were 1:1000 dilutions of preparations of 1.5 × 107 transduction units), or vehicles alone in 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for an additional 5 days. The efficiency of transduction of lenti-GFP was confirmed to be more than 90% by confocal microscopy. The cells were either harvested in lysis buffer and used for both immunoblot analysis and immunocomplex kinase assay, or replated in 96-well plates for toxicity experiments. Immunocytochemistry and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—The cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, grown to 60% confluence, and fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with the antibody against human β-synuclein (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000) or polyclonal anti-pAkt and detected with the Tyramide Signal AmplificationTM-Direct (Red) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Then the cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (dendritic and neuronal marker, 1:50; Chemicon) or growth-associated protein 43 (growth cone marker, 1:1000) (Sigma) followed by detection with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cover-slips were air-dried overnight, mounted on slides with anti-fading media (Vector), and imaged with the laser scanning confocal microscope (MRC1024; Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—All of the values in the figures are expressed as the means ± S.E. To determine statistical significance, the values were compared by one-way analysis of variance post-hoc Fisher. The differences were considered significant if the p values were less than 0.05. β-Synuclein Overexpression in Neuronal Cells Protects against Rotenone Toxicity and Up-regulates Akt Activity—To investigate the mechanisms by which β-synuclein protects from neurotoxins, synuclein-transfected B103 neuroblastoma cells (α-synuclein-overexpressing, β-synuclein-overexpressing, and vector-transfected cells) were challenged with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, rotenone. In this model system, α-synuclein-overexpressing and vector-transfected cells were highly sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of rotenone after 24 h of exposure, and in contrast β-synuclein-overexpressing cells were resistant to the neurotoxic effects of this compound (Fig. 1A). To determine the role of Akt activation in the protective effects of β-synuclein, the cells were incubated under serum-free conditions for 6 h and analyzed by immunoblot. This study showed that pAkt immunoreactivity was up-regulated in β-synuclein-overexpressing cells when compared with both α-synuclein-overexpressing cells and vector-transfected cells both under basal conditions (Fig. 1B) and after 10 or 30 min of rotenone treatment (Fig. 1C), whereas total Akt (tAkt) immunoreactivity was comparable among all cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with the immunoblot analysis, immunocomplex kinase assay confirmed that Akt activity was significantly higher in β-synuclein-overexpressing cells compared with controls, both under basal conditions (Fig. 1D) and after rotenone treatment (not shown). To determine whether differences in Akt expression might be associated with alterations in the effects of rotenone on α- and β-synuclein expression, Western blot analysis was performed. These studies show that after rotenone treatment, levels of α- and β-synuclein were unchanged compared with base line (not shown). Down-regulation of Akt Results in Increased Susceptibility to Rotenone Toxicity in β-Synuclein-overexpressing Neuronal Cells—To further confirm the role of Akt activation in β-synuclein-mediated neuroprotection, neuronal cell lines were transfected with Akt siRNA. Under basal conditions, after 48 h this approach led to an ∼50% decrease in total Akt expression in β-synuclein and α-synuclein-overexpressing cells and in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). To determine whether cellular susceptibility to neurotoxins increases when Akt expression is down-modulated by siRNA, the cells were challenged with rotenone (200 nM) for 24 h. This study showed that Akt siRNA-transfection rendered β-synuclein-overexpressing cells sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of rotenone compared with controls (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results support the notion that the increased activity of endogenous Akt in β-synuclein-overexpressing cells might protect cells from rotenone toxicity. Transient Overexpression of β-Synuclein Results in Up-regulation of Akt Activity and Enhanced Neuroprotection in Wild Type Neuronal Cells—To corroborate by an independent method the effects of β-synuclein on Akt activation and neuroprotection, wild type B103 cells or primary neuronal cortical cultures were infected with a lentiviral vector encoding β-synuclein or GFP alone. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that 90% of the cells transfected with GFP or β-synuclein were positive (Fig. 3). Consistent with the studies performed in stably transfected cell lines, neuronal cells transduced with β-synuclein were resistant to the neurotoxic effects of rotenone when compared with the lenti-GFP-transduced cells (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that transduction with these lentiviral constructs was highly efficient and resulted in increased β-synuclein or GFP expression, respectively, in wild type B103 cells (Fig. 4B, lower panels). Both Western blot (Fig. 4B) and immunocomplex activity assays (Fig. 4C) confirmed that in cells transduced with lenti-βsynuclein there was a significant increase in pAkt levels and activity compared with cells transduced with lenti-GFP. In contrast, total Akt and actin levels were comparable among cell lines (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results corroborated that β-synuclein up-regulated Akt activity and enhanced neuroprotection.Fig. 4Effects of transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing β-synuclein on Akt and neuroprotection from rotenone. Wild type B103 cells were infected with either lenti-βsynuclein, lenti-GFP (both were 1:1000 dilution of preparations of 1.5 × 107 transduction units), or vector control for 24 h. After 5 days, the cells were either analyzed by immunoblot analysis/immunocomplex kinase assay or treated with rotenone and analyzed with the MTT assay. A, compared with vector control and lenti-GFP transduced cells, the cells infected with lenti-βsynuclein were protected from rotenone toxicity (200 nm for 24 h). B, immunoblot analysis for pAkt (Ser473), tAkt, β-synuclein, and GFP. Compared with vector control and lenti-GFP, the cells transduced with lenti-βsynuclein displayed increased pAkt (Ser473) immunoreactivity. C, Akt activity, as measured by GSK-rapamycin fusion protein, was significantly increased in lenti-βsynuclein-transduced cells, compared with lenti-GFP-transduced cells and control cells. *, significant difference compared with vector and GFP controls (p < 0.05, one-way analysis of variance post-hoc Fisher).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Down-regulation of β-Synuclein Results in Increased Susceptibility to Rotenone Toxicity and Decreased Activity of Akt in Neuronal Cells—Because up-regulation of Akt activity conferred protection against rotenone in β-synuclein-overexpressing neuronal cells, it is possible that down-regulation of β-synuclein may abrogate the neuroprotective effects of this member of the synuclein family. To test this hypothesis, β-synuclein expression in transfected cells was down-regulated utilizing an siRNA strategy. After 48 h, expression of β-synuclein decreased by more than 50% (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions, pAkt (Ser473) immunoreactivity was down-regulated compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells, whereas levels of expression of total Akt and actin were comparable among cell lines (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, immunocomplex kinase assays confirmed that Akt activity was significantly down-regulated in the β-synuclein siRNA-transfected cells compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5C).

Hsp70 can refold denatured polypeptides via a C-terminal peptide binding domain (PBD), which is regulated by nucleotide cycling in an N-terminal ATPase domain. However, unlike Hsp70, both Sse1 and mammalian Hsp110 bind unfolded peptide substrates but cannot refold them. To test the <i>in vivo</i> requirement for interdomain communication, <i>SSE1</i> alleles carrying amino acid substitutions in the ATPase domain were assayed for their ability to complement <i>sse1</i>Δ yeast. Surprisingly, all mutants predicted to abolish ATP hydrolysis (D8N, K69Q, D174N, D203N) complemented the temperature sensitivity of <i>sse1</i>Δ and lethality of <i>sse1</i>Δ<i>sse2</i>Δ cells, whereas mutations in predicted ATP binding residues (G205D, G233D) were non-functional. Complementation ability correlated well with ATP binding assessed <i>in vitro</i>. The extreme C terminus of the Hsp70 family is required for substrate targeting and heterocomplex formation with other chaperones, but mutant Sse1 proteins with a truncation of up to 44 C-terminal residues that were not included in the PBD were active. Remarkably, the two domains of Sse1, when expressed <i>in trans</i>, functionally complement the <i>sse1</i>Δ growth phenotype and interact by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, a functional PBD was required to stabilize the Sse1 ATPase domain, and stabilization also occurred <i>in trans</i>. These data represent the first structure-function analysis of this abundant but ill defined chaperone, and establish several novel aspects of Sse1/Hsp110 function relative to Hsp70."

Our recent work showing that Notch1 is selectively expressed in basal epithelial cells of the prostate and higher Notch1 expression during development suggests that Notch1-expressing cells may define progenitor cells in the prostate. To test this hypothesis, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which the Notch1-expressing cells can be ablated in a controlled manner. Specific targeting was achieved by expressing the bacterial nitroreductase, an enzyme that catalyzes its substrate into a cytotoxin capable of inducing apoptosis, under the Notch1 promoter.

We evaluated the consequences of ablation of Notch1-expressing cells in two systems, organ culture of early postnatal prostates and re-growth of prostate in castrated mice triggered by hormone replacement. Our data show that elimination of Notch1-expressing cells inhibited the branching morphogenesis, growth, and differentiation of early postnatal prostate in culture and impaired prostate re-growth triggered by hormone replacement in castrated mice. Furthermore, we found that Notch1 expression following castration and hormone replacement was concomitant with known basal cell markers p63 and cytokeratin 14 and was high in the proliferative human prostate epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W1970979984,"Secretory vesicle exocytosis is a highly regulated process involving vesicle targeting, priming, and membrane fusion. Rabs and SNAREs play a central role in executing these processes. We have shown recently that Rab27a and its effector, granuphilin, are involved in the exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules through a direct interaction with the plasma membrane syntaxin 1a in pancreatic beta cells. Here, we demonstrate that fluorescence-labeled insulin granules are peripherally accumulated in cells overexpressing granuphilin. The peripheral location of granules is well overlapped with both localizations of granuphilin and syntaxin 1a. The plasma membrane targeting of secretory granules is promoted by wild-type granuphilin but not by granuphilin mutants that are defective in binding to either Rab27a or syntaxin 1a. Granuphilin directly binds to the H3 domain of syntaxin 1a containing its SNARE motif. Moreover, introduction of the H3 domain into beta cells induces a dissociation of the native granuphilin-syntaxin complex and a marked reduction of newly docked granules. These results indicate that granuphilin plays a role in tethering insulin granules to the plasma membrane by an interaction with both Rab27a and syntaxin 1a. The complex formation of these three proteins may contribute to the specificity of the targeting process during the exocytosis of insulin granules.

The complex formation of these three proteins may contribute to the specificity of the targeting process during the exocytosis of insulin granules. Intracellular fusion of vesicles or organelles with their target membranes is a common reaction of the compartmental structure of eukaryotic cells that is mediated by dynamic molecular assemblies involving conserved protein families. Central to these reactions are Rab GTPase and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; HA, hemagglutinin; Cy3, indocarbocyanine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SgIII, secretogranin III. 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; HA, hemagglutinin; Cy3, indocarbocyanine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SgIII, secretogranin III. which are conserved from yeast to man (1Jahn R. Lang T. Südhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The membrane-anchoring SNAREs form a four-helix bundle in a ternary protein complex that is thought to drive a fusion reaction. By contrast, many Rabs act on a more upstream process in the initial physical contact between a vesicle and its target (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). This process, known as tethering or docking, may provide specificity to membrane fusion.Both yeast and mammalian systems have revealed various tethering factors. Some of them are large multisubunit complexes and others are long coiled-coil proteins (3Whyte J.R.C. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The former include the exocyst (the Sec6/8 complex), the conserved oligometric Golgi complex (the Sec34/35 complex), the transport protein particle complexes (TRAPP-I and -II), and the Class C Vps complex (the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex), and the latter are represented by p115 (yeast Uso1p) and EEA1. The monomeric tethering factor directly binds to Rab and functions as an effector protein, whereas the large complexes are associated with events upstream or downstream of the Rab function. These tethering factors are commonly expressed in almost all cells and function in constitutive processes depending on the accumulation of cargo. Compared with these pathways, the regulated secretory pathways that have developed in neuroendocrine cells have a unique property, which is first to store specific cargo and then to release it only in the presence of secretagogues. Because fusion frequencies and vesicle demands continuously change as a function of the external stimuli in regulated secretory pathways, releasable vesicles must be replenished in concert with fusion events. Therefore, the tethering process in regulated secretory pathways needs additional regulation compared with that in other pathways.As in neurons, pancreatic beta cells express many components of secretory machinery, including Rab3 and its effector RIM, the SNAREs (synaptobrevin2, synaptosomal-associated protein 25, and syntaxin 1a), and SNARE-associated proteins (Munc13-1 and Munc18-1) (4Rorsman P. Renström E. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 5Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Kitahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). They appear to function in the exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules, although the precise mechanism still is unclear. Although the central fusion players are shared in endocrine cells and neurons, proteins expressed in a specific cell need to be characterized. This is because each regulated secretory pathway, depending on the function of the specific cargo, has developed unique organelles in which the morphological appearance, release kinetics, and biogenesis are distinct. For example, synaptic vesicles in neurons are placed at the active zone opposite the synaptic cleft and undergo rapid cycles of exocytosis and endocytosis at the nerve termini. Vesicle recycling does not require input from the biosynthetic pathway because the neurotransmitter is refilled by specific transporters on the vesicle membrane. By contrast, secretory granules in endocrine cells are exocytosed with a slower onset but for a longer duration and rely on de novo synthesis of polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum and transport through the Golgi network to the plasma membrane, although they have no discrete docking sites. Even among secretory granules in endocrine cells, there are some differences in exocytotic characteristics. For instance, pancreatic beta cells contain a small number of insulin granules that are docked below the plasma membrane, whereas chromaffin cells contain a large number of morphologically docked vesicles (6Plattner H. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Eliasson L. Renström E. Ding W.-G. Proks P. Rorsman P. J. Physiol.

Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, the tethering process in regulated secretory pathways likely is diverse.From the analysis of genes preferentially expressed in pancreatic beta cells, we have identified previously a novel set of Rab and its effector, Rab27a and granuphilin, respectively, both of which are specifically localized on insulin-containing mature granules (9Wang J. Takeuchi T. Yokota H. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28542-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rab27a in beta cells enhanced depolarization-induced insulin secretion without affecting basal secretion, suggesting that granules in a pool primed for fusion are accumulated by the action of Rab27a. Granuphilin directly binds to the plasma membrane-anchored SNARE, syntaxin 1a, and Rab27a regulates this interaction (11Torii S. Zhao S. Yi Z. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our data, estimated by the universal function of Rab effectors, suggest that granuphilin has a function in tethering insulin granules with the plasma membrane at the docking stage of exocytosis. In the present study, we provide both morphological and biochemical evidence that granuphilin efficiently induces the translocation of granules to the plasma membrane. The tethering function of granuphilin requires its interaction with both Rab27a and syntaxin 1a. We propose that granuphilin regulates accurate targeting of insulin granules to the exocytotic site by a specific interaction with syntaxin 1a.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Construction—Partial cDNA fragments of mouse phogrin were amplified from the MIN6 cDNA library by PCR using primers 5′-CCATGGACTGAGCGCCAAC-3′ and 5′-TTGTATGGCTCCAGCAACTG-3′, 5′-AGCCACGGTACCTTGTACAT-3′ and 5′-GATGTAGTCGGAACTGCCAT-3′, and 5′-GAATGCACCCAAGAACCGTT-3′ and 5′-CAGGACTGATATCCTGTTGC-3′.

Briefly, MIN6/phogrin-EGFP cells (clone 41) cultured on 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with either 0.1% Triton X-100 or ice-cold methanol. The cells then were incubated with primary antibodies followed by indocarbocyanine (Cy3)conjugated, species-specific anti-IgG secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Intrinsic EGFP and antibody staining signals were observed with confocal microscopes TCS-SP2 (Leica Mikrosystems Vertrieb GmbH, Bensheim, Germany), LSM5 PASCAL (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad) or with an epifluorescence microscope (BX-50; Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a SenSys™ charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ).A peripheral pattern of EGFP signals was quantified under a fluorescent microscope as follows. MIN6/phogrin-EGFP cells were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of an expression plasmid encoding HA-granuphilin. The cells were incubated under a low glucose condition (2 mm) for 24 h. The cells then were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-HA rat monoclonal antibodies followed by Cy3-labeled anti-rat IgG. Cells that revealed a linear distribution along a part of the plasma membrane were judged as positive, whereas those that showed only a punctate granular pattern were judged as negative. Cells that showed ambiguous patterns, which constituted ∼10% of the cells, were excluded from the counting. Although only Cy3-positive, HA-granuphilin expressing cells were judged in the assay, ∼20% of untransfected cells normally show the peripheral pattern of EGFP signals. For each experiment, a total of 100 cells were unambiguously assessed.Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Binding Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (11Torii S. Zhao S. Yi Z. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vitro translation of HA-tagged proteins was performed using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins (1 μg) immobilized on 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with equal amounts of in vitro translated proteins (6-10 μl) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times, and the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were suspended in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin per ml. The cells were homogenized for 40 strokes by the tight fitting Dounce homogenizer and the cell condition was monitored under a microscope. The total homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min to precipitate the nuclear and intact plasma membranes. The resultant supernatant then was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to separate the heavy organelle fraction including the secretory granules from the cytoplasmic materials. Fractionates were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors described above), and equal proportions of each lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis.Transduction of MIN6 Cells with TAT Fusion Proteins—Isolation of TAT-GFP and TAT-H3 was performed as described previously (14Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Nishiwaki C. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50805-50811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were transduced for 50 min with 70 μg/ml of TAT fusion proteins, and the cell extracts were prepared as described for the immunoprecipitation experiments.RESULTSGranuphilin Promotes Insulin Granule Targeting to the Plasma Membrane—We demonstrated recently that Rab27a and its effector granuphilin are peripherally localized on the membrane of mature dense core granules in pancreatic beta cells and regulate insulin secretion through interaction with the plasma membrane t-SNARE, syntaxin 1a (10Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Torii S. Zhao S. Yi Z. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These biochemical studies suggest that granuphilin plays a role in tethering two membranes, secretory granules and the plasma membrane, at the event of exocytosis. To explore this possibility, we morphologically assessed the function of granuphilin by tracing EGFP-labeled granules. A MIN6 cell line first was established that expresses phogrin-EGFP fusion protein, which was shown previously to be properly targeted to insulin granules in pancreatic beta cells (12Pouli A.E. Emmanouilidou E. Zhao C. Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Katsuta H. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Immunostaining analysis confirmed that phogrin-EGFP is almost entirely colocalized with insulin on secretory granules but not on the perinuclear Golgi region (Fig. 1). Using these cells, the motion of insulin granules can be followed by tracking the EGFP fluorescence. When HA-tagged granuphilin-a was transiently overexpressed, EGFP signals clearly were redistributed at the peripheral region exactly where granuphilin was colocalized (Fig. 2A, arrows). In contrast, neighboring untransfected cells showed only punctate EGFP signals mainly distributed around the Golgi/endosomal region (Fig. 2A, asterisks), although some of these normally display a peripheral pattern in this assay condition. These observations suggest that overexpression of granuphilin induces translocation of insulin granules toward the plasma membrane.Fig. 2Overexpression of granuphilin promotes the targeting of insulin granules to the plasma membrane.A, MIN6/phogrin-EGFP cells were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of an expression plasmid encoding HA-tagged granuphilin-a. The cells were incubated under a low glucose condition (2 mm) for 24 h. Then they were fixed and immunostained with anti-HA and Cy3-labeled anti-rat IgG antibodies. Intrinsic EGFP fluorescence (a, a′), Cy3 fluorescence (b, b′), and merged fluorescence (c, c′) are shown. Plasma membrane accumulation of EGFP signals was observed at the region marked by arrows in cells expressing HA-granuphilin-a. In contrast, neighboring untransfected cells revealed only a punctate granular pattern of phogrin-EGFP-fluorescence (asterisks). B, MIN6/phogrin-EGFP cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus bearing β-galactosidase (a), granuphilin-a (b), or granuphilin-b (c) cDNA. The cells were cultured under a high glucose condition (25 mm) and fixed after 12 h. The EGFP fluorescence was observed. Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next we used a recombinant adenovirus to express granuphilin more efficiently in MIN6/phogrin-EGFP cells. In our study, almost all cells were infected and expressed exogenous protein (11Torii S. Zhao S. Yi Z. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells infected with the adenovirus that expressed granuphilin-a and -b uniformly exhibited a prominent peripheral redistribution of labeled granules compared with those expressing control β-galactosidase protein (Fig. 2B). Granuphilin-b was more effective for the targeting of granules to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, electron microscopic analysis revealed an accumulation of dense core granules near the cell-cell contact region in granuphilin-overexpressing MIN6 cells. 2H. Yokota-Hashimoto, S. Torii, and T. Izumi, unpublished observations. To see these phenomena biochemically, a conventional fractionation procedure was employed. Total MIN6 cell homogenates (T) in sucrose buffer were centrifuged at low speed (700 × g) to precipitate the plasma membrane sheets as well as the nucleus (P1). The resultant supernatant then was centrifuged at high speed (12,000 × g) to separate the heavy organelles including dense core granules (P2) and other components containing cytosol (S). In control cells expressing β-galactosidase protein, the plasma membrane-associated syntaxin 1a mainly was present in the P1 fraction, whereas peripherally granule-associated Rab27a (10Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the granule content, secretogranin III (SgIII) (13Hosaka M. Watanabe T. Sakai Y. Uchiyama Y. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3388-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were distributed in the P2 fraction (Fig. 3, upper panels). Overexpression of granuphilin-a by the adenovirus induced significant redistributions of Rab27a and SgIII from P2 to P1, suggesting that insulin granules were moved into the heavier fraction containing the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, lower panels). The localization of phogrin, an integral granule-membrane protein, was similar to that of SgIII, and the immunoreactivity of insulin was correlated with these changes (data not shown). Thus, granuphilin overexpression changed the subcellular localization of granule marker proteins. This biochemical finding indicates that the redistributed granules are engaged in distinct molecular interaction rather than simply forced against the membrane. These results, obtained using the adenovirus expression system, strongly suggest that granuphilin facilitates the docking of insulin granules to the plasma membrane.Fig. 3Granuphilin induces the redistribution of endogenous granule marker proteins. MIN6 cells were infected with an adenovirus bearing either β-galactosidase (upper panels) or granuphilin-a (lower panels) cDNA. The cells were extracted and fractioned by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal proportions of the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies for SgIII, Rab27a, or syntaxin 1a. The subcellular fractions are designated as follows: T, total homogenate; P1, plasma membrane and nucleus; P2, granules and heavy organelle; S, cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Granuphilin Promotes ACTH Granule Targeting to the Plasma Membrane—Previous studies have shown that overexpression of granuphilin significantly inhibits high K+-induced insulin secretion but enhances basal insulin secretion (11Torii S.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the peripheral translocation of granules by granuphilin seen in beta cell line MIN6 could be a mere reflection of accumulated granules resulting from the inhibition of secretion, although the phenomenon was observed in both nonstimulatory (Fig. 2A) and stimulatory glucose concentrations (Fig. 2B). To exclude this possibility, we examined the effect of granuphilin overexpression in pituitary corticotroph cell line AtT20. This cell line also physiologically expresses Rab27a/b and granuphilin (17Zhao S. Torii S. Yokota-Hashimoto H. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and does not stimulate hormone secretion in response to a high glucose level in custom medium, which is in contrast to MIN6 cells. In addition, a relatively lower density of granules in the peripheral cytoplasm of AtT20 cells enabled us to distinguish each ACTH-positive spot. Cells infected with adenovirus expressing granuphilin-b again induced a redistribution of granules along the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, as with MIN6 cells, biochemical fractionation analysis showed that granule marker proteins such as SgIII are significantly redistributed in these cells (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results indicated that the peripheral redistribution of granules by granuphilin overexpression does not simply reflect its inhibitory effect on secretion.Fig. 4Overexpression of granuphilin promotes the targeting of ACTH granules to the plasma membrane.A, AtT20 cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus bearing β-galactosidase (a) or granuphilin-b (b) cDNA. The cells were fixed after 48 h and immunostained with anti-ACTH and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The peripheral line-up of secretory granules was observed at the region marked by arrowheads. Bar, 10 μm. Insets show the higher magnification (×3.2) pictures within the boxed areas. B, AtT20 cells infected with the adenovirus were extracted and fractioned as in Fig. 3. Equal proportions of the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies for SgIII.

Zhao S. Yi Z. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because syntaxin 1a is one of the SNARE proteins on the plasma membrane that mediates the membrane fusion reaction, granuphilin may tether insulin granules to the exocytotic site by an association with syntaxin 1a. To explore this possibility, first we examined the intracellular localization of syntaxin 1a and EGFP-labeled granules that are redistributed to the plasma membrane in the granuphilin-overexpressing cells. The peripheral localization of labeled granules overlapped well with the local distribution of syntaxin 1a in cells overexpressing granuphilin-b (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Granuphilin targets secretory granules to the plasma membrane by the interaction with syntaxin 1a.A, MIN6/phogrin-EGFP cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus bearing granuphilin-b and fixed after 12 h. The cells were permeabilized with methanol and immunostained with anti-syntaxin 1a and Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Intrinsic EGFP fluorescence (a), Cy3 fluorescence (b), and merged fluorescence (c) are shown. B, MIN6/phogrin-EGFP cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding wild-type granuphilin-a (a) or its point mutants, W118S (b) and L43A (c), and were examined for the plasma membrane targeting of EGFP signals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next we examined the targeting activities of granuphilin mutants that are defective in binding to either Rab27a or syntaxin 1a. We demonstrated previously that the W118S and L43A mutations specifically disrupt interactions of granuphilin with Rab27a and syntaxin 1a, respectively (11Torii S. Zhao S. Yi Z. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Overexpression of neither W118S nor L43A altered the distribution of granules labeled by phogrin-EGFP in contrast to wild-type granuphilin-a (Fig. 5B). Some of the W118S-expressing cells showed a more compact, Golgi-like EGFP fluorescence pattern compared with control cells. Immunostaining of the W118S mutant revealed a diffuse cytosolic distribution, which may reflect the inert binding activity of this mutant to Rab27a (data not shown).

We studied the interaction of a fluorescein ester of polyethylene glycol-derivatized cholesterol (fPEG-Chol) with cholesterol-rich membranes both in cells and in model membranes. Unlike filipin and other cholesterol probes, this molecule could be applied as an aqueous dispersion to various samples. When added to live cells, fPEG-Chol distributed exclusively in the outer plasma membrane leaflet and was enriched in microdomains that dynamically clustered by the activation of receptor signaling. The surface-bound fPEG-Chol was slowly internalized via clathrin-independent pathway into endosomes together with lipid raft markers. Noteworthy, fPEG-Chol could be microinjected in the living cells in which we found Golgi apparatus as the sole major organelle to be labeled. PEG-Chol, thus, provides a novel, sensitive probe for unraveling the dynamics of cholesterol-rich microdomains in living cells.

PEG-Chol, thus, provides a novel, sensitive probe for unraveling the dynamics of cholesterol-rich microdomains in living cells. The content and distribution of cholesterol is regulated dynamically by complex mechanisms. Inside the mammalian cells a graded level of free cholesterol distributes in various membrane organelles, with the highest accumulation as domains in the post-Golgi membranes (1Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane cholesterol is also accumulated in microdomains with specific phospholipids such as sphingomyelin. These domains, often referred to lipid rafts, ubiquitously distribute from yeast to mammals, playing important roles in cellular functions (2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 3Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 4Simons K.

Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 7Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the membrane trafficking of cholesterol in live cells. This is apparently due to the lack of sensitive probes. In addition to the specificity as a precondition, use of a small amount of highly sensitive probe is necessary since probing the dynamics relies on the lowest impact of the function of the cholesterol-containing domains. Moreover, cholesterol is very unique in that its level in various membranes is tightly linked even to the transcriptional or secretory activity (8Kuwabara P.E. Labouesse M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, when using a small molecule as a probe, its insertion at a high numbered residue in functioning membranes should be avoided to reduce unexpected impact on the cellular activities. In this respect, filipin, which can be successfully used to detect cholesterol in fixed cells, is not suitable for live cells studies since, in addition to the poor fluorescence property, it yields a cytotoxic side effect by sequestering cholesterol. Similarly, using cholesterol-binding proteins as probes, which accumulate cholesterol and even form pores, often becomes problematic. Polyethylene glycol cholesteryl ethers (PEG-Chols) are a unique group of non-ionic amphiphatic cholesterol derivatives (Fig. 1) (9Ishiwata H. Sato S.B. Vertut-Doi A. Hamashima Y. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1359: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because of low toxicity, various PEG-Chols were initially used in vivo to disperse otherwise water-insoluble antibiotics (10Tasset C. Preat V. Bernard A. Roland M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that PEG(50)-Chol (Mr ∼ 2600; 50 is average number of PEG repeats) was singly dispersed in aqueous media and distributed on the surface of cultured cells (9Ishiwata H. Sato S.B. Vertut-Doi A. Hamashima Y. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1359: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Baba T. Rauch C. Xue M. Terada N. Fujii Y. Ueda H. Takayama I. Ohno S. Farge E. Sato S.B. Traffic. 2001; 2: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Without affecting the clathrin-dependent endocytosis, PEG(50)-Chol could inhibit caveolae-like endocytosis in A431 cells, although the required amount was as high as 3 × 108 molecules/cell (11Baba T. Rauch C. Xue M. Terada N. Fujii Y. Ueda H. Takayama I. Ohno S. Farge E. Sato S.B. Traffic. 2001; 2: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This specificity suggests that PEG-Chols may interact with specific membrane components at much lower dose. In the present study we showed that a fluorescein-tagged PEG-Chol (fPEG-Chol) partitioned from an aqueous media into cholesterol-rich membranes both in cells and in model membranes. These properties of fPEG-Chol made it possible to apply this compound to follow the re-organization of cell surface cholesterol as well as intracellular cholesterol dynamics. Moreover, because fPEG-Chol is water soluble and does not transverse lipid bilayer, we could localize cholesterol-rich domains in the cytoplasmic leaflet of intracellular organelle by microinjection.

Unbound fPEG-Chol was washed with centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Fluorescence of the pellet was measured and normalized by phosphorous of SM. Transfer of fPEG-Chol between Membranes—250 μm (final concentration of phospholipids) acceptor liposomes were added to 50 μm donor palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) liposomes containing 0.5 μm fPEG-Chol and 0.5 μm N-rhodamine dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. The release of fluorescence resonance energy transfer was measured at 30 °C by monitoring the time course of fluorescence emission spectrum at 535 nm with excitation at 488 nm.

In brief, DHE in ethanol was dried under argon and subsequently dissolved in MβCD in Medium 1 (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), making the initial ratio of MβCD to DHE 8:1 (mol:mol). The resulting suspension was vortexed and sonicated until it clarified. It was then incubated in a rocking water bath overnight at 37 °C and centrifuged to remove insoluble DHE aggregates.

The specimens were observed using Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. In Fig. 4, the specimens were observed under an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C-4742-98 cooled CCD camera, which was controlled by a MetaView imaging software. In Fig. 6, fluorescence microscopy and digital image acquisition were carried out using an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with UPlan Apo 100× objective. Images were acquired using a Hamamatsu Image Intensifier Unit C8600 connected with a C-2400 CCD camera. DHE was imaged using a filter cube obtained from Chroma Technology Corp.

Lucocq J.M. James J. Lister J.M. Ponnambalam S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 238-246PubMed Google Scholar). NPC is an autosomal recessive, neurovisceral disease. The hallmark of the NPC syndrome is the intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol (12Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Pentchev P.G. Brady R.O. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Vanier M.T. Carstea E.D. Parker C.C. Goldin E. Roff C.F. Biochim. Biophys.

In contrast to normal fibroblasts, fPEG-Chol brightly stained numerous perinuclear compartments that were previously identified as lysobisphosphatidic acid-rich late endosomes (12Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In contrast, the appearance of the Golgi apparatus was normal in the NPC cells (Fig. 2G). Again, the fluorescence was co-localized with filipin fluorescence (Fig. 2, E and F). Co-localization of fPEG-Chol and filipin were observed in other cell types such as melanoma cells (Fig. 2, I and J), and their derivatives, which are deficient in glycolipid synthesis (Fig. 2, K and L) (13Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) as well as COS7 cells (Fig. 2, M and N). Both fPEG-Chol and filipin staining were abolished when cells were pretreated with MβCD (Fig. 2, O and P), which removes cholesterol from cells (21Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fPEG-Chol labeling was reduced when fPEG-Chol was preincubated with SM/Chol (1:1) liposomes (Fig. 2R). A similar result was obtained with PC/Chol (1:1) liposomes. Chol-free SM or PC liposomes were much less effective to decrease fPEG-Chol labeling (Fig. 2Q). PEG-Chol Is Preferentially Distributed to Cholesterol-rich Membranes in Model Membranes—The results in fixed-permeabilized cells suggested the preference of fPEG-Chol to cholesterol-containing membranes. When SM liposomes were mixed with fPEG-Chol, the addition of cholesterol increased the fluorescence recovered with the membrane (Fig. 3A). In Fig. 3, B and C, we incubated fPEG-Chol pre-embedded in POPC liposomes with various liposomes. The fluorescence of fPEG-Chol was initially quenched by including an acceptor molecule of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, N-rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine (22Nichols J.W. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These liposomes were mixed with acceptor liposomes that contained no probe. Because rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine is a non-exchangeable phospholipid, once fPEG-Chol moved into the acceptor liposomes, its fluorescence would be de-quenched. Remarkably, fluorescence was dequenched depending on the cholesterol content of liposomes. In contrast, cholesterol-containing liposomes did not release the quenching of non-exchangeable N-NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine fluorescence in rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine/PEG-Chol liposomes (data not shown). These results indicated that fPEG-Chol moved from phosphatidylcholine liposomes to cholesterol-containing liposomes via aqueous transfer but not by membrane fusion. Our results suggest that, even once embedded in cholesterol-free membranes, fPEG-Chol will move to cholesterol-rich membranes. PEG-Chol Reveals Re-organization of Cell Surface Cholesterol-rich Domains—Unlike filipin and DHE, fPEG-Chol is membrane non-permeable (see below). This characteristic made it possible to examine the detailed distribution of cell surface cholesterol by fPEG-Chol. In Fig. 4 we examined the distribution of fPEG-Chol on the cell surface by wide-angle video-enhanced microscopy. After a brief incubation with fPEG-Chol and subsequent wash and fixation (the whole procedure was completed within 2 min), we could detect uneven distribution of fluorescence (Fig. 4, A and C). Many of fPEG-positive area were co-localized with CTxB (Fig. 4, B and D). CTxB binds to GM1, which is non-randomly distributed on the plasma membranes, and accumulates in rafts/caveolae (24Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This surface staining was abolished when cells were treated with MβCD (Fig. 4, E and F). We also measured the distribution of fPEG-Chol in cells shortly after the stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF). It is suggested that EGF receptor localizes cholesterol-rich plasma membrane domains and that binding of EGF to the receptor is dependent on cell surface cholesterol (25Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. dos Santos M. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Roepstorff K. Thomsen P. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18954-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Ringerike T. Blystad F.D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. Stang E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). fPEG-Chol fluorescence was co-localized with the distribution of biotin-labeled EGF when EGF was added at 4 °C (Fig. 4, G and H). When EGF was added at 37 °C, clustering of the EGF receptors was observed (Fig. 4J). These clusters were labeled with fPEG-Chol (Fig. 4I). The cell surface distribution of GM1 was also examined under these conditions. GM1 was also enriched in these clusters and co-localized with fPEG-Chol (Fig. 4, K and L). These results indicate that EGF induced the redistribution of both fPEG-Chol and GM1 to the same clusters where EGF receptors were enriched. fPEG-Chol in the Outer Plasma Membrane Leaflet Is Slowly Internalized Together with Lipid Raft Markers—Previously it was shown that PEG-Chol specifically inhibits clathrin-independent endocytosis (9Ishiwata H. Sato S.B. Vertut-Doi A. Hamashima Y. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1359: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Baba T. Rauch C. Xue M. Terada N. Fujii Y. Ueda H. Takayama I. Ohno S. Farge E. Sato S.B. Traffic. 2001; 2: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Endocytosis was significantly reduced when cells were preincubated with 2.5 μm or higher concentrations of PEG-Chol for 30 min at 37 °C. When human skin fibroblasts were incubated with 2.5 μm PEG-Chol for 30 min at 37 °C, cells internalize 37 ± 8 pmol of PEG-Chol/mg of protein. Endocytosis was not affected when cells were briefly incubated with low concentrations of PEG-Chol. Therefore, it is possible to follow the fate of cell surface PEG-Chol in living cells under these conditions. We treated cells with 1 μm fPEG-Chol for 5 min at room temperature. Under these conditions cells incorporated 1.8 ± 0.3 pmol of fPEG-Chol/mg of protein. This amount of fPEG-Chol was sufficient to follow the fate of fluorescence. However, this concentration of fPEG-Chol did not affect the endocytosis of dextran and CTxB. After labeling cells with fPEG-Chol, we chased the internalization of fluorescence at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mg/ml rhodamine dextran. Most of the fPEG-Chol fluorescence stayed on the plasma membrane after 10 min of chase (Fig. 5, A and D). After 60 min, fluorescent compartments surrounded the nucleus (Fig. 5B). fPEG-Chol could further stain intracellular vesicles. Most of these vesicles were not co-localized with internalized rhodamine dextran (Fig. 5E). After 180 min, the Golgi apparatus was prominently labeled with fPEG-Chol whereas rhodamine fluorescence was distributed in endosomes/lysosomes (Fig. 5, C and F). fPEG-Chol fluorescence in intracellular vesicles was highly enhanced after neutralizing the vesicular pH by ammonium chloride (Fig. 5, G and H). We then compared the internalization of fPEG-Chol with those of known raft markers. Cells were preincubated with the PE-conjugated monoclonal antibody against glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, CD59 (Fig. 5, L-N), Alexa-594 labeled CTxB (Fig. 5, O-Q) or Texas Red-labeled transferrin (Fig. 5, I-K) together with fPEG-Chol. After washing, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, treated with ammonium chloride at room temperature, and then immediately observed. fPEG-Chol well co-localized with lipid raft markers CD59 and GM1. In contrast, fPEG-Chol was not colocalized with internalized transferrin. Transferrin is internalized via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, whereas glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and cholera toxin are endocytosed by clathrin-independent mechanisms (28Sabharanjak S. Sharma P. Parton R.G. Mayor S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the raft domains were internalized via clathrin-independent pathway into acidic organelle. During prolonged incubation, fPEG-Chol was further transported to the Golgi apparatus. Recently intracellular transport of cell surface cholesterol in CHO cells was studied by using DHE (16Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DHE was enriched in the endocytic recycling compartment. We then compared the internalization of fPEG-Chol with that of DHE in CHO cells. As reported, DHE was detected in the juxta-nuclear region (Fig. 6A). In contrast, fPEG-Chol fluorescence was seen in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that the intracellular fates of fPEG-Chol and DHE are different. Cytoplasmic Leaflet of the Golgi Apparatus Has Cholesterol-rich Domains—In Fig. 7A, living human skin fibroblasts were labeled with fPEG-Chol at 10 °C, a condition that inhibits endocytosis. Fluorescence shows exclusive cell surface staining. This pattern of distribution was remarkably different from that of a fluorescent phosphatidylserine derivative, 1-palmitoyl-2-(6-((7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (C6-NBD-phosphatidylserine), which has been known to be incorporated into the plasma membrane and to undergo transbilayer movement and intracellular diffusion (29Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5890-5898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kobayashi T. Arakawa Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Fig. 7B, C6-NBD-phosphatidylserine was accumulated in the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria after 30 min at 10 °C, in agreement with previous observations (30Kobayashi T. Arakawa Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results indicate that fPEG-Chol does not undergo transbilayer movement and is membrane-impermeable. Little is known about the transbilayer membrane distribution of cholesterol in live cell organelles. Because fPEG-Chol is membrane-impermeable, we microinjected this molecule in live cells to monitor the distribution of cholesterol in the cytoplasmic side of intracellular organelles. When we microinjected fPEG-Chol in living normal skin fibroblasts, fluorescence illuminated the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 7C). Surprisingly, the pattern was similar in NPC cells. The numerous cholesterol-rich late endosomes, which could be detected in fixed and permeabilized cells (Fig. 2E), were not labeled at all (Fig. 7D). These results suggest that the Golgi apparatus solely exposes cholesterol-rich domains to the cytoplasm of both the normal and NPC fibroblasts. Microinjection of fPEG-Chol did not inhibit the endocytosis of rhodamine dextran. After prolonged incubation, fluorescence was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown). PEG-Chol, a Unique Water-soluble Probe for Cholesterol-rich Domains—Several probes have been used to localize cholesterol-rich domains. Filipin has spread widely (31Norman A.W. Demel R.A. de Kruyff B. van Deenen L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1918-1929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) despite the limitation due to the high photosensitivity and toxicity (Ref. 32Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Shimada Y. Maue R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and reference therein). Naturally occurring fluorescent cholesterol analog DHE has been used to follow the fate of unesterified sterol in living cells (16Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)). Because DHE itself is water-insoluble and has a lower fluorescence quantum yield than conventional fluorophores, a substantial amount of this molecule has to be added to live cell studies in a form complexed with MβCD. These conditions may become an obstacle in some experiments since chronic treatment of cells with MβCD-cholesterol alters cellular lipid metabolism (34Blom T.S. Koivusalo M. Kuismanen E. Kostiainen R. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14635-14644Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently a novel protein probe (BCθ) derived from bacterial toxin, perfringolysin O, has been shown to selectively bind to cholesterol-rich membrane domains (32Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Shimada Y.

Traffic. 2003; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, because BCθ is a bulky protein (Mr ∼ 57 kDa), it may induce an alteration of the membrane organization. Although liposome studies suggested that fPEG-Chol has background distribution into the hydrophobic membrane milieu as other hydrophobic molecules do, it showed the following unique characteristics: 1) preferential partition to cholesterol-rich membranes such as SM/Chol, 2) higher stability and quantum efficiency of the fluorophore than DHE or filipin, 3) single dispersion in aqueous phase at ∼μm concentrations, 4) low cell toxicity, 5) unlikely to permeate or flip-flop membranes, 6) relatively low molecular weight (∼2,600). We stress that these properties of fPEG-Chol not only complemented the information obtained by other probes but also uncovered the yet unknown trafficking of cholesterol-containing membranes in live cells. Cellular Distribution of Cholesterol-rich Domains—An in vitro study indicates that fPEG-Chol is useful in documenting dynamics of raft-like structures inside the cells as well as on the surface. Although the presumably high mobility on the surface may not allow complete visualization in the living cells, short exposure to fPEG-Chol revealed numerous spots on the cell surface. This probe followed the reorganization of these domains after activation of EGF signaling, in which fPEG-Chol aggregated with EGF and GM1. With fPEG-Chol, late endosomes were stained in fixed normal and Niemann-Pick type C cells. Interestingly, even in NPC fibroblasts, microinjection of fPEG-Chol illuminated for the first time the Golgi apparatus, but not late endosomes, as the sole major organelle that exposes cholesterol-rich domain cytoplasmically. Late endosomes were previously shown to be highly enriched with a specific phospholipid, lysobisphosphatidic acid (12Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 38Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J.

Luminal binding of several antibodies to this lipid interferes with its function in accumulation and distribution of cholesterol. Our present results suggest that accumulated cholesterol and lysobisphosphatidic acid reside in the same luminal leaflet, raising the possibility of direct interaction between these molecules in NPC. Fate of Cell Surface Cholesterol—Recently intracellular transport of cell surface cholesterol in CHO cells was studied by using a DHE/MβCD (16Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DHE was enriched in the endocytic recycling compartment localized by transferrin. The delivery of DHE to the endocytic recycling compartment from the plasma membrane was only slightly affected by energy depletion, suggesting the involvement of a non-vesicular pathway. Our results indicate that the routes of internalization of DHE and PEG-Chol are different. Because DHE undergoes rapid transbilayer movement (41John K. Kubelt J. Muller P. Wustner D. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1525-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), such a mechanism may involve spontaneous flip-flop of the molecule from the outer to inner plasma membrane leaflets followed by the accumulation to an endocytic recycling compartment (16Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In contrast, fPEG-Chol restricted in the outer leaflet cholesterol-rich domain likely monitored the slow clathrin-independent traffic to the Golgi region. We suggest here that the trafficking of the cholesterol in the outer and inner plasma membrane monolayers occur independently."
https://openalex.org/W2100647001,"Zinc is an essential nutrient required for the growth and metabolism of eukaryotic cells. In this work, we examined the effects of zinc depletion on the regulation of phospholipid synthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Zinc depletion resulted in a decrease in the activity levels of the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway enzymes phosphatidylserine synthase, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, and phospholipid methyltransferase. In contrast, the activity of phosphatidylinositol synthase was elevated in response to zinc depletion. The level of Aut7p, a marker for the induction of autophagy, was also elevated in zinc-depleted cells. For the CHO1-encoded phosphatidylserine synthase, the reduction in activity in response to zinc depletion was controlled at the level of transcription. This regulation was mediated through the UASINO element and by the transcription factors Ino2p, Ino4p, and Opi1p that are responsible for the inositol-mediated regulation of UASINO-containing genes involved in phospholipid synthesis. Analysis of the cellular composition of the major membrane phospholipids showed that zinc depletion resulted in a 66% decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine and a 29% increase in phosphatidylinositol. A zrt1Δ zrt2Δ mutant (defective in the plasma membrane zinc transporters Zrt1p and Zrt2p) grown in the presence of zinc exhibited a phospholipid composition similar to that of wild type cells depleted for zinc. These results indicated that a decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of zinc was responsible for the alterations in phospholipid composition.

Recent data indicate that phospholipid metabolism in yeast is coordinately regulated with mechanisms that control zinc homeostasis (43Han G.-S. Johnston C.N. Chen X. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10126-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Zinc, an essential nutrient, is required for the growth and metabolism of eukaryotic cells (44Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a cofactor for several hundred enzymes (44Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a structural component for many transcription factors (45Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc deficiency in humans is manifested by defects in appetite, cognitive function, embryonic development, epithelial integrity, and immune function (46Walsh C.T. Sandstead H.H. Prasad A.S. Newberne P.M. Fraker P.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 5-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, zinc deficiency in rats is associated with oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins (47Oteiza P.L. Olin K.L. Fraga C.G. Keen C.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 85-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as causing a decrease in the overall phospholipid content (48Driscoll E.R. Bettger W.J. Lipids. 1992; 27: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 49Johanning G.L. O'Dell B.L. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 1654-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 50Clejan S. Maddaiah V.T.

Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic levels of zinc in yeast are controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including cellular influx (51Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), efflux (52Nies D.H. Silver S. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 186-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D.

A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic levels of zinc are largely controlled by high affinity and low affinity zinc transporters (Zrt1p and Zrt2p) in the plasma membrane (55Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 56Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Zrt1p and Zrt2p are induced when the extracellular concentration of zinc is low (55Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cytoplasmic levels of zinc are controlled further by the vacuole membrane efflux transporter Zrt3p. Expression of the vacuole membrane-associated DPP1-encoded DGPP phosphatase (43Han G.-S.

The induction of DGPP phosphatase expression in zinc-depleted cells correlates with diminished levels of the minor vacuole membrane phospholipids DGPP and PA (59Han G.S. Johnston C.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5338-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to the changes in DGPP and PA, zinc depletion results in a reduction in the level of PE and an increase in the level of PI in the vacuole membrane (59Han G.S. Johnston C.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5338-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of dpp1Δ mutant cells depleted for zinc indicates that the alterations in the major vacuole membrane phospholipids are not dependent on the regulation of DPP1 expression (60Johnston C.N. The Effects of Zinc and the DPP1-encoded Diacylglycerol Pyrophosphate Phosphatase on the Vacuolar Phospholipid Composition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ2002Google Scholar). In this work, we showed that zinc depletion resulted in a decrease in the activities of CDP-DAG pathway enzymes and an increase in the activity of PI synthase. The level of Aut7p, a marker for the induction of autophagy, was also elevated in zinc-depleted cells. For the CHO1-encoded PS synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step in the CDP-DAG pathway, the reduction in activity was controlled at the level of transcription. This regulation was mediated through the UASINO element in the CHO1 promoter and by the transcription factors Ino2p, Ino4p, and Opi1p. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Cells were grown at 30 °C in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose. For selection of cells bearing plasmids, appropriate nutrients were omitted from synthetic complete medium. Zinc-depleted medium was synthetic complete medium prepared with yeast nitrogen base lacking zinc sulfate. For zinc-depleted cultures, cells were first grown for 24 h in synthetic complete medium supplemented with 1.4 μm zinc sulfate. Standard synthetic growth medium contains 1.4 μm zinc sulfate. Saturated cultures were harvested, washed in deionized distilled water, diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in medium containing 0 or 1.4 μm zinc sulfate, and grown for 24 h. Cultures were then diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and grown again in medium containing 0 or 1.4 μm zinc sulfate. This growth regimen with medium lacking zinc was used to deplete internal stores of zinc. Cells in liquid media were grown to the exponential phase (1–2 × 107 cells/ml), and cell numbers were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm. Plasmids were maintained and amplified in Escherichia coli strain DH5α, which was grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to cultures of DH5α-carrying plasmids. For growth on plates, yeast and bacterial media were supplemented with 2 and 1.5% agar, respectively. To prevent zinc contamination, glassware was washed with Liqui-Nox, rinsed with 0.1 mm EDTA, and then rinsed several times with deionized distilled water.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this workStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicsReference/SourceS. cerevisiaeDY1457MATα ade6 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52Ref. 96Zhao H.

https://openalex.org/W1985901212,"The tumor suppressor, Smad4/DPC4, is a common signal transducer in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) regulates the signaling potential of Smad4 through a sumoylation-dependent mechanism. PIAS1 was shown to be an E3 ligase for Smad4 sumoylation in vitro and in vivo. PIAS1 physically interacted with Smad4 in a TGF-β-inducible manner. A minimal SUMO E3 ligase domain and Smad4-binding domain were defined on PIAS1 protein. The RING finger domain of PIAS1 was essential for its E3 ligase function. Although PIAS1 enhanced the Smad4-dependent transcriptional activation of TGF-β signaling, a mutant lacking the RING domain inhibited the sumoylation of Smad4 in a dominant negative manner and, as a result, abolished the transcriptional response of TGF-β. These data demonstrate that PIAS1 protein positively modulates TGF-β responses as a SUMO E3 ligase for Smad4.

The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway controls the turnover of products of many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and thus plays a major role in cancer development (1Adams J.

Recently, a number of ubiquitin-related proteins have also been found in eukaryotic cells. These proteins, including the small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1), 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO1, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1; PIAS1, protein inhibitor of activated STAT1; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SBE, Smad-binding elements; SAP, stress-activated protein; MH, Mad homology; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β.1The abbreviations used are: SUMO1, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1; PIAS1, protein inhibitor of activated STAT1; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SBE, Smad-binding elements; SAP, stress-activated protein; MH, Mad homology; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β. utilize a conjugation system that is similar to ubiquitination (6Schwartz D.C.

In particular, SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by an E1 enzyme consisting of the Aos1/Uba2 heterodimer and then transferred to the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme Ubc9 and subsequently ligated to the substrate. In contrast to ubiquitination, SUMO1 modifications of target proteins do not promote their degradation. Furthermore, SUMO1 modification reduces ubiquitination of tumor suppressor Smad4 (8Lin X.

Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of SUMO1 modification vary depending on the target. For example, SUMO1 conjugation is necessary for RanGAP1 localization to the nuclear pore complex (10Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

Structural analysis of the complex between Ubc9 and its substrate, RanGAP1, demonstrates clearly how the motif is specifically recognized by Ubc9 and elucidates nicely why RanGAP1 sumoylation may not depend on an E3 ligase (20Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, more recent reports support the presence of E3 enzymes for sumoylation (21Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Pichler A. Gast A.

Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In particular, a family of SUMO E3 ligases, termed protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS), has recently been discovered (21Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The PIAS protein family consists of five members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy. PIAS1 and PIAS3 were originally shown to interact with STAT1 and STAT3, respectively, and inhibit their functions (25Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6101-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The first demonstration of a mammalian PIAS protein as a SUMO E3 ligase was shown in the involvement of PIAS1 in p53 sumoylation (33Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). PIAS proteins resemble the RING-class ubiquitin E3 ligases and bind to Ubc9 through the RING finger domain (34Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The RING finger domain is highly conserved among PIAS proteins and is supported by the observation that, similar to PIAS1, PIASxβ also promotes the sumoylation of CtBP (12Lin X. Sun B. Liang M.

A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Amid the increasing numbers of transcription factors that interact with PIAS proteins, it is believed that the coregulator function of PIAS proteins could operate, at least partly, through PIAS-mediated sumoylation of the transcription factors (18Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).Recently our laboratory and others revealed that Smad4 is a sumoylated protein (8Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31043-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27853-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It appears that Smad4 sumoylation may involve the function of a PIAS protein (37Lee P.S. Chang C. Liu D. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27853-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50833-50842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PIASy also regulates TGF-β signaling through its interaction with Smad3 (39Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Wang G. Shuai K. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9791-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 40Imoto S. Sugiyama K. Muromoto R. Sato N. Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34253-34258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yet, whether PIAS proteins act as SUMO E3 ligases for Smads has not been resolved in a well defined system. To understand the role of PIAS proteins in TGF-β signaling, we determined the in vivo and in vitro function of PIAS1 and other family members in Smad4 sumoylation, the physical association of PIAS1 and Smad4, and the physiological consequence in TGF-β-induced transcription. We delineated the minimal requirement for the SUMO E3 ligase activity and Smad4-binding activity of PIAS1 protein. Interestingly, PIAS1 formed a TGF-β-inducible complex with Smad4. PIAS1 promoted sumoylation of Smad4 both in vivo and in vitro. Accordingly, PIAS1 profoundly stimulated TGF-β-dependent transcription. Deletion or point mutations in the RING domain of PIAS1 inhibited TGF-β-induced reporter gene expression in a dominant negative manner. Therefore, PIAS-mediated sumoylation plays an important role in SMAD-dependent TGF-β signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Cloning—Mammalian expression plasmids for epitope (HA-, FLAG-, or His)-tagged Smad4 and SUMO1 have been described previously (8Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31043-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PIAS1 was obtained by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI (at the 5′ end) and SalI (at the 3′ end) in pXF2F or pXF3H, which are derived from pRK5 for the generation of N-terminally FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged proteins, respectively. Deletion mutants of PIAS1 containing aa 2–480, 121–480, 200–480, and 300–480, as well as point mutations at Cys-345, Cys-350, and Cys-355 into Ser residues were also obtained by PCR and similarly cloned into the pXF3H vector. Details of the primer sequences and cloning strategies can be obtained upon request.The bacterial expression plasmid for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Smad4 has been described previously (45Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Plasmids for GST-PIAS proteins were constructed by transferring the inserts containing the PIAS coding region from mammalian plasmids into pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant GST fusion proteins were produced in the Escherichia coli BL21 strain and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro sumoylation, recombinant Smad4 was separated from the GST tag by thrombin (0.2 units/μl) cleavage in phosphate-buffered saline. We observed that GST-Smad4 fusion protein is a poor substrate for in vitro sumoylation.Ni-NTA Precipitation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—For Ni-NTA precipitation, HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids for His-tagged Smad4, FLAG-tagged SUMO1, and HA-PIAS as specified in the text and/or figures. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were harvested and sonicated in guanidinium lysis buffer (6 m guanidinium HCl, 0.1 m NaPO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 8). His-tagged Smad4 was then immobilized on Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) and, after extensive washing, eluted in elution buffer (200 mm imidazole, 5% SDS, 0.15 m Tris, pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol). Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll), and detected with anti-His or anti-Smad4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for the Smad4 protein and anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-SUMO1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for the SUMO-conjugated Smad4 protein. Antibody-bound proteins were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescence (Pierce).For Smad4-PIAS interactions using immunoprecipitations, HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-Smad4 and HA-PIAS. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were harvested in FLAG lysis buffer (46Feng X.-H. Liang Y.-Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To detect PIAS-bound Smad4 and to retrieve PIAS proteins, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), and then to detect PIAS1-bound Smad4 (as similarly described (12Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)), the cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma).In Vitro Sumoylation—In vitro sumoylation assay was performed as described by Lin et al. (12Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recombinant SUMO1, Uba2/Aos1, and Ubc9 were produced from E. coli as described by Pichler et al. (23Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In a typical sumoylation reaction, 20 ng of SUMO1, 20 ng of Uba2/Aos1, 10 ng of Ubc9, 100 ng of substrate (Smad4 or RanGAP), and PIAS1 (100 ng or as specified in the text/figures) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of ATP. SUMO conjugates were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-SUMO or anti-Smad4 antibodies.GST in Vitro Binding and Pull-down Assays—For the in vitro binding assay, 35S-labeled PIAS proteins, produced in vitro by using aTnT kit (Promega), were incubated with 1 μg of GST or GST-Smad4 as indicated in the text. GST-Smad4-bound PIAS was retrieved by using glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After extensive washing of GST fusions and binding proteins in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, Smad4-bound PIAS was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. PIAS1-mediated pull down of Smad4 full-length protein or domains was similarly done.For PIAS1 pull down of endogenous Smad4, exponentially growing HaCaT cells were treated with 400 pm TGF-β (2 h) and harvested in cell lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysates were precleared with 10 μg of GST protein (on beads) for 1 h at 4 °C, incubated with 2 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-PIAS1 for 2 h at 4 °C, washed four times with the lysis buffer, and then analyzed by anti-Smad4 Western blotting.Transcription Reporter Assays—Plasmid Smad-binding elements (SBE)-luc, which contains the luciferase gene under control of the SBE (41Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), was used to measure TGF-β-induced transcription. Transfections, TGF-β treatment, and reporter assays were carried out as described (8Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31043-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). TGF-β-responsive HaCaT and Mv1Lu cells were transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Generally, exponentially grown cells at 30% confluency were transfected with expression plasmids for PIASs and/or reporter plasmids. The amount of transfected DNA was always the same by adding vector DNA whenever needed. 40–45 h after transfection, cells were treated with 200 pm TGF-β for 12 h. Cells were then harvested for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All assays were done in duplicate and repeated more than three times, and all values were normalized for transfection efficiency against β-galactosidase activity.RESULTSPIAS1 Acts as a SUMO E3 Ligase in Smad4 Sumoylation—We have recently discovered that Smad4 is sumoylated in vivo at two conserved lysine residues, Lys-113 and Lys-159 (36Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We then decided to determine whether Smad4 is a direct substrate for the SUMO1 conjugation in a well defined in vitro reconstitution experiment using purified recombinant proteins. The assay contained recombinant Smad4, SUMO1, Ubc9, and E1 enzyme Aos2/Uba2 heterodimer, and ATP. When Smad4 protein was incubated with different components of SUMO1, E1 or E2 enzyme alone, we observed that Smad4 was not SUMO1-modified (data not shown). Even when all components were added to the reaction mixture, no additional bands of Smad4 with slow mobility were observed (Fig. 1, lane 3). Conversely, the positive control RanGAP1 was efficiently sumoylated under the same conditions (lane 1). These data suggest that an additional cellular factor, such as an E3 ligase, may be critical for Smad4 sumoylation.We then tested whether the recently identified SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 could mediate SUMO1 modification on Smad4. PIAS1 has been shown to be an E3 ligase for CtBP (12Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), p53 (33Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and c-Jun sumoylation (35Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We found that in the presence of PIAS1, two bands of the higher molecular mass product (80–100 kDa) were observed by Western blotting using an anti-SUMO antibody. The higher molecular mass bands appearing in these in vitro modification reactions were further identified as Smad4-SUMO1 conjugates, because the same bands were recognized by an anti-Smad4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, lower blot, the slow migrating Smad4 species represented SUMO1-conjugates (lane 4). In contrast, the K113R/K159R mutant was not sumoylated (Fig. 1A, lane 5; Fig. 1B, lane 8), confirming the in vivo data that Lys-113 and Lys-159 represent the sumoylation sites on the Smad4 molecule (36Lin X.

Further analysis indicated the involvement of other PIAS proteins. PIASxβ, and to a lesser extent PIASy, but not PIAS3, could promote sumoylation of Smad4 (data not shown). However, this study only focuses on the role of PIAS1.Additionally, we conducted a dosage experiment for PIAS1 in Smad4 sumoylation. As shown in Fig. 1B, a gradual increase in PIAS1 added to the in vitro reaction mixture increased the amount of sumoylated Smad4. Consistent with our previous observations in vivo (8Lin X. Liang M.

Furthermore, an even more slowly migrating band could be occasionally detected, likely because of the double modification at both Lys-113 and Lys-159 (Fig. 1A, upper and lower blots). Together, data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that PIAS1 directly acts as an E3 ligase to allow SUMO1 modification of both Lys-113 and Lys-159 residues on Smad4.PIAS1 Sumoylates Smad4 Dependent on Its RING Finger Domain—To further characterize the function of PIAS1 in Smad4 sumoylation, we determined whether the RING finger of PIAS1 is important for its E3 role toward Smad4 sumoylation. To this end, simultaneous point mutations at C345S, C350S, and C355S were introduced into PIAS1 protein (Fig. 2C, construct CS), and the effect of the mutations was tested in SUMO1 modification of Smad4 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2A, the RING mutant failed to induce sumoylation of Smad4 (lanes 4 and 6), whereas Smad4-SUMO conjugate was observed in the presence of recombinant wild type PIAS1 protein (lanes 3 and 5). These data suggest that the functional RING domain of PIAS1 is essential for its E3 ligase function in Smad4 sumoylation.Fig. 2Mapping of the minimal E3 ligase domain of PIAS1. A and B, in vitro sumoylation of Smad4 by deletion mutants of PIAS1. In vitro sumoylation assay using recombinant proteins was carried out as in Fig. 1. 100 ng of recombinant Smad4 was added in lanes 2–6 in A and all lanes in B.

WT, wild type; IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Minimal E3 Domain of PIAS1 for Smad4 Sumoylation— PIAS1 is a polypeptide consisting of 650 amino acids. Besides its RING finger domain (aa 300–420), PIAS1 has a SAP domain at the N terminus that may mediate interaction with the nuclear matrix and a C-terminal domain with unknown functions. We were then interested in determining the minimal requirement of the PIAS1 sequences/domains for Smad4 sumoylation. Based on the requirement of RING domain in Smad4 sumoylation, we hypothesized that the minimal E3 ligase should at least contain the RING domain. For this purpose, a series of deletions were generated from the N and C termini of PIAS1 (Fig. 2C). Recombinant PIAS1 proteins containing these deletion mutations were produced in E. coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The recombinant proteins were then tested for their ability to sumoylate Smad4 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2A, deletion of the C-terminal domain (aa 481–650) did not affect its ligase function toward Smad4 sumoylation (Fig. 2A, lane 5). The mutant without the first 120 amino acids retained its ability to sumoylate Smad4, albeit less efficiently (Fig. 2B, lane 3 in comparison to lane 1). However, the RING domain alone was not sufficient to promote Smad4 sumoylation (Fig. 2B, lane 5). We also determined the essentiality of RING finger domain in the full-length and the shorter functional E3 ligase domain (aa 2–480). As expected, mutation in the RING finger (C345S/C350S/C355S) of PIAS1 caused the loss of its SUMO E3 ligase activity in Smad4 sumoylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6). Take together, the minimal E3 ligase activity of PIAS1 is located in the region of aa 121–480, including the RING domain (summarized in Figs. 2C and 4C).Fig. 4PIAS1 interacts with Smad4 through multiple contacts on PIAS1. A, PIAS1-Smad4 interaction in vitro. An equal amount (1 μg) of GST-Smad4 fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 35S-labeled PIAS1 or its variants. After extensive washing, the PIAS1-Smad4 complex was resolved on SDS-PAGE, and Smad4-bound PIAS1 was visualized by autoradiography. Upper blots, Smad4-bound PIAS1; lower blots, 1% input before in vitro binding. B, Smad4 interacts with PIAS1 in cells. GST-Smad4 was used to pull down PIAS1 from 293T cell lysates that had been transfected with the indicated HA-tagged PIAS1 proteins. Smad4-bound PIAS1 was detected by anti-HA antibodies (upper blots). The expression levels of different PIAS1 peptides in whole cell lysates were shown in the lower blots. Open arrows indicate the absence of corresponding bands.

To this end, we transfected HeLa cells with an expression plasmid for PIAS1 and determined whether its overexpression could promote Smad4 sumoylation. As shown in Fig. 3A, although Smad4 was weakly modified with SUMO1 (lane 3), the sumoylation could be strongly stimulated with PIAS1 expression (lane 4). The increases in Smad4 sumoylation depended on the integrity of the E3 ligase function of PIAS1, as the RING mutant did not produce any effects on Smad4 sumoylation (Fig. 3B, compare lane 4 with 3).Fig. 3PIAS1 promotes Smad4 sumoylation in vivo.

Among these proteins are sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs) that pump Ca2+ into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recently, the human SERCA3 gene was shown to give rise to five isoforms (SERCA3a–e (h3a–h3e)). Here we demonstrate the existence of an additional new member, termed SERCA3f (h3f). By reverse transcriptase-PCR using monocytic U937 cell RNA, h3f mRNA was found to exclude the antepenultimate exon 21. h3f mRNA expression appeared as a human-specific splice variant. It was not found in rats or mice. h3f mRNA gave rise to an h3f protein differing in its C terminus from h3a–h3e. Of particular interest, h3f diverged in the first amino acids after the first splice site but presented the same last 21 amino acids as h3b. Consequently, we further investigated the structure-function-location relationships of the h3b and h3f isoforms. Comparative functional study of h3b and h3f recombinant proteins in intact HEK-293 cells and in fractionated membranes showed the following distinct characteristics: (i) resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) and (ii) ER Ca2+ content ([Ca2+]er); similar characteristics were shown for the following: (i) the effects of the SERCA inhibitor, thapsigargin, on Ca2+ release ([Ca2+]Tg) and subsequent Ca2+ entry ([Ca2+]e) and (ii) the low apparent Ca2+ affinity and the enhanced rate of dephosphorylation of the E2P phosphoenzyme intermediate. Subcellular location of h3b and h3f by immunofluorescence and/or confocal microscopy using the h3b- and h3f-specific polyclonal and the pan-h3 monoclonal (PL/IM430) antibodies suggested overlapping but distinct ER location. The endogenous expression of h3f protein was also proved in U937 cells. Altogether these data suggest that the SERCA3 isoforms have a more widespread role in cellular Ca2+ signaling than previously appreciated.

https://openalex.org/W1968629537,"The human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis can degrade the N-linked glycans of human RNase B to acquire nutrients, but no gene or protein has been associated with this activity. We identified an 88-kDa secreted protein, endoglycosidase (Endo) E, which is most likely responsible for this activity. EndoE, encoded by ndoE, consists of an α-domain with a family 18 glycosyl hydrolase motif and a β-domain similar to family 20 glycosyl hydrolases. Phylogenetic analysis of EndoE indicates that the α-domain is related to human chitobiases, and the β-domain is related to bacterial and human hexosaminidases. Recombinant expression of full-length EndoE or EndoEα, site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic residues, mass spectroscopy, and homology modeling shows that EndoEα hydrolyzes the glycan on human RNase B, whereas EndoEβ hydrolyzes the conserved glycan on IgG. Denaturation experiments indicate that the chitinase activity on RNase B is not dependent on the tertiary structure, although it is on IgG. The ndoE gene and secreted EndoE are present in most E. faecalis but not in Enterococcus faecium isolates. Correspondingly, E. faecalis, but not E. faecium, degrades the glycan on RNase B during growth. Thus, we have identified a secreted enzyme from E. faecalis, EndoE, which by two distinct activities hydrolyzes the glycans on RNase B and IgG. Both activities could be important for the molecular pathogenesis and persistence of E. faecalis during human infections. The human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis can degrade the N-linked glycans of human RNase B to acquire nutrients, but no gene or protein has been associated with this activity.

Thus, we have identified a secreted enzyme from E. faecalis, EndoE, which by two distinct activities hydrolyzes the glycans on RNase B and IgG. Both activities could be important for the molecular pathogenesis and persistence of E. faecalis during human infections. Enterococcus faecalis is a human commensal bacterium that inhabits the mucosal surfaces primarily in the gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless, E. faecalis is a major health problem in humans because it can cause a wide variety of diseases by infecting the urinary tract, bloodstream, and endocardium (1Murray B.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 3: 46-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). It is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections and can cause bacteremia with substantial mortality (2Jett B.D. Huycke M.M. Gilmore M.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 7: 462-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Therapy of infections is severely complicated by the intrinsic low and the high levels of acquired antibiotic resistance. The complete genomic sequence of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolate, V583, was recently published, demonstrating the importance of genetic mobile elements in development of resistance, and provides an excellent resource for identifying genes with potential roles in virulence and persistence (3Paulsen I.T. Banerjei L. Myers G.S. Nelson K.E. Seshadri R. Read T.D. Fouts D.E. Eisen J.A. Gill S.R. Heidelberg J.F. Tettelin H. Dodson R.J. Umayam L. Brinkac L. Beanan M. Daugherty S. DeBoy R.T. Durkin S. Kolonay J. Madupu R. Nelson W. Vamathevan J. Tran B. Upton J. Hansen T. Shetty J. Khouri H. Utterback T. Radune D. Ketchum K.A. Dougherty B.A. Fraser C.M. Science. 2003; 299: 2071-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Little is known about how E. faecalis obtains nutrients and persists in vivo, but it has been shown that it can release high mannose-type N-linked glycan from host glycoproteins that could support growth in vitro (4Roberts G. Tarelli E. Homer K.A. Philpott-Howard J. Beighton D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This ability is associated with an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity detected in several enterococcal species, including E. faecalis, but not in the closely related Enterococcus faecium (5Roberts G. Homer K.A. Tarelli E. Philpott-Howard J. Devriese L.A. Beighton D. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 50: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). No specific gene or protein has been linked to this activity. Glycosyl hydrolases can be found in all types of organisms, from bacteria to mammals, and are classified by their enzymatic activities and by their primary and structural similarities (6Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 7Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar, 8Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). An excellent up-to-date on-line resource describing the known glycosyl hydrolases and their classification can be found at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html. Glycosyl hydrolases of family 18 (FGH18) 1The abbreviations used are: FGH18 and -20, family 18 or 20 glycosyl hydrolases; Endo, endoglycosidase; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GNL, G. nivalis lectin; Hex, hexosaminidase; PNGaseF, N-glycosidase F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight. 1The abbreviations used are: FGH18 and -20, family 18 or 20 glycosyl hydrolases; Endo, endoglycosidase; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GNL, G. nivalis lectin; Hex, hexosaminidase; PNGaseF, N-glycosidase F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight. include enzymes that hydrolyze GlcNAc polymers with varying specificity. The FGH18 chitinases degrade chitin, a polymer of GlcNAc, whereas other FGH18s, like the endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, very specifically hydrolyze the chitin core of various asparagine (N)-linked glycans on glycoproteins. These include EndoF1-3 and EndoH from Flavobacterium meningosepticum that are widely used in glycobiology research to characterize glycans on glycoproteins (9Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of FGH18s are dependent on a glutamic acid residue, serving as a proton donor, and a well defined 8-amino acid motif has been established for this family (10Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai H. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The family 20 glycosyl hydrolases (FGH20s) consists of hexosaminidases from bacteria to mammals, including human lysosomal hexosaminidases that are important for degradation of glycoconjugates. Hexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52) hydrolyze β-glycosidically linked N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine in glycans. FGH20s are also dependent on a Glu residue as proton donor (11Hou Y. Vocadlo D.J. Leung A. Withers S.G. Mahuran D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Mark B.L. Wasney G.A. Salo T.J. Khan A.R. Cao Z. Robbins P.W. James M.N. Triggs-Raine B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19618-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but there are no well defined enzymatic motifs. Rather, inclusion into this family is based on overall primary and structural similarities (8Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases have been identified in a number of Gram-positive pathogens. For instance, a secreted Streptococcus pneumoniae enzyme, belonging to FGH20, has activity on human glycoproteins and is suggested to be involved in virulence (13Clarke V.A. Platt N. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8805-8814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Streptococcus oralis can hydrolyze and metabolize glycans from mucins and α1-acid glycoprotein (14Rafay A.M. Homer K.A. Beighton D. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 44: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Byers H.L. Tarelli E. Homer K.A. Beighton D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Homer K.A. Kelley S. Hawkes J. Beighton D. Grootveld M.C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1221-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, which is closely related to E. faecalis, has recently been shown to secrete an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (FGH18), EndoS, that exclusively hydrolyzes the complex-type biantennary glycan on the heavy (γ) chain of IgG (17Collin M. Olsén A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3046-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This activity alters the function of opsonizing IgG through impaired binding to Fc receptors and decreased activation of the classical pathway of complement and thereby increases bacterial survival in human blood (18Collin M. Svensson M.D. Sjöholm A.G. Jensenius J.C. Sjöbring U. Olsén A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Proteolytic and glycolytic modulation of the host immune system seems to be a common theme in the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes as well as other bacterial pathogens (19Collin M. Olsén A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked if E. faecalis might have an enzymatic approach similar to the other Gram-positive pathogens to modulate host immune defense and/or release glycan from glycoproteins for nutritional purposes. In this study, we utilized the amino acid sequence of the endoglycosidase EndoS from S. pyogenes to probe available bacterial genomic sequences. We identified a novel gene, ndoE, and a corresponding secreted protein, EndoE, in E. faecalis that has glycosyl hydrolase activity on both human RNase B and IgG. Bacteria, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—Bacteria and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. Enterococcal strains were cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) at 37 °C without aeration. Escherichia coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth (Sigma) at 37 °C with aeration. 1.5% (w/v) agar (Difco) was used to solidify media when needed, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin (Sigma) was added to E. coli cultures harboring pGEX-5X-3 constructs. For analysis of RNase B hydrolysis during growth, enterococci were grown at 37 °C for 24 h in 0.5× chemically defined medium originally developed for S. pyogenes (20van de Rijn I. Kessler R.E. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 444-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.5× PBS and 0.5 mg/ml human RNase B (Sigma).

Open table in a new tab Recombinant Expression of EndoE—EndoE and EndoEα were expressed in E. coli using the GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Biosciences). A 2,529-bp ndoE PCR product was amplified from E. faecalis HER1044 genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers 5′-TGA-TCA-GGA-TCC-CCA-ATG-AGC-CGA-3′ with a BamHI site (underlined) and 5′-CTC-GAG-CTA-GTG-ATT-TTT-AAC-CAC-CAT-3′ with an XhoI site (underlined). A 1,313-bp ndoEα PCR product was amplified using the same primer with BamHI site as above and primer 5′-TGT-TTG-CTC-GAG-TTA-TAA-ATT-ATC-3′ with an XhoI site (underlined). These PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen); the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) was transformed, and plasmid was prepared using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Plasmid preparations were digested with BamHI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and separated on 1% TAE-agarose gels followed by gel purification of excised fragments using Ultrafree-DA spin column (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Purified fragments were ligated into BamHI- and XhoI-digested plasmid pGEX-5X-3 generating plasmids pGEXndoE and pGEXndoEα that were used to transform E. coli NovaBlue (Novagen, Madison, WI). Transformants were induced using 0.1 mm β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and bacteria were lysed using BugBuster reagent and Benzonase nuclease mix (Novagen). The fusion proteins GST-EndoE and GST-EndoEα were purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and GST was removed using factor Xa according to the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Biosciences). Residual factor Xa was removed by affinity chromatography by using Xarrest-agarose (Novagen). Recombinant EndoS was purified as described previously (21Collin M. Olsén A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7187-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutation of Glu-186 and Glu-662 of EndoE into Gln was performed using QuickChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (mutations underlined) used were 5′-TGG-GTT-AGA-TAT-TGA-CAT-GCA-AAC-TCG-TCC-AAG-TGA-AAA-AG-3′ for E186Q and 5′-TTC-AAT-TTTGGT-GGC-GAT-CAG-TAT-GCA-AAT-GAT-GTC-GAC-3′ for E662Q in combination with the antisense of the above sequences and the plasmid pGEXndoE. Mutations were verified by sequencing pGEXndoE(E186Q) and pGEXndoE(E186Q). Recombinant EndoE(E186Q) and EndoE (E662Q) were expressed and purified as described above. SDS-PAGE and Lectin Blot Analysis—For analysis of glycosidase activity, 10 μg of human IgG or RNase B (Sigma) was incubated with 1 μg of purified EndoE, EndoEα, and EndoS or 1 unit of N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) (Sigma) in a total volume of 20 μl of PBS for 16 h at 37 °C. IgG samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and RNase B samples on 15% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. For lectin blot analysis, proteins were blotted to Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore) according to Towbin et al. (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated GNL lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After washing in TBST, membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Vector Laboratories). After washing, membranes were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and exposed on Blue Bio Film (Denville Scientific, Metuchen, NJ). For estimation of the rate of hydrolysis for EndoE, 1 nm IgG-Fc or RNase B was incubated with dilutions (125 ng to 8 μg) of EndoE for 20 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and spot densitometry using an Alpha Imager 2200 Documentation and Analysis System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Denaturation of IgG and RNase B—For analysis of EndoE on partially or fully denatured substrate proteins, 10 μg of IgG in 10 μl of PBS was incubated at 37, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C for 30 min followed by equilibration at 37 °C. Subsequently, 1 μg of EndoE in 10 μl of PBS was added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. RNase B (10 μg) was denatured by incubation in 20 μl of PBS for 2 min at 90 °C in the presence of 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.5% SDS as described by Chu (23Chu F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cooling to 37 °C, 1 μg of EndoE was added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by analysis on 15% SDS-PAGE. PCR Analysis of Enterococcal Strains—To investigate the presence of the ndoE gene in enterococcal isolates, single colonies from enterococci grown on Todd-Hewitt agar were boiled in 1× PCR buffer followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants (1 μl) were used as template in a standard PCR using AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an annealing temperature of 48 °C and oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATG-AAC-GGA-GTG-CAG-AAA-GGA-3′ and 5′-TTT-AAC-CAC-CAT-ATA-CTC-ACG-ATA-3′. These primers generated a 2505-bp product covering the whole ndoE gene from HER1044. Samples were separated on 1% TAE-agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Generation of Antibodies and Western Blots—For generation of polyclonal mouse antiserum, 200 μg of EndoE was incubated with 50 μl of 2% Alu-Gel-S suspension (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspension of pellet in 200 μl of sterile PBS. At day 1, 100 μl of the suspension were injected subcutaneously in BALB/C mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). At day 14 mice were boosted with an additional 100 μl of suspension. At day 24, mice were sacrificed and bled followed by serum preparation using standard protocols. Reactivity against purified EndoE was tested by Western blots (data not shown). For Western blot analysis of EndoE secretion from enterococcal isolates, cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min followed by precipitation of proteins in supernatants by using a final concentration of 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% (w/v) skim milk (PBSTS), followed by incubation with 1:5,000 of EndoE antiserum in PBSTS, washing in PBST, incubation with 1:2,000 of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish-peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and development using chemiluminescence as described above. Sequence Alignments, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Homology Modeling—All protein alignments and phylogenetic analyses were performed using the MacVector™ 7.1.1 sequence analysis software suite (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Protein sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm. Alignments were used for reconstruction of phylogenetic trees by using the neighbor-joining method, ignoring gaps and with uncorrected p values. The trees were validated using bootstrap analysis (1,000 repetitions), and consensus trees were generated. A structure model of the FGH18 domain of EndoE was constructed using Geno3D automated homology modeling (geno3d-pbil.ibcp.fr) (24Combet C. Jambon M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This method involves a PSI-BLAST (25Muller A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) search, selection of Protein Data Bank entries as templates, and calculation of agreement of secondary structure (26Geourjon C. Combet C. Blanchet C. Deleage G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); distances and dihedral angle restraints are calculated from the alignment and applied onto the query sequence followed by analysis using the CNS software (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). A model of amino acids 119-250 from EndoE was generated by using a chitinase from the fungus Coccidioides immitis (Protein Data Bank 1D2K) (28Hollis T. Monzingo A.F. Bortone K. Ernst S. Cox R. Robertus J.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as a template. Models were edited, and figures were created by using 3D-Mol (component of Vector NTI, Informax, Frederick, MD). Mass Spectroscopy—For mass analysis, 500 μg of RNase B or human IgG Fc fragments (Sigma) were incubated with 1 μg of EndoE, 1 μg of EndoS, or 10 units of PNGaseF (Sigma) in PBS for 16 h. Samples were desalted on a HiTrap Desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). IgG-Fc samples were reduced with a final concentration of 20 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were analyzed on reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE to verify cleavage and reduction of IgG-Fc. 1 μl of samples was spotted onto a sample plate. 1 μl of saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fisher) in 50% acetonitrile (Burdick and Jackson, Muskegon, MI) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma) was deposited on top, and the mixture was allowed to air-dry. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE RP equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Mass spectra were obtained in positive ion mode with an acceleration voltage of 25 kV, grid voltage of 88.0%, and delay time of 300 ns and averaged over 256 laser shots. Spectra were calibrated with RNase B or bovine serum albumin. Identification of a Putative Endoglycosidase in E. faecalis—The amino acid sequence of the IgG-hydrolyzing endoglycosidase EndoS (GenBank™ accession number AAK00850) from S. pyogenes strain AP1 (17Collin M. Olsén A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3046-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) was used as a probe to search the bacterial genomes by using the comprehensive microbial resource Blast at www.tigr.org. This resulted in one significant hit (p value of 4.0 × 10-7) in the recently published genome sequence of E. faecalis V583, a vancomycin-resistant isolate harboring the vanB resistance gene (3Paulsen I.T.

The corresponding open reading frame encodes an 835-amino acid protein annotated as a β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GenBank™ accession number NP_813917). Oligonucleotide primers constructed from the corresponding DNA sequence were used to amplify and clone a homolog from the E. faecalis strain HER1044. Sequencing of this gene revealed an open reading frame encoding an 838-amino acid protein that is 99% identical to the predicted β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from V583. The sequences of the protein (denoted EndoE for endoglycosidase of Enterococcus), and the corresponding gene ndoE, have been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY376354. When the EndoE sequence was analyzed using the SignalP web server for predicting signal sequence cleavage sites at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/(30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar), it was predicted that the first 55 amino acids constitute a signal peptide with a signal peptidase cleavage site. After removal of the signal peptide, the mature EndoE protein has a predicted size of 88 kDa. EndoE Belongs to Both Family 18 and 20 of Glycosyl Hydrolases by Similarity—To further analyze the primary sequence of EndoE, a conserved domain search was performed at the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. This revealed that the carboxyl-terminal portion of EndoE contains a conserved N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase region belonging to FGH20s according to Henrissat (7Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region contains no putative conserved domains, but when EndoE was analyzed for protein patterns present in the Prosite data base at us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/scanprosite, a perfect FGH18 motif (7Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar) was identified. Moreover, when the EndoE sequence was aligned with that of EndoS (the IgG glycan hydrolase from S. pyogenes used to identify EndoE), it was apparent that the similarity was confined to the amino-terminal regions of both proteins including the conserved FGH18 motif (Fig. 1A). The carboxyl-terminal domain instead is highly similar to another FGH20 endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from S. pneumoniae (Fig. 1B). This pneumococcal enzyme has activity on human glycoproteins and has a predicted role in virulence (13Clarke V.A. Platt N. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8805-8814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on these similarities, we proposed a two-domain model for EndoE composed of a 391-amino acid FGH18 α-domain and a 392-amino acid FGH20 β-domain (Fig. 1C), and we hypothesized that the two domains might provide two distinct glycosyl hydrolase activities on host glycoproteins. EndoE Is Closely Related to Hexosaminidases and Chitobiases from Mammals—Enzymes belonging FGH20 (N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidases or hexosaminidases for short) are highly conserved, and evidence for a common evolutionary origin has been presented. For example a hexosaminidase from Vibrio vulnificus has been shown to be closely related to a human hexosaminidase (31Somerville C.C. Colwell R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6751-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The β-domain of EndoE was aligned with FGH20 hexosaminidases from the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio harveyi, S. pneumoniae, Lactococcus lactis, and Lacto-bacillus casei; the fungus Candida albicans; the silkworm Bombyx mori; the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica; and the mammals Homo sapiens (HexA and B) and Felix catus. This alignment was used to construct a phylogenetic tree. This analysis (Fig. 2A) showed that EndoEβ is clustered in a group with bacterial enzymes of L. casei, L. lactis, and S. pneumoniae. Most interesting, this group is in turn closely clustered with the enzymes from mammals (human and cat) and more distantly related to enzymes from Vibrio spp. This suggests that the FGH20 β-domain of EndoE has a common origin with hexosaminidases from mammals, including humans. The α-domain of EndoE was aligned with FGH18 homologs from the bacteria F. meningosepticum (EndoF1-3 and EndoH) (9Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3046-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (CP40, originally described as a serine proteinase but contains a perfect FGH18 motif) (35Wilson M.J.

When constructing a phylogenetic tree from this alignment, EndoEα was grouped together with the mammalian homologs, whereas all the other bacterial proteins were in a distinct group separated from the mammalian proteins (Fig. 2B). This suggests that EndoEα is more closely related to the mammalian FGH18s (di-N-acetylchitob"

This pest not only affects plants by sucking on the phloem, but it also transmits single-stranded RNA luteoviruses while feeding, which cause disease and damage in the crop. The mannose-binding Allium sativum (garlic) leaf lectin has been found to be a potent control agent of L. erysimi. The lectin receptor protein isolated from brush border membrane vesicle of insect gut was purified to determine the mechanism of lectin binding to the gut. Purified receptor was identified as an endosymbiotic chaperonin, symbionin, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Symbionin from endosymbionts of other aphid species have been reported to play a significant role in virus transmission by binding to the read-through domain of the viral coat protein. To understand the molecular interactions of the said lectin and this unique symbionin molecule, the model structures of both molecules were generated using the Modeller program. The interaction was confirmed through docking of the two molecules forming a complex. A surface accessibility test of these molecules demonstrated a significant reduction in the accessibility of the complex molecule compared with that of the free symbionin molecule. This reduction in surface accessibility may have an effect on other molecular interactive processes, including “symbionin virion recognition”, which is essential for such symbionin-mediated virus transmission. Thus, garlic leaf lectin provides an important component of a crop management program by controlling, on one hand, aphid attack and on the other hand, symbionin-mediated luteovirus transmission.

The homopteran pest Lipaphis erysimi, commonly known as the mustard aphid, causes major damage to oil seed crops. These aphids affect the growth of the plant by sucking on the plant sap, and while feeding, they also transmit disease-causing luteoviruses to the host plant in a non-replicating and circulative manner. The aphid species is capable of transmitting viruses such as barley yellow dwarf virus, potato leaf roll virus, and bean leaf roll virus, which are commonly known as plant luteoviruses and belong to the family Luteoviridae. They are phloem-limited, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that are strictly dependent on aphids as vectors for their transmission from plant to plant (1Filichkin S.A. Brumfield S.

The plant-aphid-virus interaction is highly specific for all three components (plant, aphid, and virus). Control of aphids using transgenic plants has been suggested as an alternative to pesticide spray. To date, the only commercial insect-resistant transgenic plants are those expressing genes from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis encoding insecticidal crystal proteins (Bt-toxins) (5Barton K.

Additionally, the brush border membrane vesicle (BBMV 1The abbreviations used are: BBMV, brush border membrane vesicle; RTD, read-through domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: BBMV, brush border membrane vesicle; RTD, read-through domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry.) of L. erysimi gut epithelial cells responsible for its binding to the lectin have been purified by ligand blot analysis (16Bandyopadhyay S. Roy S. Das S. Plant. Sci. 2001; 161: 1025-1033Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the specific ligand-positive ∼56 kDa receptor protein of ASAL, purified from L. erysimi, was characterized and identified as a symbionin protein (SymL) belonging to the Cpn 60 class of insect chaperonins, which is evolutionarily related to the Escherichia coli GroEL protein. Such SymL protein has been reported previously to be coded by a mutualistic intracellular symbiotic bacteria, Buchnera aphidicola. It resides in a specialized tissue of the insect gut, which supplies several essential amino acids to aphids that they do not get from plant sap (18Douglas A.E. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). This SymL also binds to the read-through domain (RTD) of the coat protein of the single-stranded virus particles located in the hemocoel and escorts them to the salivary gland and finally helps the viruses to be transmitted to different plants while the aphids feed on them (1Filichkin S.A. Brumfield S. Filichkin T.P. Young M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 569-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Eskandari F. Sylvester E.S. Richardson J.

The L. erysimi symbionin described here establishes a unique oligosaccharide-mediated binding affinity with ASAL. The bioinformatics approach further indicates that the above binding may elicit changes in surface accessibility of symbionin leading to its inactivation of the luteovirus RTD binding ability thus reducing the incidence of viral transmission from one plant to another. Mustard aphids (L. erysimi) were obtained from our institutional experimental farm and maintained on live mustard plants or artificial diets. Mannose-binding garlic leaf lectin (ASAL) has been purified from the leaves of garlic grown in the same experimental farm. All reagents and chemicals used were of analytical grade. Isolation of Aphid Brush Border Membrane Vesicle—Approximately 1000 aphids fed with a sublethal dose of ASAL were dissected, and the excised midguts were suspended in insect ringer solution (0.65% NaCl, 0.25% KCl, 0.03% CaCl2). The BBMV was isolated from the excised midgut suspension by differential precipitation of the luminal epithelium of the insect midgut with the addition of 12 mm MgCl2 salt as reported earlier (16Bandyopadhyay S. Roy S. Das S. Plant. Sci. 2001; 161: 1025-1033Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Ligand Blot Assay of Total BBMV Protein-—The total BBMV protein was dissolved in 1% sodium deoxycholate and ∼5 μg each were separated onto duplicate lanes using 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, one of the lanes was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, whereas the other was transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-C (Amersham Biosciences) membrane in a Hoeffer submerged electroblot apparatus. The membrane was transiently stained with Ponceau-S (Sigma). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was incubated with 2 nm ASAL solution for 1 h and subjected to ligand blot analysis challenging with ASAL polyclonal antibody. Purification of the Major Receptor Protein—Approximately 100 μl (∼ 0.8-1 mg) of total aphid BBMV protein extract was separated using 12% SDS-PAGE along with protein molecular weight standards in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean III electrophoresis module. The marker lane, together with 3-4 mm of the preparative lane, was excised and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A doublet of two bands, resolving closely in the range of 56 kDa was excised after aligning with the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained molecular weight standard. The proteins were electroeluted from the gel piece using an Atto electroelution apparatus (Atto Corp.). The electroeluted sample was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, and the resulting SDS-free protein sample was lyophilized to dryness and subjected to ligand blot assay as described earlier. The proteins were further separated using 10% preparative SDS-PAGE with a longer run time for better resolution of the two protein bands of the doublet. The upper band, with a higher sensitivity to ASAL, was again purified by electroelution and analyzed in an TSK G3000SW HPLC gel filtration column with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, as the running buffer. Two-dimensional PAGE Analysis of the Receptor Protein—The electroeluted proteins were additionally separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II Isoelectric focusing unit using carrier ampholytes (3Young M.J.

The extracted peptides were analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a magic C-18 100-μm × 10-cm HPLC column (Spectronex) connected online to an ion trap Finnigan DecaXP (Thermo Finnigan). A linear gradient from 5 to 50% buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile in H2O) in buffer A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile in H2O) was delivered with a Rheos 2000 HPLC system (Flux) at 100 μl/min for 30 min. A precolumn flow splitter reduced the flow to ∼300 nl/min, and the peptides were manually loaded with a 10-μl Hamilton syringe on a captrap (Michrom BioResources) mounted in the injection loop of the mass spectrometer. The eluting peptides were ionized by electrospray ionization and detected, and the individual ions were automatically selected and fragmented in the ion trap. Ten peptide fragments have been sequenced. Individual MS/MS spectra and derived sequence information of peptide fragments were compared using the program Turbo-Sequest (20Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar) against the combined Swissprot (40.28) and Trembl (21.7) protein sequence data bases. Glycoprotein-specific Staining of BBMV Protein—The proteins extracted from the total mustard aphid BBMV by dissolving in 1% sodium deoxycholate were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE and stained specifically for covalently bound oligosaccharides according to the methods of Moller and Poulsen (21Moller H.J. Poulsen J.H. Walker J.M. Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 627-632Google Scholar). This method involves periodic acid oxidation of the fixed proteins in SDS-PAGE, staining with Alcian blue and subsequent silver enhancement staining at high temperatures to specifically stain the glycoproteins. Finally the stain was developed with 2.5% sodium carbonate for 30-60 s. The staining profile was recorded, and the gel was further stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue according to standard procedures to stain the total proteins including the non-glycosylated ones. Competitive Inhibition of ASAL-receptor Interaction in Presence of Mannose and Ligand Blot Analysis after Deglycosylation of the Receptor—Total aphid BBMV proteins, dissolved in 1% sodium deoxycholate and dialyzed, were run on two separate 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and both of these were transferred onto Hybond-C membranes and marked as “A” and “B.” The ligand blot analysis mentioned above was performed on two membranes, one modification was introduced for membrane B wherein 1 nm ASAL pre-incubated with 1 m α-d-mannose was used instead of “only ASAL.” After this point, the ligand blot analysis was carried out on both the membranes as mentioned earlier (16Bandyopadhyay S. Roy S. Das S. Plant. Sci. 2001; 161: 1025-1033Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Likewise, ligand blot assays both in the presence and absence of α-d-mannose were carried out with the purified ∼56-kDa receptor protein also. In another experiment, 5 μg of total BBMV proteins of L. erysimi was deglycosylated, using the N-glycosidase F deglycosylation kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the protocol described in the kit manual and analyzed using ligand blot to check the response of deglycosylated receptor to ASAL. Building of the Model of ASAL and SymL—The nucleotide sequence of ASAL was obtained from the NCBI data base (Accession number U58947) and translated in silico using the translation tool at the Swiss Bioinformatics Server (ExPASy.ch). The 110 amino acid sequence thus obtained, represented a single subunit of the protein and was used for building the model of ASAL. The three-dimensional coordinates of the template structure, 1KJ1 (22Ramachandraiah G. Chandra N. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Acta Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 414Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (rscb.org/PDB/) (23Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodjers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8136) Google Scholar). The coordinates of chain A were used for the purpose. The amino acid sequence of SymL was obtained from the NCBI Entrez data base (Accession number AAK52957, B. aphidicola (Myzus persicae)), and the three-dimensional coordinates of its template structure, 1GRL (24Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert O.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. The comparative homology modeling was done using the program Modeller (25Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar). Energy minimizations were carried out by 4000 cycles of conjugate gradient using the consistent valence force field in a Silicon Graphics R4600 work station using the program Discover (Biopsy Technologies, San Diego, CA). The integrity and quality of the models were assessed using the program Procheck (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), which also generated the Ramachandran plot of the models. Addition of the Oligosaccharide Unit to the SymL Model—On closer inspection of the amino acid sequence of the symbionin protein, two asparagine-linked glycosylation signatures, Asn133-Lys134-Ser135 and Asn534-Ser535-Ser536, were found. However, our modeling studies showed that the second signature remains buried into the quaternary structure of the tetradecameric SymL; hence, the first signature sequence was chosen as the possible glycosylation site. A consensus oligosaccharide moiety, (GlcNac)2(Man)7, was obtained from the NMR solution structure of human Cd2 protein available in the Protein Data Bank (23Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodjers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8136) Google Scholar) under the code name 1GYA (27Wyss D.F. Choi J.S. Li J. Knoppers M.H. Willis K.J. Arulanandam A.R. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.H. Wagner G. Science. 1995; 269: 1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This oligosaccharide moiety was covalently added to the Asn133 position of the modeled SymL using the program Insight-II (Biosym Technologies) on a silicon graphics R4600 work station. The resultant Protein Data Bank coordinate file was named sm.pdb Docking of Glycosylated SymL with ASAL—The modeled structure of ASAL (ligand) was docked into the active site of its receptor SymL using the program Gramm (28Katchaski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Einstein M. Friesen A.A. Aflalo C. Vasker I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 29Vasker I.A. Aflalo C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) on a PC-LINUX work station. The experiment generated 4-5 good models, and the best model was chosen based on its energy rankings. The quality of the docked model was verified using the program Procheck, and Ramachandran plots were generated. The values of the accessible surface area for both the native protein (sm.pdb; SymL) and the ligand-bound protein were calculated using the homology module of the Insight-II program. The differences in accessible surface area between native SymL (sm.pdb) and the docked complex (smgl-asal) was calculated for every residue using Insight-II. The schematics were rendered using the program MolScript (30Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Identification of the BBMV Receptors by Ligand Binding Assay—Aphid BBMV protein was separated by SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The total protein profile was monitored by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1A). The ligand binding receptor was identified on Hybond-C membrane as an ∼56-kDa protein, as shown in Fig. 1B. Separation of Individual Receptors by Two-dimensional PAGE—On further analysis using 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and isoelectric focusing (Fig. 2B), the protein was split into a doublet with two bands interacting with ASAL. The higher molecular weight protein was further analyzed using two-dimensional PAGE (Fig. 2C) and subsequent ligand blot analyses were repeated (Fig. 2D). The receptor was further verified by HPLC as a single peak shown in Fig. 2E. Identification of the Purified Receptor Protein—The tryptic peptides of the two-dimensional PAGE-isolated receptor protein were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Fig. 3A shows the base peak chromatogram of the LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic digest of the protein. The derived sequence information of the peptide fragments was compared using Turboseqest 36, and the receptor protein had been identified as 57,885-Da E. coli GroEL-related molecular chaperonin symbionin from Buchnera aphidicola (Swissprot identifier Q93T48). The peptide sequences are depicted in Fig. 3B. Characterization of the Receptor as Glycoprotein—The glycoprotein-specific staining revealed that the active receptor is a glycoprotein. In the staining protocol using 2.5% Na2CO3, glycoproteins lit up within 30 s and the non-glycosylated proteins remained unstained within this brief exposure time. Further Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel could detect all glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins (Fig. 4A showing only the stained glycoproteins in lane 1 compared with Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained total BBMV proteins, lane 2). From the results, it is evident that the ligand-positive ∼56-kDa receptor protein is glycosylated. Ligand Blot Assay of the Receptor after Deglycosylation and Mannose Inhibition—The results of the ligand binding experiments carried out with total BBMV and deglycosylated BBMV established that the ligand binding ability of the receptor is abolished after deglycosylation (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Subsequent mannose-inhibition assays of the ligand blot analysis of total L. erysimi BBMV proteins (Fig. 4C) and purified receptor protein (Fig. 4D) were carried out where the ASAL probe was presaturated with excess α-d-mannose prior to the ligand blot analysis. In fact, under these conditions ASAL did not bind to the receptors (Fig. 4, C and D, lane 2 in each), although it bound to the receptors in the absence of α-d-mannose (Fig. 4, C and D, lane 1 in each). This result clearly indicates that the binding of ASAL to the receptor in the insect midgut takes place at N-linked mannosylated oligosaccharide and is dependent upon the mannose-binding capacity of the lectin. Deglycosylation of the BBMV protein was seen to diminish the interaction of the two proteins to a large extent, thereby reiterating a lectin-glycoprotein interaction in the case of the ASAL and BBMV receptors. However, no mobility shift was apparent in SDS-PAGE analysis of the ∼56-kDa receptor band even after the deglycosylation reaction. Molecular Interaction between ASAL and SymL Models—The docked smgl-asal (SymL-ASAL) complex is shown in Fig. 5. The docked model, when analyzed critically, showed the interaction between the mannose molecules Man554 and Man557 of SymL with respective ASAL residues Gln90, Asp92, Asn94, Val96 Asp60, Asn62, and Val64 as shown in Table I, the schematic representation of which is depicted in Fig. 6A. The ASAL residues interacting here satisfy the mannose binding domain of the garlic lectins as reported earlier in the case of garlic bulb lectin, ASA (20Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, however, we also found that a few main-chain residues, Gln432, Gln436, Gln436, and Arg118 of SymL, formed hydrogen bonds with Tyr97, Ser99, Asp100, and Ile101 residues of ASAL (Table I and Fig. 6B). Table II summarizes the two types of interactions mentioned above.Table ITable shows the interaction of the mannose residues with the ASAL residues (left two columns) and the main-chain interaction between the residues of ASAL and SymL (right two colums)Mannose atomsASAL residueASALSymLMan557Gln90Tyr97Gln432Asp92Asn94Ser99Gln436Val96Asp100Gln436Man554Asp60Asn62Ile101Arg118Val64 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6Molecular interactions of ASAL and SymL.

The reduced accessibility was envisaged in the residues of SymL that are responsible for the possible interaction with other potential molecules (RTD domain of virions) depicted in Fig. 7. In other words, the binding of ASAL to the SymL receptor covers up a certain area of the surface of the receptor, making that area sterically inaccessible to solvents or other molecules e.g. viral RTD. L. erysimi, commonly known as the mustard aphid, affects plants by transmitting luteoviruses while sucking on the phloem sap and causing interference with the growth and development of plants. After determining the efficacy of ASAL on our target aphid, L. erysimi, we extended our efforts to investigate the binding affinity of ASAL to the insect gut. The total BBMV was isolated from the L. erysimi gut, and the specific ligand-positive receptor of ASAL was identified. The receptor was further analyzed and, interestingly, identified as a symbionin (SymL) protein. The SymL protein is coded by a bacterial endosymbiont of the aphid. It is known from earlier reports that various aphid species, e.g. M. persicae, carry a prokaryote called B. aphidicola within their body, which is known to have had a symbiotic association with aphids for the last 160-280 million years (1Filichkin S.A.

Biol. 2000; 10: 866-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The aphids carry these primary symbionts and there are various attributes associated with their long association. The prolonged association of Buchnera and the aphids has resulted in a massive reduction in the genome size of the former. The Buchnera genome is only 641 kb, in comparison to its closest non-symbiotic relative E. coli (4.6 Mb) (33Silva F.J. Latorre A. Moya A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 615-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Buchnera is localized in the aphid hemocoel in a specialized organelle called mycetocytes. The benefits of the association are strictly nutritional, i.e. aphids obtain certain essential amino acids from the bacterium, which over-expresses them in the plasmids recruited for the purpose, and in return the bacterium obtains most of its housekeeping requirements from the aphid hosts (18Douglas A.E. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 31Douglas A.E. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 1997; 24: 1-9Crossref Google Scholar) The importance of the study of symbionin (SymL) in aphids has increased in the last two decades, because it was found to be involved in virus transmission. Symbionin is the protein that escorts the virion to the aphid salivary gland. In fact, symbionin is recognized by the luteovirus particle, which has a minor capsid protein, the RTD, exposed on the virion capsid. The bound virion-SymL complex passes through the midgut epithelial membrane into the aphid hemocoel by a mechanism as yet unknown and enters the accessory salivary gland of the aphid, which is speculated to be a receptor-mediated endoexocytosis. The virion is known to concentrate itself in the accessory salivary gland of the host until it is released into the phloem of a healthy plant during the next infestation cycle of the aphid (3Young M.J. Filichkin S.A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 346-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 4Van Den Heuvel J.F.J.M. Hogenhout S.A. Van Der Wilk F. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 71-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Van Den Heuvel J.F.J.M. Bruyere A. Hogenhout S.A. Zeigler-Graff V. Brault V. Verbeek M. Van Der Wilk F. Richards K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7258-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) The symbionin has been found to have extensive sequence homology (varies from aphid to aphid in the range of 80-92%) to the E. coli GroEL chaperonin. Both of them are also identical in terms of their quaternary association (35Morin S. Ghanim M. Zeidan M. Czosnek H. Verbeek M. Van Den Heuvel J.F.J.M. Virology. 1999; 256: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The present symbionin protein extracted from mustard aphid BBMV had been characterized as a glycoprotein using glyco-specific staining. Its binding affinity for ASAL had already been established using ligand blot analyses. Because ASAL is a mannose-binding protein, ASAL-SymL binding should be mannose-mediated. In agreement with this theory, deglycosylation of the BBMV proteins was seen to diminish the interaction of the two proteins considerably, thereby reiterating a lectin-glycoprotein interaction in the case of the ASAL and SymL molecules. However, no mobility shift was apparent in SDS-PAGE analysis of the ∼56-kDa receptor band even after the deglycosylation reaction. Moreover, SymL responded negatively to the ligand reaction when ASAL presaturated with α-d-mannose was used as the ligand. From these results, it can be predicted that the binding of ASAL to the receptor in the insect midgut is probably dependent on its capacity to bind to the exposed mannose unit(s) of the receptor. Additionally, the molecular aspect of the binding of the present SymL protein with luteovirus particles for its transmission onto the host plants was investigated using a bioinformatic approach. From the sequence information, it has been established that each monomer of SymL may be divided into three major domains: the equatorial, the intermediate, and the apical domain. The equatorial domain extends from the amino acid residues 1 to 135 and from 410 to the C-terminal end of the protein. Studies on the potato leaf roll virus have shown that in the SymL monomer, amino acid residues 1-121 and 409-474 come together to form a single potato leaf roll virus-RTD binding site (36Hogenhout S.A. Van Der Wilk F. Verbeek M. Goldbach R.W. Van Den Heuvel J.F.J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 358-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apical and intermediate domains, on the other hand, remain partially or fully buried into the bucket-like quaternary structure of the protein (36Hogenhout S.A. Van Der Wilk F. Verbeek M. Goldbach R.W. Van Den Heuvel J.F.J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 358-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The independent docking experiment with the SymL-RTD and the ASAL-SymL complex RTD gave new insight into the virus transmission ability of SymL when it remains bound with ASAL. The in silico model structure suggested that ASAL binds to the oligosaccharide unit attached to Asn133, which is situated on the equatorial domain of the SymL monomer. The mannose residues of the oligosaccharide moiety were found to interact with Gln90-Asp92-Asn94-Val96 and Asp60-Asn62-Val64 of two mannose binding domains of ASAL. This result corroborates the mannose binding domain defined earlier in the case of garlic bulb lectin, ASA (22Ramachandraiah G. Chandra N. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Acta Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 414Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ASAL also establishes contact involving the residues, Tyr97, Ser99, Asp100, and Ile101 with the side chains of SymL amino acid residues Gln432, Gln436, Gln436, and Arg118. Additionally, the interacting Arg residue Arg118 and Gln residues Gln432 and Gln436 of SymL fall at the defined RTD binding domain of the same (residue 1-121 and 409-474 coming together serves as RTD binding domain). Thus, the SymL-ASAL docked model probably fails to recognize the virion particle because of the unavailability of the amino acid residues essential for RTD binding, as reflected in the surface-accessibility calculation profiles of the amino acids of free SymL and the ASAL-SymL complex as shown in Fig. 7. The amino acid sequence analysis of the model structure of the SymL protein purified by us from the L. erysimi BBMV tissue envisaged the presence of a significant number of putative myristoylation signature sequences as well as exposing a hydrophobic patch between residues 502 and 522, which also supports the possibility of the SymL-virion complex coming into close association with the membrane and then passing on to the hemocoel for further transmission into plants. The detrimental effects of the lectins we have studied on the aphids and other homopteran insects (16Bandyopadhyay S. Roy S. Das S. Plant. Sci. 2001; 161: 1025-1033Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Roy A. Banerjee S. Majumder P. Das S. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have been absolute in moderately high doses (50 or 100 μg/ml). However, at lower doses, where mortality reaches 50%, the antagonistic effects of lectin in terms of a reduction of luteovirus transmission clearly would become significant. On the basis of these observations, it is envisaged that the developing transgenic crops, which would express this monocot mannose-binding lectin (ASAL), can efficiently control aphids and as a result, reduce the viral attack. In cases where the aphids may not be eliminated completely and the plants may encounter very low levels of aphid infestation upon consumption of the expressed lectin, it is predicted that they will lose their SymL-mediated virus transmission ability. Thus, lectins with such dual utility could serve as a powerful tool in an integrated pest management program. It remains elusive whether, indeed, the spread of the virus is reduced when aphids are exposed to ASAL expressed in transgenic plants.

During the photocycle the ethylene double bond in the chromophore (C-2=C-3) isomerizes from the trans-configuration to the cis-configuration (8Kort R. Vonk H. Xu X. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). 2The nomenclature of the chromophoric atoms is presented in Fig. 1B. This event triggers a reversible photocycle in which a number of spectroscopically distinct, short-lived intermediates have been identified, denoted I0 (λmax = 510 nm), pR (also denoted I1 or PYPL; λmax = 465 nm), and pB (also denoted I2 or PYPM; λmax = 355 nm) (9Meyer T.E.

These intermediates have been the subject of a number of crystallographic, NMR, and UV-visible/IR spectroscopic studies, which led to the following consensus structural model for the photocycle. I0 is formed from pG in picoseconds, during which the ethylene bond C-2=C-3 in the chromophore photoisomerizes, whereas the aromatic ring of the chromophore is kept in position in its hydrophobic pocket. The hydrogen bonds of O-4′ to Tyr42 and Glu46 are maintained, but the hydrogen bond of the chromophoric thioester oxygen (O-1) to the backbone nitrogen atom of Cys69 is disrupted, and O-1 moves to a hydrophobic pocket formed by five aromatic residues (12Ujj L.

Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13788-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A second red-shifted intermediate, pR, is formed from I0 in nanoseconds, during which O-1 is repositioned from its unfavorable hydrophobic environment to an as yet unknown or possibly undefined position (15Ren Z. Perman B. Srajer V. Teng T.Y. Pradervand C. Bourgeois D. Schotte F. Ursby T. Kort R. Wulff M. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13788-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Perman B.

Up to this time, the hydrogen-bonding network to the aromatic head of the chromophore remains preserved (17Brudler R. Rammelsberg R. Woo T.T. Getzoff E.D. Gerwert K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The blue-shifted intermediate, pB, is formed from pR in hundreds of microseconds. The residue Arg52, which shields the chromophore from the solvent, moves away from the chromophore-binding pocket disrupting the hydrogen bonds to the backbone O atoms of Tyr98 and Thr50 (18Genick U.K. Borgstahl G.E. Ng K. Ren Z. Pradervand C. Burke P.M. Srajer V. Teng T.Y. Schildkamp W. McRee D.E. Moffat K. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A further repositioning of O-1, during the recovery of the ground state pG, leads to the reformation of the hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogen atom of Cys69. The hydrogen bond between the O-4′ of the phenolic oxygen to Tyr42 and Glu46 is disrupted, and O-4′ becomes protonated. Furthermore, the chromophore swings out of the pocket to a strained, nonplanar conformation (18Genick U.K. Borgstahl G.E. Ng K. Ren Z. Pradervand C. Burke P.M. Srajer V. Teng T.Y. Schildkamp W. McRee D.E. Moffat K. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Finally, pG recovers from pB in hundreds of milliseconds by deprotonation of O-4′, reisomerization, and repositioning of the chromophore into its binding pocket and reformation of the dark state hydrogen-bonding network. Irradiation of PYP at <90 K leads to the formation of a photostationary state consisting of the dark state, a bathochromic (PYPB; λmax = 489 nm), and a hypsochromic intermediate (PYPH; λmax = 442 nm). Upon warming, these latter intermediates thermally convert to PYPBL (λmax = 400 nm) and PYPHL (λmax = 447 nm), respectively, and converge at temperatures higher than 193 K to PYPL (λmax = 456 nm) (11Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14047-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), as depicted in the low temperature photocycle scheme shown in Fig. 1A. The same branching reaction has not been observed in the early photocycle at room temperature (12Ujj L. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Atkinson G.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), although in a recent report the presence of a second early intermediate with lower extinction coefficient and spectral overlap with the ground state pG has been postulated (13Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Asahi T. Masuhara H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6047-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The low temperature intermediates PYPB and PYPL were proposed (12Ujj L.

Tokunaga F. Kinoshita T. Yoshihara K. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8997-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to be analogous to the room temperature intermediates I0 and pR, although the absorption maxima of the latter intermediates are slightly more red-shifted. No large protein conformational changes appear to take place in the room temperature transition from the dark state to pR as indicated by Fourier transform infrared in solution (17Brudler R. Rammelsberg R. Woo T.T. Getzoff E.D. Gerwert K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (16Perman B. Srajer V. Ren Z. Teng T. Pradervand C. Ursby T. Bourgeois D. Schotte F. Wulff M. Kort R. Hellingwerf K. Moffat K. Science. 1998; 279: 1946-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The UV-visible absorption difference spectrum of pR-pG at room temperature appears virtually identical to that of PYPL-PYP at 193 K (11Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14047-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The difference Fourier transform infrared spectra of PYPB, PYPH, and PYPL minus PYP indicate that the major conformational changes in the early photocycle are restricted to the region around the C-2=C-3 bond (19Imamoto Y. Shirahige Y. Tokunaga F. Kinoshita T. Yoshihara K. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8997-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is likely that the low temperature branch from pG to PYPB, PYPBL, and PYPL involves similar conformational changes to those occurring during the conversions from pG to I0 and pR, although this has not been unambiguously proven (12Ujj L. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Atkinson G.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Ren Z. Perman B. Srajer V.

Tokunaga F. Kinoshita T. Yoshihara K. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8997-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A crystallographic analysis of a photocycle intermediate trapped at 150 K led to a model that showed a 80° double bond torsion angle between C-2=C-3, indicating that the isomerization reaction around this double bond is incomplete (20Genick U.K. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Canestrelli I.L. Getzoff E.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This intermediate was tentatively assigned to PYPBL (Fig. 1A) on the basis of a 400-nm shoulder in the absorption spectrum of the frozen PYP crystal. In a later theoretical study by the same group, the cryogenically trapped intermediate was reassigned to PYPB (21Thompson M.J. Bashford D. Noodleman L. Getzoff E.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8186-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Their current model for the photocycle holds that the C-2=C-3 bond in the chromophore isomerizes to a highly unfavorable orthogonal position (20Genick U.K. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Canestrelli I.L. Getzoff E.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this energetically unfavorable chromophore conformation is essential for the signaling activity of PYP (20Genick U.K. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Canestrelli I.L. Getzoff E.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Essen L.O. Oesterhelt D. Nature. 1998; 392: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23Getzoff E.D. Gutwin K.N. Genick U.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Does the chromophore-binding pocket of PYP have a unique configuration that has allowed the trapping of a double bond in an orthogonal position? To address this question we applied novel techniques that are of general importance for the structural elucidation of low occupancy reaction intermediates in x-ray crystallography. Radiation damage ought to be taken into account while studying detailed structural changes using the x-ray crystallography technique. The interaction of X-rays with the crystalline sample can result in structural changes because of either sample heating or radiation chemistry. Thorough theoretical calculations seem to indicate that sample heating is in general very small (24Kriminski S. Kazmierczak M. Thorne R.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, the structural effects caused by the generation of radicals within the crystal can be very substantial as shown in recent systematic studies (25Burmeister W.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 26Weik M. Ravelli R.B. Kryger G. McSweeney S. Raves M.L. Harel M. Gros P. Silman I. Kroon J. Sussman J.L. Proc.

Des. 2000; 8: 315-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These structural changes are observable before traditional markers such as the Wilson B factor, diffraction resolution, and crystal mosaicity show visible signs of x-ray damage (27Ravelli R.B. McSweeney S.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 315-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Matsui et al. (28Matsui Y. Sakai K. Murakami M. Shiro Y. Adachi S. Okumura H. Kouyama T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) showed that exposure of frozen (100 K) bacteriorhodopsin crystals to a relatively low x-ray flux converted nearly half of the protein into an orange species. They subsequently employed a data collection strategy that allowed them to study the the early bacteriorhopsin photocycle intermediate K with a reduced x-ray dose and only minor radiation damage. In contrast, in many other crystallographic studies of intermediates specific x-ray radiation damage was either overlooked or assumed irrelevant (20Genick U.K. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Canestrelli I.L. Getzoff E.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 23Getzoff E.D. Gutwin K.N. Genick U.K. Nat. Struct.

Science. 1999; 286: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The structural changes induced by radiation damage are in general very characteristic and reproducible. It is possible to correct for these differences (33Diederichs K. McSweeney S. Ravelli R.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or even to profit from them (34Berglund G.I. Carlsson G.H. Smith A.T. Szoke H. Henriksen A. Hajdu J.

Structure. 2003; 11: 217-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We recently reported on the photocycle of PYP in the crystalline state (36Kort R. Ravelli R.B. Schotte F. Bourgeois B. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. Wulff M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and showed that constant illumination of PYP crystals at cryogenic temperatures leads to a photostationary state of at least one hypsochromic and one bathochromic photoproduct that resemble PYPH and PYPB (11Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14047-14053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Imamoto Y. Shirahige Y. Tokunaga F. Kinoshita T. Yoshihara K. Kataoka M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8997-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Hoff W.D. Kwa S.L.S. Van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 529-539Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The effect of temperature, light color, and duration on the occupancy of the low temperature photoproducts was determined. The optimized conditions were subsequently used on the beamline to determine the structure of PYPB. It has been demonstrated by Brodersen et al. (38Brodersen D.E. de La Fortelle E. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that the modeling of multiple conformers could be strongly biased by the phases from the refined model. An example was shown using a 1.05 Å data set, where a second, 23% conformation could not be located in σA-weighted 2mFo - DFc or even mFo - DFc maps while using refined model phases. Experimental single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data, however, revealed the true identity of the second side chain conformation. Global indicators such as Rfree were not sensitive enough to catch errors caused by such low occupancy conformations (38Brodersen D.E. de La Fortelle E. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This conclusion is likely to hold equally well while refining low occupancy photointermediates. To avoid any possible model errors, we have used the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method on selenomethionine substituted crystals of PYP. Two MAD data series were collected: one of the protein in the ground state and one in the light-activated state. In addition control dark state data were used to correct the first two data series for specific radiation damage. The corrected data were used to obtain experimental phases. We show for the first time light-activated (difference) maps that have been calculated with experimental phases exclusively and have been deconvoluted from radiation damage. Crystallography is a powerful technique that can elucidate small, structural changes that occur in early photocycle intermediates. PYP has for long been a model compound for these studies, because of the superior diffraction behavior of its crystals. Nevertheless, dispute remains among crystallographers, quantum chemists, and spectroscopists about the very fine details of the first events upon photoabsorption. The aim of this study is to contribute toward a more unified picture of these early events by employing off-line spectroscopy, radiation damage correction, and experimental phasing. Overproduction and Crystallization of Selenomethionine-labeled PYP—Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled PYP was overproduced using an Escherichia coli M15/pHisp pREP4 strain (39Kort R. Hoff W.D. VanWest M. Kroon A.R. Hoffer S.M. Vlieg K.H. Crielaard W. Van Beeumen J.J. Hellingwerf K.J.

Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The substitution of methionine by SeMet was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to be ∼100% for all five methionines in the protein. We checked for effects on the kinetics of the recovery reaction of the dark state of purified SeMet-labeled PYP in solution, because it was postulated that the sulfur atom of Met100 catalyzes the reisomerization process in the photocycle (41Devanathan S. Genick U.K. Canestrelli I.L. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Getzoff E.D. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11563-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found a rate constant of 4.5 s-1, very similar to that observed for the recovery reaction of the unlabeled, recombinant, and native proteins (9Meyer T.E. Yakali E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 39Kort R. Hoff W.D. VanWest M. Kroon A.R. Hoffer S.M. Vlieg K.H. Crielaard W. Van Beeumen J.J. Hellingwerf K.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3209-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The SeMet protein crystallized in space group P63 under conditions nearly identical to those described for the native protein (42McRee D.E. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Parge H.E. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13850-13851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cryo-trapping and Single-crystal Microspectrophotometry—An offline microspectrophotometer (43Bourgeois D. Vernede X. Adam V. Fioravanti E. Ursby T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2002; 35: 319-326Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used to study the kinetics of PYP in the crystalline state. The primary photointermediate in the light cycle of PYP was trapped at 85 K by continuous exposure of crystals to blue light during x-ray diffraction data collection. The optimization of experimental conditions and the spectroscopic identification and estimation of the occupancy of photointermediates are reported elsewhere (36Kort R. Ravelli R.B. Schotte F. Bourgeois B. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. Wulff M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Blue light was selected from a 150-W halogen light source with a 80-nm band filter centered at 440 nm and guided to the crystal by two glass fibers. The temperature was regulated by an N2 gas stream from a 600 series Oxford Cryostream. The temperature at the position of the crystal was confirmed using a thermocouple, which measured a temperature between 4 and 9 K higher than that set at the Oxford controller (44Ravelli R.B. Theveneau P. McSweeney S. Caffrey M. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2002; 9: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Throughout the paper, the controller-set temperature is denoted. The pB state was populated at -12 °C to slow down the rate of recovery of the ground state of PYP. Excitation of the P63 crystal was carried out with a shutter-controlled 488-nm laser pulse of ∼1-s duration from a tunable Argon ion laser (Melles Griot). Light was guided to the reflective objective by a 600-μm-diameter optical fiber. The radius of the focused laser spot was 90 μm. The crystal was mounted in a cryoloop and protected from dehydration by soaking in paraffin oil (Hampton Research). The laser power at the sample position was 0.55 mW, as determined through a pinhole of 25-μm radius. Cryo-trapping of a late pB state was carried out by freeze-trapping the crystal. The presence and occupation of the late pB state in the crystal was confirmed by recording a spectrum after trapping (data not shown). Data Collection and Radiation Damage Correction—Experimental phases were obtained by the use of the MAD technique on crystals of SeMet-labeled PYP. Because of the low solvent content (31%) of the P63 crystals, a two-wavelength approach was chosen (inflection point and remote wavelength) to aid density modification procedures in solving the phase ambiguity that would have resulted from a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. A total of four data sets were collected for the low temperature intermediate study, two for the dark state and two for the photoactived state (Table I). A low resolution data set was collected at the inflection point (12.658 keV), whereas the high energy remote (13.200 keV) data set consisted of a low and high resolution sweep. The crystals of dimensions 160 × 80 × 80 μm3 diffracted to atomic resolution (Table I). All of the data were collected on the MAD beamline ID14–4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), whereas the synchrotron was operated in 16-bunch mode (∼⅓ of normal intensity). Severe attenuation (between 14- and 70-fold) was used to reduce radiation damage. The exposure time consisted of a few seconds/frame, and the data were collected to 1.2Å. The total absorbed dose for all four data sets, augmented by the increased absorption of the crystal caused by the presence of selenium atoms, was estimated with the aid of the program RADDOSE (45Murray J. Garman E. Ravelli R.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) to be about 2 × 106 Gγ.Table IDiffraction data and refinement statistics All data were collected on ID14-4 of the ESRF, Grenoble, France.

Paradoxically, arsenic has also been used, amid at low doses, in the treatment of leukemia for over a century. Here we demonstrate that low to moderate concentrations of arsenite (2-10 μm) that has little or no effect on normal melanocytes may induce apoptosis of human melanomas including highly metastatic ones despite their low surface Fas levels. The two prerequisites that dictate apoptotic response of melanomas upon arsenite treatment are low nuclear NF-κB activity and an endogenous expression of tumor necrosis factor α. Under these conditions, melanoma cells acquired sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor α-mediated killing. On the other hand, signaling pathways including those of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT, MEK-ERK, and JNK play a protective role against arsenite-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in melanoma cells. Suppression of these pathways dramatically accelerates arsenite-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data could provide potential approaches to sensitize melanomas to the cytotoxic effects of arsenite through modulating the signaling pathways.

Taken together, these data could provide potential approaches to sensitize melanomas to the cytotoxic effects of arsenite through modulating the signaling pathways. Arsenical compounds are environmental toxins with multiple effects in animal and human populations. Chronic low levels of exposure to arsenite (0.5-5 μm) may result in the induction of skin, lung, bladder, and kidney cancer (1Chen C.J. Chen C.W. Wu M.M. Kuo T.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Environmental arsenic contamination is a serious problem in some regions of the world. For example, almost 50 million people are at risk in Bangladesh where both chronic and acute arsenic poisoning as well as increased cancer incidence have been reported previously (2Liu S.X. Athar M. Lippai I. Waldren C. Hei T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Higher doses of arsenite (>5 μm) produce highly damaging effects in different tissues because of its induction of apoptosis and necrosis. Such dose-dependent effects in a tissue-specific manner have enabled arsenic to be used for the treatment of certain types of cancer including acute promyelocytic leukemia and multiple myelomas through the induction of programmed cell death (3Shen Z.X.

There are two important biochemical aspects of arsenite-mediated effects in the cell. (i) Arsenite acts as a sulfhydryl reagent that binds to the free thiol (-SH) group of enzymes and inhibits their functions (6Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). (ii) Arsenite induces production of reactive oxygen species at high levels with subsequent development of oxidative stress, which affects multiple targets in the cell (2Liu S.X. Athar M. Lippai I.

Simultaneously, as a consequence of oxidative stress, stress-induced kinase pathways (MKK6-MAPK p38, MKK4/7-JNK, and MEK-ERK1/2) up-regulate the AP-1 (Jun-Fos, Jun-ATF2) transcription factors and induce AP-1-dependent gene expression (15Cavigelli M.

Arsenic compounds may suppress STAT3 activation and dramatically change growth and survival of multiple myeloma cells (21Hayashi T. Hideshima T. Akiyama M. Richardson P. Schlossman R.L. Chauhan D.

Many therapeutic approaches including γ-irradiation and chemotherapeutic drug treatment have been proposed to reactivate apoptosis in cancer cells. Human malignant melanomas, an often deadly form of skin cancer due to the lack of effective treatment options, possess numerous genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that suppress apoptosis, which allows tumor survival after treatment (22Chin L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Soengas M.S. Lowe S.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3138-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 24Ivanov V.N.

In this study, we elucidated pro-apoptotic activities induced by arsenite in human melanomas and demonstrated that arsenite-mediated NF-κB inhibition and simultaneous endogenous expression of death receptor ligand TNFα (25Aggarwal B.B.

Normal human melanocytes were maintained in TICVA medium. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The luciferase reporter gene containing three GAF DNA-binding sequence elements from the Ly6E gene was described previously (32Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The NF-κB luciferase reporter containing two κB binding sites, Jun2-Luc reporter and vector thymidine kinase-Luc (33van Dam H. Huguier S. Kooistra K. Baguet J. Vial E. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P.

Transient transfection of different reporter constructs (0.5 μg) together with expression vectors (0.5 μg) and pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.25 μg) into 5 × 105 melanoma cells was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Proteins were prepared for β-galactosidase and luciferase analysis 16 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and was normalized based on β-galactosidase levels. Expression vectors encoding IKKβS178E/S181E (activator of NF-κB pathway) (38Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used as indicated. Treatment and Apoptosis Studies—Cells were exposed to arsenite (1-50 μm) in the medium for 6-48 h. Specific inhibitors of PI3K-AKT LY294002 (50 μm), of MEK-ERK PD98059 (50 μm) or U0126 (5 μm), of JNK SP600125 (10-20 μm), and of MAPK p38 SB203580 (5-10 μm) were used with or without 5-10 μm arsenite. Inhibitors were added to media 30 min before arsenite treatment. Antibodies against TNFα (BD Biosciences), FasL and TRAIL (Alexis, San Diego, CA), were added (1-5 μg/ml) 1 h before arsenite treatment. Apoptosis was assessed by quantifying the percentage of hypodiploid nuclei undergoing DNA fragmentation (40Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar) or by quantifying the percentage of Annexin V-FITC-positive cells (BD Biosciences). Flow-cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the CellQuest program. Resistance to Treatment—Cells (400/well) were placed in triplicate on 6-well plates 12 h before treatment. For analysis of clonogenic survival of melanoma cells after treatment (16 h) with arsenite alone or in the combinations with the specific inhibitors of signaling pathways, colonies were stained with crystal violet solution 10 days after treatment. The percentage of colony-forming efficiency (in relation to values of untreated control cells) was calculated. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates (50-100 μg of protein) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and processed according to standard protocols. The antibodies used were polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser73), anti-c-Jun, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-p44/42 MAPK, anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti-AKT, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-p38 MAPK, anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma) (optimal dilutions of Abs were 1:1000-1:10,000). The secondary Abs (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:5000-1:10,000). Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed for detection of NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity as described previously (41Ivanov V. Fleming T.J. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2394-2406PubMed Google Scholar) using labeled double-strand oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTGGGGACTTTCCAGCCG-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCG-3′, respectively (binding sites are underlined). Role of NF-κB in Arsenite-induced Apoptosis of Human Melanomas—The first step of our study was to find out how arsenite treatment affects apoptosis of human melanomas. We used low to moderate doses of arsenite (2-10 μm) that were successfully applied for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and multiple myelomas through induction of programmed cell death (3Shen Z.X. Chen G.Q. Ni J.H. Li X.S. Xiong S.M. Qiu Q.Y. Zhu J. Tang W. Sun G.L. Yang K.Q. Chen Y. Zhou L. Fang Z.W. Wang Y.T. Ma J. Zhang P. Zhang T.D. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Wang Z.Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 3354-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hayashi T. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 120: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Zhao W.L. Chen S.J. Shen Y. Xu L. Cai X. Chen G.Q. Shen Z.X. Chen Z. Wang Z.Y. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2001; 42: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that high doses of arsenite (100-200 μm) may induce different signaling pathways (42Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3053-3058PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle-apoptosis studies as well as routine morphological examinations revealed that melanocytes and early-phase (radial growth) melanomas WM35 and sBcl2 were resistant to arsenite (5-10 μm)-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). We used several additional lines of human melanomas at different phases of cancer development to further elucidate the effects of arsenite on induction of apoptosis. Melanoma cell lines responded differently to arsenite (10 μm) treatment. WM793 and FEMX cells developed apoptosis after 24 h of exposure, whereas other lines were relatively resistant to treatment (Fig. 1A). A correlation was observed between the relatively low basal levels of NF-κB (p65-p50) DNA binding/trans-acting activities in WM793 and FEMX cells (Fig. 1, C and D) and the strong apoptotic response following arsenite treatment (Fig. 1A). Transcription factor NF-κB controls expression of many genes with survival and anti-apoptotic functions (43Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Moderate to high basal levels of nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity were found in several melanomas (Fig. 1, B and C). Pretreatment of DNA-binding reactions with specific antibodies to the NF-κB subunits allowed the identification of two major bands, the classical p65-p50 and p50-p50 NF-κB complexes (Fig. 1B). The other NF-κB combinations were present in the nuclear fractions at substantially lower levels. Furthermore, arsenite treatment for 6 h additionally caused a substantial decrease in the nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity determined by EMSA for WM9, LU1205, FEMX, and WM793 cells (Fig. 1, B and C) and the corresponding decrease in trans-activation of the NF-κB-dependent promoter activities (Fig. 1D). In contrast, all of the melanoma cell lines examined have moderate to high basal levels of the AP-1-dependent activity (Jun2-Luc), which could be additionally increased after arsenite treatment (Fig. 1E). To determine whether NF-κB (p65-p50) activation restores cell resistance to arsenite treatment, we used immortalized normal human TIG-3 fibroblasts with high efficiency of transfection and WM793 melanoma cells. Both cell lines have low basal NF-κB (p65-p50) activity. Transfection of permanently active IKKβS178E/S181E (canonical activator of the NF-κB pathway) (38Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) in TIG-3 cells results in strong activation of NF-κB (p65-p50) (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, transfection and expression of super-repressor IκBαΔN (Fig. 2B) (39Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) caused suppression of basal NF-κB activity (Fig. 2C). TIG-3 cells transfected with NF-κB activator, IKKβS178E/S181E, possess increased resistance to arsenite treatment compared with the control cells (Fig. 2D), whereas NF-κB inhibitor, IκBαΔN, up-regulated arsenite-induced apoptosis in TIG-3 cells (Fig. 2D). Similarly, levels of arsenite-induced apoptosis were down-regulated in WM793 melanoma cells following transfection of permanently active IKKβS178E/S181E (Fig. 2, E, G, and F), whereas IκBαΔN up-regulated arsenite-induced apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 2, F-H). LU1205 metastatic melanoma with high basal levels of NF-κB activity was relatively resistant to arsenite-induced apoptosis at low or moderate concentrations of arsenite (Figs. 1A and 2F). Additionally, LU1205/IκBαΔN cells, which were stably transfected with super-repressor IκBαΔN (39Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were used. These cells possess a remarkably increased apoptotic response 24 h after arsenite treatment from 1 to 33% of apoptotic cells (data not shown) because of an acquired sensitivity to TNF-mediated killing. Hence, as a result of the suppression of basal NF-κB activity, both fibroblasts and melanoma cells can acquire increased sensitivity to arsenite-induced apoptosis, whereas reactivation of NF-κB may reduce levels of arsenite-induced apoptosis. Arsenite Induces TNFα-mediated Apoptosis in WM793 Early Melanoma Cells—Early melanoma WM793 cells demonstrated notable induction of Jun2-Luc, TNFα-, and TRAIL-promoter activities (but not FasL-promoter activity), which are parallel to the inhibition of NF-κB-dependent DNA binding and promoter activity (Fig. 3A) following arsenite (5 μm) treatment. Up-regulation of endogenous TNFα expression and suppression of NF-κB activity by arsenite created a canonical case for induction of TNFα-mediated apoptosis (12Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar, 45Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar). Indeed, these cells possess dose-dependent sensitivity to arsenite 24 and 48 h after treatment by developing apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Introduction of anti-TNFα-inhibitory Ab (5 μg/ml) but not anti-FasL or anti-TRAIL Abs into cell cultures partially suppressed arsenite-induced apoptosis in WM793 cells (Fig. 3C). Advanced apoptosis of WM793 cells (determined by counting cells with hypodiploid nuclear DNA levels) was also blocked by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3C) that illustrated an involvement of caspases, typical features of this process. Both Ac-IETD-CHO (an inhibitor of caspase-8 and caspase-6) and Ac-LEHD-CHO (an inhibitor of caspase-9) partially suppressed arsenite-induced apoptosis, indicating that both death receptor/caspase-8-mediated apoptotic cascade and mitochondrial caspase-9-dependent pathway operate during arsenite-induced apoptosis in WM793 melanoma cells (Fig. 3C). The combination of two caspase inhibitors had the same negative effect on apoptosis as Ac-IETD-CHO alone, indicating that caspase-8 and caspase-9 function in parallel. Beside NF-κB pathway, two other cell signaling pathways, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT, play critical roles in the general regulation of cell survival. Furthermore, MKK3/6-MAPK p38-ATF2 and MKK4/7-JNK-c-Jun signaling pathways may perform either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic functions depending of cell type, nature, and intensity of signaling (12Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar, 46Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of arsenite treatment (5 μm) is up-regulation of ERK1/2 activities in WM793 cells, which was suppressed by MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) (Fig. 4A). By contrast, no arsenite-induced AKT activation was observed in WM793 cells. Co-treatment of WM793 cells with arsenite and an inhibitor of PI3K-AKT, LY294002 (50 μm), additionally decreased low basal phospho-AKT levels (Fig. 4A). Total MAPK p38 and phospho-p38 levels were up-regulated after arsenite treatment (Fig. 4A). The 5-10 μm SB203580 (p38-ATF2 inhibitor) did not affect p38 phosphorylation but suppressed ATF2 phosphorylation/activation and Jun2-Luc reporter activity (data not shown). Well known activation of MKK7-JNK by arsenite treatment (15Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 18Bode A.M. Dong Z. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 42: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was observed in WM793 cells monitoring phosphorylation of c-Jun, the main target of JNK. An inhibitor of JNK, SP600125, partially suppressed c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). We evaluated the early apoptotic commitment of WM793 cells using Annexin V-FITC staining and FACS analysis (Fig. 4B). Notable levels of early apoptosis were detected after 6 h of 5 μm arsenite treatment. The percentage of late apoptotic cells (FITC+ PI+) increased after 12 h of treatment. In the presence of LY294002 or PD98059, development of apoptosis and secondary necrosis was also accelerated. Effects of SP600125 (not shown) and SB203580 on the early stages of arsenite-induced apoptosis were not well pronounced. By contrast, Z-VAD-fmk, a universal caspase inhibitor, effectively suppressed the progress of apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Finally, 24 h after treatment, we observed dramatic accelerating effects of LY294002 or PD98059 on arsenite-induced apoptosis in WM793 cells, whereas SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK) and SB203580 (inhibitor of MAPK p38) were less effective (Fig. 4C). U0126 (5 μm), an additional MEK1/2 inhibitor, was also very effective in the up-regulation of arsenite-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). These data convincingly demonstrated a protective role of the basal PI3K-AKT and inducible MEK-ERK activities against the development of arsenite-induced TNFα-mediated apoptosis of early melanoma WM793. Arsenite Induces TNFα-mediated Apoptosis in FEMX Metastatic Melanoma Cells—The common features of metastatic FEMX cells and early melanoma WM793 cells are low basal NF-κB activity (see Fig. 1C) and endogenous expression of TNFα (44Ivanov V.N. Fodstad O. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 47Krasilnikov M. Ivanov V.N. Dong J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4092-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Arsenite (5 μm) treatment up-regulated AP-1 DNA binding activity, AP-1-dependent (Jun2-Luc) reporter activity, and c-Jun phosphorylation, which was suppressed by 10 μm SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) (Fig. 5, A, B, and D). Up-regulation of TNFpr-Luc activity in FEMX cells after arsenite treatment could be suppressed by 5-10 μm SB203580 (Fig. 5D) via inhibition of MAPK p38-ATF2, a critical regulator of TNFα expression (48Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The effect of 10-20 μm SP600125 on the TNFα promoter activity was less pronounced (Fig. 5A). Up-regulation of TNFα expression took place in the context of substantial down-regulation of NF-κB activities by arsenite (see Fig. 1, C and D) that accelerated arsenite-induced apoptosis of FEMX cells. Furthermore, arsenite treatment (3 h) substantially up-regulated ERK activity, slightly increased AKT activity, and had modest positive effects on phospho-p38 levels in FEMX cells (Fig. 5C). Despite arsenite-induced activation of survival pathways, metastatic FEMX cells developed a rapid apoptotic response to arsenite, which was detected with Annexin V-FITC plus PI staining (Fig. 5E) or with cell cycle-apoptosis analysis (Fig. 6A).Fig. 6Arsenite treatment induces TNFα-mediated apoptosis in FEMX human metastatic melanoma.A, effects of LY294002 (50 μm) (LY), PD98059 (50 μm) (PD), U0126 (5 μm), and SP600125 (20 μm) (SP) on 10 μm arsenite-induced apoptosis in FEMX cells.

Combined treatment of FEMX cells with arsenite and SP600125 also caused a moderate acceleration of apoptosis, whereas SB203850 slightly suppressed apoptosis (Fig. 6A), probably via suppression of TNFα expression (Fig. 5D). A difference between FEMX and WM793 cells was linked with distinct effects of suppression of MAPK p38 on arsenite-induced apoptosis of these cells: modest positive effects for WM793 cells (see Fig. 4C) and slight negative effects for FEMX cells (Fig. 6A).

A relevant model of this process is provided by fibronectin, an important extracellular matrix protein that plays a key role in cell adhesion and migration and contains three alternatively spliced regions known as EDI, EDII, and IIICS. We used a cell culture system to simulate mammary epithelial-stromal communication, a process that is crucial for patterning and function of the mammary gland, and studied the effects of extracellular signals on the regulation of fibronectin pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We found that soluble factors from a mammary mesenchymal cell-conditioned medium, as well as the growth factors HGF/SF (hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor), KGF (keratinocyte growth factor), and aFGF (acidic fibroblast growth factor), stimulate EDI and IIICS but not EDII inclusion into fibronectin mRNA in the mammary epithelial cell line SCp2, favoring fibronectin isoforms associated with proliferation, migration, and tissue remodeling. We explored the signaling pathways involved in this regulation and found that the mammary mesenchymal cell-conditioned medium and HGF/SF act through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cascade to alter fibronectin alternative splicing. This splicing regulation is independent from promoter structure and de novo protein synthesis but does require two exonic elements within EDI. These results shed light on how extracellular stimuli are converted into changes in splicing patterns. The way alternative splicing is regulated within tissues is not understood.

Pre-mRNA alternative splicing is a widespread process that regulates gene expression and is the most important source of protein diversity in vertebrates (1Graveley B.R.

Different FN polypeptides arise through an intricate pattern of alternative splicing in three regions of the single primary transcript, (from 5′ to 3′) extra domain II (EDII), extra domain I (EDI), and type III connecting segment (IIICS) (also called EDB or EIIIB, EDA or EIIIA, and V region, respectively), resulting in up to 12 variants in rodents. FN alternative splicing is modulated in a cell type-, development-, and age-specific manner and therefore constitutes a paradigm for studying the regulation of this complex process (2Kornblihtt A.R. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P. Srebrow A. Werbajh S. Muro A.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). EDI and EDII are cassette exons, either excluded from or included into the mature FN mRNA. The third site of alternative splicing, IIICS, is subject to total inclusion, partial inclusion, or total exclusion due to the presence of an internal 3′ splice site within this exon. In vivo EDI+ FN is poorly represented in the ECM of adult normal tissues. However, this variant is over-expressed in developing embryos, wound healing, liver fibrosis, ovary granulosa cell proliferation, and some tumors (2Kornblihtt A.R. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2541-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that EDI inclusion may mediate a conformational change in the whole molecule that would result in an increased exposure of the RGD motif, therefore increasing cell-ECM interaction through the binding to α5β1 integrin. Furthermore EDI inclusion potentiates the ability of FN to promote cell cycle progression (4Manabe R. Oh-e N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5919-5924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, a growing body of data suggests that EDI per se is active. It has been shown that this region is responsible for the conversion of lipocytes into myofibroblasts in fibrotic liver (5Jarnagin W.R. Rockey D.C. Koteliansky V.E. Wang S.S. Bissell D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2037-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) as well as for the induction of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -3, and -9) required for cell migration and tissue remodeling (6Saito S.

Recently, Muro et al. (7Muro A.F. Chauhan A.K. Gajovic S. Iaconcig A. Porro F. Stanta G. Baralle F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) generated mice devoid of EDI exon-regulated splicing and demonstrated that EDI splicing regulation is required for proper skin wound healing and normal life span. EDII inclusion correlates with that of EDI in several cases. EDII is excluded from FN in normal adult tissue and included during development and pathological conditions such as inflammation, major trauma, wound healing, and tumors (8Oyama F. Hirohashi S. Sakamoto M. Titani K. Sekiguchi K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2005-2011PubMed Google Scholar, 9Peters J.H. Loredo G.A. Chen G. Maunder R. Hahn T.J. Willits N.H. Hynes R.O. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2003; 141: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the biological function of EDII is unknown, and the mechanisms that regulate its alternative splicing differ from those for EDI (10Lim L.P. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Cramer P. Cáceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol.

Splicing of the IIICS can generate three different variants in rodents, referred to as IIICS-0, IIICS-95, and IIICS-120 according to their lengths in the encoded amino acid residues. IIICS inclusion is higher in all fetal versus adult tissues, and this region is required for secretion of FN dimers during biosynthesis (13Schwarzbauer J.E. Spencer C.S. Wilson C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Mardon H.J. Sebastio G. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 423-433PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of several pre-mRNAs can be regulated by extracellular signals such as growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and stress stimuli (15Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2409-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have shown previously that a basement membrane-like ECM, as well as its two main protein components, modulates FN EDI alternative splicing in a hepatoma cell line (16Srebrow A. Blaustein M. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only a few cases of the transducing components linking the cell surface with the nuclear splicing machinery have been investigated. For example, it has been demonstrated that the MAPK kinase 3/6-p38 pathway modifies the subcellular distribution of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 and modulates the alternative splicing of transcripts derived from an adenovirus E1A reporter minigene. There is evidence suggesting a role for protein kinase C, Ras, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in alternative splicing regulation (15Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2409-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recent reports linked the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 to the regulation of CD44 alternative splicing triggered by T-cell activation. The STAR (signal transduction and activation of RNA) protein, SAM68, has been postulated as the final step of this cascade (17Matter N. Herrlich P. König H. Nature. 2002; 420: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The mammary gland comprises stromal and epithelial cells that communicate with each other through the ECM. Disruption of this dynamic communication can both induce and promote breast cancer. Cross-talk between the mammary epithelium and stroma is also crucial for the proper patterning and function of the normal mammary gland. Unlike other organs, the mammary gland undergoes most of its growth and morphogenesis in the adult animal, and certain stages of the postnatal gland exhibit embryonic- and tumor-like features (18Cunha G.R. Young P. Hamamoto S. Guzman R. Nandi S. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1992; 1: 105-118PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wiseman B.S. Werb Z. Science. 2002; 296: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). As EDI exon inclusion is linked to development, tissue remodeling, and tumorigenesis, the mammary gland represents a useful physiological context in which to study the regulation of FN alternative splicing by the cellular microenvironment, in particular by cell-cell interaction. In this study we investigated the effects of different growth factors and cytokines on FN alternative splicing in a functionally normal mouse mammary epithelial cell line (SCp2) and show that hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and acidic FGF (aFGF) stimulate EDI and IIICS inclusion but not EDII into mature FN mRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that soluble factors secreted by a mouse mammary mesenchymal cell line (SCg6) present in the conditioned medium from these cells (g6CM) also regulate FN EDI and IIICS alternative splicing in SCp2 cells, indicating that epithelial-mesenchymal interaction influences pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We explored the signaling pathways involved in this regulatory phenomenon, showing that g6CM as well as HGF/SF act through a PI 3-kinase-dependent cascade to alter FN splicing pattern in this cellular context. This work defines different extracellular cues that regulate FN alternative splicing, increasing FN isoforms preferentially involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, metastasis, and tissue remodeling. Furthermore, the data presented here provide new insights into how the cellular microenvironment can influence gene expression. Cell Culture—SCp2 and SCg6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (DMEM:F-12; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, insulin (5 μg/ml, Sigma) and gentamicin (50 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Cell co-culture was performed using Falcon Tissue Culture Inserts bearing a 0.4 μm-pore size P.E.T membrane (Becton Dickinson Labware). Approximately, 1–2 × 105 cells were plated in DMEM:F-12 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum into 35-mm tissue culture wells. After 24 h, cell monolayers were rinsed, an insert was placed inside each well, and 1–2 × 105 cells were plated on top of the insert filter. Cells in the bottom well and in the insert were cultured together for 48 h. Cell Treatments—Approximately 1–2 × 105 cells were plated in DMEM:F-12 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum into 35-mm tissue culture wells. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by serum-free DMEM:F-12, and cells were grown for another 24 h before treatment with growth factors (20 ng/ml), g6CM, SCp2 conditioned medium (p2CM) or serum-free DMEM:F-12 (control). g6CM was obtained by plating 1 × 106 cells into 100-mm tissue culture dishes in 2% fetal bovine serum medium and replacing it with serum-free DMEM:F-12 after 24 h. Cell supernatant was collected 24 h later and centrifuged to discard cell debris. Alternatively, g6CM was filtered through a 0.45-μm porous filter to obtain identical results. The same protocol was carried out with SCp2 cells to obtain p2CM. Reagents—Growth factors and cytokines utilized were: epidermal growth factor (EGF), KGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), aFGF, and HGF/SF from Sigma and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from R&D Systems, Inc.

Plasmids used for luciferase assays were pG5-Luc, pGal4-Elk1, and pGBDXGal4-Atf2. Experiments with RasV12 included pCEV-RasV12 or empty vector (pBluescript, Stratagene). Transfections were performed 24 h after plating using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Approximately 2 × 105 cells were transfected with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 and 2 μg of total plasmid DNA in 35-mm tissue culture wells. Co-transfection of pCMVβgal allowed standardization by transfection efficiencies. Cells were stimulated 24 h after transfection. Luciferase Assays—Luciferase (LUC) activity in cell lysates was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before lysis with 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega).

Radioactive RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide native gels and detected by autoradiography. Radioactivity in the bands was measured in a scintillation counter according to the Cerenkov method (11Cramer P. Cáceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol.

Western Blot Analysis—After treatment, cells were lysed in boiling 2× sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at the time points indicated. Proteins were separated (12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE), blotted, probed with specific antibodies, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Luminol (Sigma).

Differential Regulation of FN Alternatively Spliced Exons in Response to Growth Factors in Mammary Epithelial Cells—A number of growth factors (HGF/SF, TGFβ1, and EGF) stimulate EDI inclusion into mature mRNA in different cultured cell lines (16Srebrow A. Blaustein M. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Inoue T. Nabeshima K. Shimao Y. Koono M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We tested whether these and other growth factors and cytokines could regulate EDI alternative splicing in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line SCp2. After cells were exposed to different stimuli for 48 h, they were harvested, and RNA was extracted to compare the relative proportions of the two mRNA isoforms (lacking or containing the EDI exon) using an RT-PCR-based method (Fig. 1A). EGF, aFGF, bFGF, KGF, and HGF/SF increased the EDI+/EDI- ratio up to 4-fold (Fig. 1B). This effect was seen as early as 5 h and peaked at 24–48 h (data not shown). Surprisingly, the widely reported regulator of EDI alternative splicing, TGFβ1, did not up-regulate EDI+ isoform in these cells, even at the wide range of concentrations tested (0.1–50 ng/ml; data not shown). As a positive control, TGFβ1 stimulated EDI inclusion in Hep3B cells. Furthermore, leukemia inhibitory factor also failed to modify the EDI+/EDI- ratio (data not shown). To explore whether the growth factors that regulate EDI inclusion also affect the splicing of the other two FN alternative regions, we performed specific RT-PCR for EDII and IIICS (Fig. 1A). Alternative splicing of IIICS was also modified upon treatment of SCp2 cells with different growth factors (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, aFGF, KGF, and HGF/SF up-regulated IIICS-120, the IIICS isoform containing the LDV motif. This motif has been shown to promote cell adhesion by interacting with α4β1 and α4β7 integrins (26Humphries M.J. Akiyama S.K. Komoriya A. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2637-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, this newly synthesized FN (EDI+, IIICS-120) would have an enhanced potential for binding to a specific subset of integrins associated with cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and matrix metalloproteinase induction (4Manabe R.

Conversely, the EDII+ FN isoform was not detected in RNA from untreated cells, and none of the described stimuli altered this splicing pattern (Fig. 1D). These results extend the number of growth factors that stimulate EDI inclusion, bringing the FGF family into the scene for the first time and suggesting that a number of mitogenic agents, but not every cytokine, are key mediators of extracellular up-regulation of EDI inclusion in mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, a strong correlation between EDI and IIICS splicing regulation emerged from these experiments, whereas EDII splicing pattern remained unaffected by these treatments. This is consistent with the idea that alternative splicing of EDI and EDII exons is controlled by different molecular mechanisms (10Lim L.P. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Cramer P. Cáceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol.

Soluble Factors Secreted by Mammary Mesenchymal Cells Regulate FN Alternative Splicing in Mammary Epithelial Cells—The epithelial-mesenchymal interaction is mediated by growth factors secreted by both cell types. We have shown that many of these growth factors affect FN alternative splicing. However, these experiments performed with recombinant factors are far from representing the actual extracellular milieu. To simulate the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction and evaluate its influence on FN alternative splicing, we chose a cell culture model composed of two mouse mammary cell lines, the epithelial line SCp2 and the mesenchymal line SCg6. Both cell lines derive from the same parental cell strain, CID-9 (30Desprez P.Y. Roskelley C. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1993; 1: 99-110Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, SCg6 cells express higher levels of EDI+, EDII+, and IIICS-120 FN than SCp2 cells. Co-culture experiments were performed with tissue culture inserts that allow the interchange of soluble factors without direct cell-cell contact. The presence of SCg6 cells stimulated EDI exon inclusion in SCp2 cells, increasing the EDI+/EDI- ratio by 3–4-fold compared with that of SCp2 cells cultured with SCp2 cells on the other side of the filter (Fig. 3A). In contrast, EDI splicing in SCg6 was not affected by the co-culture with SCp2 cells (data not shown). To assess whether a dynamic cell-cell communication was essential for this effect, we tested the influence of g6CM on EDI alternative splicing in SCp2 cells. Although treatment with conditioned medium from SCp2 (p2CM) did not change EDI inclusion, treatment with g6CM elicited an increase in the EDI+/EDI- ratio already observed after 5 h and more pronounced after 24 and 48 h (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, IIICS regulation was again correlated with that of EDI, showing a marked preference for the IIICS-120 isoform (Fig. 3B), whereas EDII alternative splicing was not affected by this treatment (data not shown). These results show a novel regulation of FN alternative splicing by cell-cell interaction and provide a physiological context for studying the regulation of alternative splicing by extracellular stimuli. Signal Transduction Pathways Activated by g6CM and HGF/SF—A number of studies have associated extracellular stimuli and the regulation of FN alternative splicing. Nevertheless, the signaling cascades that lead to these effects remain unexplored (15Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2409-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The pathways that link extracellular stimuli and cellular effects are classically grouped into kinase cascades activated by either mitogenic (MAPK pathways) or stress (SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase) pathways) stimuli (31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that most growth factors activate the Ras-Raf-MAPK kinase (MEK)-ERK1/2 pathway (32Paumelle R. Tulasne D. Leroy C. Coll J. Vandenbunder B. Fafeur V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3751-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To confirm that this pathway was activated in response to g6CM and/or growth factors, we first performed a luciferase-based GAL-ELK1 reporter assay. SCp2 cells were transiently transfected with two plasmids. One plasmid carried the LUC reporter gene driven by a minimal promoter fused to binding sites for the yeast transcription factor GAL4, and the other coded for a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain plus the activation domain from ELK1 transcription factor, which is known to be phosphorylated and therefore activated by ERK1/2. Approximately a 10-fold activation of the reporter system was observed in cells treated with both g6CM and HGF/SF (Fig. 4A). The stress kinases p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which are occasionally activated by growth factors (33Recio J.A. Merlino G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), can also activate the transcription factor ELK1 in some cell lines. Therefore, we performed a LUC-based GAL-ATF2 reporter assay that only differs from the one described above in that the second plasmid codes for GAL4 binding domain fused to the activation domain of ATF2 transcription factor. ATF2 is known to be activated by JNK and p38 but not by ERK1/2. Upon treatment of SCp2 cells with g6CM or HGF/SF, a 1.5-fold activation of the reporter was observed, indicating that the JNK and/or p38 pathway are activated but to a lesser extent compared with the ERK1/2 pathway (Fig. 4B). To confirm and dissect these results, we performed Western blots for pERK and pJNK. We observed a robust increase in pERK and a clear augmentation in pJNK after 30 min of treatment (Fig. 4C). These activations were sustained in time, with high levels of pJNK and pERK still seen at 2 and 5 h, respectively (data not shown). Conversely, we detected little or no phosphorylation of p38 after 30 min of treatment with g6CM or HGF/SF, which contrasted with the strong activation induced by anisomycin, a known"

In this study we introduced the IRS-2 gene specifically into the liver of Irs2–/– mice with adenovirus vectors. Glucose tolerance tests revealed that the IRS-2 restoration in the liver ameliorated the hyperglycemia, but the improvement in hyperinsulinemia was only partial. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd) were measured during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies: EGP was increased 2-fold in the Irs2–/– mice, while Rd decreased by 50%. Restoration of IRS-2 in the liver suppressed EGP to a level similar to that in wild-type mice, but Rd remained decreased in the Adeno-IRS-2-infected Irs2–/– mice. Irs2–/– mice also exhibit obesity and hyperleptinemia associated with impairment of hypothalamic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. Continuous intracerebroventricular leptin infusion or caloric restriction yielded Irs2–/– mice whose adiposity was comparable to that of Irs2+/+ mice, and both the hyperglycemia and the hyperinsulinemia of these mice improved with increased Rd albeit partially. Finally combination treatment consisting of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of IRS-2 and continuous intracerebroventricular leptin infusion completely reversed the hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in Irs2–/– mice. EGP and Rd also became normal in these mice as well as in mice treated by caloric restriction plus adenoviral gene transfer. We therefore concluded that a combination of increased EGP due to insulin signaling defects in the liver and reduced Rd due to obesity accounts for the systemic insulin resistance in Irs2–/– mice.

Vitamin D3 25-hydroxylation is hence an essential modification step for vitamin D3 activation. Until now, three cytochrome P450 molecular species (CYP27A1, CYP2C11, and CYP2D25) have been characterized well as vitamin D3 25-hydroxylases. However, their physiological role remains unclear because of their broad substrate specificities and low activities toward vitamin D3 relative to other substrates. In this study, we purified vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase from female rat liver microsomes. The activities of the purified fraction toward vitamin D3 and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 were 1.1 and 13 nmol/min/nmol of P450, respectively. The purified fraction showed a few protein bands in a 50–60-kDa range on SDS-PAGE, typical for a cytochrome P450. The tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting of a protein band (56 kDa) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry identified this band as CYP2J3. CYP2J3 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant CYP2J3 showed strong 25-hydroxylation activities toward vitamin D3 and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 with turnover numbers of 3.3 and 22, respectively, which were markedly higher than those of P450s previously characterized as 25-hydroxylases. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that CYP2J3 mRNA is expressed at a level similar to that of CYP27A1 without marked sexual dimorphism.

The latter reaction is 100-fold more efficient than vitamin D3 25-hydroxylation and is essential for the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acid (27Ohyama Y. Masumoto O. Usui E. Okuda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutation of this gene causes cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, leading to accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in most tissues (28Björkhem I. Boberg K.M. Leitersdorf E. Scriver C.R.

The disruption of the Cyp27a1 gene in mice severely compromises cholesterol metabolism but not vitamin D3 metabolism (29Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G.

CYP2D25 was purified from pig liver and kidney microsomes, and its cDNA was isolated (23Axén E. Bergman T. Wikvall K. Biochem.

Commun. 1997; 241: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A series of reports by Wikvall and co-workers have shown that (i) this enzyme hydroxylates not only at the C-25 of vitamin D3 but also at the C-1α and C-26 of 25-OH-D3 (30Araya Z. Hosseinpour F. Bodin K. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); (ii) it is expressed in kidney as well as in liver (31Hosseinpour F. Norlin M. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); and (iii) a possible human ortholog, CYP2D6, exhibits no 25-hydroxylation activity (32Hosseinpour F. Wikvall K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34650-34655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Very recently, Cheng et al. (25Cheng J.B. Motola D.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38084-38093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have reported a microsomal P450 (CYP2R1) in mice and humans as a 25-hydroxylase. They successfully isolated this P450 by expression cloning from a CYP27A1-deficient mouse cDNA library, and the 25-hydroxylase activity of the recombinant enzyme was demonstrated. However, detailed analysis of the enzyme activity including substrate specificity and kinetic parameters has not yet been reported.The aim of the present study is to investigate whether other P450 enzymes with a 25-hydroxylation activity higher than those identified exist in mammals. Previous studies showed that CYP2C11 is a male-specific P450 expressed in rat liver and scarcely expressed in female rat liver (26Yoshioka H. Morohashi K. Sogawa K. Miyata T. Kawajiri K. Hirose T. Inayama S. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1706-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, female rat liver microsomes exhibit substantial vitamin D3 25-hydroxylation activity (17Andersson S. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16932-16936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hayashi S. Usui E. Okuda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a yet unidentified vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase. In the present study, we have identified the P450 enzyme responsible for this 25-hydroxylation activity from female rat liver microsomes. Here we report CYP2J3 as a principal microsomal vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase in rat.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Vitamin D3 and testosterone were obtained from Katayama Chemical (Osaka, Japan), and 25-OH-D3, 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1α-OH-D3, cholic acid, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). CHAPS and MEGA-10 were from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan). Emulgen 911 was supplied by Kao-Atlas Co. (Tokyo, Japan). β-NADPH was the product of Oriental Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. δ-Aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA) was from Sigma. The chaperone plasmid, pGro7, was purchased from Takara Bio Inc. (Otsu, Japan). Male and female rats (Wistar strain, 8–10 weeks old) were obtained from Hiroshima Jikken Doubutsu (Hiroshima, Japan). All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available.Purification of Female Rat Microsomal 25-Hydroxylase—Livers (∼100 g) were excised from 15 female rats that had been starved for 20 h before sacrifice and perfused with 0.9% NaCl solution. All subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C or on ice, and all buffers contained 1 μg/ml of leupeptin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin except for the hydroxyapatite II step. Livers were minced and homogenized with 5 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min and subsequently at 9300 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 187,000 × g for 1 h. The precipitated pellet of microsomes was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged again. All buffers used in the following purification procedures contained 20% glycerol and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The pellet of microsomes was suspended in buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to the final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. To solubilize microsomes, 10% cholate was slowly added to a final concentration of 1.0%, and then the mixture was slowly stirred on ice for 1 h. The solubilized solution was fractionated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (Katayama Chemical) as described (34Coon M.J. van der Hoeven T.A. Dahl S.B. Haugen D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The precipitate with 4–16% PEG was suspended in buffer A. The suspension was dialyzed overnight against buffer A. The turbid dialysate was resolubilized by adding 10% cholate and the same volume of 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 m KCl and 2mm EDTA, resulting in the final concentration of 1.0% cholate and 9.2 mg of protein/ml in buffer A. The mixture was stirred on ice for 45 min and centrifuged at 187,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was then diluted with the same volume of buffer A to reduce the cholate concentration.The diluted sample (80 ml) was applied to an ω-aminohexyl-Sepharose column (3.0 × 12 cm) equilibrated with buffer B (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5% cholate). The column was washed with buffer B and then eluted with buffer B containing 0.05% Emulgen 911. The fractions with relatively high 1α-OH-D3 25-hydroxylation activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.3% cholate, and 0.05% Emulgen 911). The dialyzed fraction (70 ml) was applied to a Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column (2.5 × 3.0 cm) (the hydroxyapatite I step). The column was washed with buffer C and then eluted stepwise with 60, 100, and 300 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.3% cholate, and 0.05% Emulgen 911. The fractions eluted with 60 mm potassium phosphate were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% cholate, and 0.2% CHAPS). The dialyzed fraction (14 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.6 × 2.5 cm) (the DEAE-Sepharose I step). The column was washed with buffer D and then eluted stepwise with the same buffer containing 100, 200, and 300 mm NaCl. The fractions (100 mm NaCl eluate) containing relatively high activity were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% cholate. The dialyzed fraction (4.2 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.0 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with buffer E, consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% cholate, and 0.1% MEGA-10 (the DEAE-Sepharose II step). The column was washed with buffer E and eluted stepwise with the same buffer containing 40, 80, and 300 mm NaCl. The fractions (40 mm NaCl) containing high activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer F (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.05% cholate). The dialysate (2.5 ml) was applied to a Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column (1.0 × 2.0 cm) (the hydroxyapatite II step). The column was washed with buffer F and then eluted with 400 mm potassium buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.05% cholate. The fractions with relatively high activity were stored at –80 °C and used for enzyme characterization.Enzyme Assay—25-Hydroxylase activity was assayed with a reconstituted method (35Ohyama Y. Hayashi S. Usui E. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Typically, the assay mixture (0.49 ml) consisted of 10–300 μg of protein, NADPH-P450 reductase (0.5 units based on cytochrome c reducing activity (36Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 1 μm EDTA, and 10 nmol of 1α-OH-D3 dissolved in 5 μl of ethanol. The assay mixture was preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and then the reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 50mm β-NADPH. The incubation was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n NaOH. The reaction products were extracted with 4 ml of benzene. The organic phase (3 ml) was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in chloroform and ethyl acetate (4:1, v/v). An aliquot was subjected to HPLC analysis (PU-980 pump, UV-975 detector, JASCO Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a Finepak SIL-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm; JASCO). The sample was eluted with isopropyl alcohol/methanol/hexane (7:7:86, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min, and effluents were monitored by absorbance at 265 nm (λmax of vitamin D3 derivatives). The amount of the product was calculated according to the standard curve based on the peak height. In the assay of microsomal activity, the NADPH-P450 reductase was omitted from the assay mixture. The hydroxylation activity toward vitamin D3 was assayed as follows. 0.98 ml of a typical assay mixture consisting of P450 fraction, 1.0 unit of NADPH-P450 reductase, 100 μm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 1.0 μm EDTA, and 100 nmol of vitamin D3 dissolved in 10 μl of ethanol was preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and then the reaction was started by adding 20 μl of 50mm β-NADPH. The incubation was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of ethanol. Subsequent procedures were similar to those for the 1α-OH-D3 assays. HPLC analysis were performed with isopropyl alcohol/methanol/hexane (5:2:93, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The testosterone hydroxylation activity was measured using 50 nmol of testosterone as a substrate by the method similar to that used for 25-hydroxylase activity. HPLC analysis was performed with isopropyl alcohol/methanol/hexane (5:15:85, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min, and effluents were monitored by absorbance at 238 nm (18Hayashi S. Noshiro M. Okuda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1753-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To confirm the product identities, the reversed phase HPLC analysis (Finepak SIL C18T-5 column, 4.6 × 250 mm; JASCO) was carried out in parallel. HPLC analysis for 25-OH-D3 was performed with water/methanol (5:95, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min, and that for 1,25-(OH)2D3 was with water/methanol (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min (35Ohyama Y. Hayashi S. Usui E. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined by measuring the activities under varying substrate concentrations. Vitamin D3 concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 μm were used for 4.8 pmol of dN2J3 and 1α-OH-D3 from 0.25 to 2.0 μm were employed for 0.95 pmol of dN2J3. Experiments were carried out at least three times, and data are presented as the averages. Hydroxylation activities of dN2J3 for 25-OH-D3 were also examined by HPLC analysis of metabolites (35Ohyama Y. Hayashi S. Usui E. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).In-gel Digestion with Trypsin—The in-gel digestion procedure was performed as previously described (37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7767) Google Scholar, 38Taniguchi H. Kikuchi M. Saibo Kogaku. 2002; 21: 524-534Google Scholar). Briefly major protein bands with apparent molecular mass between 50 and 60 kDa of the purified fraction were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gel and cut into pieces. The gel pieces were destained by washes with either 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate repeatedly (in the case of Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining) or with 100 μl of 15mm potassium ferricyanide and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate once and water repeatedly (for silver staining) (39Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). After shaking with 100 μl of acetonitrile for 5 min, acetonitrile was removed, and the gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 20 min at 30 °C. The gel pieces were shaken with 100 μl of reducing solution (10 mm dithiothreitol and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate) for 60 min at 56 °C and then washed with 100 μl of 25mm ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min. Subsequently, the gel pieces were shaken under dark conditions with 100 μl of alkylating solution (55 mm iodoacetamide and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate) for 45 min and washed with 100 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The gel pieces were shaken with 50% acetonitrile and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min twice. The solvent was removed, and the gel pieces were dried again. The gel pieces were immersed in 90 μl of digestion solution containing 10 μg/ml sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) and 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated on ice for 30 min. After removing unabsorbed solution, the gel pieces were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Digested peptides were extracted twice from gel pieces with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The extracts were combined, and the solvent was evaporated to a volume of ∼20 μl. The concentrated samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass analysis as below.Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—One μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (Sigma) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile (v/v)) was added to 1 μl of sample in the Eppendorf tube, and then 1 μl of the sample-matrix solution was spotted onto a stainless steel probe tip and allowed to air-dry for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were measured on a Bruker Biflex II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with an ion source with visualization optics and an N2 laser (337 nm). Mass spectra were recorded in the reflector positive mode at a 28.5-kV acceleration voltage and 1.5 kV in the detector by accumulating 200 spectra of single laser shots under threshold irradiance. The fragments in the range from m/z 800 to 4000 were detected. Highly intense, well resolved mass signals arising from 3–5 selected target spots were considered. If the signal/noise ratio of the profile was low, the sample was desalted with ZipTip (Millipore Corp.) before mixing with matrix solution, and then desalted sample was remeasured as described. All MALDI spectra were calibrated externally using a standard peptide mixture (angiotensin II (Mr = 1047.2), adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 (Mr = 2466.7), and insulin (Mr = 5734.6)).Construction of Expression Plasmids—Standard methods for construction of plasmids were as described by Sambrook et al. (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Rat liver cDNA libraries (for male and female, separately) were prepared by a reverse transcription reaction with total RNA, oligo(dT)12–18 primer and SuperScript II (Invitrogen). CYP2J3 cDNA (41Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol.

To prepare a cDNA for an N-terminal modified CYP2J3 protein (mN2J3), TY-1 (forward primer, 5′-TCA CAT ATG GCT GTC ACA GCT GGT TCC CTA CTA G-3′) and TY-2 (reverse primer, 5′-CTC AAG CTT AGC AGA CAC CAG TGT CCT CCA TG-3′) were used as a PCR primer set. TY-1 and TY-2 primers include a NdeI site that coincides with the initiation codon (ATG) and a HindIII site after the stop codon, respectively (indicated with underlines) to facilitate the subsequent cloning into the NdeI/HindIII sites of an expression vector. Moreover, TY-1 primer was designed to alter the second codon to GCT (Ala) and one guanine in the fifth codon (GCG) to thymine to achieve the efficient expression as described by Barnes et al. (42Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) (see Fig. A in Supplemental Materials). A PCR product (1.6 kb) was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). After transformation of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, plasmid was purified and verified to be free of mutations by DNA sequence analysis using an ABI PRISM 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The plasmid was completely digested by NdeI and then partially with HindIII because an additional HindIII site is present in the coding region. The 1.6-kb NdeI-HindIII fragment containing the mN2J3 open reading frame was purified from agarose gel and ligated into the NdeI/HindIII site of the pKSN2 vector (43Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sakaki T.

To prepare an expression plasmid for an N-terminal truncated CYP2J3 (dN2J3), pK-mN2J3 was amplified by the primer set of TY-5 (forward primer, 5′-CAT ATG GCT AAA CAC AGA CGT CCC AAG AAC TAC-3′) and TY-2 (see Fig. A in Supplemental Materials).

Dbp9p seems to function in ribosomal RNA biogenesis, but it has not been biochemically characterized. To analyze the enzymatic characteristics of the protein, we expressed a recombinant Dbp9p in Escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity. The purified protein exhibited RNA unwinding and binding activity in the absence of NTP, and this activity was abolished by a mutation in the RNA-binding domain. We then characterized the ATPase activity of Dbp9p with respect to cofactor specificity; the activity was found to be severely inhibited by yeast total RNA and moderately inhibited by poly(U), poly(A), and poly(C) but to be stimulated by yeast genomic DNA and salmon sperm DNA. In addition, Dbp9p exhibited DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA helicase activity in the presence of ATP. These results indicate that Dbp9p has biochemical characteristics unique among DEAD box proteins.

RNA helicases are enzymes that unwind double-stranded RNA molecules in an energy-dependent manner through the hydrolysis of NTP. These proteins are widely distributed among a variety of organisms ranging from viruses and prokaryotes to mammals. RNA helicases are associated with virtually all biological processes requiring RNA, including transcription, splicing, RNA transport, ribosome biogenesis, RNA editing, translation, and RNA decay (1De la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The largest family of RNA helicases is the DEAD box protein family. The DEAD box proteins have seven to eight distinctive motifs. The DEAD is derived from the amino acid sequence of motif II, the Walker B motif (2Linder P. Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Leroy P.

Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In vitro analyses of DEAD box proteins such as the translation initiation factor eIF-4A and the human nuclear protein p68 have demonstrated that these proteins possess RNA-dependent ATPase activity and are capable of melting short RNA duplex structures in an ATP-dependent manner (3Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 4Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

For example, eIF-4A, an archetypical member of the DEAD box protein family, is capable of unwinding partial duplex RNA in a bidirectional manner and acting on RNA or DNA-RNA, but not on the DNA duplex (4Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 6Du M.X. Johnson R.B. Sun X.L. Staschke K.A. Colacino J. Wang Q.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analyses of the conserved regions of DEAD box proteins have demonstrated that these regions are important to ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, RNA binding, RNA unwinding, and coupling of these different activities. In addition to these typical DEAD box RNA helicases, some DEAD box proteins have recently been shown to have peculiar characteristics. Hepatitis C virus NS3 drives the unwinding activity with all ribo- and deoxyribo-NTPs (6Du M.X. Johnson R.B. Sun X.L. Staschke K.A. Colacino J. Wang Q.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CsdA, an Escherichia coli DEAD box protein, unwinds double-stranded RNA in the absence of NTP (7Jones P.G. Mitta M. Kim Y. Jiang W. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the DEAD box family includes proteins with a wide variety of biochemical activities. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains over 20 different DEAD box proteins, many of which are essential to viability. Combined with biochemical analyses, yeast genetical analyses have revealed the functions of many DEAD box proteins. For example, the DEAD box proteins Prp5p and Prp28p are involved in pre-messenger RNA splicing (8Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Linder P. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7664-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, it is ribosome biogenesis that DEAD box proteins are most often associated with, because 13 DEAD box proteins have been implicated in ribosome biogenesis (1De la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Ribosomes are one of the largest and most complex macromolecular assemblies (reviewed in Ref. 15Leary D.J. Huang S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). DBP9 encodes an essential nucleolar DEAD box protein. Genetic depletion of Dbp9p results in a deficit of 60 S ribosomal subunits and in the appearance of half-mer polysomes. In vivo depletion of Dbp9p results in reduced synthesis of the 27 S precursor to the mature 25 S and 5.8 S ribosomal RNA, which terminally leads to a net deficit in 60 S ribosomal subunits (16Daugeron M.C. Kressler D. Linder P. RNA. 2001; 7: 1317-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that Dbp9p participates in ribosome biogenesis. Dbp9p is classified as a DEAD box protein based on sequence homology (17Shiratori A. Shibata T. Arisawa M. Hanaoka F. Murakami Y. Eki T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It has never, however, been shown experimentally to unwind RNA. In this study, therefore, we purified and characterized Dbp9p, which was found to display several specific characteristics: it unwinds RNA in the absence of NTP, its ATPase activity is inhibited by RNA but stimulated by DNA, and it exhibits DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA helicase activity. Our work suggests that the DEAD box family proteins vary widely with respect to substrate specificity. Construction of Plasmids—The pBluescript-Dbp9 vector containing an N-terminal FLAG tag was a kind gift from A. Shiratori (17Shiratori A. Shibata T. Arisawa M. Hanaoka F. Murakami Y. Eki T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of Dbp9 was subcloned into an expression vector pET32b by KpnI/XhoI sites (pET32-Dbp9). The expression clones were transformed to Escherichia coli (AD494). The Dbp9 mutated forms were constructed as follows. For the mutagenesis of R414I, R414T, and R414K in the DEAD box family helicase motif VI, we used the synthetic oligonucleotides I-f (5′-TGC ATA GAG TAG GT ATA ACT GCT CGT GGC GG-3′) and I-r (5′-CCG CCA CGA GCA GT TAT AC CTA CTC TAT GCA-3′); T-f (5′-TGC ATA GAG TAG GT ACA ACT GCT CGT GGC GG-3′) and T-r (5′-CCG CCA CGA GCA GT TGT ACC TAC TC TAT GCA-3′); and K-f (5′-TGC ATA GAG TAG GT AAA ACT GCT CGT GGC GG-3′) and K-r (5′-CCG CCA CGA GCA GT TTT ACC TAC TCT ATG CA-3′), respectively. PCR reactions were carried out using primers r, f, and pBluescript-Dbp9 as a template DNA with pfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Forty units of DpnI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was added to the resulting reaction mixture, which was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was ligased by TAKARA T4 ligation kit (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan). The reaction mixture was transformed into E. coli to purify the plasmids pBluescript-Dbp9(R414I), -Dbp9(R414T), and -Dbp9(R414K), respectively. The plasmids pET32-Dbp9(R414I), -Dbp9(R414T), and -Dbp9 (R414K) were constructed by cloning 0.7-kb HindIII-XhoI fragments from pBluescript-Dbp9(R414I), -Dbp9(R414T), and -Dbp9(R414K) into HindIII-XhoI-restricted vector pET32b, respectively. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Dbp9 —Plasmids containing E. coli were grown in 2×YT medium to A600 = 0.4 at 30 °C. The expression of recombinant protein was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 2.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl), and sonicated in the same buffer. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 and then loaded onto a 9-ml Probond nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen). The lysate was washed with 10-column volumes of the loading buffer (50 mm imidazole, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2). Step elutions were carried out in 3-column volumes by increasing the imidazole to 100 and then 500 mm. Dbp9p was mostly eluted in the 500-mm elution, as verified by SDS-PAGE. The elution was loaded on a 150-ml Sephacryl S 400 (Amersham Biosciences) gel-filtration column equilibrated in the same buffer. The proteins were eluted in 200 ml of the same buffer. Forty 5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed. Two fractions mostly containing Dbp9p were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. The protein was then loaded on a phosphocellulose cation exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a gradient of 0.02–1.0 m KCl. Fractions were analyzed for ATPase activity. Peak ATPase activity was found to correlate with the peak of Dbp9p. ATPase Assay—The measurement of hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 50 μm ATP, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 2 mm DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; ss, single strand; ds, double strand. 2% PEG8000, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μCi (18.5 kBq) of [γ-32P]ATP, and various amounts of purified Dbp9p samples. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Aliquots of each reaction were spotted onto a thin layer chromatography plate. ATP and free phosphate were separated by thin-layer chromatography in 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The sheets were dried and exposed on x-ray film. When needed, Pi on the TLC plate was quantitated by counting in a liquid scintillation counter. RNA Unwinding Assay—Preparation of substrate S1:S1 substrate for the RNA-unfolding and RNA binding assay was prepared following a previously described method (18Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21372-21383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S1 was 81 bp T7 RNA polymerase transcript from plasmid Bluescript II KS (Stratagene) digested with HindIII. These transcripts were synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]GTP as described previously (19Valdez B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6395-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We next purified S1 using a QIA quick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and a Micro-Spin G25 column (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Unwinding and Binding Assays—RNA substrate mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 25, 50, or 100 ng of Dbp9p or 100 ng of mutated Dbp9p (R414I, R414T, R414K) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a mixture containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 50% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. As controls, we prepared a sample with an RNA substrate that was heat-denatured by incubating for 5 min at 99 °C and without the addition of Dbp9p. Aliquots of each sample were loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 100 V. The gel was packed into a hybridization bag and exposed on an imaging plate (Fuji). The RNA binding assay was carried out by the same method except that the RNA unwinding buffer lacked proteinase K. The mixture was loaded onto 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. Cofactors for ATPase—Poly(A), poly(U), and poly(C) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Heat-denatured yeast total DNA refers to yeast total DNA that was heated at 100 °C for 10 min. DNaseI-treated yeast total DNA was prepared by digestion with 1260 units of DNaseI at 25 °C for 1 h. pUC19 linear DNA was prepared by EcoRI (TAKARA) digestion. We added 10-, 100-, or 1000-ng nucleotides to ATPase reaction mixtures containing 50 ng of Dbp9p and then stirred. Measurement of ATP hydrolysis was carried out as described in ATPase assay. DNA Helicase, DNA-RNA Helicase Assay—This assay is based on Tuteja et al. (20Tuteja N. Rahman K. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Skopac D. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The DNA substrate used in the helicase assay consists of 32P-labeled complementary oligonucleotides annealed to M13mp19 phage ssDNA to create a partial duplex. The DNA probe sequence is 5′-TTT TTT TTT TTT TT GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG AC TTT TTT TTT TTT T. The T-3′ RNA probe sequence is 5′-UUU UUU UUU UUU UU GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG AC UUU UUU UUU UUU UU-3′. Twenty-five nanograms of these DNAs or RNAs was 5′-end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide and 0.925 MBq [γ-32P]ATP in a T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT). Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed using a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This labeled oligomer was annealed to M13mp19 ssDNA (1 μg) in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Forty-nine microliters of 32P-labeled oligomer mixture and 5 μlof0.2 μg/μl DNA were mixed in a solution containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 3 min and allowed to anneal at 65 °C for 20 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature for 40 min. The substrates were purified using a MicroSpin S-400 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). The standard reaction mixture (15 μl) consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 8 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 30 mm KCl, 4% sucrose 80 μg/μl bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 5 μl of 32P-labeled helicase substrate and Dbp9p. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of a helicase reaction stop buffer (0.3% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.03% bromphenol blue). After further incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the substrate and product were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel (mini gel size, 8 × 10 cm) in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.2) and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). After electrophoresis, the gel was exposed to an imaging plate for 2 h and the bands were detected by a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji). The helicase activity using the DNA-RNA substrate was also determined as described above but in the presence of RNasein. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Dbp9p—Dbp9p seems to function in RNA metabolism, especially in ribosome assembly, based on its sequence motifs and the phenotypes of the dbp9 mutants (16Daugeron M.C. Kressler D. Linder P. RNA. 2001; 7: 1317-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To characterize Dbp9p biochemically, we constructed a plasmid for expressing Dbp9p with a FLAG-, a His-, a Trx-, and an S tag in E. coli. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced by growing the E. coli with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 2.5 h. Large-scale preparations of the recombinant protein were purified with anti-His tag affinity chromatography (Probond) and gel-filtration column chromatography (Sephacryl S400). This partially purified Dbp9p was purified further through phosphocellulose cation exchange column chromatography (Fig. 1A). During the purification, fractions were simultaneously assayed for ATPase activity. In the course of phosphocellulose column chromatography, the elution profile was monitored by an ATPase assay. The peak fraction of the ATPase consisted of a homogeneous preparation of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa (Fig. 1B), which is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of Dbp9p with all the tags described above. Identification of the purified protein was also verified by an anti-FLAG tag antibody (data not shown). The above purification procedure was applied to E. coli strains expressing the Dbp9p mutants with the replacement of Arg-414, which is a conserved amino acid within the RNA binding motif by isoleucin, threonine, and lysine (named Dbp9p(R414A), Dbp9p(R414T), and Dbp9p (R414K), respectively) (Fig. 2A) (21Oh J.Y. Kim J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This Arg residue of mammalian eIF-4A has been reported to be critical in both ATP hydrolysis and RNA binding activities. Substitution of the same Arg residue of the yeast eIF-4A gene, TIF1, to Thr or Ile impaired the function of this elongation factor (22Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 23Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As expected, the Dbp9p mutant proteins purified by gel filtration chromatography did not show ATPase activity (Fig. 2). Dbp9p Shifts a Secondary Structure of RNA through Unwinding Activity—The presence of both the DEAD box motif and ATPase activity in Dbp9p leads to the prediction that Dbp9p might exhibit RNA unwinding activity. To determine whether Dbp9p can unwind RNA, we measured its RNA unwinding activity using a folded RNA substrate. We prepared S1 RNA, which was obtained by transcribing pBluescript with T7 RNA polymerase. The structure of the S1 RNA used is illustrated in Fig. 3A. The input S1 shows two forms on the gel: a fast-migrating unfolded RNA and a slow-migrating folded RNA. Incubation of S1 RNA with Dbp9p decreased the latter form as the amount of input Dbp9p increased (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, this reaction occurred in the absence of NTP. However, the mutant forms of Dbp9p did not change the migration pattern of the input RNA. These results indicate that Dbp9p has NTP-independent RNA unwinding activity and that the motif VI of Dbp9p is necessary for this unwinding activity. To confirm the direct interaction between Dbp9p and S1 RNA, we carried out a gel shift assay. Preincubation of Dbp9p with S1 RNA gave rise to a shifted band of the RNA (Fig. 4). The amount of shifted RNA increased along with the amounts of input Dbp9p. Dbp9p Has DNA-dependent ATPase Activity—As described above, we demonstrated that Dbp9p has RNA unwinding activity. A common property of numerous NTPases/helicases is their activation and even the dependence of their ATPase activity on RNA, DNA, or homopolymeric polynucleotides. The E. coli DEAD box protein CsdA, which has been shown to be able to unwind RNA duplex in the absence of ATP, has not been characterized in terms of the cofactor dependence of ATPase (7Jones P.G. Mitta M. Kim Y. Jiang W. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We, therefore, had much interest in the specificity of Dbp9p ATPase activity. Dbp9p was incubated with 32P[ATP], and the formation of 32P was measured using thin-layer chromatography in the presence of a variety of polynucleotides. The ATPase activity of Dbp9p was reduced up to one-fifth by the addition of yeast total RNA and was slightly reduced by poly (U), poly (A), and poly (C) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the addition of increasing amounts of yeast genome DNA or salmon sperm DNA increased the amount of ATP hydrolyzed up to 8–12 fold, showing that the Dbp9p ATPase activity is stimulated by DNA (Fig. 6A). Stimulation of the ATPase activity by the addition of purified circular pUC19 DNA and EcoRI-treated linear pUC19 DNA up to 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively, was also observed, indicating that DNA ends are not required for this stimulation. To confirm that this stimulation was caused by DNA and not by contaminated proteins, we carried out the same ATPase analysis using yeast genome DNA treated with DNaseI or heat-treated DNA. Heat-treated DNA stimulated ATPase activity, whereas DNase-treated DNA did not (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that DNA itself, not any contaminated protein, activates the ATPase activity of Dbp9p.Fig. 6DNA stimulates Dbp9p ATPase activity. ATPase activity was measured through Pi radioactivity. The y-axis shows the ATP activity of each additive relative to that with no addition. A, Dbp9p ATPase activity with yeast genome (○) or salmon testis DNA (▪). Both of the DNAs stimulated Dbp9p ATPase activity. B, Dbp9p ATPase activity with DNaseI-treated yeast genome (○) or heat-denatured yeast genome (▪). The DNaseI-treated yeast genome did not stimulate Dbp9p ATPase activity. The heat-denatured yeast genome stimulated Dbp9p ATPase activity. C, Dbp9p ATPase activity with linear pUC19 (○) or circular pUC19 (▪). Linear pUC19 was EcoRI-cut pUC19. Both DNAs stimulated Dbp9p ATPase activity slightly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Dbp9p Has DNA Helicase Activity—The ATPase activity of Dbp9p was found to be at least partially inhibited by RNA and stimulated by DNA. This result was different from our expectation based on the amino acid sequence and phenotypic analysis. Dbp9p was therefore tested for its ability to function as a DNA helicase. We used a partial duplex substrate having a 17-bp annealed portion and hanging tails of 14 nucleotides at both the 5′- and 3′-ends, and the 5′-ends were labeled with 32P. Incubation of 32P-labeled forked DNA with Dbp9p resulted in the reduction of 32P DNA-M13ssDNA and an increase in 32P DNA according to the amount of Dbp9p, although incubation with mutant Dbp9ps (R414I, R414T, and R414K) failed to unwind this substrate (Fig. 7). We also performed a helicase assay with DNA-RNA substrate, synthesizing 45-nt RNA annealed with single-stranded circular M13 DNA. Reduction of 32P RNA-M13ssDNA was observed according to the amount of Dbp9p, meaning that Dbp9p has DNA-RNA helicase activity. Dbp9ps with site-directed mutation, however, did not show the helicase activity (Figs. 8 and 9).Fig. 9Dbp9p DNA and DNA-RNA helicase activities are ATP-dependent. Helicase assay with 1 mm ATP (+ATP) or without ATP (–ATP). The experimental procedures are the same as described for Figs. 7 and 8. A, DNA-DNA substrate. B, DNA-RNA substrate. These bands were detected by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then investigated whether this DNA helicase activity requires ATP hydrolysis. We incubated Dbp9p with 32P DNA-M13ssDNA as a substrate in the presence or absence of ATP. In a reaction without ATP, there was no strand displacement by Dbp9p (Fig. 9A). Also, no dissociation of 32P RNA-M13ssDNA by Dbp9p was observed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 9B). These results indicate that the DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA helicase activities of Dbp9p require ATP. The DBP9 gene encodes a DEAD box protein and is required for 27 S ribosomal RNA processing. Proteins containing the conserved DEAD box protein motifs are assumed to hydrolyze ATP and unwind RNA, but a direct biochemical demonstration of helicase activity remains essential. Because there has been no biochemical analysis of Dbp9p, we extensively characterized its biochemical activity in the present study. Some DEAD box proteins need the interaction with other proteins to exert their ATPase or helicase activity (4Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Here we show that Dbp9p possesses an unwinding activity on S1 ssRNA without ATP. This result indicates that Dbp9p has ATPase-independent RNA helix-destabilizing activity and apparently does not need to interact with other proteins to display RNA unwinding activity like that of E. coli CsdA (7Jones P.G. Mitta M. Kim Y. Jiang W. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), although Dbp9p seems to interact with Dbp6p functionally in vivo (16Daugeron M.C. Kressler D. Linder P. RNA. 2001; 7: 1317-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the RNA unwinding assays, there must be several artificial conditions because most of the DEAD box proteins identified thus far do not show any substrate specificity. Therefore, one could speculate that the unwinding reaction mediated by Dbp9p would be nonenzymatic. However, we think this possibility is excluded by the experiments with the mutated proteins, which could not hydrolyze ATP. The mutated proteins were unable to unwind the S1 RNA substrate. Dbp9p hydrolyzes ATP to produce free phosphate (Fig. 2B). The R414I, R414T, and R414K mutations, which have a conserved Arg residue in the RNA binding motif replaced with Ile, Thr, and Lys, respectively, impaired the ATPase activity of Dbp9p. This Dbp9p ATPase activity was inhibited by one-third with the addition of RNA and stimulated by the addition of genomic DNA. We have not tried to identify an in vivo Dbp9p substrate. We therefore could not examine whether in vivo substrate RNA also inhibits the ATPase activity of Dbp9p. The results presented above indicate that the Dbp9p ATPase has a preference for DNA. In terms of its cofactor, Drosophila Vasa (24Liang L. Diehl-Jones W. Lasko P. Development. 1994; 120: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HCV CAP-Rf (25You L.R. Chen C.M. Yeh T.S. Tsai T.Y. Mai R.T. Lin C.H. Lee Y.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2841-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another two DEAD box proteins, also have RNA-independent ATPase activity, and the activity of CAP-Rf is even inhibited by RNA. The ATPase activity of some DExH box proteins, another RNA helicase family, is known to be stimulated with DNA. For example, ATPase activity of S. cerevisiae Mer3p, a DExH box protein, is stimulated by DNA (26Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). But there are few other DEAD box proteins whose ATPase activity is known to be stimulated by DNA. The Dbp9p was able to displace the 17-nt fragment that had been annealed to the M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA in a reaction containing ATP. Some DExH box RNA helicases, such as RNA helicase A and human G3BP, have DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA helicase activities (23Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Costa M. Ochem A. Staub A. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Some viral helicases, such as NPHII and HCV NS3, also have DNA-DNA and RNA-RNA helicase activities (6Du M.X. Johnson R.B. Sun X.L. Staschke K.A. Colacino J. Wang Q.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bayliss C.D. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 794-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of DEAD box proteins, DP103 and AtDRH1 show dsRNA unwinding and DNA-RNA helicase activities (30Yan X. Mouillet J.F. Ou Q. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Okanami M. Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2638-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but no DEAD box protein has been shown to have DNA helicase activity. The DNA helicase activity of Dbp9p was found to be abolished by an amino acid substitution in its RNA-binding domain (Fig. 7). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that a DEAD box protein has DNA helicase activity. It is not known whether the unwinding of the DNA-DNA duplex by the recombinant Dbp9p is significant in terms of its physiological function. Although the hypothesis that Dbp9p could act as a DNA helicase in addition to RNA helicase is attractive, experimental data in support of such a possibility are lacking. NOH61 is a human ortholog of Dbp9p. Although it has not been determined whether NOH61 has helicase activity, the nucleolar localization and the participation in ribosome biogenesis are common to both proteins (32Zirwes R.F. Eilbracht J. Kneissel S. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1153-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The addition of ds and ssDNA activated the ATPase activity of NOH61 3.9- and 1.6-fold, respectively. The biochemical characteristic that ATPase activity is stimulated by the addition of DNA could also be applied to NOH61. But NOH61 cannot complement the defect of dbp9 mutation. In addition, NOH61 has a different substrate than that of Dbp9p in ribosome biogenesis. It is therefore speculated that NOH61 plays a role in the later stages of the processing that leads 65 S preribosomal particles to mature to 60 S ribosomal subunits, whereas Dbp9p seems to act at a very early stage in the formation of the 60 S equivalent. These differences might be based on the difference between the biochemical characteristics of these two orthologous proteins: the ATPase activity of Dbp9p is severely inhibited by RNA but that of NOH61 is not. We sincerely thank Dr. Hiroaki Katagi for critical reading and helpful comments on the manuscript. We thank Wataru Gunji for the gift of the yeast total RNA and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2158332761,"Galactose mutarotase catalyzes the conversion of β-d-galactose to α-d-galactose during normal galactose metabolism. The enzyme has been isolated from bacteria, plants, and animals and is present in the cytoplasm of most cells. Here we report the x-ray crystallographic analysis of human galactose mutarotase both in the apoform and complexed with its substrate, β-d-galactose. The polypeptide chain folds into an intricate array of 29 β-strands, 25 classical reverse turns, and 2 small α-helices. There are two cis-peptide bonds at Arg-78 and Pro-103. The sugar ligand sits in a shallow cleft and is surrounded by Asn-81, Arg-82, His-107, His-176, Asp-243, Gln-279, and Glu-307. Both the side chains of Glu-307 and His-176 are in the proper location to act as a catalytic base and a catalytic acid, respectively. These residues are absolutely conserved among galactose mutarotases. To date, x-ray models for three mutarotases have now been reported, namely that described here and those from Lactococcus lactis and Caenorhabditis elegans. The molecular architectures of these enzymes differ primarily in the loop regions connecting the first two β-strands. In the human protein, there are six extra residues in the loop compared with the bacterial protein for an approximate longer length of 9 Å. In the C. elegans protein, the first 17 residues are missing, thereby reducing the total number of β-strands by one. Galactose mutarotase catalyzes the conversion of β-d-galactose to α-d-galactose during normal galactose metabolism. The enzyme has been isolated from bacteria, plants, and animals and is present in the cytoplasm of most cells. Here we report the x-ray crystallographic analysis of human galactose mutarotase both in the apoform and complexed with its substrate, β-d-galactose. The polypeptide chain folds into an intricate array of 29 β-strands, 25 classical reverse turns, and 2 small α-helices. There are two cis-peptide bonds at Arg-78 and Pro-103. The sugar ligand sits in a shallow cleft and is surrounded by Asn-81, Arg-82, His-107, His-176, Asp-243, Gln-279, and Glu-307. Both the side chains of Glu-307 and His-176 are in the proper location to act as a catalytic base and a catalytic acid, respectively. These residues are absolutely conserved among galactose mutarotases. To date, x-ray models for three mutarotases have now been reported, namely that described here and those from Lactococcus lactis and Caenorhabditis elegans. The molecular architectures of these enzymes differ primarily in the loop regions connecting the first two β-strands. In the human protein, there are six extra residues in the loop compared with the bacterial protein for an approximate longer length of 9 Å. In the C. elegans protein, the first 17 residues are missing, thereby reducing the total number of β-strands by one. During normal galactose metabolism, β-d-galactose is converted to glucose 1-phosphate via the action of four enzymes that constitute the Leloir pathway as shown in Scheme 1 (1Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In the first step of this pathway, β-d-galactose is epimerized to α-d-galactose through the action of galactose mutarotase. The second step involves the phosphorylation of α-d-galactose to galactose 1-phosphate by galactokinase. As indicated in Scheme 1, galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase catalyzes the third step by transferring a UMP group from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate, thereby generating glucose 1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. To complete the pathway, UDP-galactose is converted to UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase.Mutations in three of the enzymes of the Leloir pathway, namely galactokinase, galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, or UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, have been demonstrated to result in the diseased state known as galactosemia (2Petry K.G. Reichardt J.K. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 98-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Novelli G. Reichardt J.K. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The symptoms of this genetic disease include early onset cataracts (typically within the first two years of life) and, in more severe cases, liver, kidney, and brain damage. Cataract formation is believed to be caused by the buildup of unmetabolized galactose in the lens of the eye. Aldose reductase catalyzes the reduction of the sugar to galactitol (dulcitol), which is not, in contrast to galactose, readily transported across the plasma membrane (4Kinoshita J.H. Merola L.O. Dikmak E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 62: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Dvornik E. Simard-Duquesne N. Krami M. Sestanj K. Gabbay K.H. Kinoshita J.H. Varma S.D. Merola L.O.

Eye Res. 1991; 52: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As such, the accumulation of this highly osmotically active compound draws excess water into the lens resulting in cataracts by a mechanism that is not fully understood. The more severe symptoms of galactosemia are most likely caused by a combination of these osmotic effects and the accumulation of the intermediate α-d-galactose-1-phosphate (7Tsakiris S. Marinou K. Schulpis K.H. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 91: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism of toxicity is not understood. No known disease-causing mutations in human galactose mutarotase have been identified thus far. However, galactitol is reported to be an inhibitor of mammalian mutarotase (8Keston A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 102: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that its accumulation would partly block the action of mutarotase, resulting in a further buildup of unmetabolized galactose.Galactose mutarotase activity was first reported in Escherichia coli in 1965 (9Wallenfels K. Hucho F. Herrmann K. Biochem. Z. 1965; 343: 307-325PubMed Google Scholar) and has since been observed in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria (9Wallenfels K. Hucho F. Herrmann K. Biochem.

It is present in the cytoplasm of most cells, suggesting that the in vivo rate of uncatalyzed mutarotation is insufficient for the metabolic needs of the organism. Indeed, deletion of the mutarotase gene from E. coli results in slow growth on minimal medium containing phenyl-β-d-galactopyranose as the sole carbon source (11Bouffard G.G. Rudd K.E. Adhya S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The first three-dimensional structure of a dimeric mutarotase, namely that from Lactococcus lactis, was reported in 2002 (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The enzyme was shown to adopt a β-sandwich motif, similar to that seen in domain 5 of β-galactosidase (25Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) with the sugar binding site located in a wide, shallow cleft. Five highly conserved residues (Arg-71, His-96, His-170, Asp-243, and Glu-304) were within hydrogen-bonding distance to the hydroxyl groups of the bound galactose ligand. Previous kinetic studies suggested that the reaction mechanism for the enzyme proceeds via an acid/base mechanism with a transient ring opening (26Bentley R. Bhate D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1225-1233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hucho F. Wallenfels K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the model of the mutarotase from L. lactis implicated Glu-304 as the likely catalytic base and either His-96 or His-170 as the catalytic acid (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the reaction mechanism of galactose mutarotase is thought to occur via abstraction of the proton from the C-1 hydroxyl group by Glu-304 in the L. lactis enzyme and protonation of the ring oxygen of the sugar by His-170, which results in ring opening. Subsequent rotation about the C-1-C-2 bond followed by a reversal of the ring opening events ultimately yields a product with an altered configuration at C-1 (28Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues (or their equivalents in the E. coli enzyme) have confirmed the role of Glu-304 as the catalytic base and established His-170 as the catalytic acid (28Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Beebe J.A. Arabshahi A. Clifton J.G. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4414-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The gene encoding the human enzyme was identified in 2003, and the protein product was characterized (30Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). From these investigations, it was suggested that Glu-307 and His-176 fulfill the roles in acid/base catalysis in the human mutarotase (30Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, regardless of the source, mutarotases tend to show a preference for galactose over glucose and have high kcat and Km values with this sugar (typically 104 - 105 s-1 and 10 - 100 mm, respectively) (23Bailey J.M. Fishman P.H. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 781-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Timson D.J. Reece R.J.

Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The preference of these enzymes for galactose over glucose was addressed structurally with the L. lactis mutarotase and, at least in the case of this bacterial protein, is explained by the existence of nonproductive binding modes in the active site for glucose and its derivatives (33Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With respect to quaternary structure, human mutarotase appears to be monomeric (10Wallenfels K. Herrmann K. Biochem. Z. 1965; 343: 294-306PubMed Google Scholar, 30Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas the L. lactis enzyme was shown to be a dimer on the basis of ultracentrifugation experiments (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The biochemical significance, if any, of these differences in quaternary structure is not understood at the present time.Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of human galactose mutarotase, both in the unbound state and complexed with its substrate, β-d-galactose. This study represents the first report of a eukaryotic mutarotase with bound sugar and allows for a detailed comparison between the human and the bacterial forms of the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of the Galactose Mutarotase Gene—The human galactose mutarotase gene was amplified from the originally described pET21-GALM plasmid (30Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using a forward primer designed with an NdeI restriction site at the start codon and a reverse primer with a XhoI restriction site after the stop codon. This construct allowed for insertion of the PCR product into the pTYB12 expression vector, which provides an N-terminal chitin-binding domain followed by a dithiothreitol-inducible intein (New England Biolabs). The recloning was done because diffraction-quality crystals could not be obtained with protein expressed from the pET21-GALM plasmid construct, which contained a noncleavable N-terminal polyhistidine tag.Protein Expression and Purification—For protein expression, the pTYB12-GALM plasmid was used to transform E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells (Novagen). A starter culture from a single colony was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin. Subsequently, 10 ml were transferred to 1000 ml of the supplemented LB medium in a 2-liter shaker flask and grown at 37 °C until an optical density of 0.8 was achieved at 600 nm. The cultures were cooled to 16 °C in an ice-water bath, and IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Homopipes, homopiperazine-N,N′-bis-2-(ethanesulfonic acid); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PEG, polyethylene glycol. was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cell growth was allowed to continue at 16 °C for an additional 15 h.The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells (50 g) were thawed in 150 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm NaH2PO4 and 500 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The thawed cells were placed in an ice bath and disrupted by four rounds of sonication (1-min duration each) separated by 5 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 100-ml column of chitin beads (New England Biolabs) that had been equilibrated previously with lysis buffer. The column was then washed with lysis buffer until the absorbance reading at 280 nm reached background level. The column was charged by washing with 200 ml of lysis buffer augmented with 100 mm dithiothreitol. The charged column was subsequently moved to room temperature, allowed to stand for 18 h, and then returned to 4 °C. The cleaved protein was eluted with lysis buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on purity, as judged by SDS-PAGE, and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The dialyzed protein was concentrated to 23.0 mg/ml based on the extinction coefficient of 0.85 ml·mg-1·cm-1 as calculated with the program Protean (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). A typical yield was between 80 and 100 mg of protein/50 grams of cells.Crystallization of Apogalactose Mutarotase—A search for crystallization conditions was conducted both at room temperature and at 4 °C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion utilizing an in-house-designed sparse matrix screen composed of 144 conditions. The best crystals were observed growing at 4 °C from polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG-8000) at pH 5.0. Large single crystals were subsequently obtained by seeding into batch experiments with precipitant solutions of 5-8% PEG-8000 buffered with 100 mm Homopipes (pH 5.0) and enzyme concentrations of 12 mg/ml. Diamond-shaped crystals grew to maximum dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm in 3-5 weeks. They belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 60.7 Å, b = 90.7 Å, c = 70.0 Å, and β = 102.5°. The asymmetric unit contained two monomers.Structural Analysis of Apogalactose Mutarotase—An x-ray data set was collected to 2.2 Å resolution at 4 °C with a Bruker HISTAR area detector system equipped with Supper “long” mirrors. The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were processed with XDS (34Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 35Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 67-71Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and internally scaled with XSCALIBRE. 2I. Rayment and G. Wesenberg, unpublished data. X-ray data collection statistics are presented in Table I. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMORE (36Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 645-653Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and using, as a search model, one subunit of the L. lactis enzyme (Protein Data Bank accession number 1L7J). Two peaks were readily identified in the rotation search. A subsequent translation search and rigid body refinement to 3.0 Å yielded an R-factor of 46%. To reduce model bias, the electron densities corresponding to the two monomers in the asymmetric unit were averaged with the software package AVE (37Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar, 38Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1994Google Scholar). From this averaged electron density map, a model for the complete monomer was constructed and then placed back into the unit cell for subsequent least squares refinement with TNT (39Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Alternate cycles of manual rebuilding and least square refinement reduced the R-factor to 17.4% for all measured x-ray data to 2.2 Å resolution.

This, however, led to cracking of the crystals and a marked change in lattice parameters and x-ray diffraction quality. Following these initial soaking experiments, crystals were grown by seeding into batch experiments with precipitant solutions of 5-8% PEG-8000 buffered with 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), 200 mm LiCl, and 100 mm d-galactose with enzyme concentrations of 12.0 mg/ml. The crystals of the apoenzyme were used for initial nucleation. Rod-like crystals appeared after 3-4 weeks and achieved maximum dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm. They belonged to the space group P1 with unit cell dimensions of a = 61.0 Å, b = 68.7 Å, c = 98.9 Å, α = 107.7°, β = 98.4°, and γ = 102.7° and contained four monomers in the asymmetric unit. Most likely the initial attempts at soaking crystals of space group P21 in solutions containing galactose resulted in a change of space group, thereby leading to the observed deterioration in the quality of the x-ray diffraction properties.An x-ray data set from a crystal of the enzyme-sugar complex was collected to 2.3 Å resolution at 4 °C, processed with SAINT (Bruker AXS, Inc.), and scaled as described previously. This protein-substrate complex structure was solved via molecular replacement with the software package AMORE (36Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 645-653Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and employing, as the search model, the x-ray coordinates for the apoenzyme. Iterative cycles of least square refinement with TNT (39Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar) and manual manipulation with TURBO (40Roussel A. Cambillau C. Biographics. AFMB, Marseille, France1992Google Scholar) reduced the R-factor to 16.9% for all observed data from 30.0 to 2.30 Å resolution. Refinement statistics are presented in Table II.Quality of the X-ray Models—The models for both the apo- and sugar-bound forms of human galactose mutarotase refined to low R-factors with excellent overall stereochemistry as indicated in Table II. Electron density was visible for all of the polypeptide chains (Met-1 to Ala-342) in the asymmetric unit, regardless of the space group. In several of the monomers, the Gly-His motifs left behind from the intein construct were visible. Only the polypeptide chain backbone from Lys-249 to Lys-252 was somewhat weaker in each monomer. A Ramachandran plot reveals only one significant outlier in either the apoenzyme or the protein/galactose monomers, namely Asn-81 with average ϕ, Ψ angles of 70° and -159°, respectively. The electron density corresponding to Asn-81 is unequivocal in each monomer, and, in fact, its side chain carboxamide group forms a hydrogen bond with the 2-hydroxyl group of bound β-d-galactose. This strained conformation is not a function of sugar binding because it is also observed in the apoenzyme model.Shown in Fig. 1 is the electron density corresponding to one of the β-d-galactose moieties in the P1 asymmetric unit. Each of the four sugars in the asymmetric unit was modeled into the electron density map in the β-anomeric configuration. Excluding the C-6 hydroxyl oxygens, the average B-values for the sugars are between 31.0 and 39.4 Å2. The C-6 hydroxyl oxygens refined to high B-values of 77.1, 89.3, 100, and 100 Å2. These higher temperature factors most likely reflect the fact that there are no direct hydrogen-bonding interactions between the protein and this portion of the substrate.Fig. 1Representative electron density. Electron density corresponding to the β-d-galactose moiety and surrounding amino acid residues is shown for monomer I in the x-ray coordinate file. The map was calculated with coefficients of the form (2Fo - Fc), where Fo and Fc were the native and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively. The map was contoured at 1σ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCrystals of the apo-form of galactose mutarotase belong to the space group P21 with two polypeptide chains per asymmetric unit. The α-carbons for these two monomers superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.17 Å and, as such, are essentially identical within experimental error. Hence, for the sake of simplicity, the following discussion will only refer to monomer I in the x-ray coordinate file. The chitin-binding domain/intein construct employed for protein expression and purification left a residual glycine and a histidine residue at the N terminus. These two residues are well ordered in monomer I but are not visible in the electron density for monomer II.Shown in Fig. 2a is a ribbon representation of the monomeric human enzyme, which has the overall dimensions of ∼60 × 40 × 55 Å. The polypeptide chain folds into a complicated series of 29 β-strands ranging in length from 2 to 11 amino acid residues. These strands are connected by a number of classical reverse turns including 12 type I, 4 type I′, 6 type II, 1 type II′, 1 type III, and 1 type III′. There are two α-helical regions defined by Leu-62 to Leu-66 and Leu-230 to Leu-234. cis-Peptide bonds are observed at Arg-78 and Pro-103. Arg-78 is located in a coil region connecting β-strands 6 and 7, whereas Pro-103 is positioned in the loop between β-strands 9 and 10. The side chain of Arg-78 points away from the active site cleft.Fig. 2Structure of human galactose mutarotase. A ribbon representation of the three-dimensional architecture exhibited by the apoenzyme is shown in a. For clarity, only the major strands of the β-sheet are displayed. Asterisks indicate the positions of cis-Arg-78 and cis-Pro-103. The location of the active site is depicted in b as a space-filling representation. Note that the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of galactose, from left to right and indicated by the red spheres, are solvent-exposed. The view is approximately the same as displayed in a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When crystals of human galactose mutarotase are grown in the presence of d-galactose, the space group changes from P21 to P1 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. These four monomers are, however, virtually identical, such that their α-carbons superimpose with r.m.s.d. values between 0.17 and 0.18 Å. The Gly-His motif at the N terminus is visible in the electron density for two of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit. Again, for the sake of simplicity, the following discussion will refer only to monomer I in the P1 asymmetric unit. Within experimental error, there are no significant structural changes in the enzyme that occur upon galactose binding. All main chain plus C-β atoms for the apo- and substrate-bound forms of galactose mutarotase correspond with a r.m.s.d. of 0.19 Å. The sugar moiety is situated in a shallow active site cleft with its 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups somewhat solvent-exposed (as shown in Fig. 2b).A close-up view of the region surrounding the sugar ligand is depicted in Fig. 3a. Those amino acid side chains responsible for anchoring the sugar to the protein include Asn-81, Arg-82, His-107, Asp-243, His-176, Gln-279, and Glu-307. A schematic diagram showing possible hydrogen bonding interactions between the protein and the ligand is presented in Fig. 3b. As predicted by Timson and Reece (30Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), Glu-307 is located within ∼2.8 Å of the 1-hydroxyl group of galactose and thus is in the proper position to serve as the catalytic base for proton abstraction. Likewise, His-176 lies at ∼2.8 Å from the ring oxygen and could possibly serve as a catalytic acid. The hydrogen bonding pattern displayed around the galactose moiety in the human enzyme is similar to that observed for the L. lactis mutarotasesugar complex (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The notable exceptions, however, are those interactions observed between the sugar and Asn-81 and Gln-279 in the human protein. The structurally equivalent residues in the L. lactis mutarotase are Gly-70 and Val-277, respectively. Recently, the structure of the apo-form of galactose mutarotase from Caenorhabditis elegans was solved to 1.85 Å resolution and the x-ray"

The control sequences conserved between mammalian insulin genes are acted upon by transcription factors, like PDX-1 and BETA-2, that are also involved in islet β cell function and formation. In the current study, we investigated the contribution to human insulin expression of the GG2 motif found between nucleotides -145 and -140 relative to the transcription start site. Site-specific mutants were generated within GG2 that displayed a parallel increase (i.e. -144 base pair) or decrease (i.e. -141 base pair) in insulin enhancer-driven reporter and gel shift binding activity in β cells consistent with human GG2 being under positive regulatory control. In contrast, the corresponding site in the rodent insulin gene, which only differs from the human at nucleotides -144 and -141, is negatively regulated by the Nkx2.2 transcription factor (Cissell, M. A., Zhao, L., Sussel, L., Henderson, E., and Stein, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 751-756). Human GG2 activator binding activity was present in nuclear extracts prepared from human islets and enriched in those from rodent β cell lines. The human GG2 activator binding factor(s) was shown to be ∼38-40 kDa and distinct from other size-matched islet-enriched transcription factors, including Nkx2.2, Pax-4, Cdx2/3, and Isl-1. Combined DNA chromatographic purification and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the GG2 activator was PDX-1. These results demonstrate that the GG2 element, despite its divergence from the core homeodomain consensus binding motif, is a site for PDX-1 activation in the human insulin gene.

Insulin is a polypeptide hormone critically involved in the control of glucose homeostasis and is synthesized exclusively by pancreatic islet β cells. Tissue-specific expression of the insulin gene has been shown in transgenic animals in vivo to be mediated by 5′-flanking sequences within 350 base pairs of the transcription start site that are ∼60% conserved between human and rodent (1Fromont-Racine M.

Each of these factors represent a distinct transcription factor family with DNA binding mediated by the homeodomain, basic helix-loop-helix, and basic leucine-zipper regions in PDX-1, BETA-2, and MafA, respectively. Gene ablation studies have revealed that each of the islet-enriched transcriptional activators of the insulin gene also mediate critical steps involved in both endocrine and exocrine pancreas formation (11Schwitzgebel V.M.

Thus, mice and humans lacking PDX-1 are apancreatic apparently due to an early arrest in endocrine and exocrine progenitor cell development (13Stoffers D.A. Zinkin N.T. Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L.

In addition, the PAX-6 homeodomain protein, which at least binds to and activates rodent insulin C2 (-329/-307 bp)-driven expression (17Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R.

Collectively these observations link essential insulin gene transcription factors with broader functions associated with β cell formation and physiology. The current work was focused on the GG2 element located between nucleotides -145 and -140 in the human insulin gene. Recently the corresponding region in the rodent gene was found to be negatively regulated by islet-enriched Nkx2.2, a homeodomain transcription factor of the NK-2 class (25Cissell M.A. Zhao L. Sussel L. Henderson E. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 751-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, earlier studies showed reduced human insulin enhancerdriven reporter activity from a GG2 deletion and block mutant, while in vitro DNase I footprinting indicated that a β cell-enriched factor of roughly 30 kDa was involved in control (34Tomonari A. Yoshimoto K. Mizusawa N. Iwahana H. Itakura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 35Tomonari A. Yoshimoto K. Tanaka M. Iwahana H. Miyazaki J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8285-8296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To more precisely examine the mechanism of human GG2-mediated control, a comprehensive series of directed mutations were made and analyzed in the context of a human insulin enhancer-driven reporter. These studies strongly suggested that human GG2 was under positive control by a protein(s) of ∼38-40 kDa that was present in nuclear extracts from human islets and enriched in rodent β cell lines. The binding site for the human GG2 activator also appeared to be distinct from other pancreas-enriched transcription factors and incapable of interacting with those of similar size, including Nkx2.2, Pax-4, Cdx2/3, and Isl-1. The GG2 activator was purified from a cultured β cell line by DNA affinity chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry to be PDX-1, a result confirmed by antibody and DNA binding competition analysis. These studies have identified an atypical PDX-1 binding site in the human insulin enhancer and demonstrated a fundamental difference in the regulation of the human and rodent insulin genes. Transfection Constructs—Insulin GG2-mediated activation was assayed from human insulin enhancer-driven firefly luciferase expression constructs that contained either wild type -251 to +2 bp sequences (-251 Luc WT) 1The abbreviations used are: Luc, luciferase; WT, wild type; BHK, baby hamster kidney; TK, thymidine kinase; hum, human; mut, mutant; Ins, insulin; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; Act, activator; Cons., consensus. (37Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar) or GG2 mutations. The -145/-142 block mutant (-155CCAGCACCAGTTCCATGGTCCGGAAA-130, mutated nucleotides are underlined), -144 mut A (-155CCAGCACCAGGTAAATGGTCCGGAAA-130), -144 mut B (-155CCAGCACCAGGCAAATGGTCCGGAAA-130), -141 mut A (-155CCAGCACCAGGGAACTGGTCCGGAAA-130), and -141 mut B (-155CCAGCACCAGGGAAGTGGTCCGGAAA-130) were constructed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Enzyme restriction digest and DNA sequencing analyses was utilized to determine the correctness of each construct. The -238 Luc WT construct contains rat insulin II sequences from -238 to +2 bp (38Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while -238 Luc (-133/-132 mut) contains an A to C change at nucleotides -133 and -132 (25Cissell M.A. Zhao L. Sussel L. Henderson E. Stein R.

Cell Culture and Transfection Analysis—Monolayer cultures of pancreatic islet β (βTC-3 (mouse), Min6 (mouse), HIT T-15 (hamster), and Ins-1 (rat)), α (αTC-6 (mouse)), and non-islet (BHK (hamster), HepG2 (human), HeLa (human),and NIH 3T3 (mouse)) cell lines were maintained as described previously (39Zhao L.

The LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was used to introduce Insulin-Luc (0.5 μg) and TK-Renilla Luc (phRL-TK, 10 ng) into βTC-3 and Min6 cells. The Luc activity from phRL-TK served as an internal transfection control. The luciferase measurements were made from cell extracts prepared 40-48 h after transfection using the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Each experiment was carried out at least three times with two independently isolated DNA preparations. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Human islet and cell line nuclear extracts were prepared by the Schreiber et al. (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W.

The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Distribution Program at the Washington University Medical School provided human islets. The TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to in vitro transcribe and translate the Nkx2.2, Cdx2/3, and Pax-4 from pNkx2.2 (25Cissell M.A. Zhao L. Sussel L. Henderson E. Stein R.

The binding analysis was performed with double-stranded oligonucleotides to WT human (hum) GG2 (-155CCAGCACCAGGGAAATGGTCCGGAAA-130), hum GG2 -144 mut A, hum GG2 -141 mut A, rat GG2 WT (-145CTAGCACCAGGCAAGTGTTTGGAAA-121), Nkx2.2 Consensus (GGTTTTTAAGTGGTTTTTGGG) (43Watada H.

The binding reactions (25-μl total volume) were conducted at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 μg of nuclear extract or 5 μl of in vitro translated protein and 400 fmol of 32P-radiolabeled probe in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Competition assays were performed under the same conditions except that an excess of competitor DNA to probe was included in the reaction prior to the addition of nuclear extract. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run in 1× TGE buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were then dried and visualized by autoradiography. SDS-PAGE Fractionation—βTC-3 nuclear extract (100 μg) was separated on a 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The lane containing the fractionated extract was cut horizontally into 3-mm pieces to represent different molecular weight fractions. The proteins were eluted overnight from the crushed gel slice at 4 °C by agitation in 100 μl of renaturation buffer (gel shift binding buffer plus 1% Triton and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin). The gel pieces were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed for human GG2 binding in the gel mobility shift assay. DNA Affinity Chromatography—The oligonucleotide trapping method (44Gadgil H. Jarrett H.W. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 966: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was modified for use with the Nkx2.2 Consensus M5 sequence containing a single TGTGTGTGTG tail at the 3′-end of the top strand, termed M5(TG)5. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. βTC-3 nuclear extract (10 mg) was incubated in 25 ml of gel shift binding buffer containing Tween 20 (5% final concentration) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, one tablet/50-ml total volume) and then applied to a column containing 5 ml of Sepharose 4B covalently linked to single-stranded ACACACACAC ((AC)5) DNA. The flow-through and early washes containing all of the human GG2 element binding activity were combined and incubated with M5(TG)5 DNA (200 fmol/10 mg of nuclear extract) and poly(dI-dC) (2 μg/pmol of M5(TG)5 DNA). The reaction was then applied to an (AC)5 DNA column (0.5 ml of Sepharose/μmol of M5(TG)5 DNA), and binding activity was analyzed over a 100 mm-1 m NaCl elution gradient. GG2 activator binding was detected at ∼200 mm NaCl. These fractions were combined, and the DNA affinity step was repeated. Proteins in the affinity-purified GG2 binding fractions were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The 38-40-kDa protein band(s) detected by Colloidal Blue staining (Invitrogen) was excised and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Protein Identification by Mass Spectroscopy—The 38-40-kDa protein band(s) was excised from the lane representing the fractions with peak activity along with a similar band from a neighboring fraction exhibiting no activity to serve as a negative control. Each band was separately cut into cubes, equilibrated in 50 mm NH4HCO3, reduced with dithiothreitol (3 mm in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 15 min), and alkylated with iodoacetamide (6 mm in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 15 min). The separate sets of gel cubes were then dehydrated with acetonitrile and rehydrated with 15 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.01 μg/μl modified trypsin (Promega), and trypsin digestion was carried out for >2 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were then desalted and concentrated into 2 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Millipore), and then 0.4 μl was applied to a target plate and overlaid with 0.4 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry were carried out using a Voyager 4700 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in reflectron mode. For intact peptide mass analysis, the mass spectra were calibrated to within 20 ppm using trypsin autolytic peptides present in the sample (m/z = 842.51, 1045.56, and 2211.09 daltons). Peptides unique to the sample generated from the peak activity fraction were used for data base interrogation against the Swiss-Prot and National Center for Biotechnology non-redundant data bases using the MASCOT algorithm. These included m/z = 791.45, 797.42, 863.45, 893.37, 943.55, 1145.62, 1161.61, 1543.86, 1559.86, 1863.86, and 1978.91, which generated an unambiguous match to mouse IPF1/PDX-1 (SwissProt P52946, MOWSE score = 141 with partial oxidation of methionine and complete carbamidomethylation of cysteine; 29% sequence coverage). Fragmentation spectra generated from the parent ions at m/z = 863.45 (193IWQFNR198), 893.37 (16DPCAFQR22), 1161.61 (116VQLPFPWM*K124), and 1863.86 (133GQWAGGAYRAEPEENKR149) validated the predicted amino acid sequences. Peptide ions present in both the sample and the negative control were derived from heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3 (Swiss-Prot Q8BG05, data not shown). Identification of GG2 Sequences That Regulate Human Insulin Enhancer-driven Expression—To investigate how the GG2 element influences human insulin gene expression, a series of mutations in GG2 (-145/-140 bp) were constructed in a reporter driven by -251 to +2 bp of the human gene (termed -251 Luc). Human GG2 mutant activity was compared in transfected βTC-3 and Min6 β cells with the rat insulin II GG2 mutant, -238 Luc (-133/-132 mut). A block mutation within human GG2 resulted in an ∼80% reduction in reporter activity, whereas the rat element mutant was ∼2-3-fold more active (Fig. 1B). Because of the different regulatory behavior of the human and rat GG2 mutants, site-directed transversion (type A) and rat insulin II conversion (type B) mutants in human -251 Luc were constructed at the non-identical bp -144 and bp -141 sequences (Fig. 1). Both of the bp -141 mutants decreased activity to a level similar to the block mutation. Conversely the bp -144 mutants resulted in 3-4-fold activation over wild type (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that human insulin nucleotides -145 to -141 are part of the functional core of the GG2 element. An Islet β Cell-enriched Protein(s) Stimulates Human GG2 Activity—Gel mobility shift assays were performed to determine the binding properties of the factor(s) associated with human GG2. Binding to both human and rat II GG2 element sequences was analyzed in βTC-3 nuclear extracts. The islet-enriched Nkx2.2 transcription factor binds to and negatively regulates rat GG2 (25Cissell M.A. Zhao L. Sussel L. Henderson E. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 751-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, Nkx2.2 did not appear to bind to the human GG2 probe using βTC-3 extracts; instead a unique slower mobility complex was principally formed (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore in vitro synthesized Nkx2.2 did not bind human GG2 (Fig. 2B) nor did rat GG2 compete with human GG2 for the slower mobility complex (Fig. 2C). This human-specific complex was not found with either bp -141 mutant, whereas enhanced binding was observed with both bp -144 mutants (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The Nkx2.2 consensus binding sequence also competed very effectively for the human-specific GG2 complex (Fig. 2C, compare Nkx2.2 Cons. with -144 mut). Strikingly the roughly 4-fold increase in human-specific complex binding achieved with the bp -144 mutants was also similar to their effect on insulin enhancer-driven activity (Fig. 1B). In contrast, neither bp -141 mutant was capable of competing with wild type human GG2 for binding to this β cell factor(s), while a wild type behavior was observed with divergent bp -138 mutant competitors (data not shown), indicating that nucleotides -145 to -140 contain the principal binding sequences. This competition analysis also demonstrated that there was no regulatory binding specificity to any of the other human GG2 complexes. Importantly, as GG2 complex binding paralleled regulation of -251 Luc in transfection assays, we conclude that this element is a site for positive control in the human insulin gene. The unique human GG2 binding complex was termed GG2 activator, abbreviated GG2 Act. To obtain insight into the distribution of GG2 Act, nuclear extracts from various islet β and non-β cell lines were analyzed for binding. GG2 Act binding activity was found in all of the tested rodent β cell lines (βTC-3, Min6, Ins-1, and HIT T-15) but not islet α (αTC-6), kidney (BHK), liver (HepG2), cervical cancer (HeLa), or fibroblast (NIH 3T3) cell lines (Fig. 3A). Wild type and mutant human GG2 competition analysis was used to distinguish the specific GG2 Act regulatory complex (i.e. β cells) from nonspecific (e.g. HepG2) (data not shown). Human β cell lines have not been isolated, and as a consequence it is not possible to directly determine the presence of GG2 Act in these cells. However, a slightly faster migrating complex (human GG2 Act) was found in human islet nuclear extracts, which would primarily represent β cells and to a lesser extent α, δ, and pancreatic polypeptide (Fig. 3B). Furthermore competition analysis demonstrated that this complex displayed the same binding specificity as GG2 Act of rodent β cell lines (Fig. 3B). Collectively these results suggest that the GG2 Act factor(s) is enriched in mammalian pancreatic islet β cells. GG2 Act Is a 38-40-kDa Factor Distinct from Pax-4, Cdx2/3, and Isl-1—To determine the approximate size of GG2 Act, βTC-3 nuclear extract was first size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The lane containing fractionated extract was then cut into slices, each containing proteins representing a particular size range. The proteins eluted from each gel slice were analyzed for GG2 Act activity. A binding activity of around 38-40 kDa was found that co-migrated with GG2 activity in unfractionated βTC-3 nuclear extract (Fig. 4, compare Fraction 11 with unfractionated (UNF)) and displayed the appropriate specificity (data not shown). These data indicated that GG2 Act is composed of one or more proteins of ∼38-40 kDa, a similar size range to that previously estimated for the human GG2 activator (34Tomonari A. Yoshimoto K. Mizusawa N. Iwahana H. Itakura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Of the characterized pancreas-enriched transcription factors, Cdx2/3, Pax-4, and Isl-1 all fall within or near the appropriate size range predicted for the GG2 Act binding factor. To determine whether Pax-4 or Cdx2/3 were capable of binding the human GG2 element, each was in vitro translated and analyzed in gel mobility shift assays. Although neither of these factors bound the human GG2 probe, specific binding to control probes was observed (Fig. 5). In addition, antiserum raised against Isl-1 had no effect on the formation of GG2 Act (data not shown). Biochemical Purification and Identification of GG2 Act by Mass Spectrometry—Since GG2 Act appeared to be regulated by a novel β cell-enriched factor, a DNA affinity chromatography approach was used to determine its identity. Successful isolation of factors via this method requires the use of a high affinity DNA probe for efficient binding complex retention. The Nkx2.2 consensus element appeared to be of use in this process since it competed for GG2 Act binding even more effectively than the bp -144 mutant of human GG2 (Fig. 2C). One diffuse binding complex was principally formed with the Nkx2.2 consensus probe using βTC-3 nuclear extract (Fig. 6B). Howev"

However, when HL-60 cells are induced to differentiate to granulocytes by treatment with retinoic acid (RA), they express CD38 and accumulate cADPR. Both processes play a causal role in RA-induced differentiation. Other granulocyte differentiation-inducers, including dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), fail to induce CD38 expression. We investigated whether treatment of HL-60 cells with Me2SO involves any changes in the cADPR/intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) signaling system and, specifically, whether Me2SO affects those nucleoside transporters (NT) (both equilibrative (ENT) and concentrative (CNT)) that mediate influx of extracellular cADPR. Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of transcripts, binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) to intact cells, and influx experiments of extracellular cADPR (with selective inhibitors of NT as NBMPR or in specific conditions) were performed in native and Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells. The native cells showed uptake of cADPR across ENT2, whereas influx of cADPR into the Me2SO-differentiated cells occurred mostly by concentrative processes mediated by CNT3 and by an NBMPR-inhibitable concentrative NT designated cs-csg. Me2SO-differentiated, but not native HL-60 cells, accumulated cADPR and showed increased [Ca2+]i levels when grown in a transwell co-culture setting over CD38-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts where nanomolar cADPR concentrations are present in the medium. NBMPR inhibited both responses of Me2SO-induced cells. Thus, concentrative influx of extracellular cADPR across CNT3 and cs-csg NT could substitute in the absence of CD38 in eliciting cADPR-dependent [Ca2+]i increases in granulocyte-differentiated HL-60 cells, as well as in other CD38– cells.

Both cADPR and NAADP+ are powerful, universal calcium-mobilizing metabolites and behave as the second messengers of many agonists, thereby modulating a wide number of calcium-mediated cell processes (reviewed in Refs. 5Lee H.C.

Both CD38 and BST-1, sharing significant sequence identity, feature two important properties (9Lee H.C. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-Ribose and NAADP: Structures, Metabolism, and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002Crossref Google Scholar). (i) They are multifunctional enzymes able to generate cADPR and to hydrolyze cADPR to ADP-ribose. (ii) Both are ectoenzymes. The latter property has prompted studies aimed at defining two major topological inconsistencies of the CD38/cADPR system. (i) The apparent unavailability of the substrate NAD+ to the ectocellular active site of CD38 and (ii) generation of cADPR at sites opposite to cADPR-responsive Ca2+ stores and gated by the ryanodine receptors (RyR) (either the extracellular environment or the intravesicular space of intracellular membrane vesicles, Ref. 14De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1149-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These investigations led to the discovery that the CD38/cADPR system is a remarkably compartmentalized one and that a number of previously unrecognized transporters can translocate NAD+ and cADPR, thereby circumventing both topological restrictions (15De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-Ribose and NAADP: Structure, Metabolism, and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002: 241-267Crossref Google Scholar). Specifically, NAD+ proved to be transported in a calcium-regulated manner, according to an equilibrative mechanism by hexameric hemichannels of connexin 43 (Cx43) that allow it to access the active site of CD38 (16Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 17Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Zocchi E. Contini P. Bisso A. Usai C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48300-48308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, cADPR showed a surprising redundancy of transporters. Native, transmembrane CD38 itself is a homodimer acting as a catalytically active transporter of cADPR, i.e. as an enzyme that couples cADPR generation at its ectocellular active site with subsequent concentrative channeling of this product across the plasma membrane (18Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Usai C. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, cADPR was also demonstrated to cross the plasma membrane of a number of CD38– cells through some members of the wide family of nucleoside transporters, both equilibrative (ENT) and concentrative (CNT). Specifically, among these promiscuous transporters, ENT2, CNT2, and a not yet molecularly characterized nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-inhibitable nucleoside transporting system proved to mediate translocation of cADPR in CD38– cells, independent of the concentrative transport catalyzed by CD38 (19Guida L. Bruzzone S. Sturla L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47097-47105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The functional interplay among some of these nucleotide transporters, notably Cx43 hemichannels and CD38, can increase the levels of [Ca2+]i, as shown by recent uncoupling experiments on 3T3 fibroblasts lacking individually CD38 or Cx43 (17Bruzzone S.

These and other results demonstrated that an enhanced subcellular trafficking of NAD+ and cADPR can upregulate [Ca2+]i levels and accordingly some calcium-mediated functions (15De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-Ribose and NAADP: Structure, Metabolism, and Physiological Functions. Kluwer Acad., Norwell, MS2002: 241-267Crossref Google Scholar). However, the same transporters, including the cADPR-translocating CNT, are also responsible for an extracellular trafficking, whereas some cADPR-generating cells can target neighboring, even CD38– but RyR+ cells, so as to induce into them significant cADPR-related increases of [Ca2+]i and of calcium-mediated cell functions. These include increased contractility of smooth myocytes (20Franco L. Bruzzone S. Song P. Guida L. Zocchi E. Walseth T.F. Crimi E. Usai C. De Flora A. Brusasco V. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, Munshi et al. (24Munshi C.B. Graeff R. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49435-49458Google Scholar) demonstrated that CD38 expression in the constitutive CD38– human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and the consequent intracellular accumulation of cADPR play a causal role in mediating its granulocytic differentiation induced by RA. These results and our recent observation that extracellular cADPR, even at extremely low concentrations, triggers expansion of human hemopoietic progenitors (23Zocchi E. Podestà M. Pitto A. Usai C.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether cADPR can be internalized by HL-60 cells across some NT. The striking differences between native and differentiated HL-60 cells suggested an investigation of both cell populations in terms of NT expression and of cADPR influx. The results obtained in this study provide evidence that the undifferentiated and the dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-differentiated HL-60 cells differ significantly in both parameters. The comparatively enhanced influx of extracellular cADPR that occurs in differentiated cells is accounted for by overexpression of CNT3 and of the NBMPR-inhibitable CNT system designated as cs-csg (25Paterson A.R.

After 90 min of incubation at 22 °C, 400-μl aliquots were collected and rapidly filtered on a prewashed glass fiber filter (Whatman, Maidenstone, UK). Filters containing the retained cells were washed with 5.0 ml of ice-cold Na+ buffer and analyzed to determine [3H]NBMPR content by liquid scintillation counting. Free NBMPR was determined from the radioactivity present in 100 μlofthe incubation buffer at the end of the binding assay. Specific binding was determined as the difference between the total binding of [3H]NBMPR to the cells and the [3H]NBMPR binding in the presence of excess non-isotopic NBMPR (nonspecific binding). Parameters of NBMPR binding were obtained from Scatchard plots of bound/free versus bound NBMPR (33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17833) Google Scholar). Non-linear plots were resolved graphically by the method of Rosenthal (34Rosenthal H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-Polymerase Chain Reaction Analyses— Total RNA from both native and Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells was isolated using the RNase Mini Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and treated with RNase-free DNase-set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT reactions were performed using Thermoscript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen); 4 μg of total RNA were denatured in the presence of 1 mm dNTP and 50 pmol of oligo(dT)20 for 5 min at 65 °C, then incubated in the appropriate buffer (1× cDNA synthesis buffer) with 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (RNaseOUTTM) and 15 units of ThermoScriptTM at 50 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by incubation for 5 min at 85 °C, and the cDNA was treated with 2 units of RNase H (Invitrogen). The resulting total cDNA was then amplified by PCR to analyze the mRNA expression of the five cloned nucleoside transporters (ENT1, ENT2, CNT1, CNT2, CNT3), using the gene-specific primer pairs reported previously (19Guida L. Bruzzone S. Sturla L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47097-47105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were run in 25-μl reaction volumes containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy) and using 10 pmol of the specific primers (TibMolBiol, Genova, Italy). The PCR conditions for all cDNAs were as follows: an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, for 35 cycles, and then a final elongation step was performed at 72 °C for 7 min. The results of PCR amplification, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, were visualized using the Chemi Doc System (Bio-Rad). Gene RulerTM 100-bp DNA Ladder (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD) was used as a standard marker. Semiquantitative PCR Analyses of CNT3 and ENT2 Transcripts— The cDNA equivalent of 50 ng of starting RNA from undifferentiated and Me2SO -differentiated HL-60 cells was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (19Guida L. Bruzzone S. Sturla L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47097-47105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for human CNT3 (hCNT3), ENT2 (hENT2), ENT1 (hENT1), and β-actin as internal control. The PCR incubation was performed as described above, and PCR conditions for cDNAs were: 30 s, 94 °C; 30 s, 58 °C; 1 min, 72 °C, for a number of cycles optimized for each gene (30 cycles for CNT3, 28 cycles for ENT2 and 22 cycles for ENT1 and β-actin). The abundance of PCR products was semiquantified by densitometric scanning of the ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels using Chemi Doc System, and the cDNA fragments corresponding to each amplified gene was compared between native and Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells. Transient Transfection of COS-7 Cells with Human CNT3 cDNA—Total RNA from Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells was purified, and the reverse transcription reaction was performed as described above (see reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses). The following primers were used to amplify full-length human cDNA CNT3 (GenBankTM accession number AF305210): sense, 5′-CACCAAGAGCATGGAGCTGAGGAG-3′ (nucleotide positions 87–106); antisense, 5′-TCAGAGTTCCACTGGAGAAGTG-3′ (nucleotide positions 2197–2176). PCR amplification was performed in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 1 mm MgSO4, 300 μm dNTP, 15 pmol of primers, and using 1.25 units of AccuPrimeTM Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 95 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 3 min, for 35 cycles. The 2.11-kb PCR product was cloned in the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO using the pcDNA3.1 Directional TOPO expression kit (Invitrogen). The plasmid obtained was sequenced on both strands of cDNA to verify the presence of correct insert. The pcDNA3.1 plasmid and the pcDNA3.1/CNT3 construct were transfected into COS-7 cells by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were collected, and the expression of CNT3 and β-actin (as internal control) was monitored by RT-PCR, performed as described above. Co-cultures of Native and Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 Cells over 3T3 CD38–/+Feeder Cells—Both native and Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells (2.0 ml), after 4 days of treatment, were seeded in transwell plates (2.5-cm diameter; 0.4-μm pore size) on pre-established (1.0 ml) confluent feeder layers of CD38+/– 3T3 cells (transfected with the sense or antisense cDNA for human CD38–, Ref. 28Zocchi E.

HL-60 cells were recovered, washed once with 5.0 ml of PBS, resuspended in 300 μl of water, and sonicated for 30 s at 3 watts in ice. A 20-μl aliquot was used for protein determination. Perchloric acid was then added at a final 0.6 m concentration to cell lysates. cADPR content of the samples was determined by the enzymatic cycling assay (31Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric Determination of Intracellular Calcium [Ca2+]i Concentrations—HL-60 cells co-cultured 48 h over 3T3 CD38+/– feeder cells were recovered from the transwells (about 106 cells for undifferentiated samples and 0.5 × 106 for Me2SO-differentiated samples), washed twice in 5.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1.0 ml of fresh complete medium, and incubated in the presence of Fura2-AM (10 μm) for 45 min at 37 °C. Fura2-loaded cells were washed twice in 3.0 ml of zero calcium solution (35Podestà M. Zocchi E. Pitto A. Usai C. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. Scadden D.T. Walseth T.F. De Flora A.

Calcium measures were performed in a 2.0-ml cuvette under continuous stirring in zero calcium solution as described (35Podestà M. Zocchi E. Pitto A. Usai C. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Guida L.

Statistical analysis of different calcium (values) was performed using one-way analysis of variance. p values were considered statistically significant when < 0.05. Distinctive Expression of Equilibrative and Concentrative Nucleoside Transporters in Native and Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 Cells—Native, CD38– (29Kontani K. Nishina H. Ohoka Y. Takahashi K. Katada T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49435-49458Google Scholar) and is RA-specific. Other differentiation-inducing agents, e.g. Me2SO (granulocyte differentiation-inducing) and PMA, a macrophage differentiation inducer, Ref. 29Kontani K. Nishina H. Ohoka Y. Takahashi K. Katada T. J.

Conversely, HL-60 cells induced to differentiate by treatment with both Me2SO and PMA exhibit a decrease of equilibrative nucleoside transport (30Ritzel M.W. Ng A.M. Yao S.Y. Graham K. Loewen S.K.

We first analyzed the mRNA expression of the five molecularly defined human NT (hNT), both equilibrative (ENT1 and ENT2) and concentrative (CNT1, CNT2, and CNT3), in native HL-60 cells and, by comparison, in the same cells induced to differentiate with Me2SO, RA, and PMA, respectively.

The signaling pathway(s) that regulate platelet procoagulant activity are largely unknown, although they are distinct from platelet aggregatory signals linked to fibrinogen ligation to the conformationally active αIIBβ3 integrin. We describe a novel intracellular signaling mechanism involving platelet IQGAP1 that specifically regulates the development of platelet procoagulant activity under conditions of mechanical shear stress. Murine platelets that are deficient in IQGAP1 demonstrate increased prothrombinase activity compared with wild-type littermate controls when activated by a physiological shear stress of 16 dynes/cm2 (shear rates of 1600 s-1) (p < 0.0001), corresponding to ∼2.5 times the normal shear stress, or ∼40% degree of stenosis in coronary arteries. The exaggerated prothrombinase activity is not associated with enhanced platelet microvesiculation (cytoskeletal proteolysis) and occurs independently of the intracellular calcium release, [Ca2+]i, but it is specifically coupled to the α-granule exocytic pathway without concomitant effects on aminophospholipid exposure. These observations identify platelet IQGAP1 as an important modulator of normal hemostasis and as an appropriate pharmacological target for control of platelet procoagulant function.

These observations identify platelet IQGAP1 as an important modulator of normal hemostasis and as an appropriate pharmacological target for control of platelet procoagulant function. The hemostatically neutral surface of quiescent platelets is preserved by an aminophospholipid translocase that maintains phosphatidylserine (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; PAR, protease-activated receptor; PMP, platelet microparticle; mIQGAP, murine IQGAP; GFP, gel-filtered platelet; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HBMT, HEPES-buffered modified Tyrode's solution; BAPTA-AM, cell-permeant 5,5′-dimethylacetoxymethyl ester. and phosphatidylethanolamine within the inner platelet leaflet and phosphatidylcholine on the outer leaflet. This asymmetry is abolished by thrombin, collagen, and ionophores, presumably related to changes in the intracytosolic calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i. The rapid loss of membrane asymmetry is mediated by a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase (with inhibition of the translocase), resulting in rapid bidirectional movement of phospholipids, the appearance of procoagulant PS, and an ∼6-log acceleration of α-thrombin generation via the assembly of cell surface prothrombinase (1Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J. Freyssinet J.-M. Nurden A.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11625-11634Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The importance of the sudden reversal of this membrane phospholipid in the maintenance of normal hemostasis is best exemplified by Scott's syndrome. This syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder caused by an uncharacterized molecular defect associated with a platelet procoagulant deficiency, which is related to defective membrane PS movement (3Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Esmon C.T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17049-17057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the aggregatory potential of platelet agonists (mediated by fibrinogen ligation to the conformationally active αIIbβ3 integrin) is distinct from that linked to exposure of the aminophospholipids PS and phosphatidylethanolamine. In thrombin-activated human platelets, for example, PS exposure is mediated by protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), with little or no contribution from PAR4 (2Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J. Freyssinet J.-M. Nurden A.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11625-11634Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Andersen H. Greenberg D. Fujikawa K. Wenfeng X. Chung D. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11189-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Platelet microvesiculation (generation of platelet microparticles (PMP)) is closely associated with the exposure of anionic PS on the outer surface of the platelet, thereby considerably enhancing the surface area for activation of the coagulation cascade. PMPs can be generated from high shear stress and are able to cross-activate platelets and endothelial cells, and they are elevated in patients with increased thromboembolic risk and in the subsets of those patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (1Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J. Freyssinet J.-M. Nurden A.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11625-11634Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A causal role for PMPs in thrombosis, however, has been difficult to establish because platelet microvesiculation is intimately associated with platelet activation and aggregation. Although the molecular basis of microvesiculation remains poorly characterized, it appears to be calcium-dependent, requires cytoskeletal reorganization, is associated with calpain and caspase-3 activation, and is morphologically similar to the membrane blebbing and phospholipid exposure phase of nucleated cell apoptosis (5Wolf B. Goldstein J. Stennicke H. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G. Salvesen G. Green D. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of PMP generation remains unknown, although the molecular pathway appears to be distinct from that regulating PS exposure or platelet exocytosis and is associated with cytoskeletal proteolysis (1Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J. Freyssinet J.-M. Nurden A.T.

Mammalian IQGAPs are conserved homologues of an extended family of proteins; their counterparts in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Iqg1p/Cyk1p) and amoebae (Dictyostelium discoideum DdGAP1) have key roles in actomyosin ring formation and cytokinesis. Two homologous IQGAPs have been identified and characterized, although expression of IQGAP1 appears broad compared with the previously described hepatocyte-restricted distribution of IQGAP2 (6Weissbach L.

IQGAPs are multidomain scaffolding proteins that presumably integrate intracellular signals with actin polymerization by interactions with the Rho GTPases rac1 and cdc42 (through Ras-GAP-related homology domains, or GRD), Ca2+/calmodulin (through IQ motifs), and F-actin (through calponin homology domains). Interactions with E-cadherin (8Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa K. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K.

Our data now link IQGAP1 to a shear stress-restricted (mechanoreceptor) signaling pathway of platelet activation, specifically regulating the procoagulant properties of the platelet membrane. Murine Functional Studies—All animal studies were completed in accordance with approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. mIQGAP1-/- mice and inbred wild-type littermate controls were expanded and maintained on an SV129 background and genotyped by PCR (11Li S. Wang Q. Chakladar A. Bronson R. Bernards A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Blood was removed by retro-orbital puncture into 0.1 volume of acid/citrate/dextrose supplemented with 0.1 μm prostaglandin E1, and gel-filtered platelets (GFP) were isolated over a Sepharose 2B column as described previously (12Gnatenko D. Dunn J. McCorkle S. Weissmann P. Perrotta P. Bahou W. Blood. 2003; 101: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Protein-solubilized lysates were generated from liquid nitrogen snap-frozen livers or GFP (1 × 109 platelets), and immunoblot analysis was completed by 4-15% SDS-PAGE using anti-IQGAP1 (1:500 dilution) (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-IQGAP2 (1:1000) (Upstate Biotechnologies) antibodies, which were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Complete hemograms were determined using automated Coulter counters, and the F-actin content of GFP was determined by flow cytometry using fixed and permeabilized platelets incubated with 30 units/ml FITC-phalloidin (13Schmidt V.A. Scudder L. Devoe C. Bernards A. Cupit L.D. Bahou W. Blood. 2003; 101: 3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy was completed using 1 × 109 GFP fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. After postfixation in a freshly prepared solution of 1% (w/v) osmic acid, alcohol-dehydrated samples were pelleted and embedded in an Epon-812 resin mixture, and thin sections were examined in a blinded fashion. Platelet Functional Studies—Gel-filtered platelets in HEPES-buffered modified Tyrode's (HBMT) solution (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% dextrose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were rested at 37 °C for 30 min prior to use and then supplemented with 80 μg/ml human fibrinogen prior to aggregometry (with stirring) using a 4-channel Chronulog aggregometer. Agonists included human α-thrombin (∼3500 units/mg; 10-nm ∼1 unit/ml), PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF, fibrillar collagen (Hormon-Chemie), or ADP (Sigma). Microspectrofluorimetry was completed in 96-well microtiter plates using a FLEXStation (Molecular Devices). GFP (1 × 107/well) were gently centrifuged (800 × g) into individual wells and loaded with Fluo-3 (Flex reagent, Molecular Devices) for 30 min at 37 °C, and kinetic data were analyzed using Soft-MaxPro software. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. from quadruplicate wells, and statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Platelet calmodulin activity assays were determined from platelet-rich plasma prepared in 0.5 μm prostaglandin E1 as described previously (14Thompson W. Terasaki W. Epstein P. Strada S. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 69-92PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, platelets were resuspended at 3 × 108 platelets/ml in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 and freeze-thawed twice, and supernatants were isolated after centrifugation. Assays were completed in duplicate using calmodulin-dependent chicken gizzard phosphodiesterase for cyclic AMP generation, and determinations were made from the linear portion of the standard curve using pure porcine testis calmodulin as the standard. Flow Cytometric Analyses—FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD41 monoclonal antibody (integrin αIIbβ3 chain) and FITC-conjugated anti-CD62 (P-selectin) were purchased from Pharmingen. CD41 was used for delineating platelet gates, and debris and dead cells were excluded using scatter gates. PS exposure of intact and microvesiculated platelets was quantified by annexin-V binding. Briefly, appropriately treated platelets were incubated with 0.0125 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin V in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark followed by FACScan analysis using logarithmic gain settings for light scatter and fluorescence (BD Biosciences). For all studies, 10,000 gated events were acquired; forward and side scatter and fluorochrome binding were used for delineation and quantification of platelets and platelet-derived microparticles. Prothrombinase Determinations and Shear Activation—Quantitative assessment of phosphatidylserine exposure was completed using both annexin-V binding (see above) and a modified prothrombinase assay using acetylated prothrombin (15Jesty J. Bluestein D. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Jesty J. Yin W. Perrotta P. Bluestein D. Platelets. 2003; 3: 143-149Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Acetylated prothrombin retains <0.1% clotting activity (and is thereby defective in platelet activation) but is activable by factor Xa in the presence of platelet factor Va to produce thrombin activity measured by cleavage of the chromogenic substrate tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Chromozym-TH; Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 0.1-ml samples of GFP (4 × 104/μl, subjected to various agonists or exposure to shear stress) in Ca2+-free HBMT were incubated with 200 nm acetylated prothrombin, 5 mm Ca2+, 100 pm factor Xa, and individual agonists for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, duplicate 20-μl aliquots were assayed, using 0.3 mm Chromozyme-TH for thrombin generation, by reading in a microplate reader. All samples were individually normalized to parallel determinations using the same GFP (agonist or shear-exposed) activated with 5 μm ionomycin. Flow-dependent (shear stress) prothrombinase activities were determined using polytetrafluoroethylene tubing in a circulating flow loop as described previously (16Jesty J. Yin W. Perrotta P. Bluestein D. Platelets. 2003; 3: 143-149Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GFP (2 × 104/μl) were resuspended in 2.3 ml of Ca2+-free HBMT supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and activated for various times and shear rates at 37 °C, and duplicate 20-μl aliquots were then removed for assays. The result of a single shear loop represents the platelet activation rate, determined by linear regression. The statistical significance of mean platelet activation rates between wild type and mIQGAP1-/- was calculated using a paired Student's t test. For calcium chelation, GFPs were preloaded with 50 μm BAPTA-AM (cell-permeant 5,5′-dimethylacetoxymethyl ester) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37 °C followed by a second gel filtration step prior to shear activation (or microspectrofluorimetry using 1 nm α-thrombin). For some experiments, determining prothrombinase activity of the microparticle fractions was carried out in parallel using the supernatants of samples centrifuged at 10,000 × g (flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated anti-CD41 confirmed the presence of <2% intact platelets in micro-particulate fractions). Control experiments on uncirculated platelets showed no detectable prothrombinase activity. IQGAP Characterization in Murine Platelets—We have previously identified both IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 in human platelets and demonstrated that IQGAP2 activation is restricted to platelet stimulation by thrombin (13Schmidt V.A. Scudder L. Devoe C. Bernards A. Cupit L.D. Bahou W. Blood. 2003; 101: 3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the mIQGAP1 gene has been described previously, with no evident phenotypic consequences except for gastric hyperplasia (11Li S. Wang Q. Chakladar A. Bronson R. Bernards A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis using either murine liver or platelet lysates established that murine platelets specifically express mIQGAP1, with no evidence for mIQGAP2 expression (Fig. 1). These expression patterns are distinct from those of human platelets, which express both IQGAP1 and IQGAP2. Furthermore, there are no compensatory changes in mIQGAP2 expression levels in mIQGAP1-/- platelets. Complete blood counts from 30 mice (wild type (n = 10)), mIQGAP1+/- heterozygotes (n = 9), and mIQGAP1-/- (n = 11) demonstrated no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, mean platelet volumes, platelet F-actin content, or morpholoy as evaluated by Wright-Giemsa staining or transmission electron microscopy. Similarly, in a comparison of heterozygote, wild-type controls (n = 3 in each arm), and mIQGAP1-/- platelets, platelet aggregometry using gel-filtered platelets demonstrated small but nonreproducible differences in agonist-induced hyperresponsiveness. These results were most evident using strong receptor agonists such as thrombin or fibrillar collagen (known to activate platelets via members of the PAR family or the glycoprotein VI/FcγR-chain receptor tyrosine kinase complex, respectively) and, when evident, were manifest by a more rapid initial slope, with slightly exaggerated amplitudes (data not shown). Exaggerated Calcium Mobilization in mIQGAP1-/- Platelets—Because IQGAP1 is known to bind Ca2+/calmodulin via four homologous IQ motifs (IQXXXRGXXXR) (17Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), microspectrofluorimetry was completed to establish the effect of IQGAP1 deficiency on intracellular calcium responses ([Ca2+]i) in agonist-stimulated platelets. Initial studies using gel-filtered platelets from mIQGAP1-/- mice demonstrated exaggerated elevations of intracytosolic calcium compared with wild-type controls at both concentrations of thrombin (1 and 10 nm). Subsequent experiments using both male and female mice (n = 3 in each arm) confirmed these results, extending these observations to platelet stimulation using the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF (Fig. 2). The exaggerated responses were readily evident in the rate of cytosolic calcium release and were concentration-dependent, using both thrombin and the PAR4-activating peptide. Because IQGAP1 is a major calmodulin-binding protein, we sought to exclude the possibility that these exaggerated [Ca2+]i responses were caused by secondary changes in cytosolic calmodulin concentrations. As seen in Fig. 2, calmodulin concentrations were essentially identical between mIQGAP1-/- and wild-type platelets and comparable with those previously determined in human platelets (19MacNeil S. Walker S. Seid J. Tomlinson S. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Shear Stress-restricted Defect in mIQGAP1-/- Platelet Procoagulant Activity—Platelet procoagulant activity is intimately associated with the calcium-induced microvesiculation that parallels the generation of the prothrombinase complex, although the two endpoints are independently regulated molecular events (20Bucki R. Bachelot-Loza C. Zachowski A. Giraud F. Sulpice J.-C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15383-15391Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Gaffet P. Bettache N. Bienvenu A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10448-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas microvesiculation requires cytoskeletal proteolysis, assembly of the prothrombinase complex is contingent on two processes: (i) the release of activated platelet factor V from the storage pool found within α-granules (see below), and (ii) exposure of aminophospholipids, including negatively charged PS. Different platelet agonists cause the extent of PS exposure to vary. For example, ionophores typically effect maximum exposure followed by fibrillar collagen and thrombin; PS exposure is also known to result from mechanical shear stress (22Miyazaki Y. Nomura S. Miyake T. Kagawa H. Kitada C. Taniguchi H. Komiyama Y. Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Fukuhara S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3456-3664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further dissect the relationship of the exaggerated [Ca2+]i release in response to PS exposure, platelets were activated by distinct agonists or by mechanical shear, and procoagulant activity was determined using a modified prothrombinase assay that closely parallels PS exposure as quantified by annexin-V binding (15Jesty J. Bluestein D. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with prior observations (2Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J. Freyssinet J.-M. Nurden A.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11625-11634Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Andersen H. Greenberg D. Fujikawa K. Wenfeng X. Chung D. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11189-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), thrombin and collagen (but not ADP or PAR4 agonist peptide) caused dose-dependent increases in prothrombinase activity, results that were essentially the same for both mIQGAP1-/- and wild-type platelets (Fig. 3a). In sharp contrast, however, mIQGAP1-/- platelets activated by shear stress demonstrated enhanced prothrombinase activity compared with littermate controls (either at 12 or 16 dynes/cm2, equivalent to shear rates of 1200 and 1600 s-1, respectively). This exaggerated procoagulant activity was unrelated to inherent differences in membrane function or phospholipid content because the maximal prothrombinase activities between wild type and mIQGAP1-/- platelets were essentially identical (Fig. 3a). Similarly, there was no evidence that the enhanced procoagulant activity could be explained by inherent differences in microvesiculation as determined by flow cytometric analyses. More exhaustive experiments were completed using platelets activated by shear stress of 16 dynes/cm2 (corresponding to ∼2.5 times normal shear stress in coronary arteries, or ∼40% degree of stenosis). Because the prothrombinase measurement of platelet procoagulant activity reflects the composite sum generated from microvesicular and intact platelets (23Alberio L. Safa O. Clemetson K.J. Esmon T. Dale G. Blood. 2000; 95: 1694-1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), parallel determinations were made of the proportion of the total activity derived from platelet microparticles. As shown in Fig. 4, by using larger numbers of mouse platelets activated by moderate shear stress (n = 12 in each arm, with male:female ratios of 1:1), mIQGAP1-/- platelets demonstrated an enhanced ability for prothrombinase generation, differences that were highly significant compared with wild-type controls (p < 0.0001). Although microvesiculation is known to accompany high shear activation, minimal (and essentially comparable) microparticle formation was evident in both mIQGAP1-/- and wild-type platelets activated by low-shear (Fig. 5), consistent with prior observations (22Miyazaki Y. Nomura S. Miyake T. Kagawa H. Kitada C. Taniguchi H. Komiyama Y. Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Fukuhara S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3456-3664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the prothrombinase activity was primarily found in the intact platelets from both groups of mice, with an identical fraction (∼26%) accounted for by platelet microparticles. Thus, although IQGAP1 is known to have actin-polymerizing functions that could be involved in the cytoskeletal actin reorganization known to accompany microvesiculation, mIQGAP1 deficiency is uniquely associated with enhanced shear-associated platelet prothrombinase activity, without a concomitant defect in microvesiculation.Fig. 5Dissection of PS-exposing versus exocytic pathways of shear activation. GFP (4 × 104/μl) were activated by shear (16 dynes/cm2), and at various time points, samples were removed and analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-phosphatidylethanolamine (a) or anti-CD62 (P-selectin) (b). a, scattergrams of annexin V-phosphatidylethanolamine labeling, or forward/side scatter distribution in nonfluorescent cells are displayed. Solid lines, wild type; light brown, mIQGAP1-/-. For all experiments and time points, a total of 10,000 gated events were quantified. Results represent a complete and representative set of experiments, repeated on two separate occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) mIQGAP1-/- Procoagulant Activity Is Disjoined from [Ca2+]i and Coupled to the Platelet Exocytic Pathway—To further delineate the intracellular signaling pathways regulating the procoagulant phenotype, we studied the role of the aberrant [Ca2+]i and dissected the two critical components of platelet prothrombinase assembly (negatively charged phospholipid exposure and factor V surface expression caused by α-granule exocytosis). Initially, platelets were incubated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM followed by activation using the identical shear rate of 16 dynes/cm2. Unexpectedly, BAPTA-treated mIQGAP1-/- platelets demonstrated persistently exaggerated procoagulant activity (Fig. 4), despite evidence for effective chelation as established by microspectrofluorimetry after shear activation (data not shown). These results were in sharp contrast to wild-type control platelets, which demonstrated inhibitory effects on the generation of platelet procoagulant activity with calcium chelation. To more specifically dissect the mechanism for the enhanced prothrombinase generation data, simultaneous determinations quantified annexin-V binding (as a marker for PS exposure) and P-selectin cell surface expression (as a marker for α-granule exocytosis). For both wild-type and mIQGAP1-/- platelets, the distribution of intact platelets, microparticles, and annexin-V binding were essentially identical when platelets were activated by shear rates of 16 dynes/cm2 (Fig. 5). In contrast, mIQGAP1-/- platelets demonstrated a shorter lag phase of P-selectin expression compared with wild-type platelets; these differences were limited to intact platelets with no differences evident in the generation of P-selectin microparticles between both platelet phenotypes. Indeed, the time to half-maximal response (t½) was ≤5 min for mIQGAP1-/- platelets compared with t½ ∼12 min for wild-type controls. This abbreviated lag time in mIQGAP1-/- platelets was not associated with any changes in either maximal P-selectin expression or its expression in platelet microparticles. These observations strongly support a model linking platelet IQGAP1 with a shear-activated, exocytic pathway that specifically regulates platelet prothrombinase complex assembly, which is independent of platelet microvesiculation. Furthermore, despite the fact that maximal α-granule release is essentially identical between wild-type and mIQGAP1-/- platelets by 15 min, mIQGAP1-/- platelets display persistently enhanced procoagulant activity at all subsequent time points (see Fig. 4). These data did not directly quantify cell surface factor V expression as a marker of prothrombinase assembly. Nonetheless, if α-granule-derived factor V secretion parallels that of P-selectin, an extrapolation of these observations suggests that the initial rate of prothrombinase complex assembly represents a major determinant of subsequent thrombin generation over time. What is the mechanism by which IQGAP1 modulates platelet procoagulant activity, and how is this related to the exaggerated [Ca2+]i transients? Previous observations have demonstrated complex relationships among Ca2+, calmodulin, and structural domains of IQGAP1. Indeed, Ca2+ can directly associate with IQGAP1 (24Ho Y.-H. Joyal J. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and Ca2+/calmodulin binding modulates the functional interactions of IQGAP1 with actin and cdc42 (25Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.-D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Bashour A. Fullerton A. Hart M. Bloom G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the IQ motifs display differential binding to apocalmodulin compared with Ca2+/calmodulin (27Li Z. Sacks D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4347-4352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This observation implies that IQGAP1 may facilitate Ca2+ association to calmodulin-bound IQGAP1, a model that may explain the exaggerated [Ca2+]i release in IQGAP1-null platelets. Irrespective of the mechanism, this aberrant [Ca2+]i response appears unrelated to the enhanced procoagulant phenotype evident in shear-induced mIQGAP1-/- platelets, data that are entirely consistent with previous observations disjoining the intracytosolic calcium release from the procoagulant capacity of the activated platelet membrane (2Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J. Freyssinet J.-M. Nurden A.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11625-11634Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Andersen H. Greenberg D. Fujikawa K. Wenfeng X. Chung D. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11189-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Bucki R. Bachelot-Loza C. Zachowski A. Giraud F. Sulpice J.-C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15383-15391Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Gaffet P. Bettache N. Bienvenu A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10448-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rather, our data establish that IQGAP1 functions in a calcium-independent secretory pathway of α-granule release, specifically activated by shear stress. Regulated platelet exocytosis proceeds through a sequence involving granule docking and fusion, utilizing core SNARE (soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor)-related molecules that are functional in neuronal secretion and conserved in yeast (28Reed G. Fitzgerald M. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3341PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there is no evidence that IQGAP1 functions within this complex, although the S. cerevisiae Iqg1p homologue is known to interface proteins regulating polarity-dependence with those involved in exocytosis/secretion and cytokinesis (29Osman M. Konopka J. Cerione R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Alternatively, IQGAP1 could modulate α-granule secretion by interactions with microtubules or microtubule-associated proteins (known to be important for platelet secretion (28Reed G. Fitzgerald M. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3341PubMed Google Scholar), a prime candidate being CLIP-170 (8Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa K. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar)). Recent evidence would suggest that an IQGAP1/CLIP-170 scaffold complexed with [GTP]-bound rac1/cdc42 functions as a link between microtubules and the cortical actin meshwork, thereby providing a calcium-independent, integrated signaling complex that could normally function to negatively regulate the early stages of granule exocytosis. What is the mechanoreceptor linked to platelet IQGAP1 activation, and how does IQGAP1 become activated during shear stress? Although various studies have delineated key IQGAP1 structural domains mediating biochemical interactions with regulatory proteins in vitro, our data provide the first evidence for a physiological signal (i.e. shear) directly linked to IQGAP1 activation. Previous data have established a role for the von Willebrand factor/GPIbα mechanoreceptor axis in shear-induced conformational activation of αIIbβ3, although the role of this agonist-receptor complex (and its signaling pathway) in the generation and assembly of the prothrombinase complex remains incompletely delineated (30Mazzucato M. Pradella P. Cozzi M. DeMarco L. Ruggeri Z. Blood. 2002; 100: 2793-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our shear loop did not include exogenous von Willebrand factor, suggesting that the intracellular signaling pathway occurs independently of von Willebrand factor/GPIbα ligation, although we cannot definitively exclude the possibility of GPIbα activation from endogenous platelet-derived von Willebrand factor. Interestingly, the physical properties of the phospholipid bilayer may be sufficient for shear stress-induced activation of membrane-bound G proteins in the absence of cell surface receptors (31Guidi S. Nolan J. Frangos J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2515-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), thereby providing a direct link to IQGAP1 via GTP-charging of rac1 and/or cdc42. Finally, although IQGAP1 specifically modulates the kinetics of prothrombinase assembly, our data also suggest that IQGAP1 deficiency results in progressive procoagulant activity over time, imputing a regulatory role for IQGAP1 in sustaining cell surface thrombin generation. These data implicate IQGAP1 in a fundamental signaling mechanism that regulates platelet procoagulant activity and presumably normal hemostasis; further characterization of this signaling pathway should identify novel targets capable of modulating platelet procoagulant function.

Post-transcriptional modifications of various forms of RNA are essential cellular processes (1Lane B.G. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 1-20Google Scholar). Naturally occurring RNA molecules (tRNA, rRNA, and small nuclear RNA) contain a variety of nonstandard ribonucleosides such as ribothymidine and pseudouridine. Pseudouridine (ψ), the C-glycoside isomer of uridine, is the most abundant of the modified bases found in RNA (2Charette M. Gray M.W. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 341-351Google Scholar). Pseudouridine is formed by the site-specific enzymatic modification of uridine present in tRNA, rRNA, and small nuclear RNA by an ancient and universal class of enzymes called pseudouridine synthases (PUS; EC 4.2.1.70, 2). 1The abbreviations used are: PUS, pseudouridine synthase; TruB,ψ55 tRNA pseudouridine synthase; EC-TRUB, E. coli TruB; MTB, M. tuberculosis; MTB-TRUB, M. tuberculosis TruB; PUA, pseudouridine and archaeosine domain; TM-TRUB, T. maritima TruB; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TLS, translation-libration-screw. Based on protein sequence analysis, PUSs were originally classified into four major sequence families (3Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Google Scholar): (i) TruB (specific for the nearly universal ψ55 in tRNA); (ii) RsuA (rRNA-specific); (iii) RluA (rRNA-specific); and (iv) TruA (tRNA anti-codon loop-specific). In addition, a new sequence family (TruD, ψ13 tRNA-specific) of PUS was identified recently (4Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA. 2003; 9: 711-721Google Scholar). Several studies have shed light on the biological implications of pseudouridine bases. Conserved ψ residues are believed to play important roles in RNA stability, codon recognition, spliceosomal assembly, and other functions (2Charette M. Gray M.W. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 341-351Google Scholar, 5Gu J. Patton J.R. Shimba S. Reddy R. RNA. 1996; 2: 909-918Google Scholar, 6Yu Y.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A.

The importance of ψ residues is underscored by their tendency to occur in RNA molecules near functionally important regions such as near the peptidyl transfer site in rRNA (8Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13475-13483Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the deletion of PUS genes results in impaired growth (RluD) and competitive disadvantage (TruB) in Escherichia coli (9Gutgsell N.S. Del Campo M.D. Raychaudhuri S. Ofengand J. RNA. 2001; 7: 990-998Google Scholar, 10Raychaudhuri S. Conrad J. Hall B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1998; 4: 1407-1417Google Scholar, 11Gutgsell N. Englund N. Niu L. Kaya Y. Lane B.G. Ofengand J.

Klauck S.M. Wiemann S. Mason P.J. Poustka A. Dokal I. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 32-38Google Scholar). Suggestions have been put forward that, apart from their usual catalytic role, certain PUS enzymes (e.g. TruB) may also act as chaperones for RNA folding (11Gutgsell N. Englund N. Niu L. Kaya Y.

A comparison of those structures indicates a common ancestral linkage and a shared enzymatic mechanism involving a catalytic aspartate residue (17Sivaraman J. Sauve V. Larocque R. Stura E.A.

The structures of TruB from E. coli (EC-TRUB) and T. maritima (TM-TRUB) in complex with an RNA segment mimicking the T stem-loop of tRNA demonstrates that TruB accesses the target U55 of its tRNA substrate by a mechanism involving a base-flipping conformational change (15Hoang C.

A combination of rigid docking followed by induced fit binding was proposed for tRNA recognition based on the significant conformational change observed between the structures of RNA-bound and -free forms of EC-TRUB (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). Here we present the structure of ψ55 tRNA pseudouridine synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB-TRUB) at 1.9-Å resolution in two substrate-free forms. The structures depict an interesting mode of β-sheet bending movement affecting the shape of the catalytic cleft as well as a major disordering of the active site in the absence of the RNA substrate. Implications of the above observations are discussed in relation to protein function. The structure of MTB-TRUB was determined as part of the M. tuberculosis structural genomics initiative (21Goulding C.W. Apostol M. Anderson D.H. Gill H.S. Smith C.V. Kuo M.R. Yang J.K. Waldo G.S.

Rupp B. Jacobs Jr., W. Terwilliger T.C. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2002; 2: 121-141Google Scholar). Cloning—The Rv2793c gene was amplified by PCR using M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA as the template, with a forward primer (5′-CCATATGGCTAGCGCAACCGGCCCCGGAATCGTGGTTATCGAC-3′) that introduced an NdeI site (underlined) and a reverse primer (5′-CGGCGACGATGCACCCCGGGGGTGTACCACGAGGTAAGCTT-3′) that introduced a HindIII site (underlined). The forward primer also inserted an alanine codon (GCT) immediately following the start codon to enhance protein expression (22Looman A.C. Bodlaender J. Comstock L.J. Eaton D. Jhurani P. de Boer H.A. Knippenberg P.H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2489-2492Google Scholar), while the reverse primer introduced a thrombin recognition sequence to the C terminus. The PCR product was cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen). Following sequence confirmation, the gene was subcloned into pET22b (Stratagene), which added a hexahistidine tag to the expressed protein, trailing the thrombin recognition sequence. The resulting C-terminal extension had the amino acid sequence of GVPRGKLAAALEHHHHHH immediately following the natural protein sequence. Expression and Purification—The recombinant protein was expressed at ∼10 mg/liter/A600 nm in BL21(DE3)-Gold (Stratagene) E. coli in enriched buffered Luria-Bertani medium (10 g of NaCl, 40 g of tryptone, 20 g of yeast extract per liter of medium, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7). Each gram of cell pellet was resuspended and lysed in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml DNase I, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble, recombinant protein was initially purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen). Because of the sensitivity of the protein to high concentrations of imidazole, the peak elution fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 0.3 m NaCl soon after purification. The dialyzed sample was concentrated using Centricon YM-10 concentrators (Millipore) and further purified on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 0.3 m NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml. The purified protein was ≥99% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed the molecular weight of the recombinant protein and the purity of the sample. Crystallization—The protein was initially crystallized as rod clusters after 4 weeks at room temperature by sitting drop vapor diffusion in which 1 μl of the protein concentrate was mixed with 1 μl of crystallization reagent (0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 (Hampton index screen formulation 69)) at room temperature. Diffraction quality crystals were grown with microseeding. In the optimization trial, pre-equilibrated drops of 10 μl of protein mixed with 10 μl of reservoir reagent gave larger and better diffracting crystals. The final crystallization condition was 110 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 17% (w/v) PEG 3350. Crystals grew to ∼700 × 400 × 80 μm. Data Collection—Prior to shock-freezing the crystals in the nitrogen stream for data collection, each crystal was soaked for 5 min in a series of reagents for cryoprotection. The reagents consisted of the same components as the crystallization reservoir solution with the addition of PEG 3350 at a concentration of 25%, followed by 30 and 35%. It was noted that PEG concentrations >35% caused crystals to fracture. All data were collected at the Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.1 equipped with an ADSC Q4 CCD detector (λ = 1.0332 Å). DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) programs were used for data processing and scaling.

Open table in a new tab Phasing—The molecular replacement method was used to solve the structure of MTB-TRUB using the AMoRE program (24Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar). The protein component of the EC-TRUB structure (Protein Data Bank code 1K8W, Ref. 15Hoang C. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar) was used as a search model. The search model was converted to a polyserine model, and an atomic displacement parameter (Bfactor) of 20 Å2 was applied to all atoms. An unambiguous molecular replacement solution was obtained for which the initial correlation coefficient was 0.43 (Rfactor 0.48) for two molecules in the asymmetric unit for 12-4 Å data. Refinement—Rigid body refinement was performed in REFMAC5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) prior to the atomic refinement step using data to 3 Å. An initial attempt to build an atomic model using the ARP (26Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Google Scholar) automated rebuilding protocol with data to 1.9 Å failed. A conformational difference between the two chains was obvious from an inspection of the electron density map. Both chains were manually rebuilt in the core region, and partial models were refined in REFMAC5. The ARP automated model building protocol, interspersed with refinement using REFMAC5, was subsequently used to build the rest of the model. Manual rebuilding and checking were done using the graphics package O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). A small portion of the data set was used to calculate Rfree for cross-validation (28Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Google Scholar). Moderate restraints were used initially for non-crystallographic symmetry-related molecules at all refinement stages. Individual isotropic Bfactor values were refined. ARP was used to add and scrutinize waters. Translation-libration-screw (TLS) refinement (29Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Google Scholar) was performed at the final stages of the refinement (with a fixed Bfactor of 20 Å2) without any non-crystallographic symmetry restraints applied. In an attempt to understand the molecular motion in terms of rigid body vibrations, we performed three parallel TLS refinements in REFMAC5 under the following conditions: (i) case I, an entire protein molecule as a rigid body (two TLS groups); (ii) case II, the catalytic and the PUA (pseudouridine and archeosine) domain in each molecule as rigid bodies (four TLS groups); and (iii) case III, each molecule constituting three rigid bodies (segments I and II and the PUA domain; six TLS groups). The TLSANL program (30Howlin B. Butler S.A. Moss D.S. Harris G.W. Driessen H.P.C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 622-624Google Scholar) was used to analyze the resultant TLS matrices. However, the difference in Rfactor and Rfree was only marginally better in case III than in case II or case I. Evidently the hinge-based flexibility of the protein is not captured by the minor rigid body vibrations manifested by the proteins in their crystalline environment. Model Quality—The quality of the final model was quite satisfactory (Table I, Part B). The WHAT-IF (31Vriend G. Sander C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 47-60Google Scholar), PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), and ERRAT (33Colovos C. Yeates T.O. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1511-1519Google Scholar) programs and several tools from the O program were used for model evaluation. A Ramachandran plot was satisfactory with only 0.8% of the non-glycine residues lying outside the core region (as defined in MOLEMAN; Ref. 34Kleywegt G. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar). Residues 54 and 162 are in the disallowed part of the Ramachandran plot but are supported with well defined density. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1SGV. Surface Area Computation—The solvent-excluded surface area of the molecule was calculated using the MSMS program (35Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.-C. Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry. ACM Press, New York1995: C6-C7Google Scholar) with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. All hydrogen atoms were generated using the CNS program (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) prior to the surface area computation. The DINO graphics package (www.dino3d.org) was used to visualize and inspect the surface. Software Used for Structure Analysis and Illustration—The BRUTE option of LSQMAN (34Kleywegt G. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar), the FIT program (bioinfo1.mbfys.lu.se/~guoguang/fit.html), the LSQ option of O, and several programs from the CCP4 suite (37Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) were used for structural superposition and analysis. DSSP (38Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Google Scholar) was used for secondary structure assignment. The DINO and MOLSCRIPT (39Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) programs were used for making the illustrations. Overall Structure of MTB-TRUB—The crystal structure of MTB-TRUB was determined with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Here, we refer to the two molecules as MTBTRUB-A and MTB-TRUB-B (A and B correspond to the chain names of the two polypeptides in the Protein Data Bank coordinate set). The final structure contains residues 3-292 and 1-294 from 298 residues in the A and B chains, respectively. Residues 115-142 in MTB-TRUB-A and residues 112-139 in MTB-TRUB-B are missing in the electron density map (henceforth referred to as the disordered region) and are not modeled. The structure is composed of two domains (Fig. 1), namely the large N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1-226) and the short C-terminal RNA-binding domain (residues 227-298). Both domains are of the (α + β) type. The catalytic domain contains 12 β-strands (11 β-strands in the B chain), four α-helices, and two 310 helices (Fig. 1). A mostly anti-parallel, mixed, multiply bifurcated β-sheet (henceforth, the central β-sheet) forms the core of the catalytic domain. The C-terminal domain contains a four-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by one α-helix on each side. Hinge Bending—A key observation from the crystal structure is the presence of a significant conformational difference, occurring in the central β-sheet, between the two copies of the enzyme visualized in the crystal asymmetric unit (Fig. 1B). As a result, a portion of the catalytic domain (residues 72-199; segment I) moves essentially as a rigid body with respect to the remainder of the catalytic domain (residues 1-71 and 200-226; segment II) between the two chains (Table II and Fig. 2). The observed rigid body motion can be described by an ∼13° rotation around an effective hinge axis (Fig. 1B) with a translational (screw) component less than 0.5 Å. The movement is created by a few small torsional rotations localized to the hinge region centered around residues 71-72 and 199-200 (maximal Δφ/Δψ of ∼8°). As a result, a segment of the central β-sheet formed by strands β10-β4-β9-β8-β7 moves to a new local conformational energy minimum, whereas the hydrogen-bonding pattern with the rest of the protein remains intact. The effective hinge axis runs close to the Cα atom of Cys-173 (β9), the carbonyl group of Leu-199 (β10), and the Cγ atom of Tyr-70 (β4) at the base of the catalytic cleft (Fig. 1B). Thus, the base of the catalytic cleft can function as a mechanical hinge. Interestingly, all three of these residues take part in active site formation.Table IIComparison of different segments of the MTB-TRUB-A and MTB-TRUB-B chainsRange of residues used for superpositionR.m.s.d. computed for the residue rangeR.m.s.d.No. of Cα atoms alignedÅSegment II (3-71, 200-226)Segment II (3-71, 200-226)0.4296Segment I (72-111, 149-174, 181-199)Segment I (72-111, 149-174, 181-199)0.485PUA domain (227-292)PUA domain (227-292)0.366Segment II (3-71, 200-226)Segment I (72-111, 149-174, 181-199)3.885Segment II (3-71, 200-226)PUA domain (227-292)0.9266 Open table in a new tab The rigid body approximation to the conformational difference between the two molecules breaks down for two short stretches of segment I, i.e. in the β9-α3 loop (Fig. 3, A and B) and in all the visible residues between residue 111 and residue 149. Residues 112-114 (β7) in the MTB-TRUB-A chain form an anti-parallel β-sheet interaction with the neighboring β8 strand. These residues are missing in the MTB-TRUB-B chain. The overall structure of MTB-TRUB-A is generally similar to the previously published structures of TruB from E. coli (ECTRUB, Protein Data Bank code 1K8W; 2.2 Å r.m.s.d. between 255 pairs of Cα atoms (15Hoang C. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar)) and T. maritima (TM-TRUB; Protein Data Bank code 1R3E; 1.5 Å r.m.s.d. between 222 pairs of Cα atoms; Ref. 16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). On the other hand, structural superposition using the segment II residues reveals noticeable displacements of the segment I residues between the different TruB structures with maximum displacements of corresponding Cα atoms ranging from 2 to 5 Å (Fig. 4, A and B). The Active Site—The observed conformational variability leads to certain differences in the active sites of the two MTBTRUB molecules. The active site cleft is occupied by a few water molecules in both the A and B protein molecules (Fig. 3, A and B). The wall of the cleft is lined mainly by hydrophobic residues (Tyr-70, Leu-199, Tyr-178, Arg-180, Asp-42, Lys-68, Cys-173, Ile-179, Thr-177, Arg-146, and Thr-40; the underscored residues are conserved in the TruB family). Those residues from the shifted segment I that contribute to the catalytic cleft are repositioned in the B chain with respect to the A chain. The Tyr-70 side chain orientation and the Asp-42/Arg-180 salt link, as observed in the structures of other TruB homologs, is maintained in both molecules of MTB-TRUB. It has been suggested that this salt link serves to keep the nucleophilic aspartate in the deprotonated charged form in an otherwise low dielectric environment (15Hoang C. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar). Based on the different orientations of Asp-42 and Arg-180 in the RNA-bound and substrate-free forms of EC-TRUB, a substrate-induced “conformational switch” has been proposed to align the Asp-42 side chain for catalysis (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). However, our structure suggests that such a conformational change may not necessarily be substrate-induced, because a comparable side chain reorientation of Asp-42 and Arg-180 is observed between the A and B molecules of substrate-free MTB-TRUB (Fig. 3). The observed structures of MTB-TRUB suggest that the two Arg-180 and Asp-42 side chain orientations represent alternate conformations with similar energies that are capable of interconverting by normal protein “breathing.” Significant differences between the two conformations of MTB-TRUB are also observed for the β9-α3 loop housing the conserved CXXGXY motif (Cys-173/Gly-176/Tyr-178, henceforth called the CGY loop). The alternate conformation of the Lys-68 and Tyr-178 side chains, the CGY loop movement, and the above mentioned bending motion combine to make the uridine substrate (U55) binding pocket in MTB-TRUB-B less accessible (Fig. 3). The pocket is more open to the bulk solvent in the MTB-TRUB-A conformation. Movement of the Tyr-179 residue (which corresponds to Tyr-178 in MTB-TRUB) was also observed in the substrate-free EC-TRUB, resulting in a more accessible U55 pocket (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). The Disordered Thumb Region—One of the key observations from the present structure is that a significant portion of that part of the enzyme that grips the tRNA molecule in the major groove (the “thumb”) is fully disordered in both molecules of MTB-TRUB (Fig. 4, A and B). Residues 121-152 in EC-TRUB form a protrusion or so-called thumb that constitutes one side of the binding cleft and accommodates the flipped bases of the substrate (15Hoang C. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar). The highly conserved thumb region makes numerous interactions with the flipped bases and the cognate sugar/phosphate backbone in the major groove of bound RNA. This protruding part is mostly disordered in both molecules of the MTB-TRUB as well as the apo form of EC-TRUB (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). The disordered thumb in the MTB-TRUB structure reinforces the previous suggestion (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar) that this region is likely unstructured in solution and apparently undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding RNA. The C-terminal Domain—A recurring theme in RNA modification enzymes is the acquisition of small RNA binding domains to form an extended RNA binding surface (40Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 291-302Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of the MTB-TRUB is a PUA (40Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 291-302Google Scholar) domain, which is commonly found fused to RNA modification enzymes (PUS, RNA methylases, and archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (ATG); Ref. 41Ishitani R. Nureki O. Nameki N. Okada N. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2003; 113: 383-394Google Scholar), but occasionally as a single domain protein. This short domain contains several exposed basic residues. In the search for structures similar to the C-terminal domain of MTB-TRUB using DALI (42Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar), apart from EC-TRUB (Z_score = 7.8, 1.9 Å r.m.s.d. for 64 aligned Cα atoms) the most similar structure identified was the RNA-modifying enzyme archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Protein Data Bank code 1J2B, Z_score = 6, 2.9 Å r.m.s.d. for 63 aligned Cα atoms). The apo form of EC-TRUB also shows a hinge-bending motion with respect to the RNA-bound EC-TRUB involving a significant movement of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 4) (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). The overall orientation of the C-terminal domain with respect to the rest of the protein is marginally different for the two MTB-TRUB molecules (∼1 Å r.m.s.d.; Table II; Fig. 1B). This domain is envisaged as another flexible element of the TruB structure that assists in tRNA recognition (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). The RNA Binding Surface—A plot of the acidic and basic residues in the solvent-excluded substrate binding surface of MTB-TRUB shows the parts of the surface that would form the tRNA binding surface (Fig. 1D). The RNA binding surface is quite similar in all of the reported structures of TruB (ECTRUB, TM-TRUB, and MTB-TRUB). TruB enzymes do not necessarily require an entire tRNA molecule for recognition and catalysis (43Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Sissler M. Florentz C. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 505-518Google Scholar, 44Gu X. Yu M. Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 339-343Google Scholar). However, the extensive tRNA binding surface in TruB apparently serves in vivo to stabilize parts of the tRNA molecule beyond the recognition element. The crystal structure of MTB-TRUB at atomic resolution provides two views of the substrate-free enzyme. The two quite different conformations observed in the present structures apparently have similar energies with the distinct conformations being preferred in the two different packing environments in the crystal asymmetric unit. Both molecules make about the same number of intermolecular contacts (contact distance of ≤4 Å, computed using CONTACT; Ref. 37Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) with the surrounding protein chains in the crystal, whereas the B form makes a few additional intra-molecular interactions at the catalytic cleft. The two alternate conformational substates that are stabilized by weak crystallographic packing interactions almost certainly reflect a range of conformations to which the enzyme has access in vivo. Interestingly, the different conformers reveal the presence of a hinge region at the bottom of the active site cleft. In support of this, a preliminary structure of MTBTRUB has also been determined at 3-Å resolution from a monoclinic crystal form with four molecules in the asymmetric unit (data not shown). Although those structures are not described in detail here because of the relatively poor resolution, the same kind of protein flexibility is exhibited in that crystal form as well. A few small and concerted main chain torsional rotations at the base of this binding pocket create significant structural changes at the distal end of the protein; the observed shifts are as high as 6 Å between corresponding Cα atoms. The hinge bending motion apparently serves to modulate the shape and volume of the U55 binding pocket. How might the aforementioned hinge motion and the thumb reordering assist the enzyme action in vivo? The answer may lie in the energetic obstacles that TruB and other enzymes must encounter as they attempt to flip the bases out of their polynucleotide substrates prior to catalysis. In vitro kinetic studies suggest that the spontaneous base-flipping rates in duplex DNA and RNA (45Spies M.A. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14049-14053Google Scholar) are ∼4 or 5 orders of magnitude slower than the base-flipping rates observed in the presence of various enzymes (46Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5308-5314Google Scholar, 47Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Google Scholar). Not only do these enzymes provide a complementary active site for the flipped out substrate conformation, but they also apparently reduce the kinetic barriers faced by the substrate as it undergoes major conformational changes. In the reaction carried out by TruB, it is the T-loop of the tRNA molecule that flips out (15Hoang C. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Google Scholar). In the canonical L-shaped tRNA, the T-loop makes tertiary interaction with the D-loop. These interactions are lost in the base-flipped form of the tRNA. Interestingly, it has been suggested that TruB can act on the alternative λ-form of tRNA (44Gu X. Yu M. Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 339-343Google Scholar), which is a conformation in which the canonical T-D interactions are already lost. Although we do not yet have a detailed understanding of how TruB and related enzymes help to provide a kinetically accessible pathway for major substrate rearrangements, it seems logical that protein movements would play a critical role. The ordering of the swinging thumb region during the tRNA docking could facilitate base flipping (16Pan H. Agarwalla S. Moustakas D.T. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12648-12653Google Scholar). The subsequent placing of the flipped bases in the catalytic cleft and the tight gripping of the uracil ring (like a “molecular clamp”) for an in-line nucleophilic attack by Asp-42 would be assisted by the observed mode of the hinge-bending movement. The chemistry requires the repositioning of the uracil ring inside the catalytic pocket to bring the C5 atom of the uracil base close to the C1′ atom of the ribose group for covalent bond formation. The hinge bending could facilitate the above process during the chemical reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2086709642,"Leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is expressed as a homodimer and mediates leukocyte rolling through interactions with endothelial P-selectin. Previous studies have shown that PSGL-1 must be properly modified by specific glycosyltransferases including α1,3-fucosyltransferase-VII, core 2 β1–6-N-glucosaminyltransferase (C2GlcNAcT-I), one or more α2,3-sialytransferases, and a tyrosulfotransferase. In addition, dimerization of PSGL-1 through its sole extracellular cysteine (Cys320) is essential for rolling on P-selectin under shear conditions. In this report, we measured the contributions of both C2GlcNAcT-I glycosylation and dimerization of PSGL-1 to adhesive bonds formed during tethering and rolling of transfected cell lines on purified P-selectin. Tethering to P-selectin under flow increased with dimerization compared with cells expressing monomeric PSGL-1 (referred to as C320A). The rolling defects (decreased cellular accumulation, PSGL-1/P-selectin bond strengths and tethering rates, and increased velocities and skip distance) demonstrated by transfectants expressing monomeric PSGL-1 could be overcome by increasing the substrate P-selectin site density and by overexpressing C2GlcNAcT-I in C320A transfectants. Two molecular weight variants of PSGL-1 were isolated from cell lines transfected with PSGL-1, C320A, and/or C2GlcNAcT-I cDNAs, and these differences in electrophoretic mobility appeared to correlate with C2GlcNAcT-I expression. C320A transfectants expressing low molecular weight PSGL-1 had lower C2GlcNAcT-I levels (measured by reactivity to core 2 specific linkage antibody, CHO-131) and compromised rolling on P-selectin (regardless of site density) compared with C320A cells with high levels of C2GlcNAcT-I and high molecular weight PSGL-1. Both C2GlcNAcT-I glycosylation and PSGL-1 dimerization increased the rate of tethering to P-selectin under flow, whereas C2GlcNAcT-I levels primarily influenced tether bond strength.

Mice deficient in C2GlcNAcT-I (C2GlcNAcT-I–/–) have defects in leukocyte recruitment to the peritoneum after exposure to chemical irritants, and neutrophils isolated from these animals demonstrated reduced interactions with P-selectin (11Ellies L.G.

Neutrophils from C2GlcNAcT-I–/– mice also show reduced rolling interactions in vivo as well as in vitro (15Sperandio M. Thatte A. Foy D. Ellies L.G. Marth J.D. Ley K.

These data suggest that the formation of a β1,6 linkage from the N-acetylgalactosamine of a core 1 structure strongly enhances interactions between PSGL-1 and P-selectin, although the precise effect on the cellular attachment rate and stressed tether bond lifetime of this modification are unknown.Whereas appropriate post-translational modifications are critical for creation of the PSGL-1 binding pocket, dimerization of PSGL-1 has also been shown to exert significant control over leukocyte rolling interactions with P-selectin (17Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Ramachandran V. Yago T. Epperson T.K. Kobzdej M.M. Nollert M.U.

Cell lines expressing recombinant monomeric PSGL-1 had severely compromised rolling on P-selectin in vitro rolling assays and reduced binding of soluble P-selectin. Whereas these cell-based observations strongly indicate a requirement for PSGL-1 dimerization for optimal rolling on P-selectin, co-crystallization of the 19 N-terminal amino acids of mature PSGL-1 (SGP-3) with P-selectin indicates that monomeric PSGL-1 displays a complete set of P-selectin binding epitopes (19Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 20Leppanen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.B. Ju T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I.

Furthermore, the binding affinity of the P-selectin-SGP-3 complex is essentially identical to that of P-selectin binding to soluble, recombinant PSGL-1 consisting of the entire dimeric extracellular domain (19Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Although the similarities in these binding affinities argue that dimerization of PSGL-1 is not essential for interactions with P-selectin, it is not known how static measures of molecular binding affinities correlate with the ability of PSGL-1 to mediate rolling on P-selectin in the presence of fluid shear forces.In this study, we have evaluated the contribution of both dimerization and C2GlcNAcT-I modification of PSGL-1 on P-selectin-mediated cell rolling. Using high speed digital video analysis, cell rolling was separated into the component steps of accumulation, tethering, and distance traveled between adhesive events. Based on the analysis of the duration and frequency of transient adhesive events during rolling, C2GlcNAcT-1 expression makes a major contribution to the mechanical compliance of PSGL-1/P-selectin bonds. High speed video analysis of the frequency of cell tethering further demonstrated that covalent dimerization of PSGL-1 significantly enhanced the ability of cells to initiate rolling interactions via P-selectin while having a minimal affect on PSGL-1/P-selectin bond biomechanical properties.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Stable Transfectants in K562 and BJAB Cells—The generation of both K562 and BJAB cells stably expressing α1,3-fucosyltransferase-VII (FucT-VII) has been described (21Wagers A.J. Lowe J.B. Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 2125-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Snapp K.R. Wagers A.J. Craig R. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. Blood. 1997; 89: 896-901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both cell lines (K562/FT7 and BJAB/FT7) were transfected by electroporation with wild type PSGL-1 or nondimerizing PSGL-1 (referred to as C320A) in which cysteine at position 320 was mutated to alanine (17Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bulk transfectants were selected in medium containing 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, screened by flow cytometry with the anti-PSGL-1 mAb KPL1 (23Snapp K.R. Ding H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Luscinskas F.W. Kansas G.S. Blood. 1997; 91: 154-164Crossref Google Scholar), and cloned by limiting dilution. Transfectants were selected that had equal levels of KPL1 and HECA-452, which recognizes a reporter epitope associated with FucT-VII enzymatic activity. Clones with equivalent staining for these two mAbs were tested by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis (17Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) for both FucT-VII and C2GlcNAcT-I mRNA expression. This analysis revealed that BJAB cells expressed higher endogenous levels of C2GlcNAcT-I. Thus, K562/FT7 cells expressing wild type dimeric PSGL-1 or monomeric C320A were transfected with C2GlcNAcT-I, drug-selected, and screened, and clones were obtained that expressed a level of mRNA for C2GlcNAcT-I similar to that in BJAB cells. The nomenclature for the transfectants is as follows: K562-WT (where WT refers to PSGL-1), BJAB-WT, K562-C320A (where C320A refers to the dimerization mutant), BJAB-C320A, K562C2-WT (where C2 refers to C2GlcNAcT-I), and K562C2-C320A. All cell lines expressed FucT-VII and were reactive to HECA-452. Additionally, all cells were tested for reactivity to CHO-131 (kindly supplied by Dr. Bruce Walcheck, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN), a mAb that is specific for the C2GlcNAcT-I-dependent linkages that are critical components of the PSGL-1 binding pocket (24Walcheck B. Leppanen A. Cummings R.D. Knibbs R.N. Stoolman L.M. Alexander S.R. Mattila P.E. McEver R.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For each sample, ∼10,000 antibody-labeled cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest software.Rolling Substrates and Flow Assay—A microscope slide coated with recombinant P-selectin-human IgG fusion protein (referred to as PRIgG; BD Pharmingen) was assembled as the lower wall of a parallel plate flow chamber (GlycoTech, Rockville, MD) and mounted on an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Diaphot-TMD; Nikon, Garden City, NY) equipped with a Kodak MotionCorder Analyzer, model 1000 camera (Eastman Kodak Co., Motion Analysis System Division, San Diego, CA) for high temporal resolution of adhesive and rolling events. Transfectants were perfused (0.5 × 106/ml) through the flow chamber at flow rates of 0.5–2.0 dyn/cm2 and viewed at a frame rate of 125 frames/s to measure tether lifetimes and distances between tethers. A standard CCD camera (Vicon VC2410; Vicon Industries Inc., Melville, NY) recorded cell rolling velocities and cell accumulation events. In some experiments, transfectants were pretreated with either KPL1 (blocking anti-PSGL-1 mAb), KPL2 (nonblocking anti-PSGL-1 mAb), G1 (blocking anti-P-selectin mAb), or EDTA (5 mm).Site densities of adsorbed recombinant P-selectin-IgG were determined by saturation binding of the anti-P-selectin mAb G1 (Ancell, Bayport, MN) after it had been iodinated with Iodobeads (Pierce) to a specific activity of 1.7 μCi/μg. The site density of PRIgG used in tether measurements, specificity, rolling cell accumulation, velocity, dissociation constant, or adhesive event lifetime measurements varied from 10 to 200 sites/μm2 with higher site densities required for interactions involving K562-C320A due to the extremely low formation rate of tether bonds compared with PSGL-1 expressing cell lines.Western Blotting—Transfectants were washed twice and resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100 (Fisher), 1 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, egtazic acid, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated on an orbital shaker for 30 min at 4 °C. Extracts were clarified at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Samples were boiled for 5 min in β-mercaptoethanol reducing buffer, electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, probed with KPL1, washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Membranes were washed six times, developed with enzyme chemiluminescence (Pierce), and exposed to CL-X Posure x-ray film (Pierce).Image Acquisition and Processing—Adhesive events and distances between adhesive events were determined using a computer tracking program coded in MATLAB 5 (The MathWorks, Natick, MA), which used a sum of absolute difference algorithm and spline interpolation that allowed for subpixel resolution of changes in position to identify the cell in consecutive image frames. Video memory from the high speed camera (125 frames/s) was played back at standard video rates for archiving on VHS tapes. Images of rolling cells were captured from videotape to computer using Scion Image version 1.62 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and a Macintosh G4 (Apple, Inc., Cupertino, CA) equipped with a Scion LG-3 frame grabber. The elapsed time for each digitized movie used to calculate rolling velocity was 2 s.The signal/noise ratio for a typical phase-contrast image was calculated by determining the average grayscale signal intensity for a given cell. The value 0 was assigned to pure white, and 255 was assigned to pure black, resulting in an average of 73 for the brightest regions of the cell to an average of 180 for the dark background. The signal intensity was the difference between these values, whereas the noise was the S.D. value of the intensity for the pixels representing the cell, which was 22, resulting in a signal/noise ratio of 5 for a 5–10-μm diameter object. The low bias (∼0 pixels) and low S.D. of distance (∼0.1 pixels or 37 nm for 20× magnification using the Kodak camera) (25Cheezum M.K. Walker W.F. Guilford W.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2378-2388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) indicated that the observed tracking of cells was very close to the actual movement of the cells.Determination of Rolling Cell Accumulation and Adhesive Event Duration Analysis—A cell was considered rolling if it displayed at least three adhesive contacts across the field of view (640 μm in length) in a 2-s time period. Cell rolling interactions varied between a highly transient interaction to a very stable rolling, depending on PSGL-1 structural modifications. The tether bond lifetime (duration of an adhesive event at low site densities of P-selectin) was determined by counting high speed camera image frames starting with a drop in velocity of at least 25% relative to the hydrodynamic velocity of a cell near the wall and ending with an increase in velocity of 12.5 μm/s over three frames (24 ms). The increase in velocity of 12.5 μm/s, used to define the end of an adhesive event, was also 5 times higher than the highest fluctuation in apparent velocity of a stationary cell in our system. The dissociation rate constant was taken as the negative slope of the natural log of the number of events remaining versus the duration of the events at each wall shear stress.The force on the tether was found through a force and torque balance using the geometry of a tethered cell and comparing the dissociation constants from our cellular system to the dissociation constants from a cell-free bead system (26Park E.Y. Smith M.J. Stropp E.S. Snapp K.R. DiVietro J.A. Walker W.F. Schmidtke D.W. Diamond S.L. Lawrence M.B. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1835-1847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The K562, K562C2, and BJAB cell lines used in the adhesive event duration experiments had diameters of ∼17 μm, which is significantly larger than a neutrophil (∼8.5 μm), and this increase in size significantly altered the force acting on a tether bond when compared with neutrophils. To calculate the lever arm length, the koff values for the transfectants were compared with koff values from PSGL-1-coated beads as previously validated (26Park E.Y. Smith M.J. Stropp E.S. Snapp K.R.

Using the shear force (Fs) that was imposed at a low flow rate, the average lever arm length and angle between the tether and substrate (lower wall of the chamber) were calculated from the relationship Fs = Fbcosθ. This resulted in an average lever arm angle (θ) of 60.7°, a lever arm length of 4.3 μm, a microvillus tether arm length of 0.8 μm, a shear force of 232 piconewtons/dyn/cm2, and a force on the tether of 475 piconewtons/dyn/cm2 that was used to scale the force on the tether for the K562 and BJAB transfectants (26Park E.Y.

Stable transfectants expressing either wild type PSGL-1 (K562-WT or BJAB-WT) or monomeric PSGL-1 (K562-C320A or BJAB-C320A) were generated in these cell lines. Wild type PSGL-1 and C320A were expressed at similar levels on transfected cells, as was a FucT-VII reporter epitope recognized by HECA-452 (Fig. 1A). Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using PCR cycles titered to below plateau phase followed by Southern blotting (17Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Wagers A.J. Stoolman L.M. Kannagi R. Craig R. Kansas G.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1917-1929PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that BJAB/FucT-VII cells endogenously expressed higher levels of C2GlcNAcT-I compared with K562/FT7 cells (Fig. 1B). Because of these differences, K562-WT and K562-C320A cells were transfected with additional C2GlcNAcT-I (Fig. 1B). Transfectants with similar levels of C2GlcNAcT-I were used to evaluate the rolling phenotype associated with dimeric or monomeric PSGL-1.To establish the functionality and specificity of transfected PSGL-1, all cell lines were flowed over purified P-selectin at a wall shear stress of 0.5 dyn/cm2, and the number of cell interactions was quantified from analysis of videotape (see “Experimental Procedures”) and compared with the number of interactions with the appropriate specificity controls (Fig. 2). It was observed that the tethering and rolling of PSGL-1 or C320A transfectants was highly specific for P-selectin, since blocking mAbs to PSGL-1 (KPL1) or P-selectin (G1) significantly inhibited rolling. Inhibition experiments required a high density of P-selectin substrate (200 sites/μm2), because rolling of C320A expressing cells was extremely compromised at substrate densities below 100 sites/μm2 (17Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When no antibody or control antibody (KPL2) was present, all WT transfectants rolled with a steady, almost peeling-like motion much like neutrophil rolling on either P-selectin or E-selectin in vivo (1Jung U. Bullard D.C. Tedder T.F. Ley K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2740-H2747PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kunkel E.J. Ley K. Circ.

A. 1991; 88: 7538-7542Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). In contrast, C320A rolling interactions were distinctly briefer and much less stable, suggesting an adhesive functional deficit (17Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, rolling interactions were completely eliminated in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 2). There were no adhesive interactions with untransfected K562 or BJAB cells on P-selectin (data not shown). It should be noted that the cell adhesion measure reported in Fig. 2 is equivalent to a flux, in that the total number of interacting cells per unit time was counted.Fig. 2Rolling interactions are dependent on interactions between PSGL-1 and P-selectin. Transfected cells were perfused for 1 min at 0.5 dyn/cm2 wall shear stress over a P-selectin substrate of 200 sites/μm2, and tethering cells were counted for 10 fields of view (one of two experiments). All interactions, even single transient events lasting 30 ms (1 video frame), were counted. A distinct criterion was applied to quantify accumulation of cells under flow conditions (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 3). KPL1, an anti-PSGL-1 mAb, significantly reduced rolling cells (white bar), whereas KPL2, a nonblocking mAb to PSGL-1, did not (dark gray bar). G1 (hatched bar), an anti-P-selectin mAb, and EDTA (light gray bar), a divalent cation chelator, virtually eliminated rolling cells. The error bars indicate S.D. values. The asterisks indicate zero interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Influence of P-selectin Density and PSGL-1 Dimerization Status on Total Rolling Cell Accumulation—Total accumulation of rolling cells measures both bond formation frequency and its duration under stress. To investigate the influence of PSGL-1 dimerization on this parameter, a substrate expressing P-selectin at a density of 200 sites/μm2 was used. At a wall shear stress of 0.5 dyn/cm2, cells expressing dimerized PSGL-1 bound more readily than cells expressing nondimerized PSGL-1, as indicated by the increased number of rolling cells after 2 min of steady flow (Fig. 3A). Observed differences were statistically different at time points as early as 1 min after the start of flow (t test, p < 0.01, data not shown). K562, BJAB, and K562C2 transfectants expressing either dimerized PSGL-1 or monomeric C320A demonstrated an increase in total numbers of accumulated cells with time, although the increase in cellular accumulation was always significantly greater for wild type PSGL-1 compared with monomeric C320A (Fig. 3A). This suggests that PSGL-1 covalent dimerization increased the probability of P-selectin-mediated cell capture. Whereas BJAB-C320A cells rolled steadily, K562-C320A cells interacted much more transiently with the P-selectin substrate. The correlation between long duration rolling and C2GlcNAcT-1 expression suggested that increased levels of C2GlcNAcT-I might partially compensate for the rolling defects associated with monomeric PSGL-1. Qualitatively similar patterns of enhanced binding of cells expressing dimerized PSGL-1 were observed at 1 dyn/cm2 wall shear stress save for a lower overall level of binding (data not shown).Fig. 3Site density dependent accumulation of rolling cells on P-selectin. The dynamic accumulation of rolling cells (mean ± S.D.) was dependent on dimerization and P-selectin site density. The number of rolling cells was quantitated after 2 min of steady flow (except K562-WT and K562-C320A, which were perfused for 6 min over the 20 site/μm2 P-selectin density) at a wall shear stress of 0.5 dyn/cm2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” P-selectin site density was either 200 sites/μm2 (A) or 20 sites/μm2 (B) as determined by radioimmunoassay. All WT cells accumulated in greater numbers than C320A transfectants after 2 min of flow (p < 0.01) (A and B). *, both K562-WT and K562-C320A were perfused for 6 min over the 20 sites/μm2 P-selectin substrate to enhance the chance of a K562-C320A transfectant being able to form a rolling interaction (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The rolling potential of both monomeric and dimeric PSGL-1 at a P-selectin density of 20 sites/μm2 (Fig. 3B) was also investigated to probe the effect of limiting P-selectin site density on cell interactions under shear. At this lower substrate density, C320A transfectants had a much lower rolling potential than observed at 200 sites/μm2 (Fig. 3, B versus A). Using a cell rolling criterion of a minimum of three adhesive events across the microscope field of view in a 2-s interval, the K562-C320A mutation was essentially unable to roll on P-selectin at 20 sites/μm2. The cellular accumulation data were obtained after 2 min of perfusion for BJAB and K562C2 transfectants and after 6 min for K562 transfectants. The virtually complete abrogation of K562-C320A rolling, even after the increased perfusion period, was consistent with previous observations of impaired rolling on P-selectin-expressing CHO cells (17Snapp K.R.

https://openalex.org/W2072150290,"Adrenocorticotropic hormone can stimulate lipolysis and suppress leptin expression in murine adipocytes. These effects are mediated via the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2-R), which is expressed when 3T3-L1 cells are induced to undergo adipogenesis. In this study, we have characterized the mc2-r promoter in the murine adipocyte, one of the few extra-adrenal sites of expression and a cell type that lacks steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), a transcription factor that is required for mc2-r expression in adrenal cells. Transcriptional regulation of the mc2-r in the absence of SF-1 was investigated by 5′ deletion analysis of the murine mc2-r promoter in both undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The results revealed the presence of a 59-base pair regulatory region within the promoter containing an adipocyte-specific enhancer. The ability of this region to confer enhanced activity in the adipocyte was mapped to a peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE)-like sequence that bound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) in adipocyte nuclear extracts. Co-transfection of PPARγ2/RXRα with the pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 reporter resulted in transcriptional activation in preadipocytes, and this response required an intact PPRE. Mutation of the PPRE to prevent PPARγ/RXRα binding resulted in a complete abrogation of the pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 reporter activity in day 3 differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, demonstrating a key role played by this site in regulating MC2-R expression in the murine adipocyte.

Waterman M.R. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 61: 692-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the key role of MC2-R in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis has been the focus of the majority of publications to date, it is also expressed in a number of extra-adrenal sites including the murine adipocyte, fetal testis, human skin, and sympathetic ganglia (2Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2043-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3O'Shaughnessy P.J. Fleming L.M. Jackson G. Hochgeschwender U. Reed P. Baker P.J.

Early studies using the murine 3T3-L1 cell line, a widely used model of adipogenesis, demonstrated the appearance of high affinity ACTH binding sites following treatment of growth-arrested cells with a mixture of adipogenic agents including insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (6Grunfeld C. Hagman J. Sabin E.A. Buckley D.I. Jones D.S. Ramachandran J. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Subsequent characterization of the melanocortin receptors expressed by 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed the presence of both the MC2 and MC5-R. However, a pharmacological analysis showed that the actions of ACTH were mediated solely through the MC2-R in this cell line (2Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2043-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). ACTH exerts a potent lipolytic effect on the murine adipocyte via the cAMP pathway (7White J. Engel F. J. Clin. Investig. 1958; 37: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Ramachandran J. Lee V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 428: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and has more recently been shown to suppress the expression and secretion of the appetite regulating hormone leptin in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (9Norman D. Isidori A.M. Frajese V. Caprio M. Chew S.L. Grossman A.B. Clark A.J. Michael B.G. Fabbri A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 200: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MC2-R expression may therefore be important in providing feedback between the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and peripheral leptin production by adipose tissue. Studies to date on the transcriptional regulation of the murine and human mc2-r have focused solely on expression in adrenal-derived cell lines such as murine Y1 and human H295R cells (10Cammas F.M. Pullinger G.D. Barker S. Clark A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Naville D. Jaillard C. Barjhoux L. Durand P. Begeot M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1999; 255: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such studies have demonstrated a role for the transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that is widely expressed by steroidogenic tissues and that is important for the expression of key regulators of steroidogenesis in both the adrenal and gonadal systems (14Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, although heterologous expression of SF-1 can induce mc2-r promoter activity in non-expressing, non-adrenal cell lines such as JEG3 and L cells (10Cammas F.M. Pullinger G.D. Barker S. Clark A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Sarkar D. Kambe F. Hayashi Y. Ohmori S. Funahashi H. Seo H. Endocr. J. 2000; 47: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), MC2-R is not expressed by all of the SF-1-positive tissues and therefore, SF-1 is not sufficient for mc2-r gene expression. In contrast, 3T3-L1 adipocytes have been shown not to express SF-1 (16Clyne C.D. Speed C.J. Zhou J. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20591-20597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the absence of SF-1, mc2-r gene expression must be regulated via an alternative transcriptional mechanism in this cell line and the elucidation of such a mechanism would greatly improve our understanding of the tissue-specific expression of this receptor. The following study investigates the transcriptional activation of the mc2-r during 3T3-L1 differentiation. We show that murine mc2-r promoter constructs are activated in adipocytes and that the region of activation maps to a peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE)-like sequence in the proximal promoter. This is a binding site for the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipogenesis that has been shown to directly regulate the expression of genes such as adipocyte P2 (17Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar) and lipoprotein lipase (18Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). We show that deletion or mutation of this sequence renders mc2-r promoter constructs uninducible during differentiation into adipocytes or by co-transfection with expression vectors for PPARγ2 and its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor α (RXRα). Plasmids and Constructs—5′ deletions were created by linearizing pMC2-R(–1805/+105)GL3, which contains mouse MC2-R sequences from –1805 to +105 cloned into the SmaI site of the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3 (Promega) with MluI and treated with exonuclease III. Deleted products were blunt-ended, ligated to MluI linkers, and ligated back into pGL3 as MluI/BglII fragments to create a 5′ deletion series with the structure pMC2-R(–x/+105)pGL3. Expression vectors for RXRα (pCMX-hRXRα) (19Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) were the kind gifts of Prof. R. Evans (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) and Prof. M. Lazar (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and differentiated by treating 2-day post-confluent cells (day 0) with medium containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin for 2 days. On day 2, medium was replaced with insulin only containing medium (1 μg/ml) for a further 48 h before returning the cells to normal cell culture conditions (day 4). Transfections—Cell lines stably harboring the pMC2-R(–1805/+105)GL3 reporter or the empty vector pGL3 were created by calcium phosphate precipitation transfection. Ten micrograms of each plasmid were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), which confers resistance to G418S (Geneticin, Invitrogen). Cells were selected and maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418S 24 h after transfection, and the resulting colonies were pooled to produce polyclonal cell cultures. Transient transfections were performed by lipofection using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cationic lipid was combined in a 2:1 ratio with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and then incubated with the cells under serum-free conditions for 1 h. An equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal calf serum was then added to the cells, which were subsequently harvested for luciferase assay after 24 h. When differentiating cells were transfected, insulin was included in the media for the 24 h after transfection. All of the transient transfections for luciferase reporter assays included 200 ng of the pRL-CMV Renilla control vector (Promega). For transfections with expression vectors for PPARγ and RXRα, the ratio of reporter, expression vector was kept constant by adding the pCMX empty vector. Reporter Assays—Luciferase was measured using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Cell lysates were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, and luciferase activity was measured using a BioOrbit 1253 luminometer (LabTech International, Sussex, United Kingdom). Reporter activity for transient transfections was calculated by normalizing the reporter luciferase value with that of the Renilla control vector. The activity of the pMC2-R(–1805/+105)GL3 reporter in stable cell lines was calculated by normalizing the luciferase values to those of the corresponding pGL3-containing cells. cAMP Assay—Cells grown in triplicate wells of a 6-well plate were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then stimulated for 30 min in the presence of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine with or without ACTH (10–8 m). The cells were then scraped on ice before being boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was assayed for cAMP using a competitive binding assay (21Brown B.L. Albano J.D. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). The response of differentiating 3T3-L1 cells to ACTH was calculated for each time point by dividing stimulated cAMP values by unstimulated values. Reverse Transcriptase (RT) PCR—Cytoplasmic RNA was harvested from 3T3-L1 cells grown in 6-well plates using the RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 2 μg of RNA was then DNase-treated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to RT. RT was performed at 37 °C for 1 h using Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT and random hexamers (Promega). PCRs were then performed using the cDNA equivalent of 50 ng of cytoplasmic RNA. The following primer sequences (Sigma) were used: MC2-R (forward, 5′-GAGCTGAAGCCAGCAAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGATCTGGCTTAGAAGGG-3′); SF-1, (forward, 5′-ATGGAAATGCATCGAATCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AATGCTTGTTGTTCTGGAC-3′); stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) (forward, 5′-ACATGCTCCAAGAGATCTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAGCCTTGTAAGTTCTGTG-3′); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′); and PPARγ2 (forward, 5′-GAGATTCTCCTGTTGACCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGCTTCAATCGGATGGTTC-3′). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Probes were created by filling in the 5′ overhangs of the annealed oligonucleotides with Klenow DNA polymerase using a mixture of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP. Nuclear extracts were prepared by Nonidet P-40-mediated cytoplasmic lysis (22Whiteside S.T. Visvanathan K.V. Goodbourn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and EMSA was performed using 10 μg of extract per reaction as described previously (23Fowkes R.C. Sidhu K.K. Sosabowski J.K. King P. Burrin J.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) as competitor (Amersham Biosciences). If antibody was included in the reaction, the initial incubation was extended to 1 h on ice in the presence of 2 μl of rabbit pre-immune serum, PPARγ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or RXRα antibody (a kind gift of Prof. R. Evans, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). Complexes were electrophoresed on a 5% native acrylamide gel, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleotide sequences (Sigma) used were (overhang in lowercase): PPRE wild type upper strand, 5′-gatcTCCCCTTTGGCCTCTCT-3′, and PPRE mutant upper strand, 5′-gatcTCCCGATAGGCCTCTCT-3′. Statistical Analysis—ANOVA was performed where appropriate followed by Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Transcriptional Activation of the mc2-r in the Absence of SF-1—Prior to any detailed transcriptional analysis of the mc2-r promoter, it was first necessary to document the timing of MC2-R up-regulation in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. This was achieved by measuring three relevant aspects of MC2-R expression: receptor activity, promoter activity, and mRNA expression (Fig. 1). Because of the absence of a suitable MC2-R antibody, it was not possible to measure protein expression directly. Although MC5-R has also been shown to be expressed during 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis, ACTH has been shown to act solely through the MC2-R in this cell line (2Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2043-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and, therefore, the cAMP response to ACTH was measured as a surrogate for MC2-R protein expression. Fig. 1A shows a 4.8-fold increase in cAMP production following ACTH treatment on day 2. This response peaked on day 4 and was completely absent in untreated cells on day 5 (5u). Therefore, these data are consistent with previous studies, which have shown the ACTH response to be differentiation-dependent (7White J. Engel F. J. Clin. Investig. 1958; 37: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Ramachandran J. Lee V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 428: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The second aspect of MC2-R expression to be measured was promoter activity. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were stably transfected with the pMC2-R(–1805/+105)GL3 reporter. These cells were differentiated, and the luciferase activity at each time point was compared with that of cells expressing the empty vector pGL3. Promoter activity was inferred from these two measurements, and the results show a 2-fold rise in promoter activity in the immediate 24 h following hormonal induction (Fig. 1B). The mc2-r promoter was activated maximally on day 3, and beyond this time point, the activity was found to diminish. A 24-h time lag was observed between changes in the MC2-R promoter and detectable changes in the response to ACTH stimulation. For example, the onset of a functional response to ACTH on day 2 was preceded by promoter activation on day 1, and the peak response to ACTH on day 4 was preceded by peak promoter activity on day 3. In subsequent experiments in which reporter activity was used as a measure of promoter activity in adipocytes, the day 3 time point was chosen as the optimum time to harvest cell lysates following transient transfection. The transcriptional activation of the mc2-r was also inferred by RT-PCR analysis of RNA harvested from differentiating 3T3-L1 cells using intron-spanning primers (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the observed increase in promoter activation, MC2-R message was detectable 24 h after hormonal induction and this appearance preceded the up-regulation of the adipocyte marker SCD-1 (24Kim Y.C. Ntambi J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) by 72 h. MC2-R transcriptional activation therefore precedes the attainment of terminal characteristics of differentiation and the accumulation of lipid, which was not apparent until day 3 post-induction as measured by Oil-Red O staining.2 RT-PCR was also used to measure SF-1 expression in 3T3-L1 cells. The results confirmed the absence of mRNA for this factor throughout the time course of differentiation, and this result prompted a search for an alternative positive acting factor(s) driving the basal activity of the promoter in adipocytes. A 59-bp Region of the Proximal Promoter Enhances mc2-r Transcription in the Adipocyte—In an attempt to characterize regions of the mc2-r promoter that confer enhanced activity in the adipocyte, a 5′ deletion series was transiently transfected into both undifferentiated and differentiated cells and the activities of the constructs were compared (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the results obtained using stable cells, the activity of the full-length pMC2-R(–1805/+105)GL3 reporter was significantly higher in day 3 adipocytes compared with undifferentiated cells and similar significantly enhanced levels of luciferase activity were observed for all of the deletion constructs between –1805 and –112. This suggested that each of these constructs contained within their sequence an adipocyte-specific enhancer. Further deletion of the promoter between –112 and –53 effectively abolished this enhanced activity, indicating that the enhancer sequence(s) resided between these two markers. When this 59-bp region of sequence was analyzed using MatInspector (25Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar), a putative PPRE was identified between –95 and –83 relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 2B). The 13-bp sequence shared a 77% similarity with a consensus direct repeat-1 site to which PPARγ is known to bind as a heterodimer with RXRα (26Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 is the adipocyte-specific PPARγ isoform, and it is up-regulated during 3T3-L1 differentiation (27Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was used to compare the mRNA profile of PPARγ2 with that of the MC2-R in a time course of differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Both mRNAs were up-regulated within the first 24 h following hormonal induction, and therefore, an increase in PPARγ2 levels might explain the activation of the mc2-r (Fig. 2C). This coincidence of PPARγ2/MC2-R expression together with the presence of a PPRE in the regulatory region of the mc2-r promoter highlighted PPARγ2 as a potential candidate regulator of MC2-R expression. The –95 PPRE Binds to PPARγ/RXRα in Adipocyte Nuclear Extracts—A series of experiments were carried out to test the ability of the –95/–83 sequence to bind to endogenous PPARγ/RXRα in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the –95/–83 sequence was prepared and used in EMSA with both preadipocyte and day 3 adipocyte nuclear extracts (Fig. 3). No factors binding to this sequence were observed in preadipocyte nuclear extracts, but a DNA-protein complex was seen when adipocyte nuclear extracts were used (lanes 1 and 2). This result was consistent with the hypothesis that the transcription factor regulating the expression of the MC2-R is expressed as the cells begin to differentiate. The binding observed with adipocyte nuclear extract could be abolished by mutating 3 of the 4 core bp (28Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) within the direct repeat-1 sequence, and this inactivation of the site formed the basis of later mutational analysis (lanes 3 and 4). When in vitro translated RXRα and PPARγ2 were combined with the –95/–83 probe, three bands were observed, the largest of which had the same mobility as that formed with day 3 adipocyte nuclear extracts (lane 8). Antibodies to both RXRα and PPARγ were able to supershift the complex formed with adipocyte nuclear extracts (lanes 6 and 7) as well as the upper band formed with in vitro translated protein (lanes 9 and 10), confirming the presence of these two proteins in the gel shift complexes. The lower complex is retarded with the RXR antibody and represents RXR homodimers that are known to bind to a direct repeat-1 site (lane 9) (29Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U.

The mmc2-r Promoter Responds to RXRα/PPARγ2 in Preadipocytes and This Response Maps to the –95 PPRE—Having determined that endogenous RXRα and PPARγ in adipocyte nuclear extracts could bind to the –95/–83 sequence, the ability of these factors to transactivate the MC2-R promoter was tested. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 and expression constructs for PPARγ2 and RXRα. Consistent with previous studies of PPRE-containing promoters (27Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar, 31Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transfection of either PPARγ2 or RXRα expression vectors alone had no effect on the activity of the pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 reporter in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. However, when both PPARγ2 and RXRα expression vectors were transfected together with the pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 reporter, a 9-fold induction of luciferase activity was observed (Fig. 4A). This response to PPARγ2/RXRα was mapped by co-expressing the two factors with a series of fine deletion constructs prepared between –112 and –53, the two markers that had previously been shown to contain the adipocyte-specific enhancer (Fig. 3B). This analysis showed that deletion between –104 and –86, which effectively removes the putative PPRE, resulted in a dramatic reduction in the ability of the promoter to respond to PPARγ2/RXRα. Mutating the –95/–83 sequence in the context of the pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 reporter by introducing, by site-directed mutagenesis, the 3-bp mutation that had previously been shown to abolish PPARγ2/RXRα binding in day 3 differentiated cell extracts (Fig. 3, lane 4) reduced the PPARγ2/RXRα response in preadipocytes to 20% of that of the wild type reporter. These results indicated the requirement of the –95 PPRE in mediating the effects of heterologously expressed PPARγ2/RXRα in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells. However, to assess whether or not endogenous PPARγ2/RXRα contribute to the basal activity of the mMC2-R promoter during adipogenesis, the wild-type and –95 PPRE-mutated pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 reporter constructs were transfected into differentiating 3T3-L1 cells and their activity was compared on day 3 post-induction (Fig. 4D). These data demonstrate the complete abrogation of reporter activity in adipocytes following mutagenesis of the –95 PPRE in the context of the pMC2-R(–112/+105)GL3 construct. ACTH exerts its effects upon the murine adipocyte via the MC2-R, which is expressed in 3T3-L1 cells when they are induced to differentiate into adipocytes. In this study, we have used a range of techniques to map precisely the dynamics of receptor expression during adipogenesis and the mechanism of transcriptional activation has been elucidated through mutational analysis of the murine promoter. MC2-R expression is limited to a small number of tissues, and previous work has implicated SF-1, a key regulator of steroidogenic genes, in the basal expression of the MC2-R in adrenal cells. One possible mechanism for MC2-R expression in the SF-1 non-expressing adipocyte was by SF-1 homologues acting through the same sites in the promoter as those thought to regulate expression in adrenal cells. However, a minimal promoter construct in which both SF-1 sites at –31 and +31 were mutated (32King P.J. Clark A.J. Endocr. Res. 1998; 24: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) was not impaired during adipocyte differentiation.2 Therefore, it was hypothesized that a novel SF-1-independent mechanism controls the expression of the mc2-r in the adipocyte. This study set out to explore MC2-R expression in the 3T3-L1 cell line, and the results highlight a key role played by a previously uncharacterized PPRE located between positions –95 and –83 upstream of the transcription start site. Although the up-regulation of MC2-R in murine adipocytes has been documented (33Boston B.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 885: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the precise timing of this event was unknown. We have shown that mc2-r transcription is activated within the first 24 h following hormonal induction, several days prior to the expression of mature adipocyte markers such as SCD-1 (24Kim Y.C. Ntambi J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the morphological changes associated with lipid accumulation. The early nature of MC2-R expression raises the possibility that this receptor plays a role in the process of differentiation itself, and the effect of ACTH treatment during adipogenesis is currently being investigated. Also, in addition to its early expression, the transcriptional activation of the mc2-r promoter appears to be transient with peak activity on day 3 and a peak ACTH response on day 4. PPARγ levels remain elevated throughout the time course of differentiation; therefore it is possible that the mc2-r promoter is subject to transcriptional repression after day 3. The mechanism of this down-regulation of promoter activity is the focus of ongoing studies. Systematic analysis of the mc2-r promoter revealed the presence of an adipocyte-specific enhancer element(s) within a 59-bp region of the proximal promoter. In addition to the putative PPRE at –95/–83, a potential signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) site was also identified within this region between –68 and –60. STATs 1, 3, and 5 have been shown to be induced during adipogenesis (34Gerhold D.L. Liu F. Jiang G. Li Z. Xu J. Lu M. Sachs J.R. Bagchi A. Fridman A. Holder D.J. Doebber T.W. Berger J. Elbrecht A. Moller D.E. Zhang B.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2106-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 35Nanbu-Wakao R. Morikawa Y. Matsumura I. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M.A. Senba E. Wakao H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and a dominant negative STAT5 construct can down-regulate a number of genes activated during adipogenesis (35Nanbu-Wakao R. Morikawa Y. Matsumura I. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M.A. Senba E. Wakao H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). EMSA experiments using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the –68/–60 sequence failed to show binding to either preadipocyte or adipocyte nuclear extracts, and this sequence was therefore unlikely to be important for MC2-R expression in these cells.2 In contrast, the –95/–83 PPRE binds PPARγ2/RXRα heterodimers in adipocyte nuclear extracts and mediates PPARγ2/RXRα-induced transcriptional activation. Furthermore, mutation of this sequence renders the promoter inactive in the adipocyte in the presence of endogenous PPARγ/RXRα and thereby demonstrates the important role played by the –95 PPRE in regulating the expression of the MC2-R gene. These data explain the ability of the MC2-R to be expressed in the adipocyte in the absence of SF-1. The question as to whether or not human adipocytes express the MC2-R has not been satisfactorily resolved. Early studies looked for a lipolytic response to ACTH equivalent to that of the murine adipocyte in both human and primate tissues (36Kiwaki K. Levine J.A. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 2003; 173: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Bousquet-Melou A. Galitzky J. Lafontan M. Berlan M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 451-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and concluded that such a response was absent. Such studies, together with a number of attempts to document the tissue distribution of melanocortin receptor mRNAs (36Kiwaki K. Levine J.A. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 2003; 173: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Chhajlani V. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar), have concluded that the MC2-R is not present in human adipocytes, and this lack of expression might be explained by the absence of an equivalent PPRE-like sequence in the proximal promoter of the human mc2-r. However, an analysis of the distal human promoter sequence revealed the presence of at least three putative PPRE-like elements,2 and recent work using both human subcutaneous adipose tissue and human embryonic stem cell line capable of undergoing adipogenesis demonstrated the expression of mc2-r mRNA in the human adipocyte (39Smith S.R. Gawronska-Kozak B. Janderova L. Nguyen T. Murrell A. Stephens J.M. Mynatt R.L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cell line used in this study is analogous to the 3T3-L1 cell line, being of embryonic mesenchymal origin. The expression of the MC2-R in human adipocytes may therefore be developmentally regulated in adipose tissue as it is in the testes, where expression has been shown to be restricted to fetal Leydig cells and down-regulated in the adult (3O'Shaughnessy P.J. Fleming L.M. Jackson G. Hochgeschwender U. Reed P. Baker P.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3279-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate as to the role of PPARγ in the regulation of mc2-r in tissues other than the adipocyte. For example, PPARγ has been shown to be abundantly expressed in the adrenal gland (40Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) and this may explain the ability of MC2-R expression to be maintained in SF-1-haploinsufficient mice in which adrenal MC2-R expression is higher in mutant mice than in their wild type siblings (41Bland M.L. Jamieson C.A. Akana S.F. Bornstein S.R. Eisenhofer G. Dallman M.F. Ingraham H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14488-14493Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42Beuschlein F.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3122-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms. PPARγ expression has also been demonstrated in the human pituitary gland where thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonists are a novel therapeutic target for ACTH-secreting adenomas (43Heaney A.P. Fernando M. Yong W.H. Melmed S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 44Heaney A.P. Fernando M. Melmed S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The MC2-R is also expressed in the pituitary gland and has been proposed to function in maintaining a negative feedback loop controlling ACTH secretion (45Morris D.G. Kola B. Borboli N. Kaltsas G.A. Gueorguiev M. McNicol A.M. Ferrier R. Jones T.H. Baldeweg S. Powell M. Czirjak S. Hanzely Z. Johansson J.O. Korbonits M. Grossman A.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Metab. 1988; 66: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results suggest a possible mechanism by which thiazolidinediones might exert their anti-tumorigenic effects upon pituitary adenomas through activation of MC2-R expression. Increased MC2-R expression would serve to enhance the proposed negative feedback of ACTH on cell growth that has been previously demonstrated in adrenocortical tumor cells (47Masui H. Garren L.D.

In conclusion, these data elucidate a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation for the murine mc2-r and suggest potentially exciting areas of further study in the adrenal and extra-adrenal sites of expression such as the pituitary gland."

Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are known to regulate transcription factors in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. In the present study, we examined whether the SAPKs play a role in the circadian system in cultured Xenopus retinal photoreceptor layers. A 6-h pulse of SB 203580, an inhibitor of SAPKs, reset the circadian rhythm of melatonin in a phase-dependent manner similar to dark pulses. This phase-shifting effect was dose-dependent over the range of 1-100 μm. Treatment with SB 203580 also affected light-induced phase shifts, and light had no effect on the circadian oscillator in the presence of 100 μm SB 203580. In-gel kinase assays showed that SB 203580 selectively inhibited a small group of protein kinases in the photoreceptor cells. These SB 203580-sensitive kinases correspond to two isoforms of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and three isoforms of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Further in vitro study demonstrated that SB 203580 also inhibited casein kinase Iϵ (CKIϵ), which has been shown to regulate circadian rhythms in several organisms. However, a pharmacological inhibition of CKI reset the circadian oscillator in a phase-dependent manner distinct from that of SB 203580. This argues against a primary role of CKI in the phase-shifting effects of SB 203580. These results suggest that SB 203580 affects the circadian system by inhibiting p38 MAPKs or JNKs and that these protein kinases are candidate cellular signals in the regulation of the circadian oscillator in the Xenopus retinal photoreceptors.

The central mechanisms of circadian oscillators are transcriptional, and translational autoregulatory feedback loops consisting of several clock gene products (1Dunlap J.C.

Phosphorylation of FRQ protein, a central component of the Neurospora circadian system, has also been shown to affect the period length of the circadian oscillator (7Liu Y. Loros J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results indicate that protein kinases play important roles in regulation of circadian feedback loops. The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are candidates for involvement in circadian system regulation. The SAPKs are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli such as UV light, heat shock, osmotic stress, or inflammatory cytokines. The activated SAPKs regulate several transcription factors to control gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 8Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar and 9Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The SAPKs are classified into at least two groups based on the amino acid sequences of their dual-phosphorylation sites. One group is c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, also known as SAPK1), and the other group is p38 MAPKs (also known as SAPK2, -3, and -4). Each SAPK is activated by a different set of upstream kinase and has a different substrate preference (8Cohen P.

Because some of the stimuli that activate SAPKs are known to reset the circadian oscillator (11Zatz M. Wang H.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R769-R776PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zatz M. Wang H.-M. Am.

In the present study, we investigated whether the SAPKs are involved in the regulation of the circadian oscillator in Xenopus retinal photoreceptors. We used SB 203580, an inhibitor of SAPKs, to pharmacologically manipulate SAPK pathways. SB 203580 was originally described as an exceptionally specific inhibitor of some of the p38 MAPKs (9Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We found that SB 203580 reset the photoreceptor circadian oscillator and prevented light-induced phase shifts. We also showed that the inhibitory effect of SB 203580 is relatively specific to a small group of protein kinases in the photoreceptor cells and that these SB 203580-sensitive kinases include at least JNKs and p38 MAPKs. We also found that SB 203580 suppresses not only SAPKs but also CKIϵ in an in vitro kinase assay. Animals and Photoreceptor Layer Preparation—Adult, male Xenopus laevis (length, 5-6.5 cm) were purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI) and exposed to 12-h light:12-h dark (LD 12:12) cycles for at least 3 weeks before use. Photoreceptor layers were prepared as described previously (20Hasegawa M. Cahill G.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, eyecups were prepared, and the inside of each eyecup was sequentially washed with 0.3% Triton X-100, distilled water, and culture medium to lyse the inner nuclear layer. Then the damaged inner retina was peeled out. The photoreceptor layers and attached pigment epithelium were isolated and incubated overnight in modified Wolf and Quimby amphibian tissue culture medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) (20Hasegawa M. Cahill G.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An incubator maintained the LD cycle, constant temperature (21.0 ± 0.2 °C), and 5% CO2 conditions. The pigment epithelium was removed from photoreceptor layer on the next day to complete the preparation. The experimental protocols meet the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Superfusion Culture—Superfusion culture was carried out for 5 days in constant darkness as described previously (20Hasegawa M. Cahill G.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, photoreceptor layers were cultured individually in flowthrough culture chambers, and the chambers were placed in light-tight water jackets. Temperature was maintained at 21 ± 0.1 °C by a circulating water bath. To maintain the pH of the culture medium, the inflow tubing inside the water jackets was gas-permeable silicone, and circulating water was bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Culture medium was a mixture of 80% defined balanced salts and amino acids (21Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2959-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 20% Wolf & Quimby amphibian tissue culture medium, with 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μm 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan added. Culture medium was delivered by a syringe pump at a rate of 0.4 ml/h. Experimental photoreceptor layers were exposed to drug pulses by changing syringes and/or to pulses of light at times specified relative to the animals' previous LD cycles (Zeitgeber time (ZT), dark onset = ZT 12). White light was delivered by fiber optic cables from an illuminator (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) with a 150-watt quartz-halogen lamp. Control photoreceptor layers were exposed to the control medium containing Me2SO and kept in constant darkness throughout the experiments with syringe changes at the times of drug pulses. Melatonin in superfusate samples was measured by radioimmunoassay, using an 125I-melatonin analogue (Covance, Vienna, VA) and the antiserum produced by Rollag and Niswender (22Rollag M.D. Niswender G.D. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Quantitative measurement of phase shifts of melatonin rhythms was performed as described previously (23Hasegawa M. Cahill G.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1812-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). First, the melatonin release record from each photoreceptor layer was smoothed by a three-point moving average, and long-term trends were removed by subtracting the average of values 12 h before and after each point (using the Chrono computer program, written by Till Roenneberg, Universität München). The times of half-rise and half-fall of the third, fourth, and sometimes fifth circadian peaks were measured as phase reference points for each record. For each photoreceptor layer, the time of each phase reference point was compared with the corresponding mean time in the control group, and the magnitude of the overall phase shift for each photoreceptor layer was taken as the mean of the phase differences measured at those phase reference points. Tissue Collection for Protein Kinase Assays—For each sample, four photoreceptor layers were cultured together in a 24-well tissue culture dish, starting at the dark onset time on the day after dissection. Culture medium was the same as that used for the superfusion culture. The culture dishes were placed in the CO2 incubator and kept in constant darkness. Tissue collections were performed at ZT 6 as follows. First, the photoreceptor layers were rinsed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) then lysed in 100 or 400 μl of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μm microcystin-LR, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. Tissues were homogenized and centrifuged (16,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were kept at -80 °C until immunoprecipitation or in-gel kinase assay. Immunoprecipitation—The protein samples were incubated overnight with phospho-JNK antibody (1:50), phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (1:50) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), or CKIϵ antibody (1:19; BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at 4 °C. On the next day, the samples were incubated for 2-3 h with either 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) or mixture of protein A-Sepharose beads and protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. For in-gel kinase assay, the samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g) at 4 °C, and precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated samples were solubilized in 10 μl of 2× SDS gel loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) then heated at 95-100 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation, supernatant fractions were kept at -80 °C until in-gel kinase assay. For kinase assay, the samples incubated with the beads were centrifuged at 4 °C, and precipitates were washed two times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer and one time with 1.1× kinase buffer (1× kinase buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 2 μm microcystin-LR, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate). The immunoprecipitated samples were resuspended into 20 μl of 1.1× kinase buffer and used for the kinase assay. In-gel Kinase Assay—In-gel kinase assays were performed as described (24Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, equal amounts of total protein samples or immunoprecipitated samples solubilized in 2× SDS gel loading buffer were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed with 20% 2-propanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h and then with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h to remove SDS. The proteins on the gel were denatured by 6 m guanidine-HCl in buffer A for 1 h, then renatured by 0.04% Tween 40 in buffer A for 19 h at 4 °C. After renaturation, the gel was preincubated in in-gel kinase assay buffer (40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0), 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2) for 30 min, then the kinase reaction was carried out in in-gel kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (25 μCi/ml buffer) for 1 h at room temperature, in the absence or presence of SB 203580 (1, 10, or 100 μm). The in-gel kinase assay buffer for the control group contained 0.13% Me2SO. After the kinase reaction, the gel was washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate then dried on paper. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. For quantitative analysis, each gel was exposed for multiple different periods of time, and each protein kinase band was analyzed by the appropriately exposed film using the National Institutes of Health Image software (crude extract samples) or the MacBass (immunoprecipitated samples). In both programs, the levels of phosphorylation were obtained by subtracting the background level from the signal intensity of each band. The value of each band in the experimental groups was compared with that of the corresponding band in the control group on the same film. Kinase Assay—Equal amounts of the immunoprecipitated samples were incubated in kinase assay buffer containing 1 μg of phosvitin as a substrate and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) for 30 min at 30 °C, in the presence or absence of SB 203580 (1, 10, or 100 μm). The kinase assay buffer for the control group contained 0.13% Me2SO. The kinase reaction was terminated by addition of 2× SDS gel loading buffer. The samples were heated at 95-100 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged. The supernatant fractions were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The phosphorylated substrates were detected by autoradiography and analyzed using MacBass as described above. Materials—Culture medium salts were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and all other medium components were from Invitrogen. SB 203580, PD 98059, and JNK inhibitor I were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). SP600125 was a gift from Signal Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA). For the melatonin radioimmunoassay, the 125I-melatonin analogue was from Covance (Vienna, VA), and the antiserum was donated by Dr. M. D. Rollag (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences). For the in-gel kinase assay and kinase assay, [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). SB 203580 Resets the Photoreceptor Circadian Oscillator—A 6-h pulse of SB 203580 (30 μm) reset the phase of the melatonin release rhythm. The magnitude and direction of the phase shift depended on the timing of the pulse (Fig. 1). A pulse of SB 203580 beginning at ZT 3 shifted the phase of the melatonin rhythm ∼12 h (Fig. 1A), a pulse beginning at ZT 12 caused a 7-h phase advance (Fig. 1B), and a pulse at ZT 15 had no effect on the phase of the melatonin rhythm (Fig. 1C). The new phase was attained rapidly and persisted through the end of the experiment. In contrast to its strong effect on the phase of the circadian oscillator, SB 203580 did not cause an apparent acute change in melatonin levels (Fig. 1). This is an interesting observation, because all of the entrainment stimuli reported previously such as light, dopamine, and cyclic AMP acutely affect melatonin level in the retinal photoreceptors (20Hasegawa M. Cahill G.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Hasegawa M. Cahill G.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1812-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that those signals act on both the entrainment pathway and the melatonin output pathway. On the other hand, the effect of SB 203580 occurs distinctively on the entrainment pathway (or on the oscillator), and therefore, the SB 203580-sensitive cellular signal does not play a significant role in oscillator output for melatonin release. We produced a phase-response curve (PRC) for SB 203580 by starting pulses at eight different phases throughout the circadian cycle (Fig. 2A). Pulses beginning in the late subjective night to the early subjective day caused phase delays, and pulses beginning in the late subjective day to the early subjective night caused phase advances, whereas a pulse centered at midnight did not change the phase of the melatonin rhythms, resulting in a dark-pulse type PRC (Fig. 2A). When the data are replotted as a phase-transition curve, they indicate type-0 resetting; a pulse given at any time of the day always moved the oscillator phase to the night time (Fig. 2B). We tested whether inhibition of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs, other members of MAPK superfamily) reset the circadian rhythm of melatonin by using PD 98059, an inhibitor of ERK kinase. ERK has been suggested to regulate the circadian system in mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (25Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), chick pineal gland (26Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37078-37085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as well as several cell lines (29Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 645-649PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cermakian N. Pando M.P. Thompson C.L. Pinchak A.B. Selby C.P. Gutierrez L. Wells D.E. Cahill G.M. Sancar A. Sassone-Corsi P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 844-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, a 6-h pulse of PD 98059 (30 μm) given either during the midday or during the midnight had no effect on the phase of melatonin rhythms (Fig. 2A). This argues against a role for ERK signaling in regulation of the circadian oscillator in Xenopus retinal photoreceptors. A Dose-dependent Effect of SB 203580 on the Circadian Oscillator Phase—We determined the dose-response relationship for SB 203580 effects on the circadian oscillator by starting pulses at ZT 6, where the oscillator is the most sensitive to the drug. A 6-h pulse of the drug induced phase shift of the circadian oscillator in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). A pulse of 1 μm SB 203580 did not affect oscillator phase (Fig. 3A), whereas a pulse of 10 μm caused a significant phase shift (Fig. 3B). A larger phase shift was induced when the photoreceptor layers were given a pulse at a concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 3C). This result showed that the phase-shifting effects of SB 203580 are dose-dependent and that a threshold concentration for resetting the circadian oscillator is somewhere in the range of 1-10 μm in the photoreceptor cells (Fig. 3D). Effects of SB 203580 on Light-induced Phase Shifts—We also investigated effects of SB 203580 on photic entrainment. When photoreceptor layers were exposed to a 6-h light pulse (∼600 lux) beginning at ZT 15, the expected phase delays of the melatonin rhythms were induced (Figs. 4A and 5A). At 10 or 30 μm SB 203580, a 6-h pulse of the drug alone did not cause a significant phase shift at this time (Fig. 5A). When the light treatments were applied together with either 10 μm or 30 μm SB 203580, significant phase advances were induced (Figs. 4B and 5A). These phase advances were not caused by either light or the drug treatment alone, indicating a complex interaction in the effects of the two treatments on the oscillator. On the other hand, treatment with a higher concentration of SB 203580 (100 μm) together with light caused a phase delay that is indistinguishable from that caused by SB 203580 (100 μm) alone, but significantly different from that caused by the light alone (Fig. 5A). This indicates that light had no effect on oscillator phase in the presence of 100 μm SB 203580. We also performed similar experiments at ZT 21 to confirm the SB 203580 effects on the light-induced phase shift. When the photoreceptor layers were exposed to a 6-h light pulse beginning at ZT 21, the expected phase advances were induced (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, a 6-h pulse of SB 203580 caused phase delays of melatonin rhythms, and the effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 5B). When the light was applied together with either 10 or 30 μm SB 203580, the phase shift that is significantly different from that produced by either light or the drug treatment alone was induced (Fig. 5B). However, simultaneous treatment with light and 100 μm SB 203580 together caused a phase delay that is indistinguishable from that caused by SB 203580 (100 μm) alone. Thus, SB 203580 consistently affected both phase advances and phase delays induced by light, and light had no effect on the oscillator phase in the presence of 100 μm SB 203580.Fig. 5Quantitative summary of circadian phase shifts induced by light (∼∼600 lux), SB 203580, and simultaneous treatment with light and SB 203580. The 6-h pulses were started at ZT 15 (A) or at ZT 21 (B). Three light-induced phase shifts in each graph were obtained from three separate experiments to test effects of three different concentrations of SB 203580 on the light-induced phase shift. Phase advances and delays are represented as positive and negative values, respectively. In both ZTs, the phase shift caused by light and SB 203580 (100 μm) together was indistinguishable from that caused by SB 203580 (100 μm) alone but was significantly different from that caused by light alone.

This result argues against a role for ERK signaling in regulation of the circadian oscillator in Xenopus retinal photoreceptors by light. It has been reported that inhibition of protein synthesis resets the circadian oscillator in a phase-dependent manner similar to SB 203580 and blocks light-induced phase shifts (31Dunlap J.C. Feldman J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Takahashi J.S. Murakami N. Nikaido S.S. Pratt B.L. Robertson L.M. Recent Prog. Horm.

This raised the possibility that the effects of SB 203580 on the circadian system are due to nonspecific inhibition of protein synthesis. We therefore examined whether SB 203580 inhibited protein synthesis in our system. The photoreceptor layers were incubated under constant darkness in the culture medium in which leucine was replaced by [3H]leucine (40 μCi/ml; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 6 h in the presence or absence of SB 203580, and the [3H]leucine incorporated into newly synthesized protein was measured by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation method (34Eskin A. Yeung S.J. Klass M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that a 6-h pulse of SB 203580 did not inhibit total protein synthesis (data not shown). It is unlikely, therefore, that the effects of SB 203580 are caused by nonspecific inhibition of protein synthesis. Effects of SB 203580 on Photoreceptor Protein Kinases—We assessed the overall specificity of SB 203580 for protein kinase activities in the photoreceptors by in-gel kinase assays of total protein extracts. This technique detects both substrate-dependent phosphorylation and autophosphorylation of kinases separated by molecular mass. Using MBP as a substrate, we detected various protein kinases in the photoreceptor cells (Fig. 6). The signals represent specific incorporation of radiolabeled phosphates into the substrate protein, because no signal was detected when [γ-32P]ATP was replaced by [α-32P]ATP (data not shown). The apparent molecular masses of the detected protein kinases were distributed approximately between 30 and 110 kDa. For quantitative analysis, those kinases were divided into 10 groups (peaks 1-10) based on the differences in the molecular mass (Fig. 6). When the kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of SB 203580 (1, 10, or 100 μm), only two groups of protein kinases were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 and Table I). The apparent molecular masses of those SB 203580-sensitive protein kinase groups were ∼55 kDa (peak 5) and 43-45 kDa (peak 6). This result suggests that the inhibitory effect of SB 203580 is relatively specific to a small group of protein kinases.Table IEffect of SB 203580 on protein kinases in Xenopus retinal photoreceptor cellsPeak (~kDa)32P incorporation1 μm10 μm100 μm% of controlPeak 1 (80-105)99.3 ± 7.5102.0 ± 10.886.1 ± 6.6Peak 2 (74)102.9 ± 15.1106.7 ± 10.0129.4 ± 16.6Peak 3 (68)88.2 ± 16.687.8 ± 20.7119.3 ± 17.4Peak 4 (61)85.4 ± 5.889.2 ± 6.470.3 ± 9.0Peak 5 (55)84.1 ± 7.052.7 ± 1.3ap < 0.05, significantly different from the group treated with 1 μm SB 203580 (ANOVA, Dun"
https://openalex.org/W2165138584,"Lipopolysaccharide, particularly the <i>O</i>-antigen component, is one of many virulence determinants necessary for <i>Shigella flexneri</i> pathogenesis. <i>O</i>-Antigen modification is mediated by glucosyltransferase genes (<i>gtr</i>) encoded by temperate serotype-converting bacteriophages. The <i>gtrV</i> gene encodes the GtrV glucosyltransferase, an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the transfer of a glucosyl residue via an α1,3 linkage to rhamnose II of the <i>O</i>-antigen unit. This mediates conversion of <i>S. flexneri</i> serotype Y to serotype 5a. Analysis of the GtrV amino acid sequence using computer prediction programs indicated that GtrV had 9–11 transmembrane segments. The computer prediction models were tested by genetically fusing C-terminal deletions of GtrV to a dual reporter system composed of alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase. Sandwiched GtrV-PhoA/LacZ fusions were also constructed at predetermined positions. The enzyme activities of cells with the GtrV-PhoA/LacZ fusions and the particular location of the fusions in the <i>gtrV</i> indicated that GtrV has nine transmembrane segments and one large N-terminal periplasmic loop with the N and C termini located on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the membrane, respectively. The existence of a unique reentrant loop was discovered after transmembrane segment IV, a feature not documented in other bacterial glycosyltransferases. Its potential role in mediating serotype conversion in <i>S. flexneri</i> is discussed."
