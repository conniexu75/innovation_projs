https://openalex.org/W2081085542,"We have examined the role of protein-protein interactions in modulating the activity of Sp1, a human transcription factor that utilizes glutamine-rich activation domains. These domains may represent a commonly used structural motif, since a nonhomologous glutamine-rich segment from the Drosophila Antennapedia protein is also a potent activator when fused to the Sp1 DNA binding domain. Sp1 is generally considered a proximal promoter factor that can only stimulate transcription when bound close to the initiation site. However, here we present evidence that distally and proximally bound Sp1 can stimulate transcription synergistically. In addition, a DNA binding-deficient mutant of Sp1 that retains glutamine-rich domains can interact with proximally bound Sp1 to superactivate transcription. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking provides direct evidence for an interaction between Sp1 monomers. Thus, Sp1-Sp1 interactions may play an important role in modulating promoter activity."

https://openalex.org/W2088283936,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains a family of luminal proteins (reticuloplasmins) that are normally excluded from the secretory pathway. However, reticuloplasmins are efficiently secreted when murine fibroblasts are treated with calcium ionophores. The secreted and cellular forms of endoplasmin are clearly distinguishable on the basis of gel mobility and endoglycosidase H sensitivity. Reticuloplasmin secretion leads to the depletion of the proteins from the ER and their accumulation in the Golgi apparatus. The stress response to calcium ionophore induces reaccumulation of reticuloplasmins in the ER and suppresses their secretion. Secretion is also associated with changes in the structure and distribution of the ER. These observations show that perturbation of cellular calcium levels leads to the breakdown of the mechanism for ER retention of reticuloplasmins and suggest a role for calcium ions in their sorting from secretory proteins."

Clonal deletion of thymocytes bearing self-reactive T cell receptors is a major mechanism for generating tolerance and occurs readily for antigens expressed by bone marrow-derived cells. Tolerance to antigens expressed on the radioresistant thymic stromal elements is demonstrated here to occur via a nondeletional mechanism. For minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mls-1a) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, this alternate form of tolerance induction results in clonal anergy."

https://openalex.org/W1670186976,"Specific inhibitors of the glycosylation of O-glycosidically linked glycoproteins have not previously been described. When tested for their effects on mucin glycosylation in a mucin-producing colon cancer cell line, LS174T, benzyl-, phenyl-, and p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-alpha-galactosaminide inhibited the formation of fully glycosylated mucin in a dose-dependent manner. Free aryl-oligosaccharides were found in the medium of treated cells labeled with [3H]glucosamine, [3H]galactose, [3H]fucose, [3H]mannosamine, or phenyl-alpha-[6-3H] N-acetylgalactosamine. UDP-Gal:GalNAc-beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase was inhibited by aryl-N-acetyl-alpha-galactosaminides but not by a number of other aryl-glycosides. Treatment with these inhibitors also causes reversible morphologic changes including formation of intercellular cysts. Aryl-N-acetyl-alpha-galactosaminides can be useful for the structural and functional studies of mucin macromolecules and other O-linked glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1514223875,"The effects of increased synthesis of secreted proteins expressed from stably integrated heterologous genes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells following treatment with sodium butyrate was studied. Butyrate treatment increased expression of mRNA transcribed from the adenovirus major late promoter in combination with the SV40 enhancer for Factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and erythropoietin. Increased levels of mRNA were compared to increases in intracellular primary translation product and secreted protein. While von Willebrand factor and erythropoietin were efficiently secreted, Factor VIII was not. Increased expression of all these proteins induced expression of the glucose-regulated proteins, GRP78 and GRP94. However, increased Factor VIII synthesis was correlated with an 80-fold increase in GRP78 mRNA and a 10-fold increase in GRP94 mRNA. These data suggest that elevated levels of newly synthesized secretion-competent protein as well as misfolded protein induce the glucose-regulated proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1616650749,"Anthrax toxin is the only protein secreted by Bacillus anthracis that contributes to the virulence of this bacterium. An obligatory step in the action of anthrax toxin on eukaryotic cells is cleavage of the receptor-bound protective antigen (PA) protein (83 kilodaltons) to produce a 63-kilodalton, receptor-bound COOH-terminal fragment. A similar fragment can be obtained by limited treatment with trypsin. This proteolytic processing event exposes a site with high affinity for the other two anthrax toxin proteins, lethal factor and edema factor. Terminal sequencing of the purified fragment showed that the activating cleavage occurred in the sequence Arg164-Lys165-Lys166-Arg167. The gene encoding PA was mutagenized to delete residues 163–168, and the deleted PA was purified from a Bacillus subtilis host. The deleted PA was not cleaved by either trypsin or the cell-surface protease, and was non-toxic when administered with lethal factor. Purified, deleted PA protected rats when administered 90 min before injection of 20 minimum lethal doses of toxin. This mutant PA may be useful as a replacement for the PA that is the major active ingredient in the current human anthrax vaccine, because deleted PA is expected to have normal immunogenicity, but would not combine with trace amounts of LF and EF to cause toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1520241460,"The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is a member of the small molecular weight GTP-binding protein family and serves as the cofactor in the cholera toxin-catalyzed activation of the stimulatory regulatory subunit (Gs) of adenylate cyclase. Bovine Arf1 has been expressed at high levels and purified from bacteria. The recombinant Arf1 was compared with purified bovine brain Arf and shown to be nearly identical with respect to immunoblotting, guanine nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, and cholera toxin cofactor activities. The only known chemical difference between the recombinant and brain proteins is the lack of myristic acid at the amino terminus of the expressed protein. The preparation of nucleotide-free Arf1 has allowed a more accurate determination of the binding constants for guanine nucleotides and revealed a significantly higher affinity for GDP than was previously determined. The effect of magnesium ions on nucleotide affinities was also determined and found to be quite different for the different guanine nucleotides. We have shown that GDP binds to the protein in the absence of magnesium, while GTP or guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) can only bind to Arf1 in the presence of nanomolar (or higher) levels of the free metal. This characterization of the nucleotide binding and the ability to produce large amounts of a single species of ARF with full retention of a range of activities should greatly facilitate subsequent studies on the structure and function of ARF."

https://openalex.org/W1491068058,"alpha-Amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) secreted by the aleurone layer of barley grains are Ca2+-containing metalloenzymes. We studied the effect of Ca2+ on the activity and structure of the two major groups of aleurone alpha-amylase by incubating affinity purified enzyme in solutions containing Ca2+ from pCa 4 to 7. Both groups of isoforms required one atom of Ca2+/molecule of enzyme as determined by isotope exchange, but the two groups differed by more than 10-fold in their affinity for Ca2+. Both groups of alpha-amylase were irreversibly inactivated by incubation in low Ca2+ (pCa 7). This inactivation was not due to changes in primary structure, as measured by molecular weight, but appeared to be the result of changes in secondary and tertiary structure as indicated by circular dichroism spectra, serology, lability in the presence of protease, and fluorescence spectra. Analysis of the predicted secondary structure of barley aleurone alpha-amylase indicates that the Ca2+-binding region of barley amylases is structurally similar to that of mammalian alpha-amylases. Our data indicate that micromolar levels of Ca2+ are required to stabilize the structure of barley alpha-amylases in the endoplasmic reticulum of the aleurone layer where these enzymes are synthesized."

https://openalex.org/W1507429610,"We have isolated two cDNAs encoding human lysosomal beta-galactosidase, the enzyme deficient in GM1-gangliosidosis and Morquio B syndrome, and a beta-galactosidase-related protein. In total RNA from normal fibroblasts a major mRNA of about 2.5 kilobases (kb) is recognized by cDNA probes. A minor transcript of about 2.0 kb is visible only in immunoselected polysomal RNA. A heterogeneous pattern of expression of the 2.5-kb beta-galactosidase transcript is observed in fibroblasts from different GM1-gangliosidosis patients. The nucleotide sequences of the two cDNAs are extensively colinear. However, the short cDNA misses two noncontiguous protein-encoding regions (1 and 2) present in the long cDNA. The exclusion of region 1 in the short molecule introduces a frameshift in its 3'-flanking sequence, which is restored by the exclusion of region 2. These findings imply the existence of two mRNA templates, which are read in a different frame only in the nucleotide stretch between regions 1 and 2. Sequence analysis of genomic exons of the beta-galactosidase gene shows that the short mRNA is generated by alternative splicing. The long and short cDNAs direct the synthesis in COS-1 cells of beta-galactosidase polypeptides of 85 and 68 kDa, respectively. Only the long protein is catalytically active under the assay conditions used, and it is capable of correcting beta-galactosidase activity after endocytosis by GM1-gangliosidosis fibroblasts. The subcellular localization of cDNA-encoded beta-galactosidase and beta-galactosidase-related proteins is different."
https://openalex.org/W1509786438,"We have reported previously that a 67-kDa polypeptide (p67) present in reticulocyte lysates protects the alpha-subunit of reticulocyte eukaryotic peptide chain initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) from phosphorylation by an eIF-2 kinase, heme-regulated protein synthesis inhibitor (Datta, B., Chakrabarti, D., Roy, A.L., and Gupta, N. K. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 3324-3328). We now present evidence that this p67 contains multiple O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues, and these glycosyl residues may be required for p67 activity to protect the eIF-2 alpha-subunit from eIF-2 kinase phosphorylation. Our results are as follows. 1) p67 binds specifically to wheat germ agglutinin, and such binding is completely inhibited in the presence of 0.2 M GlcNAc. 2) The binding of p67 to wheat germ agglutinin leads to complete loss of p67 activity to protect the eIF-2 alpha-subunit from eIF-2 kinase phosphorylation. 3) p67 accepts 10-12 [3H]galactose molecules from UDP-[3H]galactose in the presence of galactosyltransferase. This radioactivity is resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosamine F (+ peptide:N-glycosidase F) treatment but is completely lost when the 3H-labeled p67 is treated with sodium borohydride in mild alkali (beta-elimination reaction). These results suggest that p67 contains terminal GlcNAc moieties O-linked to the protein. 4) Upon hexosaminidase treatment, p67 reaction product migrated as a lower molecular mass (Mr approximately 65 kDa) protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 5) A monoclonal antibody (D1) against p67 has been isolated. D1 apparently recognizes a specific GlcNAc-containing peptide epitope in p67 and does not react with hexosaminidase-treated p67. These results suggest that p67 activity in the cell may also be regulated post-transcriptionally by glycosylation of p67 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2012680547,"The ability to clone large fragments of DNA in yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC's) has created the possibility of obtaining global physical maps of complex genomes. For this application to be feasible, most sequences in complex genomes must be able to be cloned in YAC's, and most clones must be genetically stable and colinear with the genomic sequences from which they originated (that is, not liable to undergo rearrangement). These requirements have been met with a YAC library containing DNA fragments from Drosophila melanogaster ranging in size up to several hundred kilobase pairs. Preliminary characterization of the Drosophila YAC library was carried out by in situ hybridization of random clones and analysis of clones containing known sequences. The results suggest that most euchromatic sequences can be cloned. The library also contains clones in which the inserted DNA is derived from the centromeric heterochromatin. The locations of 58 clones collectively representing about 8 percent of the euchromatic genome are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2165867989,"Abstract Rearranged MOPC41 immunoglobulin kappa gene constructs have been stably introduced into cultured S194 mouse plasmacytoma cells to investigate the effects of deleting the intronic enhancer and/or matrix association region (MAR) on gene expression. Intact single-copy kappa genes containing 1.5 kilobase pairs of upstream and 8.5 kilobase pairs of downstream flanking sequences exhibited sensitivity to chromosome position effects and were expressed at a mean level of 27% relative to the endogenous kappa gene expression or only 6% with respect to the MOPC41 kappa mRNA levels in the tumor. Deletion of the intronic MAR led to a 4-fold decrease in expression, while deletion of both the MAR and enhancer led to an 11-fold decline. These effects were dampened by preselecting for integration into a transcriptionally poised chromatin location as demonstrated by linkage to a selectable marker which lacked both a MAR and an enhancer. Significantly, we found that sequences downstream of the poly(A) addition site compensated 150-fold for deletion of the intronic enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1539675729,"Phorbol esters induce the differentiation of the human promonocytic cell line U937 to a monocyte/macrophage. This process is associated with the induction of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene expression (Strulovici, B., Daniel-Issakani, S., Oto, E., Nestor, J., Jr., Chan, H., and Ping-Tsou, A. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3569-3576). Here we describe the induction by phorbol esters of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responsiveness in U937 cells. Preincubation with phorbol myristate acetate (TPA, 5 x 10(-8) M) for at least 4-6 h and up to 12 h followed by 3 h of LPS treatment induced a 4-fold enhancement in the accumulation of IL-1 beta transcripts compared to treatment with TPA alone. This priming effect was specific for protein kinase C agonists and required de novo protein synthesis. Exposure of [35S]methionine-labeled U937 cells to phorbol esters induced the de novo synthesis of a protein which migrated with a 40-kDa molecular mass in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, had an isoelectric point of 5.7 (p 40/5.7), and was recognized by a specific antibody to the pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive Gi2. The time course for the appearance of Gi2 correlated with that for the induction of LPS responsiveness by TPA. Moreover, the LPS response was PT-sensitive. In cells treated with LPS for 5 min, Gi2 showed diminished ADP-ribosylation by PT. Treatment of U937 cells with LPS for 30 min induced phosphorylation of Gi2 and enhanced PT labeling. In a cell-free assay, phosphorylation of Gi2 by protein kinase C type III, rendered it a better PT substrate. The present findings thus suggest: 1) that TPA induces LPS responsiveness in U937 cells via de novo synthesis of Gi2; 2) that the LPS response (enhanced IL-1 production) is linked to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein which we identified as Gi2; and 3) that LPS leads to phosphorylation of Gi2."

https://openalex.org/W1528921963,"Amino acid sequencing of a large number of chemical and enzymatic cleavage products of elongation factor 1 alpha purified from rabbit reticulocyte has identified seven post-translationally modified residues. Five of the modifications are methylations of lysine residues yielding dimethyllysine at residues 55 and 165 and trimethyllysine at residues 36, 79, and 318. The two remaining post-translational modifications involve the addition of ethanolamine to glutamic acid residues 301 and 374, as reported previously (Rosenberry, T. L., Krall, J. A., Dever, T. E., Haas, R., Louvard, D., and Merrick, W. C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7096-7099). Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry have been used to analyze peptides containing these modified residues. The analyses have determined that glycerylphosphorylethanolamine has been attached to the glutamic acid residues. An analysis of the amino acid sequence surrounding each of the three types of modification has indicated no similarities. Therefore, it seems likely that the modifying enzymes do not recognize a specific amino acid sequence but rather the three-dimensional presentation of either amino or carboxyl residues in the elongation factor 1 alpha structure."
https://openalex.org/W1979764160,"During T cell differentiation, self tolerance is established in part by the deletion of self-reactive T cells within the thymus (negative selection). The presence of T cell receptor (TCR)-αβ+ T cells in older athymic (nu/nu) mice indicates that some T cells can also mature without thymic influence. Therefore, to determine whether the thymus is required for negative selection, TCR Vβ expression was compared in athymic nu/nu mice and their congenic normal littermates. T cells expressing Vβ3 proteins are specific for minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mlsc) determinants and are deleted intrathymically due to self tolerance in Mlsc+ mouse strains. Here it is shown that Vβ3+ T cells are deleted in Mlsc+ BALB/c nu/+ mice, but not in their BALB/c nu/nu littermates. Thus, the thymus is required for clonal deletion during T cell development."

https://openalex.org/W2088163601,"Transcription of the yeast CYC1 promoter fused to a sequence lacking guanosine residues provided a rapid, sensitive assay of initiation by RNA polymerase II in yeast extracts. Initiation was enhanced by yeast and mammalian activator proteins. The adenoviral major late promoter fused to the G-minus sequence was transcribed in yeast extracts with an efficiency comparable to that observed in HeLa extracts, showing that promoters as well as transcription factors are functionally interchangeable across species. Initiation occurred at different sites, approximately 30 and 63 to 69 base pairs downstream of the TATA element of the adenoviral promoter in HeLa and yeast extracts, respectively, distances characteristic of initiation in the two systems in vivo. A component of the transcription system and not the promoter sequence determines the distance to the initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W1591965351,"The anion transporter from human red blood cells, band 3, has been expressed in Xenopus laevis frog oocytes microinjected with mRNA prepared from the cDNA clone. About 10% of the protein is present at the plasma membrane as determined by immunoprecipitation of covalently bound 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS) with anti-DIDS antibody. The expressed band 3 transport chloride at a rate comparable to that in erythrocytes. Transport of chloride is inhibited by stilbene disulfonates, niflumic acid, and dipyridamole at concentrations similar to those that inhibit transport in red blood cells: DIDS and 4,4'-dinitro-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate inhibit chloride uptake with Kiapp of 34 nM and 2.5 microM, respectively. Lysine 539 has been tentatively identified as the site of stilbene disulfonate binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of this lysine to five different amino acids has no effect on transport. Inhibition by stilbene disulfonates or their covalent binding was not affected when Lys-539 was substituted by Gln, Pro, Leu, or His. However, substitution by Ala resulted in weaker inhibition and covalent binding. These results indicate that lysine 539 is not part of the anion transport site and that it is not essential for stilbene disulfonate binding and inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1572613835,"Equilibrium binding studies demonstrate that purified Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase binds isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, NADP, and NADPH at 1:1 ratios of substrate to enzyme monomer. The phosphorylated enzyme, which is completely inactive, is unable to bind isocitrate but retains the ability to bind NADP and NADPH. Replacement of serine 113, which is the site of phosphorylation, by aspartate results in an inactive enzyme that is unable to bind isocitrate. Replacement of the same serine with other amino acids (lysine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, and alanine) produces active enzymes that bind both substrates. Hence, the negative charge of an aspartate or a phosphorylated serine at site 113 inactivates the enzyme by preventing the binding of isocitrate."
https://openalex.org/W1499390113,"Abstract Rat olfactory adenylyl cyclase has been identified by means of a monoclonal antibody BBC-2, which reacts with both Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive and -insensitive forms of adenylyl cyclase (Mollner, S., and Pfeuffer, T. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 171, 265-271). The antibody recognized a 180-kDa polypeptide in olfactory cilia but not in decilitated olfactory epithelial membranes. A protein of the same mobility was observed when olfactory adenylyl cyclase was purified by forskolin-agarose affinity chromatography followed by radioiodination. Its identity was further established by cross-linking to [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gs alpha (GTP-binding protein), to yield a single radiolabeled product of Mr approximately 220. Olfactory adenylyl cyclase has a approximately 3-fold higher turnover number, as assessed from stoichiometric binding of [35S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate. Therefore, the considerably higher specific adenylyl cyclase activity in olfactory cilia must be due to a approximately 100-fold higher molar concentration of enzyme in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1553688586,"A hybrid protein that comprises the β-lactamase signal peptide fused precisely to chicken muscle triosephosphate isomerase is not secreted into the periplasm of Escherichia coli. The protein can be secreted, however, if an arginine residue at position 3 of the isomerase is replaced by either a serine or a proline residue. In contrast, replacement of a neighboring lysine residue has no effect on secretion of the protein. Furthermore, if the arginine is removed from position 3 to generate a secreted protein, but is then reintroduced in place of the neighboring lysine, the blockade to secretion is re-established. The singular effect of the arginine residue on secretion does not result from the role this residue plays in the formation or stabilization of the native isomerase structure: mutational alterations remote from the N terminus of the isomerase that prevent the proper folding of the protein do not relieve the block to secretion. The finding that an arginine residue prevents secretion while a lysine residue does not, suggests that basic residues near the mature N terminus of a secreted protein must be deprotonated if orderly export is to occur. This implies that the signal peptide along with the N-terminal portion of the mature protein partitions directly into the lipid bilayer in the course of the secretory process."
https://openalex.org/W125683640,"alpha-Thrombin induces a dose-dependent rapid transient increase in platelet cytosolic Ca2+ levels, coming solely from intracellular stores, since EGTA has no effect. In contrast, the post-stimulation equilibrium [Ca2+]in depends upon an influx from the extracellular milieu, and is lower in the presence of EGTA. We measured the Ca2+ transient (with Indo-1, 1-[2-amino-5-(6-carboxyindol-2-yl)-phenoxy]-2-(2'-amino-5'-methylp henoxy)- ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), cytosolic alkalinization (with BCECF, 2',7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein), membrane depolarization (with diS-C3-(5), 3,3'-dipropylthiodi-carbocyanide iodide), and degranulation (by beta-glucuronidase release) induced in washed human platelets by 9 nM thrombin in the absence or presence of extracellular or intracellular Ca2+ chelating agents (EGTA and BAPTA, 5,5'-dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, respectively). Platelets loaded simultaneously with 2 microM Indo-1 and 15 microM BAPTA (each as the acetoxymethyl ester) before addition of thrombin exhibited no cytoplasmic Ca2+ transient or alkalinization, no depolarization or degranulation. Replenishment of such cells with extracellular CaCl2 restored resting [Ca2+]in. Upon stimulation with 9 nM thrombin these replenished platelets exhibited no Ca2+ transient, and a slow gradual increase in [Ca2+]in from extracellular stores, a slow alkalinization and depolarization, and partial degranulation, all abolished by extracellular EGTA. Thus thrombin-induced platelet activation exhibits a biphasic Ca2+ requirement: the initial transient increase in [Ca2+]in comes from intracellular stores only, while the later steps of depolarization, alkalinization, and degranulation can proceed, albeit more slowly, if only extracellular Ca2+ is available."
https://openalex.org/W1556119083,"Abstract The FAD-containing NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, which catalyzes the four-electron reduction of O2----2H2O, has been purified by an improved procedure for analyses of its structural and redox properties. The enzyme is apparently a dimer of two identical subunits, each containing 1 mol of FAD. Dithionite reduction of the enzyme proceeds in two distinct phases corresponding to approximately 0.5 and 1.1 eq/FAD, respectively. Thiol assays of the NADH oxidase, reduced anaerobically with 1 eq of NADH/FAD prior to denaturation, are consistent with the presence of a single redox-active cysteinyl residue/subunit. Analysis of the cysteinyl peptides of the oxidase, identified in tryptic digests of the enzyme labeled metabolically with [35S]cysteine, reveals a sequence which is closely related to the redox-active cysteinyl peptide sequence recently determined for the streptococcal flavoprotein NADH peroxidase. A second cysteinyl peptide sequence, when aligned with residues 3-17 of the peroxidase NH2-terminal sequence, reveals identity in 7 of 15 positions and satisfies several of the criteria described for ADP-binding structures. Additional probes of the structural and redox properties of the NADH oxidase, including visible circular dichroism spectroscopy and sensitivity to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, provide further evidence for a fundamental structural connection between flavin-dependent NADH oxidase and peroxidase functions."

https://openalex.org/W1520349149,"Intracellular calcium has been proposed to be an important mediator of signal transduction by various growth factors. We have studied the role of intracellular calcium in the mitogenic stimulation of C3H 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts by epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor α. We have found that both these peptides can cause a marked, transient increase in intracellular calcium levels. This rise occurs only in the presence of extracellular calcium. However, this calcium transient is not involved in the accumulation of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs which are elicited by these growth factors, since mRNA induction is observed to an equivalent degree in the absence or presence of extracellular calcium. These results demonstrate that although these growth factors cause an increase in intracellular calcium, the calcium second messenger system is not responsible for the induction of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs in C3H 10T1/2 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1518017695,"An alpha-xylosidase that acts on oligosaccharide fragments of xyloglucan, a plant cell wall polysaccharide, was purified from pea (Pisum sativum) epicotyls that had been treated with an auxin analog. The enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 85,000 Da according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 79,000 Da according to gel-permeation chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. The purified xylosidase consisted of a series of closely related, enzymatically active proteins with isoelectric points ranging from about pH 7.35 to 7.7; the xylosidases were separated by chromatofocusing. The pH optimum of the mixed xylosidase was 4.9-5.1. The substrate specificity of the xylosidase mixture was determined by purification and structural characterization of the products of treating xyloglucan-oligosaccharide substrates with the enzyme. Characterization of the substrates and products included elution volume from a gel-permeation column, glycosyl residue and glycosyl linkage composition analyses, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The enzyme specifically cleaved only one of the alpha-xylosidic linkages of xyloglucan-oligosaccharide substrates, the one attached to a 6-linked glucosyl residue, not those attached to the 4,6-linked glucosyl residues. The enzyme was unable to cleave the xylosidic linkage of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-xylopyranoside or the alpha-xylosidic linkage to C-6 of glucose in the disaccharide isoprimeverose. The enzyme was also unable to release measurable amounts of xylose from large xyloglucan polymers."
https://openalex.org/W1505041459,"Abstract Modification of bovine brain G proteins by an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of biotin has been studied. In the presence of GDP, but in the absence of Mg2+, neither guanine nucleotide binding nor GTPase activity of the protein was altered by modification using less than 1.25 mM biotin derivative with 1 mg/ml G protein. Under these conditions the alpha subunit was modified more extensively than the beta and gamma subunits. However, biotinyl-alpha was less readily bound to streptavidin-agarose than was the less modified beta subunit. Biotinyl-beta gamma was isolated from the modified, intact G protein and further characterized to determine if biotinylation alters its functional properties. Isolated biotinyl-beta gamma and unmodified beta gamma were equivalent based upon: 1) inhibition of the S49 cell membrane adenylyl cyclase, 2) changes in hydrodynamic parameters after being recombined with isolated alpha and treated with guanine nucleotides or complexes of fluoride and aluminum, and 3) competition for isolated alpha binding to biotinyl-beta gamma immobilized previously on streptavidin-agarose. Biotinyl-beta gamma prebound to streptavidin-agarose was 70-100% functional, based upon binding of isolated alpha subunits. Estimates of the affinity of alpha binding to biotinyl-beta gamma indicate that bovine brain alpha 41 has a 10-15-fold higher affinity for beta gamma than does alpha 39. Nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotides and complexes of fluoride and aluminum decreased binding of either alpha 39 or alpha 41 to biotinyl-beta gamma, and these effects were dependent upon the amount of Mg2+ present. GTP decreased binding of alpha 39, but not alpha 41, to biotinyl-beta gamma. These results indicate that GTP can affect G protein subunit interactions and that its effects do not necessarily require an intact membrane environment or the participation of activating receptors or other membrane-associated proteins. They further indicate that biotinylation of beta gamma does not alter its functional properties and that it can be used for studying G protein subunit interactions."

The swelling is fully reversed by uncoupler, is stimulated by quinine, and is accompanied by membrane depolarization and increased rate of respiration. A23187-treated mitochondria passively swell in K+ thiocyanate at neutral pH, under conditions where the H+-K+ antiporter appears to be silent. These data indicate that A23187 activates electrophoretic K+ flux, supporting the notion that Mg2+ depletion unmasks several ionic conductance pathways whose concerted interplay could provide a sensitive regulation of mitochondrial volume homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1969165922,"The goals of providing coverage for everyone in the United States and controlling the growth in national health expenditures require difficult decisions about what medical services to provide. Currently accepted practices vary enormously in the amount of health they produce for a given expenditure. Studies of the health effects of several major interventions in relation to their costs--Pap smears, mammography, coronary care units, bypass surgery, and cholesterol reduction--indicate the kinds of choices to be made."
https://openalex.org/W1499399837,"Rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes were labeled with [3H]serine or [3H]mannose as a precursor. Intracellular proteoglycan core protein precursor was purified from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies against the hyaluronic acid-binding region, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The core precursor was eluted from the gels and treated with alkaline borohydride in order to convert serine residues substituted with xylose or N-acetylgalactosamine to alanine (or with alkaline sulfite to convert them to cysteic acid). After acid hydrolysis, the proportions of labeled serine and alanine (or cysteic acid) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography, and the results were compared with those obtained for the completed proteoglycan molecules isolated from the same cultures. In the completed proteoglycans, about 55% of the serine residues were substituted with xylose or N-acetylgalactosamine, while the corresponding figure for the intracellular precursor molecules was less than 5%. These results indicate, in agreement with our previous kinetic data, that the major part of the xylosyl transfer to the chondrosarcoma proteoglycan core protein precursor must occur late in the processing sequence, i.e. after about 85% of its intracellular lifetime and no more than 7 min before the addition of the rest of the chondroitin sulfate chain. The ratio of [3H]mannose to [3H]fucose in the core precursor was about 19, while that for the complete proteoglycan was about 2. This indicates the presence of high mannose, N-linked oligosaccharides on the core protein precursor which are converted to the complex forms on the completed proteoglycan. These data provide further support that the core precursor resides mainly in the pre-Golgi compartment and that xylosylation occurs mainly in a Golgi compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1525390051,"The high-affinity receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2) is composed of two distinct subunits with molecular weights of 55,000 and 75,000 (p55 and p75). While the presence of the high-affinity receptor requires the simultaneous expression of p55 and p75, these subunits can also be expressed independently, resulting in IL-2 receptors with low and intermediate affinities, respectively. IL-2 can induce proliferation in cells expressing either the intermediate affinity p75 receptor or the p55. p75 high-affinity complex, suggesting that p75 is responsible for signal transduction. We have previously shown that signal transduction by the high-affinity IL-2 receptor involves the activation of a tyrosine protein kinase. In order to evaluate the role of p75 in the activation of this kinase we assessed the ability of IL-2 to induce the activation of a tyrosine protein kinase in the human leukemic cell lines Hut 78 and YT. These cells express p75 as the predominant IL-2 receptor. IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in both cell lines and the concentrations of IL-2 needed to stimulate this phosphorylation were similar to that required for binding to the p75 receptor. Antibodies that inhibit binding of IL-2 to p55 had no effect on the IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylations in YT cells, while antibodies that block the binding of IL-2 to p75 completely inhibited the phosphorylations. These results demonstrate that the signaling capacity for the IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation resides in the p75 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1560820482,"Abstract We have purified to homogeneity a 23-kDa protein from bovine brain membranes using [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) binding as an assay. GTP gamma S binding to the purified protein is inhibited by GDP, GTP, and GTP analogs but not by cGMP, GMP, or adenine nucleotides, consistent with the nucleotide-binding behavior of members of the family of GTP-binding regulatory proteins. On addition of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine and a methyltransferase present in bovine brain membranes, the purified 23-kDa G-protein is carboxyl methylated. When subjected to limited tryptic proteolysis, the 23-kDa protein is converted to a 22-kDa major fragment with concomitant release of a carboxyl methylated protein fragment of 1 kDa. Furthermore, when the cleaved protein is reconstituted with stripped bovine brain membranes, the small carboxyl-methylated fragment but not the 22-kDa major fragment is found to reassociate with the membranes. These results indicate that the site of carboxyl methylation and the region responsible for membrane anchoring, most likely, are localized to a small region at the carboxyl terminus. It is attractive to speculate that carboxyl methylation and membrane anchoring are interrelated processes and play key roles in the function of this small G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1632515834,"The potential role of calcium as a regulator of goblet cell differentiation was tested by culturing duodenal explants from 14-day chicken embryos in media containing a range of calcium concentrations. Extracellular calcium in vitro approximated the range of plasma calcium concentration that was found to rise by 16% during the third week of embryonic development. As ionic calcium was increased from 0.9 to 2.0 mM in 48-h cultures, the number of goblet cells per 100 ridges increased progressively from 29 +/- 2.2 to 158 +/- 6.9 while attaining a distribution on the previllous ridges similar to that in ovo. The rate of goblet cell differentiation in vitro exceeded that in ovo when extracellular calcium was increased to 1.1 mM and was maximal at 1.6-2.0 mM calcium. Neither the growth of previllous ridges nor gross morphology of the tissue was altered as extracellular calcium was increased. Goblet cell differentiation in 1.3 mM calcium was stimulated by 0.1 microM calcium ionophore and inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine, indicating an intracellular site for calcium action. These results indicate that calcium plays a primary role in regulating goblet cell differentiation in embryonic intestine and suggest that rising levels of plasma calcium influence the rate of differentiation in ovo."
https://openalex.org/W1853063216,"Anaerobic addition of 0.5 eq of NADH/FAD to the streptococcal NADH oxidase produces a redox form spectrally similar to that obtained with 0.5 eq of dithionite/FAD. The second phase of the titration, however, in addition to reducing the flavin with 1 eq of NADH/FAD, leads to the appearance of a long-wavelength absorbance band centered at 725 nm. Reductive titrations of the enzyme with 3-acetylpyridine-adenine dinucleotide, which has a redox potential 72 mV more positive than that of NADH, yield a similar reduced enzyme species. Dithionite reduction of the NADH oxidase followed by titration with NAD+ partially mimics the long-wavelength absorbance of the NADH-reduced enzyme but also leads to the oxidation of 1 FADH2/dimer. NADH is not formed, however, and a similar result is obtained when the dithionite-reduced oxidase is titrated with the nonreducible substrate analog 3-aminopyridine-adenine dinucleotide. These data indicate that the FADH2 oxidation observed is intramolecular and suggest that the active centers of the two apparently identical subunits/dimer are not equivalent. These results also demonstrate that bound pyridine nucleotides can modulate the redox manifold of the NADH oxidase and, when taken together with the effects of these ligands on pre-steady-state behavior, suggest an important regulatory aspect of the catalytic redox function of this unique flavoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1571152933,"The stereochemical course of the oxidation of stereospecifically deuterated dopamine and tyramine, catalyzed by porcine plasma amine oxidase, has been investigated using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The oxidation proceeds with loss of the pro-R hydrogen at C-1. This stereochemistry is in contrast to that observed with the analogous copper containing oxidases isolated from pea seedlings (pro-S) and bovine plasma (nonstereospecific). There is no precedent for these three distinct stereochemical reaction courses to be followed by enzymes in the same class. Mechanistic differences among the three enzymes are evident from the profiles of solvent exchange into reaction products; however, these differences cannot account for the overall differential stereochemical courses observed."

https://openalex.org/W1558219118,"Abstract Hormones have been demonstrated to activate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in plasma membranes in a manner dependent upon or potentiated by GTP. For thyrotropin-releasing hormone activation in GH3 cell membranes, stimulation persisted in membranes from pertussis toxin-treated cells. These observations indicate the presence of a membrane phospholipase C (PL C) and a novel GTP-binding protein (Gp); however, neither of these proteins has been characterized. In this paper, we report studies of GH3 membrane PL C utilizing [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate liposome substrate. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S]), but not other nucleotides, was found to stimulate PL C activity and required greater than 1 nM Ca2+. High concentrations of Ca2+ (10 microM) also activated the membrane PL C. Treatment of membranes with N-ethylmaleimide inhibited Ca2+-activated but not GTP[S]-activated PL C. Extraction of membranes with 1 M KCl solubilized the membrane PL C; however, the solubilized PL C was not GTP[S]-stimulated. N-ethylmaleimide-treated, KCl-extracted membranes were markedly deficient in GTP[S]-stimulated PL C activity; however, activity could be restored by incubation with the desalted extracted PL C. Reconstitution appeared to involve the recoupling of membrane-associated Gp with soluble 330- and 110-kDa forms of the PL C. Cytosolic PL Cs failed to substitute for the solubilized membrane PL C. These results indicate that the Gp-regulated PL C in GH3 cell membranes is an extrinsic membrane protein that can be extracted reversibly at high ionic strength. Moreover, the membrane PL C can be distinguished from cytosolic PL C isoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1547130507,"We have examined the relationship of N-linked oligosaccharide structures to the proper targeting and proteolytic processing of two lysosomal enzymes, α-mannosidase and β-glucosidase, in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Two different mutant strains, HL241 and HL243, each synthesize the same nonglucosylated, truncated, lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, Man6GlcNAc2. [3H]Mannose-labeled N-linked oligosaccharides were studied following their release from immunoprecipitated α-mannosidase and β-glucosidase by digestion with peptide: N-glycosidase F. The oligosaccharides from both mutants resembled each other, but they were smaller and contained fewer anionic groups than those from the wild-type. The oligosaccharides from the mutants strains were reduced in sulfate and Man-6-P content, and all Man-6-P was in the form of acid-stable phosphodiesters. Pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments using [35S] methionine indicated that the precursor forms of both enzymes were smaller than wild-type, and that this difference was due solely to differences in N-linked oligosaccharides. The precursor forms of the enzymes were not over-secreted, but appeared to be proteolytically processed into mature forms at approximately 50% the rate of wild-type. This is mainly due to their prolonged retention in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, but, ultimately, both enzymes were properly targeted to lysosomes. These studies indicate that a reduction in the amount of sulfation, phosphorylation or size of the N-linked oligosaccharides in these mutants is not critical for the proteolytic processing and targeting of the lysosomal enzymes, but that these changes may influence their rate of exit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1565920222,"Our previous report (Marsolais, C., Huot, S., David, F., Garneau, M., and Brunengraber, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2604-2607) had concluded that a fraction of [14C]formate oxidation in liver occurs in the mitochondrion. This conclusion was based on the labeling patterns of urea and acetoacetate labeled via 14CO2 generated from [14C]formate and other [14C]substrates. We reassessed our interpretation in experiments conducted in (i) perifused mitochondria and (ii) isolated livers perfused with buffer containing [14C]formate, [14C]gluconolactone, 14CO2, or NaH13CO3, in the absence and presence of acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. Our data show that the cytosolic pools of bicarbonate and CO2 are not in isotopic equilibrium when 14CO2 is generated in the cytosol or is supplied as NaH14CO3. We retract our earlier suggestion of a mitochondrial site of [14C]formate oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1593999275,"NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 has been crystallized from ammonium sulfate solutions using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Depending on pH, the crystals grew in the orthorhombic space group I222 or one of its subgroups P222 or P2(1)2(1)2 (or one of its two permutations). In both cases the unit cell axes are a = 76.6 A, b = 132.9 A, and c = 145.7 A. There are two monomers/asymmetric unit in the body-centered crystal form and four in the primitive one. The enzyme is catalytically active in the crystalline state. The crystals diffract to at least 2.5 A resolution; they are stable in the x-ray beam and hence suitable for detailed three-dimensional structure determination."

https://openalex.org/W1481593485,"The Pi-ATP exchange and ATP hydrolytic reactions, by the F0F1 complex, were studied in Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores in the dark. An optimal pH between 7.0 and 8.5 was determined for the hydrolytic and exchange reactions. Under these conditions, the hydrolysis/exchange ratio was approximately 2. The kinetic analysis of the hydrolytic and exchange reactions using Mg-ATP as substrate showed a change in the hydrolysis/exchange ratio that varied between 2.0 and 2.8 as the substrate concentration was increased. With Ca-ATP, hydrolysis was not saturated up to a substrate concentration of 5.0 mM, and the hydrolysis/exchange ratios changed from 2 to 240 as the substrate concentration was increased from 0.06 to 5.0 mM. Free Mg2+ inhibited hydrolysis and phosphate uptake without altering the hydrolysis/exchange ratio. Nigericin induced an increase in the hydrolysis/exchange ratio from 2.7 to 130, whereas in the presence of valinomycin, this ratio increased from 2.7 to 21. From these results, it can be concluded that Ca-ATP hydrolysis is loosely coupled to phosphate uptake given that Pi-ATP exchange activity is extremely low, even at high rates of ATP hydrolysis."
