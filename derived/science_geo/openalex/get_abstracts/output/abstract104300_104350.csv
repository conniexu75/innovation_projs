https://openalex.org/W1757241200,"The physiological alpha-oxoaldehyde methylglyoxal binds and modifies arginine, lysine, and cysteine residues in proteins. The kinetics and mechanism of these reactions were investigated with N alpha-acetylamino acids and bovine serum albumin at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. The reaction of methylglyoxal with N alpha-acetylarginine involved the initial reversible formation of glycosylamine and 4,5-dihydroxy-5-methylimidazolidine derivatives, with further slow irreversible conversion to an imidazolone, N alpha-acetyl-N delta- (5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine. The imidazolone was fluorescent with an excitation lambda max value of 320 nm and an emission lambda max value of 398 nm. Methylglyoxal reacted reversibly with N alpha-acetyllysine to form glycosylamine and bisglycosylamine derivatives. Further reaction of these glycosylamines occurred to form brown, fluorescent oligomers that were not characterized. Methylglyoxal reacted rapidly and reversibly with N alpha-acetylcysteine to form the hemithioacetal adduct. The reaction of methylglyoxal with bovine serum albumin (BSA) at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C involved the reversible and irreversible formation of methylglyoxal-BSA adducts. Irreversible modification of BSA occurred mainly on arginine residues to form imidazolone. The formation of methylglyoxal-modified proteins involves glycoxidation leading to advanced glycation end product-like fluorescence. It is expected to be increased in diabetes mellitus and may be linked to the development of diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W1643628872,"The effect of phosphoinositides on the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes was investigated. PKC alpha, beta I, beta II, gamma, delta, epsilon, eta, and zeta were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified by column chromatography. The calcium-activated PKC isotypes alpha, beta I, beta II, and gamma were not significantly activated by any of the phosphoinositides investigated (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P), PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-4,5-P2, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) when added in the presence of concentrations of phosphatidylserine that give maximal stimulation. The calcium-insensitive PKC isotypes delta, epsilon, and theta also showed little response to PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-4-P, or PtdIns-4,5-P2 when these lipids were added in the presence of phosphatidylserine. In contrast, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 caused a 5-15-fold stimulation of these enzymes compared with phosphatidylserine alone. 50% maximal stimulation of PKC epsilon by PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 occurred when this lipid was present at about 1% of the carrier PtdIns-4,5-P2 (about 100 nM). These lipids had little effect on baculovirus-expressed PKC zeta, which was constitutively active. A short chain version of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, dioctanoyl-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, activated PKC delta, epsilon, and eta in the absence of other lipids, whereas a short chain version of PtdIns-4,5-P2, dihexanoyl-PtdIns-4,5-P2, did not. Since PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 are nominally absent in unstimulated cells and appear within seconds to minutes of stimulation by various cell activators, these lipids could act as second messengers to activate PKC delta, epsilon, or eta in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1495035446,"To address large discrepancies reported in the literature, the viscoelastic properties of gels formed by purified actin filaments have been measured by five different techniques and five different instruments using actin preparations purified separately in four different laboratories. These measurements consistently showed that the elastic shear modulus of 2 mg/ml F-actin is on the order of several hundred pascals, and depends very strongly on the length of the filaments and on the history of the sample prior to measurement. Shortening of actin filaments with gelsolin and mechanical perturbations reduce the shear modulus to low values identical to some reported in the literature, indicating that such perturbations account for low shear moduli and poor responsiveness to filament modifying treatments reported previously. The structures of individual actin filaments within gels very similar or identical to those studied rheometrically were also examined by dynamic light scattering and fluorescence microscopy. Dynamic light scattering data were analyzed by a new method to confirm that actin filaments have no stable associations with each other and fluctuate in solution at a rate governed by the filament bending modulus or persistence length, determined to be approximately 10 microns. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that applying even small shear stresses to F-actin can orient and rupture the filaments, and that in a minimally perturbed viscoelastic gel, long actin filaments are free to diffuse within a limit of constraints formed by their neighbors. These findings confirm that relatively isotropic F-actin networks are sufficiently strong to stabilize cells."
https://openalex.org/W1496561250,"Previous studies from this laboratory and others suggest that arachidonic acid and its metabolites play important roles in a variety of biological processes such as signal transduction, contraction, chemotaxis, and cell growth and differentiation. Here we studied the effect of arachidonic acid on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Arachidonic acid activated MAP kinases in VSMC in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a potent inhibitor of the lipoxygenase system, significantly blocked the arachidonic acid-induced activation of MAP kinases, whereas indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, had no effect. In VSMC, arachidonic acid was converted to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE); NDGA inhibited the formation of this HETE. Exogenous addition of 15-HETE to VSMC caused stimulation of MAP kinases. Depletion of protein kinase C attenuated both the arachidonic acid- and 15-HETE-induced activation of MAP kinases in VSMC. Together these results suggest that 1) arachidonic acid activates MAP kinases in VSMC; 2) 15-HETE, a 15-lipoxygenase product of arachidonic acid, at least in part, mediates the arachidonic acid effect on MAP kinases; and 3) protein kinase C appears to be important in arachidonic acid activation of MAP kinases. Therefore, MAP kinases may play an important role in arachidonic acid signaling of VSMC growth and function."
https://openalex.org/W1624294703,"In an effort to clarify the regulation of distribution and actions of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in bone, TGF-beta 1 binding to extracted bone matrix proteins and the influence of such binding on TGF-beta 1 actions were examined. In-gel binding of 125I-TGF-beta 1 using extracts from mineralized bovine bone matrix demonstrated that 125I-TGF-beta 1 was almost exclusively bound to a proteoglycan, decorin. The binding was via the core protein of decorin. Scatchard analysis of the binding of 125I-TGF-beta 1 to immobilized decorin purified from osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell conditioned medium revealed that there were two specific binding sites with high and low affinities for TGF-beta 1 (Kd = 0.3 and 5 nM, respectively). The addition of decorin along with TGF-beta 1 enhanced the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. Decorin in itself did not affect their proliferation. These cells possessed types I and II TGF-beta receptors and betaglycan, and the addition of decorin increased the binding of 125I-TGF-beta 1 to all these receptors. These results demonstrate that the core protein of decorin specifically binds TGF-beta 1 with high affinities and that the binding of TGF-beta 1 to decorin increases TGF-beta 1 binding to its receptors and enhances its bioactivity. Because TGF-beta is released by bone resorption along with matrix proteins, including decorin, and because it stimulates the synthesis of these proteins, it is suggested that the binding and enhancement of the activities of TGF-beta by decorin may play a role in maintaining bone formation during bone remodeling process."
https://openalex.org/W1519557516,"We isolated and characterized the human oxytocin receptor gene. Southern blots indicated that the human genome has a single copy of the gene. Chromosomal localization by fluorescence in situ hybridization also showed that the gene was a single copy, assigned to 3p26.2 of the human chromosome. The gene spans approximately 17 kilobases and contains 3 introns and 4 exons. Exons 1 and 2 correspond to the 5'-non-coding region, followed by exons 3 and 4 encoding the amino acids of the receptor. Intron 3, which is the largest at 12 kilobases, separates the coding region immediately after the putative sixth transmembrane-spanning domain. The transcription start sites, demonstrated by primer extension analysis, lie 618 and 621 base pairs upstream of the methionine initiation codon. Near these putative transcription start sites, we found a TATA-like motif and a potential SP-1 binding site at about 30 and 65 base pairs, respectively. We also found other known binding sites of transcription regulating factors, such as AP-1, AP-2, GATA-1, Myb, nucleofactor-interleukin 6 binding consensus sequence, and an acute phase reactant-responsive element. No estrogen-responsive element was observed except three half-palindromic estrogen-responsive element motifs. Our findings of the oxytocin receptor gene structure should help to elucidate the mechanism by which the gene expression is induced drastically at parturition in the uterus and how the gene is regulated in other organs such as the mammary gland or central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1521778811,"Elevations in gene dosage of the transcriptional regulatory protein yAP-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can elicit pronounced phenotypic increases in tolerance of a variety of drugs including the toxic heavy metal cadmium. While a large elevation in cadmium tolerance occurs in response to overproduction of yAP-1, the target genes under yAP-1 control have not yet been identified that are responsible for this increase. We show here that the YCF1 gene, encoding a likely integral membrane protein, is required for yAP-1 to exert its normal effects on cadmium tolerance. Mutant strains of yeast that lack the YCF1 gene are hypersensitive to cadmium and this hypersensitivity is epistatic to yAP-1 overexpression. YCF1 mRNA levels and the expression of a YCF1-lacZ reporter construct positively correlates with changes in YAP1 gene dosage. A set of 5' truncation derivatives of the YCF1-lacZ fusion gene identified the region from -201 to +47 as being sufficient for the yAP-1-dependent increase in expression. DNase I footprinting using a probe from this segment of the YCF1 promoter showed that bacterially-produced yAP-1 protein was capable of binding a novel DNA element we have designated the yAP-1 response element. Insertion of the yAP-1 response element upstream of a CYC1-lacZ gene fusion led to the production of beta-galactosidase in a yAP-1-dependent fashion. These data establish that an important physiological target of yAP-1 transcriptional regulation is the YCF1 structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W30659429,"Construction of chimaeric DNA molecules in vitro relies traditionally on two enzymatic steps catalyzed by separate protein components. Site-specific restriction endonucleases are used to generate linear DNAs with defined termini that can then be joined covalently at their ends via the action of DNA ligase. A novel approach to the synthesis of recombinant DNAs exploits the ability of a single enzyme, vaccinia DNA topoisomerase, to both cleave and rejoin DNA strands with extreme specificity at each step. Placement of the CCCTT cleavage motif for vaccinia topoisomerase near the end of a duplex DNA permits efficient generation of a stable, highly recombinogenic protein-DNA adduct that can religate only to acceptor DNAs that contain complementary single-strand extensions. Linear DNAs containing CCCTT cleavage sites at both ends (bivalent substrates) can be activated by topoisomerase and inserted into a plasmid vector in a simple and rapid in vitro procedure that is especially well suited to the molecular cloning of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNAs. Activation of polyvalent (e.g. branched) DNA substrates by topoisomerase offers a potentially powerful method for the synthesis of two- and three-dimensional polynucleotide networks."
https://openalex.org/W2155437551,"Latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-binding protein (LTBP) is a component of the latent TGF-beta complex in human platelets. LTBP is composed of two different cysteine-rich repeat sequences, i.e. epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and a repeat containing 8 cysteine residues. The overall structure of LTBP is similar to those of the microfibrillar proteins fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2. Here we report the identification of a novel protein termed LTBP-2, which is structurally related to LTBP. cDNA for LTBP-2 was obtained from human foreskin fibroblast cDNA libraries using a fragment of the LTBP cDNA as a probe. LTBP-2 is composed of 20 EGF-like repeats and four copies of the 8-cysteine repeat. The amino acid sequence of LTBP-2 is 41% identical to that of LTBP and 25% identical to that of fibrillin-1. LTBP-2 is synthesized as a 240-kDa protein by human foreskin fibroblasts and also by COS cells transfected with the isolated LTBP-2 cDNA. Similar to LTBP, a considerable part of LTBP-2 was found to be associated with extracellular matrix. Co-transfection of cDNAs for LTBP-2 and TGF-beta 1 revealed that LTBP-2 forms a high molecular weight complex with the TGF-beta 1 precursor. The LTBP-2 gene was assigned to chromosome 14q24. These results indicate that different forms of latent TGF-beta complexes occur and suggest that the different associated proteins may function to target the complexes to specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W1581520158,"Bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) is a metalloprotease purified from extracts capable of inducing ectopic bone formation. In humans, it has a domain structure similar to that of the Drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning gene-product tolloid (Tld), but is considerably shorter. Here we show that, in humans and mice, alternatively spliced transcripts encode BMP-1 and a longer protein, designated mammalian tolloid (mTld), with a domain structure identical to that of Drosophila Tld. A third alternatively spliced product, in which a novel domain is inserted near the BMP-1 C terminus, is also reported. Low levels of transcripts for mTld were found in all adult human tissues surveyed, while BMP-1 transcripts were detectable in all adult tissues except brain. This differential expression was mirrored in embryonic mouse tissues where in situ hybridization found high levels of mTld transcripts, but was unable to detect BMP-1 transcripts, in the floor plate of the neural tube of the developing central nervous system. The third alternatively spliced form was not detected in adult human tissues. In situ hybridizations found punctate signals for all three forms localized to trophoblast giant cells in 17.5-day mouse placenta, with highest levels of expression, especially for BMP-1, near the maternal interface."
https://openalex.org/W1504756577,"Sequestration of m2 receptors (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m2 subtypes), which was assessed as loss of N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) binding activity from the cell surface, was examined in COS 7 and BHK-21 cells that had been transfected with expression vectors encoding the m2 receptor and, independently, vectors encoding a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2) (beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1) or a GRK2 dominant-negative mutant (DN-GRK2). The sequestration of m2 receptors became apparent when the cells were treated with 10(-5) M or higher concentrations of carbamylcholine. In this case, approximately 40% or 20-25% of the [3H]NMS binding sites on COS 7 or BHK-21 cells, respectively, were sequestered with a half-life of 15-25 min. In cells in which GRK2 was also expressed, the sequestration became apparent in the presence of 10(-7) M carbamylcholine. Approximately 40% of the [3H]NMS binding sites on both COS 7 and BHK-21 cells were sequestered in the presence of 10(-6) M or higher concentrations of carbamylcholine. When DN-GRK2 was expressed in COS 7 cells, the proportion of [3H]NMS binding sites sequestered in the presence of 10(-5) M or higher concentrations of carbamylcholine was reduced to 20-30%. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of m2 receptors by GRK2 facilitates their sequestration. These results are in contrast with the absence of a correlation between sequestration and the phosphorylation of beta-adrenergic receptors by the GRK2 and suggests that the consequences of phosphorylation by GRK2 are different for different receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1535548497,"Stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins, including the vav proto-oncogene product. We now report the detection of several phosphotyrosine proteins (80, 74, and 70 kDa) from TCR-stimulated T cells that bind to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of proto-Vav (Vav-SH2) and co-immunoprecipitate with the proto-Vav product. Their binding to Vav-SH2 differs from that observed with SH2 domains from other proteins. None of the Vav-SH2-associated phosphoproteins bind to either of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of proto-Vav or to mutant Vav-SH2 proteins. The association of the phosphoproteins with Vav-SH2 requires induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins since proteins from lysates of herbimycin A-treated TCR-activated T cells fail to associate with Vav-SH2. Among the proteins from T cells that co-immunoprecipitate with the proto-Vav product and bind to its SH2 domain, specific antibodies identified the 70-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein as ZAP-70, a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) involved in TCR signal transduction. Binding of this PTK to Vav-SH2 is inhibited by a ZAP-70-specific synthetic tyrosine phosphopeptide. We suggest that ZAP-70 may function as a PTK for proto-Vav."
https://openalex.org/W1512736386,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment causes autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) leading to increased guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF; Sos) activity and enhanced formation of p21ras-GTP. The connection of the EGFR to p21ras activation can occur through binding of Grb2.Sos complexes to the EGFR or through the adaptor protein Shc via EGFR.Shc.Grb2.Sos multimeric complexes. Therefore, we investigated the importance of Shc in coupling the EGFR to activation of ras GEF (Sos). EGF treatment led to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Although phosphorylated EGFR can bind to both Shc and Grb2, the predominant linkage was observed between EGFR and Shc. Similarly, more Grb2 was associated with Shc than with EGFR after EGF stimulation. Immunoprecipitation of Shc from EGF-stimulated cells removed almost all EGFR-associated Grb2. Furthermore, immunodepletion of Shc proteins from membrane fractions of EGF-stimulated cells removed 93% of the ras GEF activity, whereas, precipitation of EGFR had only a small effect on ras GEF activity. These data indicate that coupling to Shc provides the major pathway linking activated EGFRs to Grb2.Sos and stimulation of the p21ras pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1575363584,"GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA damage) is a DNA-damage-inducible gene regulated in part by the tumor suppressor p53. A role in negative growth control has recently been suggested based on significant (more than 75%) reduction of colony formation following over expression of Gadd45. To better understand the role of Gadd45, we have developed specific rabbit and murine antibodies raised against the human recombinant protein. Using these antibodies, we have found that in ML-1 cells Gadd45 is predominantly a nuclear protein. MyD118, a protein induced by terminal differentiation sharing 57% homology with Gadd45, does not cross-react with any of the antibodies produced. As expected, the induction of Gadd45 protein by ionizing radiation (IR) was also found to be dependent on a wild type p53 phenotype. Interestingly, WI-L2-NS, a human lymphoid cell line, showed very high basal levels of Gadd45 mRNA and protein in addition to a high constitutive level of a mutated p53 protein. In this cell line, the high levels of GADD45 did not inhibit cellular growth in spite of the fact that no mutations were found in GADD45 sequence. These results indicate that some cell line(s) can tolerate high levels of Gadd45 and abrogate its growth suppression function."
https://openalex.org/W1545532543,"The renin-angiotensin system is a major determinant of arterial pressure and volume homeostasis in mammals through the actions of angiotensin II, the proteolytic digestion product of angiotensinogen. Molecular genetic studies in several human populations have revealed genetic linkage between the angiotensinogen gene and both hypertension and increased plasma angiotensinogen. Transgenic mice were generated with a human angiotensinogen genomic clone to develop an animal model to examine tissue- and cell-specific expression of the gene and to determine if overexpression of angiotensinogen results in hypertension. Human angiotensinogen mRNA was expressed in transgenic mouse liver, kidney, heart, adrenal gland, ovary, brain, and white and brown adipose tissue and, in kidney, was exclusively localized to epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules. Plasma levels of human angiotensinogen were approximately 150-fold higher in transgenic mice than that found normally in human plasma. The blood pressure of mice bearing the human angiotensinogen gene was normal but infusion of a single bolus dose of purified human renin resulted in a transient increase in blood pressure of approximately 30 mm Hg within 2 min. These results suggest that abnormalities in the angiotensinogen gene resulting in increased circulating levels of angiotensinogen could potentially contribute in part to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W85127246,"The Fc receptor for IgG in platelets was identified as the integral membrane isoform encoded by the Fc gamma RIIA gene. Functional analysis of this molecule determined that activated Fc gamma RIIA is tyrosine phosphorylated and that activation induced the physical association with the protein tyrosine kinase p72syk. Other tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules also co-immunoadsorbed with the activated receptor. Tyrosine kinase activity co-immunoadsorbing with the platelet Fc gamma R was enhanced upon activation and specifically induced the phosphorylation, on tyrosine residues, of a physically associated 72-kDa protein. These data support a model of Fc gamma receptor-mediated platelet activation where signal is transduced through inducible association of the tyrosine kinase p72syk with the low affinity Fc gamma receptor. Thrombin, a potent platelet agonist, has been shown to up-regulate the activity of the tyrosine kinase p72syk in platelets. Consequently, our findings identify a second pathway by which p72syk is activated in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2110634095,"Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF-3) plays a pivotal role in the initiation phase of protein synthesis where it promotes dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into subunits, stabilizes methionyl-tRNAi binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits, and is required for mRNA binding. Mammalian eIF-3 is comprised of eight subunits, but no mammalian cDNA encoding these proteins has been cloned and sequenced, nor has the corresponding factor been characterized in yeast. Since many initiation factors are strongly conserved between mammalian and yeast systems, we employed a mammalian assay for initiation, the synthesis of methionyl-puromycin, to detect eIF-3 activity in yeast subcellular fractions. Yeast eIF-3 was purified from the high salt wash of ribosomes by Superose 6 molecular sieve and MonoS ion exchange chromatography. Yeast eIF-3 contains eight subunits with masses of 16, 21, 29, 33, 39, 62, 90, and 135 kilodaltons all of which coelute with an apparent mass of 550 kilodaltons from the Superose 6 column. Immunoblotting shows that the 90-kDa subunit corresponds to the product of the PRT1 gene whose mutant form, prt1-1, exhibits destabilization of methionyl-tRNAi binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits. eIF-3, and specifically the 62-kDa subunit, bind to RNA. These biochemical approaches to defining yeast eIF-3 complement genetic methods so far used in characterizing the initiation factors and provide another route to defining the yeast translational machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1603429689,"We have investigated the effect of mutations in tyrosines 1131, 1135, and 1136 of the human insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) on the growth and transformation of mammalian cells. We have used for this purpose R- cells, which are 3T3-like fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR genes. These cells have no IGF-IR, do not grow in serum-free medium supplemented with the growth factors that sustain the growth of 3T3 cells, and cannot be transformed by simian virus 40 large tumor antigen or other oncogenes. The R- cells were transfected with plasmids expressing: 1) a wild type human IGF-IR cDNA; 2) a receptor with a triple mutation in the above mentioned tyrosines; and 3) receptors with single tyrosine mutations. Cells expressing the wild type or the single tyrosine mutants Y1 (Y1131F) and Y2 (Y1135F) grew in serum-free medium supplemented solely with IGF-I. Cells expressing the triple tyrosine mutant YF or the single mutant Y3 (Y1136F) failed to grow in response to IGF-I only. All mutants, though, failed to form colonies in soft agar, indicating that a fully functional IGF-IR is more critical for anchorage-independent growth than for monolayer growth. The triple mutant expression plasmid also functioned as a dominant negative, inhibiting the growth of wild type cells transformed by the simian virus tumor antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1485058873,"Induced shedding of the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (p55-R) was previously shown to be independent of the amino acid sequence properties of the intracellular domain of this receptor. We now find it also independent of the sequence properties of the transmembrane domain and of the cysteine-rich region that constitutes most of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The shedding is shown to depend solely on the sequence properties of a small region within the spacer that links the cysteine-rich region in the extracellular domain to the transmembrane domain. Detailed tests of effects of mutations in the spacer on the shedding indicate that the process is independent of the amino acid side-chain identity in this region except for a limited dependence on the identity of 1 residue (Val-173), located downstream to the putative major cleavage site of the receptor. It is strongly affected, however, by some mutations that seem to change the conformation of the spacer region. These findings suggest that a short amino acid sequence in the p55-R is essential and sufficient for its shedding and that the shedding is mediated either by a protease with limited sequence specificity or by several different proteases that recognize different amino acid sequences, yet it strictly depends on some conformational features of the cleavage region in the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1498616149,"Methylglyoxal binds and irreversibly modifies arginine and lysine residues in bovine serum albumin (BSA) under physiological conditions, producing a protein with an increased net negative charge at physiological pH. At 4 degrees C, methylglyoxal-modified BSA (MG-BSA) was bound by cell surface receptors on murine P388D1 macrophages. The apparent dissociation constant KD value was 435 +/- 2 nM, and there were 8.89 +/- 0.02 x 10(5) receptors/cell (n = 6), compare with an apparent KD value of 263 +/- 52 nM and 10.17 +/- 0.93 x 10(5) receptors/cell (n = 11) for advanced glycation end product-modified BSA (AGE-BSA). AGE-BSA competed with MG-BSA for binding to a common receptor; however, a component of AGE-BSA receptor binding could not be displaced by MG-BSA, and a component of MG-BSA receptor binding could not be displaced by AGE-BSA, suggesting that there are binding sites for both AGE-BSA and MG-BSA, competitive and noncompetitive, to MG-BSA and AGE-BSA on P388D1 cells at 4 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, receptor binding of AGE-BSA and MG-BSA was followed by endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the modified protein. Methylglyoxal-modified proteins are ligands for the AGE receptor, and their formation and metabolism may be linked to the development of diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W1652868617,"Dynamin 1 (D100) is a microtubule-activated GTPase that is believed to play a role in the early steps of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Previous studies on the characterization of the Drosophila dynamin gene homolog, known as shibire, suggest that this protein may also participate in the formation of neuronal processes. To understand the role of rat brain dynamin 1 in neuronal morphogenesis, we correlated the intracellular levels of dynamin with the formation of neurites in rat hippocampal neurons and neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells in vitro. Quantitative Western and Northern blot analyses show that dynamin levels increase during neurite formation in both the hippocampal neurons and N1E-115 cells and decrease in N1E-115 cells during serum-induced neurite retraction. Furthermore, using antisense technology, we investigated the effect of decreased intracellular levels of dynamin on neurite formation in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides against sequences surrounding the initiation codon of the rat brain dynamin gene (D100) reduce the intracellular levels of dynamin by approximately 90% and impair the formation of the minor and axon-like processes in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that dynamin-mediated processes are necessary for normal neuronal morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W187743566,"We compared effects of feeding arginine- and/or proline- deficient diets (-Arg, -Pro, and -Arg, Pro) with those of a complete diet (Complete) in rats whose small intestine had been massively resected. After 4 weeks, the rats fed -Arg and -Arg, Pro lost weight (a mean of 28 and 32 g, respectively), whereas those fed Complete and -Pro gained 80 and 58 g, respectively. The average nitrogen balance was about 117,100, -20 and -14 mg/day for Complete, -Pro, -Arg, and -Arg, Pro diets, respectively. The concentration of arginine in skeletal muscle was about 310, 330, 91, and 65 nmol/g for Complete, -Pro, -Arg, and -Arg, Pro, respectively; while plasma arginine concentration averaged 95, 107, 56, and 46 microM, respectively. The weight loss, the negative nitrogen balance, and the markedly reduced arginine concentration in the muscle observed in rats fed -Arg and -Arg, Pro clearly indicate that arginine becomes a strictly essential amino acid in the rats with massive resection of the small intestine. However, sufficient proline can be synthesized from arginine in tissues such as the liver and kidney in the absence of the small intestine. Plasma glutamine, citrulline in the muscle and plasma, urinary excretion of orotic acid and nitrate (to assess nitric oxide formation from arginine) were also measured, and the changes in these metabolites are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1556569720,"The sperm acrosome is a regulated secretory granule that undergoes exocytosis during fertilization. To elucidate the structural organization of the contents within the acrosome, guinea pig sperm acrosomal apical segments were isolated and mapped by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Although complex, the two-dimensional PAGE map was dominated by two M(r) 50,000 polypeptides (p50 and proacrosin), a M(r) 67,000 polypeptide (p67), and a M(r) 32,000 polypeptide (sp32). Proacrosin (pI > 8.0), p67, and sp32 were extracted from apical segments by 1 M NaCl. Protein p50, a relatively acidic polypeptide, was not extracted in 1 M NaCl and/or 1% Triton X-100 at 4 degrees C, but was solubilized with 6 M urea. Protein p50 was purified from the urea extract by elution from DEAE-Sephacel with 100 mM guanidine HCl and appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. Antibodies to p50 were monospecific as judged by Western blot analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence indicated that p50 was restricted to the acrosomal apical segment. Incubation of apical segments at pH 7.5 in the presence of 1 mM EDTA at 37 degrees C resulted in the release of p50 into the 200,000 x g supernatant fluid, a process that was reversed by a subsequent incubation with 1.5 mM CaCl2, but not with MgCl2. The Ca(2+)-dependent reassociation of p50 with the acrosomal apical segments was reversed by the addition of 2.0 mM EGTA, indicating that p50 binding is dependent on free Ca2+ concentrations. When acrosomal matrices were purified following Triton X-100 extraction, p50 was the major component, with p67, proacrosin, and sp32 as less prominent constituents. Molecular cloning demonstrated that p50 is a unique, testis-specific member of the pentaxin family of calcium-dependent binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1839759909,"We have evaluated the basis for the constitutive and serum-regulated expression of the mouse thrombospondin (TSP) gene in both transiently and stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells. Experiments with deleted and mutated mouse promoter/CAT constructs and gel mobility assays demonstrated that an Egr-1 binding site in the proximal promoter, flanked by overlapping GC boxes and an adjacent GC-rich region, functioned to positively regulate the constitutive activity of the gene. These motifs, and their cognate transcription factors, appear to act in concert, with partial redundancy, so that discrete mutations were only partially effective in reducing transcriptional activity. The Egr-1 site corresponds in position to an NF-Y binding site which functions synergistically with a distal serum-response element to mediate the serum response of the human TSP1 gene. However, neither the Egr-1 motif nor the surrounding proximal promoter region upstream from the TATA box participates in the serum response of mouse TSP1. These experiments add support to the growing realization that similar physiologic responses of homologous genes in mouse and man need not utilize similarly placed cis-acting elements."
https://openalex.org/W1514303750,"We report the initial biochemical characterization and the primary structure of a guinea pig sperm acrosomal pentaxin (apexin). Pentaxins are a family of penta- or decameric serum proteins that includes serum amyloid protein and C-reactive protein. Apexin consists of disulfide-linked 50-kDa subunits that give rise to an oligomeric protein. Apexin and a sperm protein related to complement receptors coelute with affinity-purified fertilin (PH-30), a potential sperm-egg membrane fusion protein. However, no evidence for a functional association of apexin with fertilin was found. Apexin is localized to the acrosome of mature guinea pig sperm and is thus the first pentaxin for which a defined intracellular localization has been reported. Whereas the C-terminal portion of apexin is clearly related to serum pentaxins, the N-terminal domain shows no strong homology to other known proteins. Northern blot analysis of different tissues revealed expression in the testis. Apexin is distinct from the pentaxins serum amyloid protein and C-reactive protein and may have evolved to perform functions other than those performed by serum pentaxins, such as intracellular protein sorting to the acrosome."
https://openalex.org/W1495191327,"The cDNA for an antibody light chain raised by immunization against vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was cloned in a bacterial expression vector, and the recombinant light chain was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The light chain catalyzed the hydrolysis of VIP efficiently owing to its comparatively high affinity for the substrate. In control experiments, the catalytic activity was preserved at a constant level after further chromatography of the light chain on anion-exchange and gel-filtration fast protein liquid chromatography columns, and it was removed by immunoadsorption with immobilized anti-mouse light chain antibody. The amide bond linking methylcoumarinamide (MCA) and arginine in a tripeptide unrelated in sequence to VIP was cleaved by the light chain with lower affinity and kinetic efficiency (kcat/Km). Hydrolysis of the peptidyl-MCA conjugate was inhibited competitively by the alternate substrate, VIP. The Ki and Km values for VIP were in the same range, indicating that peptide-MCA and VIP hydrolysis occurs at a common catalytic site in the light chain. Molecular modeling suggested the presence of a serine protease-like site in the light chain. This was supported by inhibition of the hydrolytic activity by serine protease inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of other classes of proteases. These observations suggest a poorly discriminatory catalytic site, with specificity for VIP arising chiefly by means of the antigen recognition function of the light chain combining site."
https://openalex.org/W1639382403,"Topoisomerase III, but not topoisomerase I, could, in the absence of DNA gyrase, support bidirectional DNA replication in an oriC plasmid DNA replication system reconstituted with purified proteins. The initial rate of DNA synthesis and the efficiency of nascent chain elongation showed that topoisomerase III-stimulated DNA replication was as efficient as gyrase-stimulated DNA replication. In addition, topoisomerase III was also able, in the absence of DNA gyrase, to decatenate the replicating daughter DNA molecules to form monomer product. Thus, of the four topoisomerases in Escherichia coli, three, topoisomerases III and IV and DNA gyrase, can support nascent chain elongation, whereas only two, topoisomerases III and IV, can topologically resolve the daughter molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1580463729,"The existence of a second receptor binding site on human prolactin (hPRL) was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. First, 12 residues of helices 1 and 3 were mutated to alanine. Since none of the resulting mutants exhibit reduced bioactivity in the Nb2 cell proliferation bioassay, the mutated residues do not appear to be functionally necessary. Next, small residues surrounding the helix 1-helix 3 interface were replaced with Arg and/or Trp, the aim being to sterically hinder the second binding site. Several of these mutants exhibit only weak agonistic properties, supporting our hypothesis that the channel between helices 1 and 3 is involved in a second receptor binding site. We then analyzed the antagonistic and self-antagonistic properties of native hPRL and of several hPRLs analogs altered at binding site 1 or 2. Even at high concentrations (approximately 10 microM), no self-inhibition was observed with native hPRL; site 2 hPRL mutants self-antagonized while site 1 mutants did not. From these data, we propose a model of hPRL-PRL receptor interaction which slightly differs from that proposed earlier for the homologous human growth hormone (hGH) (Fuh, G., Cunningham, B. C., Fukunaga, R., Nagata, S., and Goeddel, D. V., and Well, J. A. (1992) Science 256, 1677-1680). Like hGH, hPRL would bind sequentially to two receptor molecules, first through site 1, then through site 2, but we would expect the two sites of hPRL to display, unlike the two binding sites of hGH, about the same binding affinity, thus preventing self-antagonism at high concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1577898165,"Ca(2+)-activated Cl- current (ICl,Ca) in colonic T84 cells is inhibited by the specific peptide inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM KII). Annexin IV, a Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding protein also inhibits Ca(2+)-dependent anion current activation (Kaetzel, M.A., Chan, H.-C., Dubinsky, W.P., Dedman, J.R., and Nelson, D.J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 5297-5302). Intracellular injection of antibodies against annexin IV enhances current activation; this activation is inhibited by the peptide inhibitor of CaM KII. Intracellular application of autonomously active CaM KII in the presence of ATP induced a Cl- current similar to that activated by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Current activation by the exogenous kinase was completely inhibited in the presence of purified annexin IV. In vitro, annexin IV does not inhibit CaM KII activity nor does it act as a substrate for CaM KII. Thus, it appears that annexin IV inhibits phosphorylation-dependent anion conductance activation by preventing CaM KII-ion channel interaction rather than by direct interaction with the enzyme itself. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which Ca(2+)-dependent membrane binding proteins, cytoplasmic kinases, and ion channels interact to regulate membrane conductance. The characterization of unique channel regulatory pathways in Cl- transporting epithelia may identify potential avenues of alternate therapy to compensate for the loss of functional Cl- channels in the disease of cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1546595337,"The in vivo isomerization of all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acids (RAs) was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography after oral administration to rats. All-trans (2 ng/ml)- and 13-cis (1.8 ng/ml)-RAs, but not 9-cis-RA, were detected in the serum of normal rats. When an excess of either all-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA (100 micrograms/rat) was intragastrically administered to the retinoid-depleted rats, a rapid isomer exchange between 9-cis- and all-trans-RAs along with appearance of the administered RA occurred shortly after the dose (30 min). RA rapidly isomerized when an excess of either all-trans- or 9-cis-RA (1 mg/rat) was administered to normal rats. To examine whether the isomerized RAs elicit biological actions in vivo, the induction of target genes-[cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBP II) for 9-cis-RA and all-trans-retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR beta) for 9-cis- and all-trans-RAs] was determined. The degree of induction of the two genes did not differ 4 h after administration of either 9-cis-RA or all-trans-RA. However, unlike all-trans-RA, the RAR-specific synthetic retinoids did not induce the CRBP II gene. These results suggested that the apparent actions of 9-cis- and all-trans-RAs on gene expression in vivo may be mediated to some extent by the converted stereoisomer."
https://openalex.org/W1547153839,"Abstract The alpha-like subunits of F1F0 ATP synthases share primary structural homology in two segments near their carboxyl termini. However, the amino acids at the functionally important positions occupied by alpha Gly-218 and alpha His-245 in Escherichia coli vary depending upon organism and organelle. The alpha G218-->D,H245-G and alpha G218-->K,H245-->G double mutations were constructed in the E. coli uncB(alpha) gene to model the chloroplast ATPase IV subunit and alkaliphilic bacterial alpha subunit, respectively. Strains carrying each of the single mutations, alpha G218-->D, alpha G218-->K, and alpha H245-->G, had marked reductions in F1F0 ATP synthase function. The alpha G218-->K mutation was alone sufficient to virtually eliminate enzyme function. Membranes prepared from the alpha G218-->D mutant exhibited increased levels of ATP hydrolysis activity without a corresponding increase in active proton transport, suggesting a mechanistic uncoupling of catalytic activity and proton translocation. However, much of the lost F1F0 ATP synthase activity was restored in the alpha G218-->D,H245-->G and alpha G218-->K,H245-->G double mutant strains demonstrating that these mutations act as mutual intragenic second-site suppressors. The evidence is consistent with a close spatial interaction between alpha Gly-218 and alpha His-245."
https://openalex.org/W1988786754,"Secondary tritium and primary 14C kinetic isotope effects were measured for the hydrolysis of alpha-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride catalyzed by sugar beet seed alpha-D-glucosidase, forming alpha-D-glucose, and by Rhizopus niveus glucoamylase forming beta-D-glucose. The data provided a novel opportunity to model and directly compare the transition state structures for the hydrolysis of a substrate promoted with retention or inversion of configuration according to the enzyme catalyst. The isotope effects for the reaction catalyzed by each enzyme are most consistent with an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism. The modeled transition state structures for the hydrolysis promoted by the alpha-glucosidase and the glucoamylase both bear significant oxocarbonium ion character, with the D-glucosyl residue having a flattened 4C1 conformation and a C-1-O-5 bond order of 1.92, even though opposite D-glucose anomers were produced from the substrate. The transition states show some modest differences, but their general similarity strongly suggests that the stereochemical outcome of glycosylase reactions does not predict the transition state structure, nor does the transition state structure of such reactions predict the stereochemical outcome. The results support previously reported evidence for the separate topological control of product configuration by protein structures in these and other glycosylases."
https://openalex.org/W1614111557,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was purified from Escherichia coli K-12, and its N-terminal sequence was determined to be MKLFYKPGAXSLAS. The gene encoding this sequence was cloned and mapped at 1731-1732 kilobases on the E. coli gene map. It encoded a polypeptide of 201 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 22,860. The overexpressed product of the gene was confirmed to have GST activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and ethacrynic acid and GSH-dependent peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide. The relative molecular mass of the gene product was determined to be 40,000 by gel chromatography and 25,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating a homodimeric structure. The deduced amino acid sequence was 54% identical with that of Proteus mirabilis GST. Although the homologies between the GSTs from E. coli and mammals were low, many of the residues assigned to be important for the enzymatic function or structure in mammalian cytosolic GSTs were found to be conserved in E. coli GST. Therefore, E. coli GST is considered to have diverged from the same ancestor with other cytosolic GSTs. A specific tyrosyl residue in the vicinity of the N terminus is conserved in all of the known cytosolic GSTs and has been shown to function as a catalytic residue in alpha, mu, and pi class GSTs from mammals. Although Tyr5 in E. coli GST appeared to be the counterpart of the catalytic residue, its replacement with phenylalanine did not significantly affect the enzymatic activity. Therefore, this apparently conserved tyrosyl residue is not essential for catalytic activity in E. coli GST."
https://openalex.org/W1541734564,"Integrins promote cell-substratum and cell-cell adhesion by acting as transmembrane linker molecules between extracellular adhesion proteins and the actin-rich cytoskeleton. The integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) is essential for platelet spreading, aggregation, fibrin clot retraction, and for the transduction of extracellular signals. We examined the effect of the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A on integrin and cytoskeletal-mediated events in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Incubation of washed platelets for 24 h with herbimycin A (5 microM) abolished the thrombin-stimulated cytoskeletal enzyme activity of pp60c-src in parallel with a reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins, as assessed with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots. However, thrombin-induced activation of protein kinase C and the production of thromboxane A2 were not altered by herbimycin A. Despite the absence of cytoskeletal pp60c-src enzyme activity, platelet shape change, aggregation, and serotonin release were unaltered following platelet stimulation with thrombin (0.05-1.0 unit/ml). Herbimycin A-treated platelets also demonstrated normal platelet aggregation in response to collagen (5 micrograms/ml), ionophore A23187 (2 microM), and ADP/adrenaline (10 microM each). However, the ability of herbimycin A-treated platelets to retract fibrin gels was significantly reduced. This defect in clot retraction was associated with reduced incorporation of integrin alpha IIb beta 3 into the cytoskeletal fraction of thrombin-aggregated platelets. Our studies suggest that tyrosine kinases in platelets regulate the cytoskeletal attachment of alpha IIb beta 3, as an essential process for the transmission of cellular contractile forces to fibrin polymers."
https://openalex.org/W1541647944,"Regions of the human plasminogen (Pg) cDNA containing its kringle 4 (K4) and K5 domains have been expressed in Escherichia coli, and binding constants of omega-amino acid ligands for recombinant (r)-[K4Pg] and r-[K5Pg] have been obtained. In each case, the results showed that of a series of aliphatic alpha, omega-amino acid analogues, 6-aminohexanoic acid showed maximal affinity for these modules, and all ligands interacted more strongly with r-[K4Pg] than with r-[K5Pg]. Site-directed mutagenesis investigations demonstrated that the major amino acid side chain contributors to ligand binding were similar for each of these kringles. Ligand binding was stabilized by charged groups at Asp56 of r-[K4Pg] and Asp57 of r-[K5Pg] as well as by Arg69 of both r-[K4Pg] and r-[K5Pg]. Some hydrophobic amino acids that contributed significantly to the binding strength of the ligands were identified. These were provided by homologous residues in each of the domains, viz. Trp60 and Trp70 of r-[K4Pg] and Trp62 and Tyr72 of r-[K5Pg]. Tyr74 of r-[K5Pg] also substantially contributed to its ligand binding energy."
https://openalex.org/W1002279830,"Protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta) is an atypical PKC isoform that has recently been implicated in cell division and cell growth. However, there has been no morphologic evidence for the involvement of PKC zeta in mitogenic signal transduction. Here we use immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that PKC zeta co-localizes with microtubules in both interphase and metaphase cells of the shark rectal gland in primary culture. This co-localization is present after non-ionic detergent treatment and is disrupted by nocodazole. During mitosis, PKC zeta is associated with the mitotic apparatus and co-localizes with beta-tubulin in spindle microtubules, while entirely sparing astral microtubules. These findings provide the first evidence that PKC zeta is associated with the mitotic apparatus. The striking presence of PKC zeta in the central portion of the mitotic apparatus suggests a functional role for this kinase isoform in cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2115767863,"Elements responsible for the transcriptional activity of the human ATP synthase beta-subunit (ATPsyn beta) gene promoter have been studied through transient expression in HepG2 hepatoma cells of a CAT gene connected with various 5‘-deletion mutants of the 5‘-flanking region. Promoter activity was mostly dependent upon a single CCAAT motif as well as a nearby Ets domain binding region. This last region contains two sites that bind Ets-related proteins present in liver nuclear extracts as well as recombinant purified Ets-1 protein. The ATPsyn beta promoter was trans-activated by Ets-1 and Ets-2 expression vectors, and this effect was lost when the Ets binding region was deleted. The Ets binding region of the ATPsyn beta promoter increased basal expression and conferred Ets-1- and Ets-2-dependent trans-activation to the herpes symplex thymidine kinase minimal promoter. A double-point mutation of the main Ets-binding site, which suppresses Ets binding, blocks Ets-dependent trans-activation. It is concluded that the gene for the mitochondrial ATPsyn beta is a target of transcriptional activation by members of the Ets family of transcription factors. It is suggested that Ets transcription factors may be involved in the enhanced expression of the ATPsyn beta gene in highly proliferating cells and in the coordinate transcription of nuclear genes for mitochondrial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1522964198,"p21 Ras has been implicated in vulval differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We now describe the characteristics during nematode development of the related p21 RhoA which has been ascribed a morphological role in mammals. The CeRhoA cDNA isolated in this study encodes a sequence of 192 amino acids residues with 87.6% identity to human RhoA. Genomic Southern analysis indicates the presence of a single Rho gene in C. elegans. Its 2-kilobase mRNA is expressed at the highest levels during embryogenesis and decreases gradually thereafter. However, the level of the 24-kDa protein detected by the anti-CeRhoA antibody is high at the larval stages but low in embryos. The glutathione S-transferase/CeRhoA fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli displays conserved biochemical activities. Unlike its counterpart in mammalian cells which is predominantly cytosolic, most of CeRhoA is associated with the membrane and the cytoskeleton throughout development. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis indicates an ubiquitous expression of CeRhoA throughout development with a particular enrichment at larval stages in the pharyngeal nerve ring and at the tip of the head containing chemosensory and mechanosensory neurons. This suggests a stage-specific role for p21 RhoA in mediating the signaling pathway underlying the sensory circuitry in C. elegans post-embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1498693984,"The present study was undertaken to clarify the pharmacokinetics of 22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3, OCT), a vitamin D3 analogue with little calcemic activity, and its effect on the transcription of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) gene in nude mice bearing a human carcinoma (FA-6) associated with humoral hypercalcemia. FA-6 tumor expressed vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA, and its nuclear extract contained a specific and saturable 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding activity. Although [3H]OCT administered intravenously into FA-6 tumor-bearing nude mice was cleared from the circulation more rapidly than [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3, the uptake of [3H]OCT into the tumor tissue, relative to the radioactivity in the circulation, was greater than that of [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3. Intravenous or oral administration of OCT reduced the steady-state levels of PTHRP mRNA in FA-6 tumor, and nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that the effect of OCT on PTHRP gene expression occurred at a transcriptional level. RNase mapping analysis revealed that both upstream and downstream promoters of the human PTHRP gene were down-regulated by OCT. Finally, OCT exerted a preventive as well as therapeutic effect on cancer-associated hypercalcemia with a marked prolongation of the survival time in tumor-bearing animals. These results suggest that OCT is effectively taken up by a VDR-positive human carcinoma in vivo and has a therapeutic potential for cancer-associated hypercalcemia through suppression of PTHRP gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1498086754,"The insertion of Band 3, the human erythrocyte anion exchanger, into microsomal membranes was studied in an in vitro reticulocyte lysate translation system. Band 3 consists of a 43-kDa amino-terminal cytosolic domain and a carboxyl-terminal 52-kDa membrane domain containing up to 14 transmembrane segments with a single N-glycosylation site at Asn-642. Insertion of truncated Band 3 molecules into microsomal membranes was assayed by glycosylation, resistance to alkaline extraction, and tryptic removal of the cytosolic domain. Truncations containing either the first four or the last eight putative transmembrane segments were stably integrated into microsomes showing that an intact membrane domain was not required for membrane integration. Furthermore, the extracytosolic domain following the seventh transmembrane segment was properly translocated across the microsomal membrane and glycosylated whether the seventh transmembrane segment was the first, last, or the only transmembrane segment in the construct. The ability of the entire membrane domain, the truncated domain beginning with the seventh transmembrane segment, or the seventh transmembrane segment to insert into microsomes was dependent on the presence of the signal recognition particle receptor. The seventh transmembrane segment in Band 3 therefore has the topogenic properties of an internal signal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1534835480,"The specific inhibitors of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, thapsigargin and 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), stimulated reinitiation of DNA synthesis in synergy with either phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate or bombesin in Swiss 3T3 cells. Maximum stimulation was achieved at 0.5 nM thapsigargin and 7.5 microM DBHQ. Kinetics of [3H]thymidine incorporation were consistent with exit from G0 and entry into S phase. Autoradiography of labeled nuclei showed that the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation was due to an increase in the proportion of cells entering into DNA synthesis. Down-regulation or selective inhibition of protein kinase C abolished this synergistic stimulation of DNA synthesis. Thapsigargin and DBHQ did not potentiate protein kinase C-mediated signals such as direct phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and tyrosine phosphorylation of bands 110,000-130,000 and 70,000-80,000. Thapsigargin and DBHQ caused a marked reduction in the ability of bombesin to induce a rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ via depletion of total cellular Ca2+, measured by 45Ca2+ content. The synergistic stimulation of DNA synthesis by DBHQ and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was dependent on a high concentration of extracellular Ca2+ (ED50 = 410 microM) and was preferentially inhibited by the inhibitor of Ca2+ influx econozole. This suggests a role for Ca2+ entry in growth control. This is the first time that either thapsigargin or DBHQ has been shown to stimulate the reinitiation of DNA synthesis in any target cell."
https://openalex.org/W1485590137,"We herein report that a novel membrane-associated protease capable of activating prothrombin is present in several mammalian cells. This protease can directly convert prothrombin to active thrombin and induces blood clotting both in vivo and in vitro but is apparently different from coagulation factor Xa, which has been thought to be the only physiological activator of prothrombin. This protease activity was initially found and was very high in 8C feline kidney fibroblast cells, and we characterized its enzymological features using this cell line. Activity was detected in neither the cytosolic fraction nor the culture medium but found in the membranes and identified on the surface of intact cells. The activation of prothrombin required Ca2+ ions, and the apparent Km value for prothrombin was 0.2 microM. The activity was irreversibly inhibited by exposure to EDTA, but various inhibitors for serine proteases including antithrombin III were without effect. Based on these results, we propose that this novel enzyme, membrane-associated prothrombin activator, catalyzes an alternative pathway for generation of thrombin, which is independent of the blood coagulation cascade, and that the thrombin generated is involved in certain pathological states and/or in activation of cells that are spatially separated from the bloodstream."
https://openalex.org/W193935746,"Isoenzymes 3-3 and 4-4 of the mu class glutathione S-transferases share 77% sequence identity but have distinctly different catalytic properties. Analysis of the crystal structure of isoenzyme 3-3 in complex with the diastereomeric products of the addition of GSH to phenanthrene 9,10-oxide (Ji, X., Johnson, W. W., Sesay, M. A., Dickert, L., Prasad, S. M., Ammon, H. L., Armstrong, R. N., and Gilliland, G. L. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 1043-1052) reveals that 3 residues that are in van der Waals contact with the xenobiotic portion of the product are different in the type 4 subunit. The three mutations, V9I, I111A, and S209A, have been introduced into isoenzyme 3-3 individually and in combination in an attempt to minimally reconstruct the active site of the enzyme to mimic the type 4 subunit in structure and function. The results suggest that the V9I mutation is an important determinant in the stereoselectivity of the enzyme toward enones and epoxides. The I111A mutation increases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward para-substituted 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ones (XPBO) as measured by kcat/KmXPBO but does not affect kcat. The S209A mutation has no effect on catalysis. The double and triple mutants V9I/I111A and V9I/I111A/S209A exhibit both a high stereoselectivity and high kcat/KmXPBO comparable to that of isoenzyme 4-4. Analysis of substituent effects on the kinetics and stereoselectivity of the enzyme toward the enone substrates suggests that the mechanistic bases for the catalytic behavior of the isoenzyme 4-4 and the reconstructed mutants are not identical. The results provide functional evidence for the catalytic importance of specific residues previously identified by x-ray crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W1546981006,"CD69 is described as a T cell activation antigen, but the ligand and physiological function of CD69 are currently unknown. The sequence of the extracellular domain of CD69 shows some similarity with that of calcium-dependent (C-type) lectins. Using comparative computer modeling and inverse folding calculations, we have generated and analyzed a detailed three-dimensional model of the extracellular domain of CD69 based on the crystal structure of the mannose binding protein. The sequence of CD69 appears to be highly compatible with the C-type lectin fold, and assessment of the model using inverse folding calculations suggests its overall correctness. Compared with mannose binding protein and the selectins, CD69 displays significant deletions in loop regions. In addition, residues that form conserved calcium binding sites found in the C-type lectin family are not conserved in CD69. This suggests the presence of structural features in CD69 that depart from some of the conserved motifs seen in two crystal structures of C-type lectins. The CD69 model shows cavity-shaped hydrophobic regions surrounded by charged residues. One of these cavities is proximal to a potential low affinity calcium binding site and may be implicated in specific interactions with ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1531003049,"Human neutrophil elastase (HNE), a serine protease, is expressed only in the promyelocytic stages of granulocyte maturation. We examined several regions of the promoter for transcriptional activity and report that a 30-base pair (bp) element located between -76 and -106 in the 5'-flanking region of HNE is sufficient for myeloid-specific expression of HNE. Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts from myeloid and non-myeloid cells reveal several myeloid-specific complexes binding to the 30-bp element. Examination of DNA-protein interactions shows that at least two myeloid-specific proteins of 38 and 55 kDa bind to this element. DNase I protection analysis reveals two distinct footprints between -80 to -91 and -94 to -104 within this element. Transient expression studies using deletion constructs of the HNE 5'-flanking region show that the 30-bp element is active in myeloid cells K 562 and U 937 but not in HeLa cells. Internal deletion of this element results in a 60-85% loss of promoter activity in myeloid cells. Additional functional studies also show that a 19-bp region between -112 and -131 contributes to transcriptional activity of the elastase promoter as well."
https://openalex.org/W1669738779,"A reconstituted system containing membranes prepared from various Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (CYR1 ras1 ras2) and a recombinant RAS2 protein was used to evaluate the effect of lipids on adenylyl cyclase activity. Incubation of wild-type membranes with lysophosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylserine, or lysophosphatidylcholine stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the absence and presence of RAS between 2-10-fold depending upon the individual lipid. Unsaturated fatty acids preferentially increased activity 2-3-fold in the presence of RAS. Other phospholipids as well as several detergents had only marginal effects on adenylyl cyclase activity. Lipids had no effect on either the binding or hydrolysis of GTP by RAS. LysoPI decreased both the Km for ATP and the amount of RAS required for enzyme activation. Four catalytically active deletion mutants of the CYR1 protein including one containing only the C-terminal 417 amino acids were similarly responsive to lysoPI when compared to the wild-type enzyme. These data suggest that lysophospholipids and fatty acids, metabolites of the mitogenically responsive enzyme phospholipase A2, may represent a novel mechanism for modulating the activity of downstream effector molecules and their interaction with Ras proteins."

The carboxyl-terminal third of Rrp1, homologous to Escherichia coli exonuclease III, is sufficient to repair oxidative and alkylation-induced DNA damage in vivo. Using a screen for partial complementation of repair-deficient E. coli, we isolated three mutants of the nuclease domain of Rrp1: T462A, K463Q, and L484P, that protect against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-induced but not t-BuO2H-induced DNA damage. Thr-462 and Lys-463 are highly conserved residues found in a cluster of 5 conserved amino acids (LQETK), while Leu-484 is poorly conserved. Gln-460 Glu-461, Thr-462, and Lys-463 and Leu-484 were altered by site-directed mutagenesis using a plasmid including the entire Rrp1 gene and mutant proteins were purified. Mutants of the three residues Glu-461, Thr-462, and Lys-463 demonstrate 8-200-fold lower phosphodiesterase specific activity than wild-type Rrp1. E461A has a 30-fold reduction in AP endonuclease and is MMS-sensitive, but all other mutants have near-normal AP endonuclease and are MMS-resistant. Glu-461 appears to be essential for the nuclease function for Rrp1. Lys-463 and, to a lesser extent, Thr-462 influence the substrate specificity of the Rrp1 nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1001385107,"Data presented here show that there are significant differences in the insulin binding affinity and the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin proreceptor isoforms which contain or lack exon 11. The exon 11(+) proreceptor does not show significant variations from the mature processed insulin receptor and has only a 3- to 4-fold reduced affinity for insulin. In contrast, the exon 11(-) proreceptor showed a markedly reduced insulin binding (25- to 50-fold less) when assayed on intact cells. Upon solubilization of the cells, exon 11(-) proreceptor bound insulin with somewhat higher affinity. Mild trypsin treatment of the cells expressing either isoform of the insulin proreceptor restored insulin binding to near-normal levels. Analysis of tyrosine kinase activity revealed that the exon 11(+) proreceptor required somewhat higher concentrations of insulin than the mature processed receptor to achieve maximal autophosphorylation. The exon 11(-) proreceptor failed to fully phosphorylate even at 10(-6) M insulin. Thus, the presence or absence of this short sequence of 12 amino acids affects the folding and/or conformation of the proreceptor so as to confer altered binding of insulin. We suggest that in the absence of exon 11 the proreceptor assumes a strained conformation that disrupts the insulin binding site. Cleavage of the proreceptor at the alpha-beta-subunit junction then allows the alpha-subunit to achieve its normal binding conformation."
https://openalex.org/W25032278,"Upstream of the chicken beta-globin gene cluster are four DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS1-4). Hypersensitive sites located upstream of the mammalian beta-globin clusters have enhancer activity and mediate position-independent gene expression. In contrast, a region inside the chicken cluster has enhancer activity and mediates position-independent expression. Here we investigate the function of the chicken upstream sites, which are different from the mammalian ones in sequence, number, and distance from the genes. Each was tested for its effect on reporter gene expression in transfected primary erythroid cells. HS2 and HS3 (4.4 and 6.4 kilobases upstream of rho-globin) showed significant enhancer activity while HS1 and HS4 (1.6 and 11 kilobases upstream of rho-globin) did not. A 237-base pair region of HS2 contained the sequences necessary for enhancer activity. Proteins from erythroid extracts bound HS2 in seven different regions; six of these sites were characterized. GATA-1 bound to four of the sites. Each site contributed to the enhancer activity of HS2. Two other sequences bound proteins that may be related to Sp1 and erythroid kruppel-like factor. Surprisingly, mutations in these elements, which disrupted protein binding, did not affect enhancer activity. Thus, the observed enhancer activity of HS2 is due to the four GATA sites. The existence of multiple GATA sites in both chicken HS2 and the mammalian upstream sites may be due to evolution from a common element with preservation of only very short sequences or to convergent evolution. These observations highlight the crucial role for GATA proteins in globin regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1567428531,"Despite the definite etiologic link between apolipoprotein (apo) E mutations and type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP), it is not clear what additional factors are involved in the development of florid hyperlipidemia and how to explain the wide variability in the expression of the hyperlipidemic phenotype in carriers of receptor binding-defective apoE variants. The present study was designed to determine whether the overexpression of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma protein that transfers cholesteryl esters from the high density lipoproteins (HDL) to the very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and whose activity is increased in hyperlipidemic states, plays a role in the development of hyperlipidemia and beta-VLDL accumulation in type III HLP. We produced double-transgenic mice that co-expressed high levels of simian CETP and either high or low levels of a human receptor binding-defective apoE variant, apoE(Cys-142). We previously reported that apoE(Cys-142) high-expresser mice showed spontaneous hyperlipidemia and accumulation of beta-VLDL, whereas the low-expresser mice showed only a modest increase in VLDL cholesterol. Co-expression of CETP induced a massive transfer of cholesteryl esters from the HDL to the VLDL in both lines of double-transgenic mice. As a result, HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels were reduced to about 50% of normal, VLDL cholesterol increased 2.5-fold, and the cholesteryl ester content of VLDL reached values similar to those observed in human beta-VLDL. The ratio of defective to normal apoE in VLDL was unaffected by CETP co-expression and was higher in animals expressing high apoE levels. Finally, in spite of an increased accumulation of beta-VLDL in the high-expresser mice, the VLDL of the low-expresser mice maintained pre-beta mobility upon co-expression of CETP. The results of this study demonstrate that the ratio of defective to normal apoE on the VLDL, rather than the cholesteryl ester content of VLDL, is the major factor determining the development of severe hyperlipidemia and the formation and accumulation of beta-VLDL in type III HLP."
