https://openalex.org/W2114245966,"Antigen targeting and adjuvancy schemes that respectively facilitate delivery of antigen to dendritic cells and elicit their activation have been explored in vaccine development. Here we investigate whether nanoparticles can be used as a vaccine platform by targeting lymph node-residing dendritic cells via interstitial flow and activating these cells by in situ complement activation. After intradermal injection, interstitial flow transported ultra-small nanoparticles (25 nm) highly efficiently into lymphatic capillaries and their draining lymph nodes, targeting half of the lymph node-residing dendritic cells, whereas 100-nm nanoparticles were only 10% as efficient. The surface chemistry of these nanoparticles activated the complement cascade, generating a danger signal in situ and potently activating dendritic cells. Using nanoparticles conjugated to the model antigen ovalbumin, we demonstrate generation of humoral and cellular immunity in mice in a size- and complement-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2075291089,"Gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 are common in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas (T-ALL), making this receptor a promising target for drugs such as gamma-secretase inhibitors, which block a proteolytic cleavage required for NOTCH1 activation. However, the enthusiasm for these therapies has been tempered by tumor resistance and the paucity of information on the oncogenic programs regulated by oncogenic NOTCH1. Here we show that NOTCH1 regulates the expression of PTEN (encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the activity of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway in normal and leukemic T cells. Notch signaling and the PI3K-AKT pathway synergize in vivo in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Notch-induced tumorigenesis, and mutational loss of PTEN is associated with human T-ALL resistance to pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1. Overall, these findings identify transcriptional control of PTEN and regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as key elements of the leukemogenic program activated by NOTCH1 and provide the basis for the design of new therapeutic strategies for T-ALL."

https://openalex.org/W2012056998,"Human olfactory perception differs enormously between individuals, with large reported perceptual variations in the intensity and pleasantness of a given odour. For instance, androstenone (5alpha-androst-16-en-3-one), an odorous steroid derived from testosterone, is variously perceived by different individuals as offensive (""sweaty, urinous""), pleasant (""sweet, floral"") or odourless. Similar variation in odour perception has been observed for several other odours. The mechanistic basis of variation in odour perception between individuals is unknown. We investigated whether genetic variation in human odorant receptor genes accounts in part for variation in odour perception between individuals. Here we show that a human odorant receptor, OR7D4, is selectively activated in vitro by androstenone and the related odorous steroid androstadienone (androsta-4,16-dien-3-one) and does not respond to a panel of 64 other odours and two solvents. A common variant of this receptor (OR7D4 WM) contains two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), resulting in two amino acid substitutions (R88W, T133M; hence 'RT') that severely impair function in vitro. Human subjects with RT/WM or WM/WM genotypes as a group were less sensitive to androstenone and androstadienone and found both odours less unpleasant than the RT/RT group. Genotypic variation in OR7D4 accounts for a significant proportion of the valence (pleasantness or unpleasantness) and intensity variance in perception of these steroidal odours. Our results demonstrate the first link between the function of a human odorant receptor in vitro and odour perception."

https://openalex.org/W2038428234,"Geosmin is responsible for the characteristic odor of moist soil, as well as off-flavors in drinking water and foodstuffs. Geosmin is generated from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, 2) by an enzyme that is encoded by the SCO6073 gene in the soil organism Streptomyces coelicolor A32 (ref. 3). We have now shown that the recombinant N-terminal half of this protein catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent cyclization of FPP to germacradienol and germacrene D, while the highly homologous C-terminal domain, previously thought to be catalytically silent, catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent conversion of germacradienol to geosmin. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the N- and C-terminal domains each harbor a distinct, independently functioning active site. A mutation in the N-terminal domain of germacradienol-geosmin synthase of a catalytically essential serine to alanine results in the conversion of FPP to a mixture of sesquiterpenes that includes an aberrant product identified as isolepidozene, which was previously suggested to be an enzyme-bound intermediate in the cyclization of FPP to germacradienol."

https://openalex.org/W2077458610,"Endogenous polyamines profoundly affect the activity of various ion channels, including that of calcium-permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs). Here we show that stargazin, a transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein (TARP) known to influence transport, gating and desensitization of AMPARs, greatly reduces block of CP-AMPARs by intracellular polyamines. By decreasing CP-AMPAR affinity for cytoplasmic polyamines, stargazin enhances the charge transfer following single glutamate applications and eliminates the frequency-dependent facilitation seen with repeated applications. In cerebellar stellate cells, which express both synaptic CP-AMPARs and stargazin, we found that the rectification and unitary conductance of channels underlying excitatory postsynaptic currents were matched by those of recombinant AMPARs only when the latter were associated with stargazin. Taken together, our observations establish modulatory actions of stargazin that are specific to CP-AMPARs, and suggest that during synaptic transmission the activity of such receptors, and thus calcium influx, is fundamentally changed by TARPs."

https://openalex.org/W2071149427,"Neural activity actively regulates muscle gene expression. This regulation is crucial for specifying muscle functionality and synaptic protein expression. How neural activity is relayed into nuclei and connected to the muscle transcriptional machinery, however, is not known. Here we identify the histone deacetylase HDAC4 as the critical linker connecting neural activity to muscle transcription. We found that HDAC4 is normally concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where nerve innervates muscle. Remarkably, reduced neural input by surgical denervation or neuromuscular diseases dissociates HDAC4 from the NMJ and dramatically induces its expression, leading to robust HDAC4 nuclear accumulation. We present evidence that nuclear accumulated HDAC4 is responsible for the coordinated induction of synaptic genes upon denervation. Inactivation of HDAC4 prevents denervation-induced synaptic acetyl-choline receptor (nAChR) and MUSK transcription whereas forced expression of HDAC4 mimics denervation and activates ectopic nAChR transcription throughout myofibers. We determined that HDAC4 executes activity-dependent transcription by regulating the Dach2-myogenin transcriptional cascade where inhibition of the repressor Dach2 by HDAC4 permits the induction of the transcription factor myogenin, which in turn activates synaptic gene expression. Our findings establish HDAC4 as a neural activity-regulated deacetylase and a key signaling component that relays neural activity to the muscle transcriptional machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2070190414,"Aberrant regulation of signalling mechanisms that normally orchestrate embryonic development, such as the Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch pathways, is a common feature of tumorigenesis. In order to better understand the neoplastic events mediated by Hedgehog signalling, we identified over 200 genes regulated by Sonic Hedgehog in multipotent mesodermal cells. Widespread crosstalk with other developmental signalling pathways is evident, suggesting a complex network of interactions that challenges the often over-simplistic representation of these pathways as simple linear entities. Hes1, a principal effector of the Notch pathway, was found to be a target of Sonic Hedgehog in both C3H/10T1/2 mesodermal and MNS70 neural cells. Desert Hedgehog also elicited a strong Hes1 response. While Smoothened function was found necessary for upregulation of Hes1 in response to Sonic Hedgehog, the mechanism does not require γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Notch receptors, and appears to involve transcription factors other than RBP-Jκ. Thus, we have defined a novel mechanism for Hes1 regulation in stem-like cells that is independent of canonical Notch signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2037199975,"Lipid peroxidation is a consequence of both normal physiology and oxidative stress that generates various reactive metabolites, a principal end product being 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). As a diffusible electrophile, HNE reacts extensively with cellular nucleophiles. Consequently, HNE alters cellular signaling and activates the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. We have previously demonstrated that in addition to promoting apoptosis, HNE activates stress response pathways, including the antioxidant, endoplasmic reticulum stress, DNA damage, and heat shock responses. Here we demonstrate that activation of the heat shock response by HNE is dependent on the expression and nuclear translocation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which promotes the expression of heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) and Hsp70-1. Ectopic expression and immunoprecipitation of c-Myc-tagged Hsp70-1 indicates that HNE disrupts the inhibitory interaction between Hsp70-1 and HSF1, leading to the activation heat shock gene expression. Using siRNA to silence HSF1 expression, we observe that HSF1 is necessary for the induction of Hsp40 and Hsp70-1 by HNE, and the lack of Hsp expression is correlated with an increase in apoptosis. Nrf2, the transcription factor that mediates the antioxidant response, was also silenced using siRNA. Silencing Nrf2 also enhanced the cytotoxicity of HNE, but not as effectively as HSF1. Silencing HSF1 expression facilitates the activation of JNK pro-apoptotic signaling and selectively decreases expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL. Overexpression of Bcl-XL attenuates HNE-mediated apoptosis in HSF1-silenced cells. Overall, activation of HSF1 and stabilization of Bcl-XL mediate a protective response that may contribute significantly to the cellular biology of lipid peroxidation.

Overall, activation of HSF1 and stabilization of Bcl-XL mediate a protective response that may contribute significantly to the cellular biology of lipid peroxidation. The oxidation of membrane phospholipids is an inescapable consequence of normal cellular respiration. A major route for lipid oxidation involves the abstraction of bis-allylic hydrogen atoms from polyunsaturated fatty acids by reactive oxygen species. The resulting lipid radicals react readily with dioxygen to form lipid hydroperoxides, which are mainly reduced to their corresponding hydroxyl species. A number of xenobiotic metabolites, anti-neoplastic drugs, transition metals, and disease states promote increased levels of both reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids. The decomposition of oxidized lipids yields a variety of diffusible electrophiles, including the α, β-unsaturated aldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). 2The abbreviations used are: HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; Hsp, heat shock protein; HSF1, heat shock transcription factor 1; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HSE, heat shock element; DMEM, Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium; D-PBS, Dulbeccoŉs phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; Hsp, heat shock protein; HSF1, heat shock transcription factor 1; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HSE, heat shock element; DMEM, Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium; D-PBS, Dulbeccoŉs phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA. Diffusible lipid electrophiles are capable of modifying nucleophilic sites on DNA and proteins throughout the cell. Modification of cellular targets by HNE is found in multiple disease states, including atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease (1Uchida K. Toyokuni S.

Plasma conjugates of HNE have been observed at low micromolar concentrations in healthy adults, implying the detectable generation of HNE under normal physiological conditions, although absolute steady-state concentrations are less clear (6Sowell J.

At the cellular level, elevated levels of HNE promote cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death. Studies in a variety of cultured cell systems, including: neuronal (PC12); endothelial human umbilical vein endothelial cells; myeloid (K562, HL-60); lymphoid (MOLT-4, Reh); and colorectal cell lines (RKO) have verified the induction of apoptosis by HNE (8Kruman I.

Rep. 2007; 12: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In addition to initiating apoptosis, HNE activates various protective, stress response pathways. We previously used microarray analysis to explore transcriptional pathways activated by HNE in RKO cells and found that HNE induces the DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, antioxidant, and heat shock responses (17West J.D. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Among the pathways activated by HNE, the heat shock response is particularly robust. The heat shock response mediates the induction of a highly conserved set of heat shock proteins (Hsps) (18Moseley P.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 83: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The inducible expression of Hsps is mediated by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which translocates to the nucleus upon activation and enhances the expression of genes from promoters containing heat shock elements (HSE) (19Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 20Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A principal function of Hsps is to chaperone other proteins, binding to nascent polypeptide chains as well as to unfolded and damaged proteins. Their function as protein chaperones aids in the recovery of cells from thermal and chemical-induced damage (21Hahn G.M. Li G.C. Radiat. Res. 1982; 92: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Howard M.K. Burke L.C. Mailhos C. Pizzey A. Gilbert C.S. Lawson W.D. Collins M.K. Thomas N.S. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hsps regulate a diverse set of signaling pathways via their interactions with “client” proteins (23Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, although Hsp70 does not interact directly with Bax, it does inhibit Bax translocation to the mitochondrion and attenuates stress-induced apoptosis (24Stankiewicz A.R. Lachapelle G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38729-38739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Here we investigate activation of the heat shock response by HNE in detail. Treatment of a colorectal cancer cell line with HNE elicits a concentration-dependent activation of HSF1, associated with a robust increase in Hsp40 and Hsp70-1 (inducible Hsp70, Hsp72) expression. Utilizing an siRNA-based method to silence HSF1, we attenuate the heat shock response and examine the effect on cell survival. Our data indicate that heat shock response protects against HNE-induced apoptosis and that HSF1 activation is critical in mediating this effect. The degree of cytoprotection afforded by the heat shock response exceeds the anti-apoptotic effects of Nrf2 activation. We find that treatment with HNE causes both activation of JNK signaling and a specific reduction in Bcl-XL expression, both of which are exacerbated by silencing HSF1. Ectopic expression of Bcl-XL confers resistance to HNE-mediated apoptosis and partially reverses the sensitization to HNE caused by HSF1 siRNA. These results indicate a critical role for HSF1 activation in resistance to stress-mediated apoptosis and suggest a novel role for Hsp70-1 as a regulator of mitochondria-mediated cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment—RKO cells, a poorly differentiated, p53(+) colon carcinoma cell line widely used for studies on DNA damage and cellular signaling of electrophiles, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen), and 25 mm HEPES buffer. HNE (Axxora) was quantified by UV-visible spectroscopy using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,750 m–1cm–1 at 223 nm. For addition to cell culture, a desired quantity of HNE in ethanol was dried down under an argon stream and reconstituted in Me2SO. The cells were treated in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM containing a final concentration of 0.5% Me2SO.Viability Assays—RKO cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 7.5× 103 cells/well. After adhering overnight, the cells were treated with HNE or Me2SO. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was aspirated, washed once in Dulbeccoŉs phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) and replaced with a solution of 2 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) in D-PBS. After 30 min, fluorescence was read using a SpectraMax multiwell plate reader (Molecular Devices) with an excitation λ of 494 nm and an emission λ of 517 nm.siRNA Transfections—For siRNA transfections, RKO cells were seeded at 25% confluence in 10-cm dishes. After adhering overnight, the cells were washed once with D-PBS, and 4 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was added per dish. The transfections were performed with 0.2 nmol of Stealth siRNA (HSF1 sense strand sequence, 5′-CGGAUUCAGGGAAGCAGCUGGUGCA-3′; Nrf2 sense strand sequence, 5′-CCAGUUGACAGUGAACUCAUUAAAU-3′) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per dish according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. After 24 h the cells were split at a ratio of 1:4 and transfected a second time the following day. The cells were split, allowed 24 h to adhere, and then treated with HNE or Me2SO.Plasmid Constructs and Transfections—Clones for Bcl-XL (NCBI accession BC019307) and Hsp70-1 (NCBI accession BC009322) were obtained from the Vanderbilt Microarray Shared Resource clone collection. Bcl-XL was excised from pCMV-SPORT6 using the restriction endonuclease BglII and ligated into the BamHI site of pcDNA3.1 Hygro(+). Hsp70-1 was excised from pOTB7 using MscI and XhoI. The excised fragment and a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the c-Myc tag (5′P-GGCATGGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGG-OH3′) were ligated into the EcoRV and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-Hygro(+). All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing at the Vanderbilt DNA Sequencing Facility. For stable transfection of Bcl-XL, RKO cells at 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes were transfected using either the Bcl-XL construct or empty pcDNA3.1 Hygro(+) and Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h the cells were split into DMEM containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin, and stably expressing clones were selected. For transient transfection of c-Myc-tagged Hsp70-1, RKO cells were transfected with either the c-Myc-Hsp70-1 construct or empty pcDNA3.1-Hygro(+) and Lipofectamine 2000, and the experiments were performed 24 h after transfection.Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—For total protein extraction the cells were scraped in cold D-PBS and collected by centrifugation. Cold mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER) lysis buffer (Pierce) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) was added to cell pellets. Protein lysates were cleared by centrifugation and stored at–80 °C. For nuclear proteins, the cells were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in 800 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 50 μl of Igepal CA-630 (Nonidet P-40) was added. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice with buffer A. The nuclear proteins were extracted by the addition of buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For Western blot, equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) prior to the addition of primary antibody. Following incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, Luminol-based detection was performed. Primary antibodies were obtained from the following sources: HSF1, c-Myc tag, PARP, caspase 3, caspase 3 cleavage products, JNK, phospho-JNK, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL from Cell Signaling; Hsp27, Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp105 from BD Biosciences; α-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich; and Nrf2, actin, and all secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Immunoprecipitation—RKO cells were transfected with empty pcDNA3.1-Hygro(+) vector, or with the c-Myc-Hsp70-1 expression construct. After 24 h total proteins were collected in mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER) lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay. Protein samples were treated with either 0.1% Me2SO (vehicle) or with 15 μm or 45 μm HNE for 1 h, and then 400 μg of total protein was immunoprecipitated using the ProFound c-Myc tag immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Following elution in 25 μl of SDS loading buffer, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot.Luciferase Assay—An HSE-bearing luciferase construct was generated by insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′P-TGCTAGCCTTCTGGAACCTTCTGGAACCTTCTGGAACCTTCTGGAACCTTCTGGAACCTTCTGGAACCTTCTTGGAAGGGCTCGAG-OH3′) into the SmaI site of pGL3-Promoter (Promega). The cells were seeded at a density of 25% confluence in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 200 ng of firefly luciferase reporter construct (pGL3-HSE) and 5 ng of Renilla luciferase (pRL-SV40)(Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 and grown for an additional 24 h. The cells were treated for 8 h with Me2SO or HNE at indicated concentrations and then collected in passive lysis buffer. Analysis of luciferase was performed using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Pharmingen).RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was collected using RNeasy RNA collection kit (Qiagen). Digestion of trace DNA was performed by incubation with DNase using DNA-free reagent (Ambion). 1 μg of total RNA was used in each reverse transcription reaction with iScript reagent, (Bio-Rad). One-tenth of each reaction volume (2 μl) was used per well in subsequent real time PCR analysis, using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Real time reactions were performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler real time PCR machine. Standard curves were generated by the amplification of target sequences that were previously cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), in dilution series from 10–1 to 10–6 fmol/well.RESULTSHNE Induces Nuclear HSF1 Expression and Promotes Heat Shock Protein Expression—Our previous observation that HNE activates the heat shock response led us to examine the underlying mechanism in detail. RKO cells were treated with either Me2SO (vehicle) or HNE for various times. Nuclear proteins were collected and analyzed for HSF1 expression by Western blot. Me2SO-treated cells showed little nuclear HSF1 expression. In contrast, the addition of 5, 15, or 45 μm HNE induced a robust accumulation of HSF1 within the nucleus (Fig. 1). Expression of HSF1 in nuclear extracts was noticeable within 15 min following HNE addition. To examine the magnitude of heat shock protein induction, RKO cells were treated with 30–60 μm HNE and total protein extracts collected at 8 h. The lysates were analyzed by Western blot for the expression of various heat shock proteins. HNE induced a robust, concentration-dependent increase in the expression of both Hsp40 and Hsp70-1 (Fig. 2). Only modest expression of Hsp40 and Hsp70-1 was observed in Me2SO-treated cells. Also, HNE did not significantly influence the expression of other heat shock proteins, including Hsp27, Hsc70 (Hsp73), Hsp90, and Hsp105.FIGURE 2HNE induces expression of heat shock proteins Hsp70-1 and Hsp40. The cells were treated with Me2SO (lane 0) or with 30, 45, or 60μmHNE for 8 h. Total protein lysates were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The lysates were analyzed by Western blot for Hsp105, Hsp90, Hsp70 (Hsc70/Hsp70-1), Hsp40, and Hsp27. Actin was included as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction of Hsp70-1 with HSF1—Previous work has established that Hsp70 is a negative regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity (25Abravaya K.

Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 5427-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, others have shown that HNE modifies Hsp70-1 in vitro, hindering its function as a protein chaperone (27Carbone D.L. Doorn J.A. Kiebler Z. Sampey B.P. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that HNE disrupts the inhibitory interaction between Hsp70-1 and HSF1. RKO cells were transiently transfected with either empty pcDNA3.1 Hygro(+) or an N-terminally c-Myc-tagged Hsp70-1 expression construct. Western blotting revealed that immunoprecipitation of c-Myc-Hsp70-1 resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of HSF1. Preincubation of protein lysates with HNE (15, 45 μm) inhibited co-immunoprecipitation of HSF1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3), suggesting that HNE-modified Hsp70-1 releases HSF1. Thus, data support our hypothesis that Hsp70-1 modification facilitates activation of the heat shock response in HNE-treated cells.FIGURE 3HNE treatment inhibits the interaction of Hsp70-1 with HSF1. The cells were transiently transfected with either empty pcDNA3.1-Hygro(+) (–) or an N-terminally c-Myc-tagged Hsp70-1 expression construct (+). After 24 h total proteins were collected. The protein lysates were treated with either 0.1% Me2SO (0), 15 μm, or 45 μmHNE for 1 h. The lysates (400 μg) were immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Myc conjugated beads. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot for expression of the c-Myc tag (c-Myc-Hsp70-1) and HSF1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HSF1 Silencing Attenuates HSE-driven Gene Expression and Heat Shock Protein Induction—To investigate the biological consequences of HSF1 activation and the resulting induction of the heat shock response, an siRNA-based approach was used to selectively inhibit HSF1 expression. RKO cells were transfected with either an HSF1-specific siRNA or a negative control siRNA (scrambled sequence). Real time PCR was performed to determine the extent of HSF1 mRNA reduction. The level of HSF1 mRNA in cells transfected with HSF1 siRNA was reduced to ∼20% of the level in control cells (Fig. 4A). Western blotting indicates complete silencing of HSF1 protein expression (Fig. 4B). A luciferase-based reporter construct also was employed to verify the inhibition of heat shock-mediated gene expression. Cells treated with siRNA (HSF1 or control) were subsequently transfected with the HSE-bearing firefly luciferase construct (pGL3-HSE). As a control, cells were co-transfected with a constitutive Renilla luciferase expression vector (pSV40-RL). Following treatment with 30–60 μm HNE, the samples were collected in passive lysis buffer. Analysis of normalized luciferase (firefly/Renillaactivity) shows that HNE eliciteda concentration-dependent increase in expression from the pGL3-HSE construct (Fig. 5A), and a maximal 21-fold increase in normalized luciferase was observed with 60 μm HNE. In contrast, silencing HSF1 nearly abolished HNE-induced luciferase expression from pGL3-HSE. Inhibition of the heat shock response was also evaluated by Western blot. Induction of both Hsp40 and Hsp70-1 by HNE was robust in control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5B); however, their expression was completely attenuated in cells transfected with HSF1 siRNA, further verifying successful knockdown of the heat shock response.FIGURE 4Silencing HSF1 expression in RKO cells by siRNA.

In addition to heat shock, HNE also activates the antioxidant response, an adaptive mechanism to defend against oxidative and electrophile-induced stress that is regulated by the transcription factor, Nrf2 (17West J.D.

To evaluate the degree of Nrf2 reduction, the cells were treated with 30 or 45 μm HNE and assayed for nuclear expression of Nrf2 by Western blot. In control siRNA-transfected cells, HNE induced a robust nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. In contrast, Nrf2 siRNA-transfected cells had no detectible nuclear Nrf2 following HNE treatment, indicating successful attenuation of Nrf2 protein expression by siRNA (Fig. 6A). To confirm silencing of the antioxidant response, the level HO-1 protein expression was measured. Western blot shows that siRNA-mediated silencing of Nrf2 suppressed the HNE-induced expression of HO-1 (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6Silencing Nrf2 expression in RKO cells by siRNA.

Here we developed an ATP analog-sensitive PKCϵ mutant to selectively inhibit the catalytic activity of PKCϵ. We used this mutant and PKCϵ-/- mice to determine that PKCϵ phosphorylates γ2 subunits at serine 327 and that reduced phosphorylation of this site enhances the actions of ethanol and benzodiazepines at α1β2γ2 receptors, which is the most abundant GABAA receptor subtype in the brain. Our findings indicate that PKCϵ phosphorylation of γ2 regulates the response of GABAA receptors to specific allosteric modulators, and, in particular, PKCϵ inhibition renders these receptors sensitive to low intoxicating concentrations of ethanol.

Valenzuela C.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 111: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Ethanol modulation of GABAA receptors was first identified in synaptosomal preparations where intoxicating concentrations (10-30 mm) enhanced receptor function as measured by 36Cl uptake assays (2Suzdak P.D. Schwartz R.D. Skolnick P. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4071-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 3Allan A.M. Harris R.A. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1987; 27: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, after 30 years of investigation, it is apparent that ethanol enhancement of synaptic GABAA receptors is variable and in some preparations cannot be detected even at anesthetic concentrations (1Weiner J.L. Valenzuela C.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 111: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Criswell H.E. Breese G.R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2005; 30: 1407-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors are pentameric protein complexes of subunits from eight classes (α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ϵ, π, θ, and ρ1-3) (5Wafford K.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 5: 47-52Google Scholar). Most receptors are composed of two α subunits and two β subunits that co-assemble with one γ2 subunit, which anchors these receptors at synapses where they mediate phasic inhibition (6Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.M. Luscher B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). A minority contain a δ subunit instead of γ2; these receptors are extrasynaptic and mediate tonic inhibition in neurons (7Farrant M. Nusser Z. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Because earlier ethanol studies that focused on GABA currents carried by γ2-containing receptors produced variable results, recent attention has turned to ethanol effects at receptors containing δ subunits. Reports from three laboratories found these receptors enhanced by low (≤30 mm) intoxicating concentrations of ethanol (8Sundstrom-Poromaa I. Smith D.H. Gong Q.H. Sabado T.N. Li X. Light A. Wiedmann M. Williams K. Smith S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 721-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Wallner M. Hanchar H.J. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, two recent studies were unable to demonstrate low dose ethanol sensitivity of δ-containing GABAA receptors (11Borghese C.M. Storustovu S. Ebert B. Herd M.B. Belelli D. Lambert J.J. Marshall G. Wafford K.A. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 1360-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Yamashita M. Marszalec W. Yeh J.Z. Narahashi T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 319: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that, like synaptic GABAA receptors, ethanol modulation of extrasynaptic receptors is also variable. The reasons for this high degree of variability are unknown. One possibility is that intracellular signaling pathways may regulate ethanol sensitivity of GABAA receptors, and the activity of such pathways was not controlled for in these studies. This hypothesis is consistent with our findings in mice lacking protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ), which show an increased behavioral response to ethanol (13Hodge C.W. Mehmert K.K. Kelley S.P. McMahon T. Haywood A. Olive M.F. Wang D. Sanchez-Perez A.M. Messing R.O. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Ethanol modulation of GABAA receptors is also increased in PKCϵ-/- mice compared with wild-type mice (13Hodge C.W. Mehmert K.K. Kelley S.P. McMahon T. Haywood A. Olive M.F. Wang D. Sanchez-Perez A.M. Messing R.O. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 14Proctor W.R. Poelchen W. Bowers B.J. Wehner J.M. Messing R.O. Dunwiddie T.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results suggest that activation of PKCϵ suppresses potentiation of GABAA receptors by ethanol. The mechanism by which PKCϵ regulates the ethanol sensitivity of GABAA receptors is unknown. Here, we examined this mechanism using receptors composed of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits, which is the most abundant receptor subtype in the brain (15McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Because there are no selective inhibitors of PKCϵ catalytic activity available, we used a chemical-genetics approach to generate an ATP analog-sensitive mutant, as-PKCϵ, that could be potently and selectively inhibited by a cell-permeant, small molecule inhibitor. Our findings indicate that PKCϵ regulates the sensitivity of α1β2γ2 receptors to ethanol and benzodiazepines through phosphorylation of serine 327 in the large intracellular loop of γ2. Animal Care and Behavior—PKCϵ-/- mice were generated by homologous recombination in J1 embryonic stem cells as described (16Khasar S.G. Lin Y.H. Martin A. Dadgar J. McMahon T. Wang D. Hundle B.

Male and female PKCϵ+/- mice were maintained on inbred 129S4/SvJae and C57BL6/J backgrounds and were crossed to produce PKCϵ+/- C57BL6/J ×129S4/SvJae F1 hybrid mice. These mice were intercrossed to generate F2 hybrid PKCϵ+/+ and PKCϵ-/- littermates for experiments. Mice were genotyped by PCR of tail biopsies (5-10 mm fragment) obtained from non-anesthetized, 10-day-old pups. All animals were between 2 and 4 months old at the time of experimentation. All procedures were conducted in accordance with Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies. Zolpidem-induced ataxia was measured as described previously (17Wallace M.J. Newton P.M. Oyasu M. McMahon T. Chou W.H. Connolly J. Messing R.O. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2007; 32: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The “up and down” method (17Wallace M.J. Newton P.M. Oyasu M. McMahon T. Chou W.H. Connolly J. Messing R.O. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2007; 32: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used to measure initial sensitivity to zolpidem with a starting dose of 0.25 mg/kg and a log dose interval of 0.0276. Immunoprecipitation—Frontal cortex was dissected from 8- to 10-week-old mice and homogenized with a Teflon-glass homogenizer in ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm benzamidine chloride, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was solubilized in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture), and centrifuged again at 120,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (500 μg of protein) was incubated for 2 h at 27 °C with 1 μg of rabbit anti-GABAA-α1 polyclonal antibody 993-2, generated against the C-terminal decapeptide sequence common to rat, mouse, and human GABAA-α1 (PQLKAPTPHQ), or with purified rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). For the reverse immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-PKCϵ (18Choi D.S. Wang D. Dadgar J. Chang W.S. Messing R.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9905-9911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or purified rabbit IgG. Protein A beads (100 μl, Roche Applied Science) were added, and the suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with ice-cold PBS, and immune complexes were eluted with 100 μl of sample buffer. After being heated for 7 min at 90 °C, samples were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 s, and proteins were separated in 4-12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were analyzed using Western blots with goat anti-PKCϵ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:500 dilution) or goat anti-α1 subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution) followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Roche Applied Science, 1:1000 dilution) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Primary Neuronal Culture—Primary cultures of cortical and hippocampal neurons were prepared from 1- to 3-day-old mice as described (19Goslin K. Asmussen A. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were dissociated from dissected cerebral cortex or hippocampus by treatment with papain (20 units/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by trituration through a 1-ml plastic pipette. For immunostaining, hippocampal neurons were plated at a density of 105 cells on 200-mm2 chamber slides coated with poly-l-lysine in Neurobasal A media containing B27 and Glutamax (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2 and 94% air. For studies of cell surface γ2 subunits, cortical neurons were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates at 1.6 × 106 cells/well. For electrophysiology experiments, hippocampal neurons were plated on poly-l-ornithine-coated 35-mm Petri dishes. Half of the medium was changed the next day and changed every 7 days for 3 weeks. Immunofluorescence Staining of Neurons—Mature (14-21 days in vitro) neurons were immunostained as described (20Brunig I. Suter A. Knuesel I. Luscher B. Fritschy J.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect GABAA receptors on the cell surface, living cultures were incubated with rabbit anti-GABAA receptor α1 N-terminal peptide (1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) diluted in Ringer's solution containing 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin for 90 min at 27 °C. After three 10-min washes in Ringer's solution, the cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 90 min at 27 °C with goat anti-PKCϵ antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in PBS containing 10% normal donkey serum. After three washes with PBS, the cells were then incubated with donkey fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and covered with coverslips in mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images (1.5-μm optical sections) were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/numerical aperture 1.40 oil immersion objective. Generation of as-PKCϵ—A pCDNA3 plasmid containing N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged, human PKCϵ cDNA was provided by Dr. Alex Toker (Harvard University, Boston, MA) and used as a template to replace Met-486 with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: 5′-GGACCGCCTCTTTTTCGTCGCCGAATATGTAAATGGTGGAGACC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GGTCTCCACCATTTACATATTCGGCGACGAAAAAGAGGCGGTCC-3′ as the reverse primer. The PCR product was treated with DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C and then amplified in Escherichia coli XL 1-Blue. The presence of the M486A mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was transfected into COS-7 cells using the SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). After culture for 72 h, cells were rinsed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates from 50 10-cm plates were pooled and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose (Sigma), previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. Agarose beads were transferred to a column and washed sequentially with 15 ml of lysis buffer, 15 ml of buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 5 ml of PKC storage buffer (0.1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25% glycerol, and 0.03% Triton X-100). To elute FLAG-tagged proteins, the beads were incubated with 1.75 ml of 0.15 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in PKC storage buffer for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 10 s at 10,000 × g. Aliquots of the supernatant were stored at -80 °C. The concentration of PKCϵ in the eluate was measured in triplicate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant PKCϵ (Invitrogen) as a standard, rabbit anti-PKCϵ SN134 (18Choi D.S. Wang D. Dadgar J. Chang W.S. Messing R.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9905-9911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) diluted 1:1,000 as the primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (1:3,500 dilution, Chemicon). Immunoreactivity was detected using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as the substrate with absorbance measured at 450 nm. Characterization of as-PKCϵ—Enzyme activity was measured by fluorescence polarization using the Protein Kinase C Assay Kit from Invitrogen. PKCϵ (0.5 ng) or PKCϵ-M486A (3 ng) was added to kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.03% Triton X-100, 0.1 μg phosphatidylserine, and 0.05 mm sodium vanadate) with 250 nm substrate peptide (RFARKGSLRQKNV) and 12.5 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in a final volume of 40 μl. The mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 5 min in the dark. The kinase reaction was initiated by addition of ATP (1-100 μm) in 10 μl and was stopped after 0-20 min by addition of 1 μl of 0.5 mm staurosporine (Calbiochem) in Me2SO. A 50-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred to a well of a dark-sided 96-well plate and mixed with 50 μl of a solution containing 2× fluorescein-labeled phosphopeptide and 2× anti-phosphoserine antibody, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 30 min at 22 °C in the dark, plane-polarized fluorescence was measured using an Analyst HT (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm. Polarization (P) was calculated by the equation, P = (Ipara - Iperp)/(Ipara + Iperp), where Ipara is the parallel emission fluorescence intensity and Iperp is perpendicular emission fluorescence intensity. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) were calculated from the equation 1/VO = Km/Vmax[S] + 1/Vmax, where VO is the initial velocity of the reaction and [S] is the initial concentration of substrate. The catalytic constant (kcat) was calculated from the equation kcat = Vmax/[E]O, where [E]O is the concentration of enzyme added to the reaction. Stable Transfection of HEK293 Cells with as-PKCϵ—HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK293 cells that stably express rat α1β2γ2S GABAA receptors (21Huang R.Q. Dillon G.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 243-255PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by G. H. Dillon, (University of N. Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX). Human PKCϵ M486A was amplified by PCR and then subcloned without the FLAG-epitope tag into pIRESpuro2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were plated on poly-l-ornithine-coated 6-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well in 2 ml of growth medium (minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mm l-α-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin). The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2:95% air before transfection. Transfection complexes were prepared by mixing 2 μg of plasmid DNA with 6 μl of TransIT-293 reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) in 100 μl of serum-free medium. Complexes were added dropwise to each well, and the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2:95% air. Clones were selected 48 h later in 5 μg/ml puromycin. Medium was replaced daily, and the concentration of puromycin was reduced to 3 μg/ml after 1 week. Expression of PKCϵ or PKCϵ M486A in surviving cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Generation of HEK293 Cells Expressing Mutant GABAA Receptor Subunits—Plasmids containing inserts encoding human α1 and γ2L in pCDM8 were provided by Dr. P. B. Wingrove (Merck Sharp & Dohme, United Kingdom). A pCIS2 plasmid encoding rat β2 was provided by Dr. N. Harrison (Cornell University, New York, NY). Phosphorylation site mutants of β2 (S410A) and γ2L (S327A and S343A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following primers: 5′-CGCCTGAGGAGACGTGCCGCCCAACTGAAAATCACC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GGTGATTTTCAGTTGGGCGGCACGTCTCCTCAGGCG-3′ as the reverse primer for β2S410A; 5′-GTCAGCAACCGGAAACCAGCCAAGGACAAAGATAAAAAGAAGAAAAACCC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GGGTTTTTCTTCTTTTTATCTTTGTCCTTGGCTGGTTTCCGGTTGCTGAC-3′ as the reverse primer for γ2LS327A; 5′-CCTCTTCTTCGGATGTTTGCCTTCAAGGCCCCTACC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GGTAGGGGCCTTGAAGGCAAACATCCGAAGAAGAGG-3′ as the reverse primer for γ2LS343A. Plasmids were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate into HEK293 cells that stably expressed PKCϵ M486A using the TransIT-293 reagent. Cells that expressed functional GABAA receptors were identified by measuring currents evoked by GABA and flunitrazepam using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Electrophysiology of Transfected HEK293 Cells—GABAA receptor currents were measured in HEK293 cells stably transfected with as-PKCϵ and native or mutant GABAA receptors using a conventional whole cell patch clamp technique. The recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA), to achieve a resistance of 5-8 MΩ when filled with pipette solution containing (in mm): 145 N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 2 Mg2+-ATP (pH 7.3, adjusted with HCl). The external solution used to perfuse the cells continuously during the experiment contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 d-glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). To test the effect of inhibiting PKCϵ on GABAA receptor function, cells were incubated with external solution containing 1 μm 1-naphthyl-PP1 (1Na) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 30 min prior to stimulation with GABA. Cells were then voltage-clamped at -75 mV, and the GABA dose-response relationship was determined in the presence or absence of 1 μm 1Na. The response to allosteric modulators was then assessed by co-application of the modulator with an EC20 concentration of GABA. Flunitrazepam was applied 5 s prior to co-application with GABA, and ethanol was co-applied with GABA by local perfusion using a Perfusion Fast-Step SF-77B system (Warner Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT) driven by pClamp 9 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Unless otherwise stated, there was a 1-min washout period between each drug application. Whole cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch amplifier (Axon CNS-Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), filtered at 2 kHz, and digitized at 5 kHz with a Digidata 1322A interface and pClamp 9 software (Axon CNS). The serial resistance was monitored continuously during each experiment, and data from cells that showed a >30% change in resistance were discarded. All recordings were obtained at 27 °C. Electrophysiology of Primary Hippocampal Neurons—Cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared as described above and used at 3-10 days in vitro. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 145 N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg2+-ATP, and 2 Na+-ATP (pH 7.3, adjusted with HCl, 280 mosm). The external solution contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 d-glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). 1 μm tetrodotoxin and 10 μm 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione were freshly added to the external solution each day. All recordings were made at 32 °C. Phosphorylation of GST-γ2 Intracellular Loop Fusion Proteins—A plasmid (provided by R. Olsen, UCLA) containing the cDNA sequence encoding the mouse γ2S large intracellular loop (amino acids 318-404) in pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was used to generate an alanine mutation at Ser-327 with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primers: 5′-GTCAGCAACCGGAAGCCAGCCAAGGATAAAGACAAAAAGAAGAAAAACCC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GGGTTTTTCTTCTTTTTGTCTTTATCCTTGGCTGGCTTCCGGTTGCTGAC-3′ as the reverse primer. BamHI and EcoRI fragments encoding the native and S327A mutant loops were subcloned into pGEX-6P-2 (GE Healthcare). Fusion proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Invitrogen) and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Phosphorylation was performed using 0.1 μm human recombinant PKCϵ (Invitrogen) in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.03% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.48 μg/μl l-α-phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 0.5 mm ATP. PKCϵ was preincubated with kinase buffer for 3 h at 27 °C to stimulate autophosphorylation and thereby maximize the activity of PKCϵ. Then 1.25 pmol of purified GST-γ2S loop or GST-γ2SS327A loop and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. At each time point, 10 μl of reaction mixture were removed and mixed with 2.5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer to stop the reaction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% gradient gels (Invitrogen), and the amount of radioactivity incorporated was quantified by phosphorimaging (Typhoon 9410, GE Healthcare). Specific radioactivity per mole of [γ-32P]ATP was determined by counting diluted aliquots of the stock [γ-32P]ATP solution to obtain a conversion value for calculating the molar ratio of 32P incorporated into each fusion protein substrate. Detection of γ2S327 Phosphorylation by Western Analysis—GST-γ2S loop proteins were phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of non-radioactive ATP. Samples of frontal cortex and hippocampus were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Samples were adjusted to a concentration of 2 mg/ml and some were incubated with 8,000 units of lambda protein phosphatase (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 30 °C for 30 min. Control samples not treated with phosphatase were incubated with Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture 1 (Sigma-Aldrich). Brain lysates, cell lysates, or GST-γ2S loop proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4-12% gradient gels (Invitrogen). The proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using affinity-purified, polyclonal rabbit anti-γ2-S(P)327 antibody (1:1000 dilution) generated against the phosphopeptide 317CLHYFVSNRKPS(P)KDKDK332 (PhosphoSolutions, Aurora, CO), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution, Chemicon) for 1 h at 27 °C. Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by scanning densitometry. Statistical Analysis—Data shown are mean ± S.E. values. Data were first tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Because all data were normally distributed, mean values were compared by either two-tailed, unpaired t-tests or ANOVA with indicated post-hoc tests. Differences between pairs of means were considered significant where p < 0.05. Except where indicated, dose-response relationships were analyzed by non-linear regression analysis using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Potentiation of the GABA response by allosteric modulators was calculated as the ratio of the current elicited by modulator plus GABA divided by the current elicited by GABA alone. Increased Response to Zolpidem in PKCϵ-/- Mice—To determine whether PKCϵ regulates GABAA receptors that contain α1 and γ2 subunits, we first examined behavioral responses in mice that lack PKCϵ. Because behavioral responses to benzodiazepines are increased in these mice (13Hodge C.W. Mehmert K.K. Kelley S.P. McMahon T. Haywood A. Olive M.F. Wang D. Sanchez-Perez A.M. Messing R.O. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we tested their response to zolpidem, an imidazopyridine that selectively acts at the benzodiazepine site on GABAA receptors that contain α1 and γ2 subunits (22Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We found that PKCϵ-/- mice showed greater rotarod ataxia in response to 1 mg/kg zolpidem than wild-type littermates (Fig. 1A). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed main effects of genotype (F1,48 = 5.66, p = 0.044) and time (F6,48 = 11.19, p < 0.001) with an interaction between these factors (F6,48 = 2,87, p = 0.018). The threshold dose of zolpidem for producing ataxia was also lower in PKCϵ-/- mice compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 1B). These differences in behavior were not associated with altered distribution of α1 subunits in the brain (supplemental Fig. S1A), abundance of α1or γ2 subunits in frontal cortex, cerebellum, striatum, or amygdala (supplemental Fig. S1B), or altered cell surface abundance of γ2 subunits (supplemental Fig. S1C) in PKCϵ-/- mice when compared with wild-type littermates. These findings suggest that the function, rather than the abundance, of zolpidem-sensitive GABAA receptors is increased in PKCϵ-/- mice. Consistent with this conclusion, PKCϵ and α1 subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated from frontal cortex of wild-type mice (Fig. 1, C and D) and were co-localized at the cell membrane in cultured hippocampal neurons from wild-type animals (Fig. 1E), indicating that PKCϵ and α1-containing GABAA receptors physically interact in a complex. Generation of an ATP Analog-sensitive Mutant of PKCϵ—PKCϵ can transduce signals by phosphorylation of substrates or by protein-protein interaction. The latter has been demonstrated for PKCϵ-stimulated neurite outgrowth in human neuroblastoma cells (23Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The ϵV1-2 peptide (EAVSLKPT), which was designed as an inhibitor of PKCϵ translocation (24Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), can be used to selectively inhibit PKCϵ. However, because ϵV1-2 does not bind the catalytic domain or inhibit the catalytic activity of PKCϵ, this peptide cannot be used to distinguish between PKCϵ-mediated effects due to protein-protein interactions or phosphorylation. Furthermore, no small molecules are known that specifically inhibit the catalytic activity of PKCϵ over other PKC isozymes, due to the highly conserved ATP binding sites of protein kinases. Therefore, to examine whether PKCϵ-mediated phosphorylation is required for modulation of GABAA receptors, we used a chemical-genetics approach to develop a sele"
https://openalex.org/W2035997627,"Hemes and heme proteins are vital components of essentially every cell of virtually every eukaryote organism. Previously, we demonstrated accumulation of the heme precursor protoporphyrin-IX (PpIX) in gastrointestinal tumor tissues. To elucidate the mechanisms of PpIX accumulation by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we studied expression of the relevant enzymes of the heme synthetic pathway. Here, we describe a significant down-regulation of ferrochelatase (FECH) mRNA expression in gastric, colonic, and rectal carcinomas. Accordingly, in an in vitro model of several carcinoma cell lines, ferrochelatase down-regulation and loss of enzymatic activity corresponded with an enhanced PpIX-dependent fluorescence. Direct detection of PpIX in minute amounts was achieved by a specifically developed pulsed solid-state laser dual delay fluorimetry setup. Silencing of FECH using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology led to a maximum 50-fold increased PpIX accumulation, imageable by a specifically adapted two-photon microscopy unit. Our results show that in malignant tissue a transcriptional down-regulation of FECH occurs, which causes endogenous PpIX accumulation. Furthermore, accumulation of intracellular PpIX because of FECH siRNA silencing provides a small-molecule-based approach to molecular imaging and molecular therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2029063714,"We identified a novel regulator, Thermococcales glycolytic regulator (Tgr), functioning as both an activator and a repressor of transcription in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1. Tgr (TK1769) displays similarity (28% identical) to Pyrococcus furiosus TrmB (PF1743), a transcriptional repressor regulating the trehalose/maltose ATP-binding cassette transporter genes, but is more closely related (67%) to a TrmB paralog in P. furiosus (PF0124). Growth of a tgr disruption strain (Δtgr) displayed a significant decrease in growth rate under gluconeogenic conditions compared with the wild-type strain, whereas comparable growth rates were observed under glycolytic conditions. A whole genome microarray analysis revealed that transcript levels of almost all genes related to glycolysis and maltodextrin metabolism were at relatively high levels in the Δtgr mutant even under gluconeogenic conditions. The Δtgr mutant also displayed defects in the transcriptional activation of gluconeogenic genes under these conditions, indicating that Tgr functions as both an activator and a repressor. Genes regulated by Tgr contain a previously identified sequence motif, the Thermococcales glycolytic motif (TGM). The TGM was positioned upstream of the Transcription factor B-responsive element (BRE)/TATA sequence in gluconeogenic promoters and downstream of it in glycolytic promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that recombinant Tgr protein specifically binds to promoter regions containing a TGM. Tgr was released from the DNA when maltotriose was added, suggesting that this sugar is most likely the physiological effector. Our results strongly suggest that Tgr is a global transcriptional regulator that simultaneously controls, in response to sugar availability, both glycolytic and gluconeogenic metabolism in T. kodakaraensis via its direct binding to the TGM.

Proper control of glycolytic and gluconeogenic activities in the cell is vital for the efficient assimilation of carbon and generation of energy and has been considered a paradigm for metabolic regulation. Stringent regulation is generally observed to avoid futile cycles that potentially lead to the depletion of energy; hence one pathway is suppressed while the other is active. Mechanisms underlying the regulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis have been extensively studied in different bacterial and eukaryotic species. In Escherichia coli, genes involved in these pathways are generally expressed in a constitutive manner (1Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1987: 142-150Google Scholar), and control is brought about predominantly by allosteric regulation of the enzymes themselves. The major sites of allosteric regulation are the two glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase (PFK) 3The abbreviations used are: PFK, phosphofructokinase; FBPase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; EM, Embden-Meyerhof; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; TGM, Thermococcales glycolytic motif; Tgr, Thermococcales glycolytic regulator; ASW, artificial seawater; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; TFB, transcription factor B; TBP, TATA-binding protein; Cra, catabolite repressor/activator; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; DTT, dithiothreitol; Mdx, maltodextrin; Pyr, pyruvate; BRE, Transcription factor B-responsive element.

Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) (4Fraenkel D.G. Pontremoli S. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reactions catalyzed by the three enzymes are irreversible under physiological conditions and are therefore considered key steps in the respective pathways. Besides the allosteric control, recent analyses have also indicated the presence of regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional (5Oh M.-K. Rohlin L. Kao K.C. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13175-13183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and post-transcriptional levels (6Romeo T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a number of mechanisms involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis regulation have been identified (for a review, see Ref. 7Gonçalves P. Planta R.J. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 314-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar to the PFK, FBPase, and pyruvate kinase from E. coli, the S. cerevisiae enzymes also display allosteric properties. In eukaryotes, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a major allosteric effector of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis; it is an activator of PFK and an inhibitor of FBPase. Allosteric activation of PFK by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate leads to an increase in the concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which in turn activates pyruvate kinase, thereby further increasing the glycolytic flux. In addition, genes encoding the three enzymes as well as the gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase are controlled in response to the presence or absence of glucose at the transcription level. Furthermore a transition from a gluconeogenic to glycolytic environment triggers rapid inactivation of FBPase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase via protein phosphorylation and specific proteolysis. Although studies on the metabolic regulation in Archaea are still in the initial phase, valuable insight has been obtained on the control of the glycolytic pathway in a number of archaeal strains including those of the Thermococcales and Thermoproteales (for reviews, see Refs. 8Verhees C.H.

Thermoproteus tenax, a member of the Thermoproteales that exhibits both autotrophic and heterotrophic modes of growth, utilizes a variant of the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway as well as the semi- and non-phosphorylating Entner-Doudoroff pathways for glycolysis (10Siebers B. Tjaden B. Michalke K. Dörr C. Ahmed H. Zaparty M. Gordon P. Sensen C.W. Zibat A. Klenk H.-P. Schuster S.C. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2179-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The variant EM pathway is characterized by the absence of allosteric control in the reactions of the PPi-dependent PFK and pyruvate kinase. Instead transcriptional and allosteric regulation is observed for the enzymes involved in the conversion between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and 3-phosphoglycerate (11Lorentzen E. Hensel R.

Hensel R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Thermococcales order is composed of two major genera, Pyrococcus and Thermococcus, and its members are hyperthermophilic, anaerobic sulfur reducers that display growth on complex proteinaceous substrates (15Itoh T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2003; 96: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Some members of this order can also grow on carbohydrates using a modified EM pathway (16Kengen S.W.M. de Bok F.A.M. van Loo N.-D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. de Vos W.M. J. Biol.

Pyrococcus furiosus is one of the most studied species of the Thermococcales and is capable of growth on a variety of sugars including maltose, starch, cellobiose, and laminarin. The level of activity of enzymes present in the modified EM pathway is generally higher in P. furiosus cells grown on sugars (glycolytic conditions) compared with cells grown on peptides or pyruvate (gluconeogenic conditions) (20van der Oost J.

Allosteric regulation has not been observed in the enzymes characterized so far in the modified EM and gluconeogenic pathways of the Thermococcales, and therefore, the regulation of enzyme activity is presumed to be primarily at the transcriptional level (24Schut G.J. Brehm S.D. Datta S. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3935-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a potential cis-regulatory element (TATCACN5GTGATA) in the glycolytic promoters of P. furiosus (25van de Werken H.J.G. Verhees C.H. Akerboom J. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 260: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This putative element was not found in Pyrococcus species that have a significantly lower capacity to metabolize sugars (Pyrococcus abyssi and Pyrococcus horikoshii); however, nearly identical motifs are present in the glycolytic and starch-utilizing promoters of the sugar-metabolizing Thermococcales. The sequence motif was thus designated Thermococcales glycolytic motif (TGM). Thermococcus kodakaraensis is a member of the Thermococcales and grows between 60 and 100 °C with an optimum at 85 °C (26Atomi H. Fukui T. Kanai T. Morikawa M. Imanaka T.

Both glycolytic (starch or maltodextrin) and gluconeogenic (peptides or pyruvate) modes of growth are observed for this archaeon, and the TGM sequences are found on most of the glycolytic and starch-utilizing gene promoters (25van de Werken H.J.G.

In this study, we characterized a gene (TK1769) disruption mutant of a putative transcriptional regulator in T. kodakaraensis. Whole genome microarray analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay strongly suggest that TK1769 encodes a transcriptional regulation factor controlling both the glycolytic (modified EM) and gluconeogenic pathways via binding to the TGM motif present in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic genes. The protein is therefore designated Tgr for Thermococcales glycolytic regulator. Microorganisms and Culture Conditions—For general DNA manipulation and sequencing, E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen) was used. For recombinant production of Tgr, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing the tRNA accessory plasmid pRIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. E. coli cells were cultivated at 37 °C in LB medium (10 g liter-1 tryptone, 5 g liter-1 yeast extract, and 10 g liter-1 NaCl) supplemented with either ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) when necessary. T. kodakaraensis strains were routinely cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 85 °C using a nutrient rich medium (MA-YT) or a synthetic medium (ASW-AA). The MA-YT-based medium contained synthetic sea salts (Marine Art SF; Tomita Pharmaceutical, Tokushima, Japan), yeast extract, and tryptone as described previously (34Kanai T. Imanaka H. Nakajima A. Uwamori K. Omori Y. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Biotechnol. 2005; 116: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The ASW-AA-based medium contained artificial seawater (ASW), vitamin mixture, modified Wolfeŉs trace minerals, and 20 amino acids as described previously (26Atomi H. Fukui T. Kanai T. Morikawa M. Imanaka T. Archaea. 2004; 1: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 35Robb F.T. Place A.R. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual—Thermophiles. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 167-168Google Scholar). As members in the Thermococcales are reported to have several tungstoenzymes (36Kletzin A. Adams M.W.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 5-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NaWO4·2H2O was also added to ASW-AA medium at a final concentration of 10 μm. Construction of the T. kodakaraensis Δtgr Strain—Disruption of the Tgr gene (TK1769, tgr) by double crossover homologous recombination was performed using the gene disruption system developed for T. kodakaraensis (28Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The plasmid used for disruption of tgr was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the tgr-coding region together with its flanking regions (about 1,000 bp) was amplified with the primer set TGR-L1 (5′-CGGTTATCACTTTCACGTTC-3′) and TGR-R2 (5′-GGTGGAAAACGCCGTCGAGT-3′) using genomic DNA of T. kodakaraensis KOD1 as a template and inserted into the HincII site of pUC118. Using the constructed plasmid DNA as a template, the flanking regions of tgr along with the plasmid backbone were amplified using the primer set TGR-L2 (5′-CCCATCATTTTTAATTTCTA-3′) and TGR-R1 (5′-CCAAAGACATTTAAGTTCAC-3′). The amplified fragment was ligated with a PvuII-PvuII restriction fragment (763 bp) containing the pyrF marker gene excised from pUD2 (29Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmid for tgr disruption (pUTGR). A T. kodakaraensis uracil auxotroph strain, KU216 (29Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), was used as the host strain for transformation. After transformation, a pyrF+ strain exhibiting uracil prototrophy was selected. The genotype of the tgr locus was confirmed by PCR amplification using the primer set tgr-US1 (5′-TACCGTTGAAGACGTGGG-3′) and tgr-DS2 (5′-GCGTCAAGCCTGAATGGTGC-3′). Genotypes were also confirmed by Southern blot analyses. Two micrograms of genomic DNA from KU216 and Δtgr were digested with PstI, separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane Hybond™-N+ (GE Healthcare). The preparation of specific probes, hybridization, and signal detection were performed with the DIG DNA Labeling and Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The constructed Δtgr strain was designated KGR1. Growth Measurements—Growth characteristics of wild-type cells (strain KOD1) and Δtgr mutant cells (strain KGR1) were determined as follows. Each strain was precultured in MA-YT medium supplemented with elemental sulfur (S0) (0.2%, w/v) at 85 °C for 10 h. S0 is required by T. kodakaraensis during growth on peptides or amino acids (26Atomi H. Fukui T. Kanai T. Morikawa M. Imanaka T. Archaea. 2004; 1: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). After the preculture, cells were inoculated into MA-YT medium supplemented either with S0 (0.5%, w/v) (MA-YT-S0), sodium pyruvate (0.5%, w/v) (MA-YT-Pyr), or maltodextrin (0.5%, w/v) (MA-YT-Mdx). As a source of maltodextrin, Amycol number 3-L (Nippon Starch Chemical, Osaka, Japan), which consists of maltooligosaccharides of 1–12 glucose units, was used. Growth characteristics of KOD1 and KGR1 cells were also determined in synthetic ASW-AA medium containing S0 (0.2%, w/v) (ASW-AA-S0), S0 (0.2%, w/v) and sodium pyruvate (0.5%, w/v) (ASW-AA-S0-Pyr), or S0 (0.2%, w/v) and maltodextrin (0.5%, w/v) (ASW-AA-S0-Mdx). Cell densities (A660) were recorded at appropriate intervals with a UV spectrometer Ultraspec 3300 pro (GE Healthcare). Microarray Analysis—The microarray plate used in this study (Array Tko1) was manufactured at Takara Bio (Otsu, Japan) and covers 2,226 genes among the total predicted 2,306 genes of T. kodakaraensis KOD1 (96.5% coverage). DNA fragments of about 300 bp, corresponding to the 3′-terminal regions of each coding region, were spotted on the glass plate. Two identical sets (left and right) were loaded on each plate. Therefore, two sets of data are obtained from each microarray plate. In the data files, individual signal intensity ratios obtained from each set as well as the average ratio value and the S.D. are shown. T. kodakaraensis KOD1 and KGR1 were cultivated at 85 °C in MA-YT-S0, MA-YT-Pyr, or MA-YT-Mdx medium. Cells were harvested in the early log phase (A660 ≈ 0.2), and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Fluorescently labeled cDNA used for hybridization was prepared using the RNA Fluorescence Labeling Core kit version 2.0 (Takara Bio). Total RNA (10 μg) was annealed with random hexamers, and reverse transcription was performed in solutions containing CyDye-labeled dUTP (Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP) (GE Healthcare). RNA was subsequently degraded with RNase H, and the labeled cDNA was purified using a column supplied in the kit according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. The labeled cDNA was dissolved in hybridization buffer (30 μl) containing 6× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.2% SDS, 5× Denhardtŉs solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed under a coverslip (Spaced Cover Glass XL, Takara Bio) in a humidity chamber at 65 °C for 12–15 h. After hybridization, the microarray plates were washed four times with 2× SSC and 0.2% SDS at 55 °C for 5 min, rinsed in 0.05× SSC, and dried by centrifugation. The intensities of the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were measured by using an Affymetrix 428 Array Scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The microarray images were analyzed using ImaGene version 5.5 software (BioDiscovery, Marina Del Ray, CA). Recombinant Production of Tgr in E. coli—The tgr gene of T. kodakaraensis KOD1 was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using Pfu TURBO polymerase (Stratagene) by standard methods. Primers used were BG2072 (5′-GGGCGGCGCATATGAGGGAAGACGAGATAATTG-3′) and BG2073 (5′-GCCGCCGGATCCTCACTCAAGGAGGATGAACTT-3′) (NdeI and BamHI sites are underlined). BG2073 contained a stop codon to ensure overexpression of Tgr without a histidine tag to prevent interference during DNA binding assays. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated in pET26b (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid was named pWUR278. The QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) was used for plasmid purification. The correct sequence of the construct was verified (Baseclear, Leiden, The Netherlands). Overexpression of Tgr was achieved by induction of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pRIL cells harboring pWUR278. A 1.5-liter culture was grown until A600 ≈ 0.5, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 15 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested and centrifuged (20 min at 5000 × g at 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and disrupted by sonication at 0 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (30 min at 26,000 × g at 2 °C). Ten millimolar MgCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added, and the cell-free extract was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. DNase I and contaminating E. coli proteins were denatured by a subsequent heat treatment (20 min at 80 °C) and removed by centrifugation (30 min at 26,000 × g at 2 °C). Resulting heat-stable cell-free extract was slowly mixed with 5 ml of cross-linked agarose-heparin resin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 60 min. After mixing, the resin was allowed to settle in a 10-ml syringe. Contaminant proteins were eluted by washing the resin with 10 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Tgr was eluted in elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Partial desalting of the sample was accomplished by dialysis to lysis buffer at 4 °C for 16 h after which the sample was loaded on a Mono Q Column (pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer) (GE Healthcare). Tgr was eluted in a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl in lysis buffer. Samples containing Tgr were collected, pooled, and dialyzed to lysis buffer at 4 °C for 16 h. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Promoter sequences of 100 bp of the ADP-dependent PFK (pfk, TK0376), FBPase (fbp, TK2164), and archaeal histone A (hpkA, TK1413) were PCR-amplified using primers BG2113 (5′-GGCCGGCTGCAGTTTCACGGAGTACTGACTTTTC-3′) and BG2114 (5′-CGGCCGGCATATGTATCACCCTCAGTGACTAA-3′), BG2117 (5′-GGCCGGCTGCAGCCGCTTCTATCACCTTCGAA-3′) and BG2118 (5′-CCGGGCCCATATGAACCACCGGTATTTTTAACCTC-3′), and BG2115 (5′-GGCCGGCTGCAGTTCGTTGTTAGACCCTGAGAA-3′) and BG2116 (5′-CGGCCGGCATATGCAACACCTCCTTAAAGGGCT-3′), respectively. The PCR-amplified pfk and fbp promoter fragments contained the TGM (25van de Werken H.J.G. Verhees C.H. Akerboom J. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 260: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) and radioactively end-labeled with 32P with phosphonucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Unincorporated label was removed by the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), 43 nm Tgr was incubated with 0.2 pmol of labeled DNA in 15 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), pH 7.5) at 70 °C for 30 min. Different concentrations of possible carbohydrate ligands (analytical grade) were added as indicated in the text. After incubation, samples were allowed to cool to room temperature for 3 min and loaded onto a prerun 4% native PAGE gel. Gels were run in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 15 mA, 200 V at room temperature until satisfactory migration. TK1769 Encodes a Protein Similar to TrmB—TrmB is an archaeal transcriptional regulator involved in sugar metabolism originally identified in Thermococcus litoralis (37Lee S.-J. Engelmann A. Horlacher R. Qu Q. Vierke G. Hebbeln C. Thomm M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have indicated that in the absence of trehalose or maltose TrmB blocks transcription of the trehalose/maltose ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter operon, in which the TrmB gene itself is included, through the direct binding to its promoter region. In the presence of trehalose or maltose, TrmB is released from the promoter region, resulting in subsequent transcriptional initiation. A nearly identical trehalose/maltose ABC transporter operon (PF1739–PF1744, including a TrmB ortholog) is also present on the genome of P. furiosus that was proposed to be the result of lateral gene transfer (38DiRuggiero J. Dunn D. Maeder D.L. Holley-Shanks R. Chatard J. Horlacher R. Robb F.T. Boos W. Weiss R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent in vitro analysis of P. furiosus TrmB (encoded by PF1743) indicated a dual function of this protein; it regulates not only the trehalose/maltose ABC transporter operon but also the maltodextrin ABC transporter operon (PF1938–PF1933) (39Lee S.-J. Moulakakis C. Koning S.M. Hausner W. Thomm M. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1797-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The latter transporter functions in the uptake of maltooligosaccharides with three or more glucose units (40Koning S.M. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J.M. Archaea. 2002; 1: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). T. kodakaraensis contains neither an ortholog of TrmB nor that of a trehalose/maltose ABC transporter but contains an ortholog corresponding to the maltodextrin ABC transporter (TK1771–TK1775). This is consistent with the fact that maltotriose and longer oligomers, including starch, can support the growth of T. kodakaraensis, whereas maltose cannot. Despite the absence of a TrmB ortholog, two TrmB-like genes (paralogs TK0471 and TK1769) are present on the T. kodakaraensis genome. Orthologous genes corresponding to TK0471 are present on all of the four sequenced genomes of the Thermococcales, whereas TK1769 orthologs are found only in P. furiosus (PF0124) and T. kodakaraensis. We speculated previously (25van de Werken H.J.G. Verhees C.H. Akerboom J. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 260: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that the latter TrmB-like gene might encode the transcriptional regulator responsible for controlling the sugar metabolism in T. kodakaraensis. This was because (i) a TrmB ortholog is absent in T. kodakaraensis, (ii) the TK1769 orthologs are present only in the sugar-metabolizing Thermococcales species, and (iii) the TK1769 gene is located adjacent to the maltodextrin ABC transporter operon on the T. kodaka"
https://openalex.org/W2032153614,"Undifferentiated and poorly differentiated thyroid tumors are responsible for more than half of thyroid cancer patient deaths in spite of their low incidence. Conventional treatments do not obtain substantial benefits, and the lack of alternative approaches limits patient survival. Additionally, the absence of prognostic markers for well-differentiated tumors complicates patient-specific treatments and favors the progression of recurrent forms. In order to recognize the molecular basis involved in tumor dedifferentiation and identify potential markers for thyroid cancer prognosis prediction, we analysed the expression profile of 44 thyroid primary tumors with different degrees of dedifferentiation and aggressiveness using cDNA microarrays. Transcriptome comparison of dedifferentiated and well-differentiated thyroid tumors identified 1031 genes with >2-fold difference in absolute values and false discovery rate of <0.15. According to known molecular interaction and reaction networks, the products of these genes were mainly clustered in the MAPkinase signaling pathway, the TGF-β signaling pathway, focal adhesion and cell motility, activation of actin polymerization and cell cycle. An exhaustive search in several databases allowed us to identify various members of the matrix metalloproteinase, melanoma antigen A and collagen gene families within the upregulated gene set. We also identified a prognosis classifier comprising just 30 transcripts with an overall accuracy of 95%. These findings may clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in thyroid tumor dedifferentiation and provide a potential prognosis predictor as well as targets for new therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2119228893,"We explored whether exposure of mammalian germ line stem cells to adeno-associated virus (AAV), a gene therapy vector, would lead to stable transduction and transgene transmission. Mouse germ cells harvested from experimentally induced cryptorchid donor testes were exposed in vitro to AAV vectors carrying a GFP transgene and transplanted to germ cell-depleted syngeneic recipient testes, resulting in colonization of the recipient testes by transgenic donor cells. Mating of recipient males to wild-type females yielded 10% transgenic offspring. To broaden the approach to nonrodent species, AAV-transduced germ cells from goats were transplanted to recipient males in which endogenous germ cells had been depleted by fractionated testicular irradiation. Transgenic germ cells colonized recipient testes and produced transgenic sperm. When semen was used for in vitro fertilization (IVF), 10% of embryos were transgenic. Here, we report for the first time that AAV-mediated transduction of mammalian germ cells leads to transmission of the transgene through the male germ line. Equally important, this is also the first report of transgenesis via germ cell transplantation in a nonrodent species, a promising approach to generate transgenic large animal models for biomedical research."

Analysis of LH3 knock-out embryos and cells in this work indicated that loss of glycosylated hydroxylysines prevents the intracellular tetramerization of type VI collagen and leads to impaired secretion of type IV and VI collagens. Mice lacking the LH activity of LH3 produced slightly underglycosylated type IV and VI collagens with abnormal distribution. The altered distribution and aggregation of type VI collagen led to similar ultrastructural alterations in muscle to those detected in collagen VI knockout and some Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy patients.

Type IV and VI collagens are highly hydroxylated and glycosylated, whereas fibrillar collagens, especially types I and III, have much lower levels of these modifications (1Kivirikko K.I. Bittar E.E. Bittar N. Greenwich C.T. Principles of Medical Biology: Cellular Organelles and the Extracellular Matrix. JAI Press Ltd., Middlesex, UK1995: 233-254Google Scholar, 17Chu M.-L. Conway D. Pan T.C.

Academic Press Ltd., London2002: 211-223Crossref Google Scholar), but the function of the glycosylation of the hydroxylysyl residues is still poorly understood. The role of glycosylated hydroxylysines in the formation and morphology of collagen fibrils has been debated (21Torre-Blanco A. Adachi E. Hojima Y. Wootton J.A. Minor R.R. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K. Robins S.P. Risteli M. Aszodi A. Fässler R. Myllylä R. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We produced previously three different mouse lines with a manipulated LH3 gene (16Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K. Robins S.P. Risteli M. Aszodi A.

The mice with no or a very low level of the LH3 protein, thus lacking the lysyl hydroxylase and glucosyltransferase activities of LH3, had an embryonic lethal phenotype. The mouse line (LH mutant) with a point mutation that specifically destroys the LH activity of LH3 without affecting glycosyltransferase activities (11Heikkinen J. Risteli M. Wang C. Latvala J.

In this study, we used LH3 knock-out and LH mutant mice and fibroblasts derived from them as a model to investigate the functions of glycosylated hydroxylysines of collagens. This work provides new information about the function of hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrates of collagens, indicating that they play an important role in the secretion of type IV collagen and in the tetramerization and secretion of type VI collagen and also affect the assembly and distribution of these collagen types. LH3-manipulated Mice—The production of the LH3 knock-out and LH mutant mice has been described previously (16Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K.

Isolation of Embryonic Mouse Fibroblast and Newborn Mouse Skin Fibroblast Cell Lines—Embryos from heterozygous LH3 knock-out crosses were used to derive embryonic mouse fibroblasts. Embryonic day 8.5 wild-type and LH3 knock-out embryos were dissected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and placed in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Promo-Cell), penicillin and streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid in 24-well plates. After several days in culture, the cells were trypsinized and transferred to 35- and 100-mm culture dishes, and culture was continued in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Embryonic mouse fibroblasts became spontaneously immortalized after several weeks in culture. The skin of the homozygous newborn LH mutant and wild-type mice was dissected; sliced; washed with PBS; and placed in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid under coverslips. The skin cells were cultured as described above for embryonic mouse fibroblasts. The genotype of the cells was confirmed by PCR as described previously (16Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K. Robins S.P. Risteli M. Aszodi A. Fässler R. Myllylä R. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—The cells were washed, scraped into homogenization buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and disrupted by brief sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The proteins were separated by 7.5 or 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with rabbit anti-type I or VI collagen antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.), rat anti-mouse α2(IV) collagen NC1 domain monoclonal antibody (H22) (23Sado Y. Kagawa M. Kishiro Y. Sugihara K. Naito I. Seyer J.M. Sugimoto M. Ooshashi T. Ninomiya Y. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 104: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), or mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (P.A.R.I.S), anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or anti-rat IgG (Dako). Immunocomplexes were visualized using ECL or ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of soluble protein were loaded onto the gel. The sizes of the collagen chains were determined by comparison with molecular mass standards. Immunofluorescence Staining—For collagen staining, cells were fixed with 95% ethanol and 5% acetic acid, and for other stainings, with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% saponin in PBS, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-type I or VI collagen antibody, rabbit anti-mouse type IV collagen antibody (Chemicon International), rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (StressGen), or mouse anti-GM130 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Cycloheximide Treatment—LH3 knock-out and wild-type embryonic mouse fibroblasts were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 h in serum-free culture medium, and cells and medium were collected after each time point. Cell lysates and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated medium proteins were used for immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence staining were performed as described above. Quantification of type IV collagen and α-tubulin at different time points was performed with ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). Collagen amounts were normalized with α-tubulin at each time point and calculated as a percentage of total collagen in untreated (0 h) samples. Type VI Collagen Biosynthetic Labeling and Analysis—Biosynthetic labeling of embryonic mouse fibroblasts and newborn skin fibroblasts and immunoprecipitation of type VI collagen with rabbit anti-mouse recombinant α3(VI) collagen N1 subdomain antibody were done as described previously (24Baker N.L. Morgelin M. Peat R. Goemans N. North K.N. Bateman J.F. Lamande S.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—The tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS or in 10% neutral formalin overnight and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistological staining, the embryos and tissues were fixed in 95% ethanol and 5% acetic acid overnight and processed for paraffin embedding. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-type I or VI collagen and rabbit anti-mouse type IV collagen polyclonal antibodies. The primary antibody was detected with fluorescently labeled Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Transmission and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Samples for transmission electron microscopy (EM) were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon 812/EMbed 812. Thin sections were cut with a Reichert Ultracut ultramicrotome. For immuno-EM, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 2.5% sucrose. They were then immersed in 2.3 m sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunolabeling, thin cryosections were incubated with rabbit anti-type I, anti-mouse type IV, or anti-type VI collagen antibody or anti-mouse decorin antibody (LF-113) (25Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and then with a protein A-gold complex. Sections were examined under a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. The calculations and measurements were done using the skin of three newborn LH mutant and control mice. The amounts of type IV collagen immunocomplexes were calculated from 180 10-μm2 areas, and distances between the complexes were measured 400 times from both genotypes. Statistical analysis was performed using Studentŉs t test. The Lysyl Residues of Collagens Are Insufficiently Modified in Homozygous LH3 Knock-out Embryonic Fibroblasts—The collagens produced by LH3 knock-out embryos were characterized using embryonic fibroblasts isolated from homozygous embryonic day 8.5 LH3 knock-out embryos. Immunoblots of type I, IV, and VI collagens showed that the collagens produced by LH3 knock-out fibroblasts migrated faster upon SDS-PAGE compared with the wild-type polypeptides (Fig. 1). The number of lost glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysyl residues was calculated using the theoretical molecular mass of 360 Da and the size difference of each collagen chain determined from the immunoblot. The size differences between the wild-type and LH3 knock-out collagens were 6.7 and 4.4 kDa for the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen chains, respectively; 14.6 kDa for the α2(IV) collagen chain; and 4.2 kDa for the α1/α2(VI) collagen chain. The determined size differences between the wild-type and LH3 knock-out collagens correspond approximately to the calculated loss of 17, 11, 40, and 10 glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysyl residues in the LH3 knock-out α1(I), α2(I), α2(IV), and α1/α2(VI) collagen chains, respectively. The size difference between the wild-type and the LH3 knock-out type IV collagens corresponds to the previously published type IV collagen glycosylation content, whereas the size difference of type I collagen exceeds earlier observations of type I collagen glycosylation, probably because of the higher level of glycosylation of embryonic collagens (18Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1979; 8: 23-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of hydroxylysines and glycosylated hydroxylysines in embryonic mouse type I collagen chains is not known, but the α1(I) and α2(I) chains contain 24 and 21 lysines, respectively, in the Y-position, which can be hydroxylated and glycosylated. The size of the LH3 knock-out type VI collagen corresponds to the previously published type VI collagen lacking all the post-translational modifications of prolyl and lysyl residues (26Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The immunoblot data thus suggest that the smaller size of the collagens is due to the total loss of hydroxylysine glycosylations in the LH3 knock-out cells. In addition, the results show that the LH3 knock-out fibroblasts have less type I and IV collagens than the wild-type fibroblasts; especially the amount of type IV collagen was clearly decreased in the LH3 knock-out cells. Similarly, the LH3 knock-out embryos also had a lower amount of type IV collagen than the wild-type embryos (see below). The Secretion of Type IV Collagen Is Disrupted in LH3 Knock-out Embryos—Immuno-EM revealed abnormal type IV collagen localization in the LH3 knock-out mice. In the embryos, most of the gold particles were retained inside cells in different parts of the secretory pathway (data not shown). In the extracellular space, no aggregates and only very few individual gold particles were seen, but not in the basement membrane zone. It is also noteworthy that the total amount (both intra- and extracellular gold particles) of type IV collagen was lower in the LH3 knock-out embryos than in the wild-type embryos (data not shown). The accumulation of type IV collagen disturbed the secretion machinery of the cells, which was seen as a dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum and a condensed Golgi structure (data not shown). Type IV and VI Collagens Are Abnormally Distributed in LH3 Knock-out Fibroblasts—The distribution of collagens was further studied with embryonic mouse fibroblasts. Upon immunofluorescence staining, the LH3 knock-out fibroblasts showed mainly intracellular localization of type IV and VI collagens, and only a few extracellular structures were found. The data suggest defective secretion of type IV and VI collagens. In addition, the staining intensity was lower in the LH3 knock-out cells than in the wild-type cells, indicating decreased amounts of these collagen types (data not shown). The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi staining of LH3 knock-out cells was comparable with that of controls (data not shown). Type IV Collagen Is Abnormally Secreted from LH3 Knock-out Fibroblasts—The secretion of type IV collagen was studied in the wild-type and LH3 knock-out fibroblasts by blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide. In the wild-type fibroblasts, the amount of type IV collagen decreased in cells and increased in the medium during treatment (Fig. 2A). A low amount of type IV collagen was detected in the cycloheximide-treated LH3 knock-out cells, but none at all in the medium, suggesting that most of the unglycosylated type IV collagen was degraded intracellularly. The amount of type IV collagen decreased rapidly in the LH3 knock-out cells after 1 h of cycloheximide treatment, probably because of rapid intracellular degradation. LH3 knock-out cells also showed prolonged intracellular accumulation of type IV collagen compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that, because of deficient glycosylation, processing of type IV collagen is delayed after translation, which leads to its intracellular accumulation and delayed secretion. Our data also suggest that unglycosylated type IV collagen is degraded inside the cells, which also explains its decreased amount in LH3 knock-out cells and embryos. Tetramerization and Secretion of Type VI Collagen Are Disturbed in LH3 Knock-out Fibroblasts—Tetramerization and secretion of type VI collagen were studied in embryonic mouse fibroblasts by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. It has been shown previously that type VI collagen tetramers are formed inside the cells and are then secreted into the extracellular space (26Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1994Google Scholar). Strikingly, no type VI collagen tetramers were detected in the LH3 knock-out cells or medium (Fig. 2D), indicating that unglycosylated type VI collagen cannot form tetramers. Because type VI collagen tetramers were not formed, the secretion of type VI collagen was also disrupted in LH3 knock-out fibroblasts. Therefore, only low amounts of α1(VI) and α2(VI) collagen chains were secreted into the medium (Fig. 2C). Some Lysyl Residues of Collagens Lack Modifications in LH Mutant Skin Fibroblasts—Skin fibroblasts were isolated from the newborn LH mutant and control mice to analyze the function of LH activity of LH3 in collagens. The LH mutant mice lacked the LH activity of LH3 but had normal glucosyltransferase activity and normal amounts of LH1 and LH2. The immunoblots of collagens demonstrated that highly glycosylated type IV (data not shown) and VI collagens of LH mutant skin fibroblasts migrated slightly faster than collagens from normal skin fibroblasts. The size difference between the collagens produced by mutant and control cells was best seen in type VI collagen, this difference being 1.4 kDa (Fig. 3A). This indicates that some hydroxylysines and subsequent glycosylations are missing despite normal glucosyltransferase activity. The difference suggests that normal levels of LH1 and LH2 do not fully compensate for the LH activity of LH3. Type VI Collagen Tetramers Are Formed in LH Mutant Fibroblasts—The secretion and tetramerization of type VI collagen were analyzed in skin fibroblasts by metabolic labeling. The secretion of individual type VI collagen chains (Fig. 3B) and tetramerization of type VI collagen (Fig. 3C) showed no obvious abnormalities in the LH mutant compared with the control. Type VI Collagen Is Abnormally Distributed in the Skin of LH Mutant Mice—Because the LH mutant mice show disorganized collagen fibrils and loose packing of collagen bundles in newborn skin (16Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K. Robins S.P. Risteli M. Aszodi A. Fässler R. Myllylä R. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the distribution of different molecules affecting the organization of collagen fibrils was analyzed in the skin of newborn mice by immuno-EM. The distributions of type I collagen (Fig. 4, A and B) and decorin (data not shown) were similar in the LH mutant and control skin. Nevertheless, the distribution of type VI collagen was abnormal in the LH mutants. Type VI collagen was detected on the surface of the collagen fibrils in both the LH mutant (Fig. 4D) and control (Fig. 4C) skin, but in the LH mutant skin, it was less evenly distributed. The most striking defect in the LH mutant skin was the extensive aggregation of type VI collagen in the extracellular space (Fig. 4F). In addition, some individual gold particles or aggregates of type VI collagen were seen inside the cells (Fig. 4F). No aggregates or intracellular accumulation of type VI collagen was seen in the controls (Fig. 4E). The Amount of Type IV Collagen Is Reduced in the Skin of LH Mutant Mice—Because the LH mutant mice show thinning of the epidermal lamina densa (16Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K. Robins S.P. Risteli M. Aszodi A. Fässler R. Myllylä R. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the distribution of type IV collagen was also studied. Type IV collagen was detected in the epidermal basement membrane in the newborn mice, but the amount was significantly (p < 0.0001) lower in the LH mutant mice than in the wild-type mice. In the LH mutant mice, there were 0.72 ± 0.79 gold particles in 10 μm2 of lamina densa, whereas in the wild-type mice, there were 1.32 ± 0.87. The decreased amount of type IV collagen was seen as an uneven distribution of type IV collagen having longer distances between individual gold particles compared with the wild-type skin. No prominent aggregation of type IV collagen was detected in the mutant or wild-type skin. Type IV and VI Collagens Are Unevenly Distributed in Muscle and the Muscular Basement Membrane Is Detached in LH Mutant Mice—Although the immunohistochemical staining of type I, IV, and VI collagens in the skeletal muscle of adult LH mutant mice was comparable with that of wild-type mice, the distributions of these collagens were analyzed in the muscle of 18-week-old mice by immuno-EM. The data show a normal distribution of type I collagen (data not shown), but the distribution of type IV and VI collagens was altered in LH mutant muscle, as in skin. Type IV collagen was located continuously in the muscular basement membrane of the controls (Fig. 5A), whereas the distribution was uneven in the LH mutants (Fig. 5B). In LH mutant muscle, type VI collagen was unevenly distributed and heavily aggregated in the extracellular space (Fig. 5D) compared with wild-type muscle (Fig. 5C), resembling the findings in skin. Interestingly, immuno-EM analyses revealed alterations also in the muscular basement membrane. In wild-type muscle, the basement membrane was tightly bound to the sarcolemma of the muscle fibers, whereas in LH mutant muscle, it was more distant from the muscle fibers and detached in many places (Fig. 5B). The Ultrastructure of the Skeletal Muscle Is Abnormal in LH Mutant Mice—The skeletal muscle of 18-week-old mice was analyzed by hematoxylin/eosin staining. Only a few mild alterations in the structure of muscle were observed; some of the muscle fibers were less organized in LH mutant muscle compared with wild-type muscle. However, when the ultrastructure of muscles was analyzed by EM, alterations were observed in the structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of LH mutant skeletal muscle. The sarcoplasmic reticulum showed dilatations and vacuolization, and the mitochondria were swollen in the LH mutant muscles (Fig. 5F), and these alterations were not detected in the wild-type muscles (Fig. 5E). The function of glycosylated hydroxylysines of collagenous proteins is currently not well understood. In this study, we have demonstrated by immunoblot analysis that the multifunctional LH3 enzyme catalyzes the glycosylation of hydroxylysines in several collagen types, and LH3 knock-out mice and cells thus provide a good model to study the function of glycosylated hydroxylysines. We have shown previously that loss of LH3 leads to disruptio"

We used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to monitor the association of RARγ, retinoic X receptor (RXR) α, and coregulators with the RARβ2, Hoxa1, and Cyp26A1 retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in F9 wild type and RARα, -β2, and -γ null cells. Additionally we quantitatively monitored expression of the corresponding mRNAs. We demonstrated that the association of RARγ and/or RXRα with a RARE was not sufficient for retinoic acid (RA)-mediated transcription of the corresponding target gene. However, the ability of RARγ and/or RXRα to recruit pCIP (AIB1/ACTR/RAC-3/TRAM-1/SRC-3) and p300 to a RARE did correlate with RA-associated transcription of target mRNAs. Therefore, the specific functions of the RAR isotypes do not manifest at the level of their DNA binding but rather from a differential ability to recruit specific components of the transcriptional machinery. We also demonstrated that RA-mediated displacement of the polycomb group protein SUZ12 from a RARE was inhibited in the absence of RARγ. Thus, transcriptional components of the RAR signaling pathway are specifically required for displacement of SUZ12 from RAREs during RA-mediated differentiation of F9 cells.

In addition, for each RAR isotype, there are several isoforms generated by differential promoter usage and splicing (3Germain P. Chambon P. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Lazar M.A. Leid M. De Lera A.R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32565-32568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptor corepressor and SMRT are found in repressor complexes containing the histone deacetylase HDAC3 (10Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li J. Wang J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar).The F9 murine embryonal carcinoma cell line has been extensively used as a cell autonomous model system to study RA signaling. F9 cells resemble the pluripotent stem cells of the inner cell mass of the early embryo and differentiate into three distinct extraembryonic (primitive, parietal, and visceral) endodermal cell types upon treatment with RA, depending on the cell culture conditions (12Damjanov I. Solter D. Sherman M. Solter D Teratomas and Differentiation. Academic Press, New York1975: 209-220Google Scholar). F9 cells express all known RA receptors, but RARβ2 mRNA is only present in high amounts after RA addition (13Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Specific functions for each of the RARs have been demonstrated through the use of F9 cells in which each of the individual RARs has been knocked out by homologous recombination as well as through the use of synthetic isotype-selective ligands. F9 RAR null cells exhibit marked modulation of a variety of genes when compared with the F9 wild type (Wt) cells. For example, the RA-mediated transcription of the homeobox gene Hoxa1 is specifically regulated by RARγ because the RA-induced expression of Hoxa1 mRNA is abrogated in F9 RARγ–/– cells (14Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Additionally a synthetic retinoid selective for RARγ can induce expression of Hoxa1 mRNA in F9 Wt cells but not in F9 RARγ–/– cells (15Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore RARγ–/– cells fail to exhibit complete morphological differentiation in culture when treated with RA (14Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another example of isotype-specific function comes from studies utilizing a F9 RARβ –/–2 cell line. In contrast to F9 Wt, RARα–/–, and RARγ–/– cell lines, the F9 RARβ –/–2 cell line exhibits no growth arrest in response to RA (16Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additionally a number of genes specifically regulated by the RARβ2 isoform in F9 cells have been identified through use of subtractive hybridization and DNA array analysis (17Zhuang Y. Faria T.N. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 619-630PubMed Google Scholar). RARα also specifically regulates RA target genes in F9 cells as the expression of both Hoxb1 and CRABP-II is reduced in F9 RARα–/– cells compared with F9 Wt and F9 RARγ–/– cells (18Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that in the F9 RAR null cell lines the expression levels of the undisrupted RARs were similar to those found in F9 Wt cells (19Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that each of the RAR isotypes regulates a specific subset of target genes in F9 cells when the RAR isotypes are expressed at endogenous levels.A degree of functional redundancy among the three RAR isotypes has also been demonstrated through use of the F9 RAR null cells and isotype-selective ligands. For example, ∼10-fold overexpression of RARα in F9 RARγ–/– cells could restore target gene activation of RARγ target genes such as Hoxa1 as well as the differentiation potential of F9 RARγ–/– cells (20Taneja R. Bouillet P. Boylan J.F. Gaub M.P. Roy B. Gudas L.J. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7854-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the same set of experiments, however, overexpression of RARβ2could not restore Hoxa1 mRNA expression in F9 RARγ–/– cells. Additionally the expression of Hoxa1 mRNA in F9 RARγ–/– cells could be restored by exposure to an RARα-selective ligand (15Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, this same RARα-selective ligand inefficiently induced expression of Hoxa1 mRNA in F9 Wt cells (15Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), indicating that the presence of RARγ can hinder the ability of RARα, bound to an RARα-selective agonist, to induce RA target genes. Furthermore an RARβ-specific agonist could induce expression of another RA target gene, RARβ2 itself, in F9 RARγ–/– cells but not in F9 Wt or RARα–/– cells (15Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that some of the functional redundancies observed among individual RARs in F9 RAR null cells do not exist in the context of wild type cells.In this study we used ChIP assays to monitor how the association of RARγ, RXRα, and coregulators with the RAREs regulating expression of the Hoxa1 (21Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), RARβ2 (22de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), and Cyp26A1 (23Loudig O. Babichuk C. White J. Abu-Abed S. Mueller C. Petkovich M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1483-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Loudig O. Maclean G.A. Dore N.L. Luu L. Petkovich M. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) genes is affected in the various F9 RAR null cell lines as compared with F9 Wt cells. Additionally we quantitatively monitored the expression of these target genes in the aforementioned F9 cell lines by real time PCR. We demonstrated that RARγ was associated with the RAREs that regulate the transcription of the Hoxa1 and Cyp26A1 mRNAs. We also showed that RARγ was associated with the RARβ2 RARE even though RARγ was not required for the RA-induced expression of RARβ2 mRNA. Furthermore we demonstrated that the presence of RARγ and RXRα at an RARE was not sufficient for the recruitment of factors required for transcription, such as p300 and pCIP, to the corresponding target genes. We also showed that the levels of the polycomb repressive protein SUZ12 associated with the RAREs monitored in this study were significantly higher in RARγ–/– cells as compared with F9 Wt and F9 RARβ –/–2 cells. Thus, we demonstrated that components of the RAR signaling apparatus were specifically required for displacement of SUZ12 from RAREs during the RA-mediated differentiation of F9 cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—F9 Wt, RARα–/–, RARβ2–/–, and RARγ –/– embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated in gelatin-coated tissue culture plates ∼48 h prior to RNA harvesting (5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) or formaldehyde fixation (2.5 × 106 cells/20-cm dish). Cells were treated with 1 μm retinoic acid for 24 h.Antibodies and Chemicals—All-trans-RA was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in ethanol. Anti-RARγ serum was generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the F region of RARγ (NH2-PGPHPKASSEDEAPGGQGKRGQS-COOH). Polyclonal anti-RARγ IgG was purified from the crude serum through use of a DEAE Affi-Gel blue gel column (Bio-Rad). Anti-RXRα (D-20, sc-553), anti-pCIP (M-397, sc-9119), anti-p300 (N-15, sc-584), and anti-actin (I-19, sc-1616) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-SUZ12 (07-379) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-Ser-5 carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (pCTDser5) was purchased from Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA).RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—RNA was prepared and subjected to semiquantitative or real time RT-PCR analysis as described previously (25Gillespie R.F. Gudas L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 298-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Characterization of F9 RARα, -β2, and -γ Null Cell Lines—RNA was prepared and subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. The primers used to detect RARα spanned the exon in which the disruption cassette was inserted and were as follows: 5′-ATCGAGACCCAGAGCAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGTGCGCTTTGCGAACC-3′ (18Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used to detect RARγ also spanned the exon in which the disruption cassette was inserted (14Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and were as follows: 5′-CAATAAGGAGAGACTCTTTGCG-3′ and 5′-TTGCTGACCTTGGTGATGAGTT-3′. The primers used to detect RARβ2 (16Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were as follows: 5′-GATCCTGGATTTCTACACCG-3′ and 5′-CACTGACGCCATAGTGGTA-3′.ChIP Assays—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (25Gillespie R.F. Gudas L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 298-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Semiquantitative and Real Time PCR—Semi-quantitative PCRs and real time PCRs were performed as described previously (25Gillespie R.F. Gudas L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 298-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared from COS cells that were either mock-transfected or transfected with a plasmid expressing RARα, RARβ, or RARγ. Five micrograms of each of the COS whole cell extracts were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size; catalog number 162-0090, Bio-Rad). Primary antibody incubation was done overnight at 4 °C. The anti-RARγ blue eluate, as described above, was used at a 1:200 dilution to detect RARγ. After a 1-h incubation with an immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature (anti-rabbit, 1:40,000 dilution; sc-2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the membranes were developed with SuperSignal Substrate (Pierce) for 5 min and exposed to BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% Blotto (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were stripped with Restore Plus Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce, 46430) and then reprobed with an anti-actin antibody (1:400 dilution) followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-goat, 1:2000 dilution; sc-2056, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSWe have previously studied the association of RARγ, RXRα, and other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation with the Hoxa1, RARβ2, and Cyp26A1 RAREs (R1 and R2) during the course of RA treatment in F9 Wt cells (25Gillespie R.F. Gudas L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 298-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The main purpose of this study was to determine how the association of RARγ, RXRα, and coregulators with the aforementioned RAREs is affected by the absence of each of the three RAR isotypes. Therefore, we utilized F9 cells lines in which both alleles of RARα (18Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RARβ2 (the predominant isoform of RARβ) (16Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and RARγ (14Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were individually knocked out by homologous recombination.To confirm that the RAR isotypes were individually knocked out in our cell lines, we monitored expression of the RAR isotypes in the various F9 RAR null cell lines by semiquantitative RT-PCR. F9 Wt and F9 RARα–/–, -β –/–2, and -γ–/– cell lines were either untreated or treated with 1 μm RA for 24 h, and RNA was harvested. RARα mRNA was detected in RARγ–/– and RARβ –/–2 cells at levels similar to those in F9 Wt cells irrespective of the presence of RA treatment (Fig. 1A). As expected, no RARα mRNA could be detected in F9 RARα–/– cells (Fig. 1A). The expression of RARγ mRNA could not be detected in RARγ–/– cells, although RARγ mRNA was expressed in RARα–/– and RARβ –/–2 cells at levels similar to those seen in F9 Wt cells irrespective of the presence of RA (Fig. 1A). In contrast to RARα and RARγ, the expression of RARβ2 was strongly induced by the presence of RA in F9 Wt cells (Fig. 1A). RA-induced expression of RARβ2 mRNA was observed in RARα–/– and RARγ–/– cells, and as expected, RARβ2 mRNA could not be detected in RA-treated RARβ –/–2 cells (Fig. 1A). To ensure that equivalent amounts of RNA were used in the RT-PCR assays, expression of the ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 “housekeeping gene” (26Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was monitored. All samples expressed 36B4 mRNA to similar levels (Fig. 1A). Thus, we confirmed that the three different RAR null cell lines each specifically lacked expression of one RAR isotype.FIGURE 1Expression of RAR isotype mRNAs and RA target gene mRNAs in F9 Wt and F9 RARα, -β2, and -γ null cell lines as measured by RT-PCR.A, confirmation of the identities of the three F9 RAR null cell lines by semiquantitative RT-PCR. F9 Wt and F9 RARα, -β2, and -γ null cell lines were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 μm RA for 24 h, and RNA was harvested. Harvested RNA was assayed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Each experiment was repeated at least three times; data shown are from one experiment. Linearity of the PCR was demonstrated by serial dilution of the F9 Wt 24-h RA sample (data not shown). Products were visualized by standard gel electrophoresis.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). F9 Wt and the RAR null cell lines were either untreated or treated with 1 μm RA for 24 h, and RNA was harvested for use in RT-PCR. Real time PCR was used to quantitate RT-PCR products corresponding to the three RA target genes. As expected, all three RA target genes were strongly induced (>22-fold) by RA treatment in F9 Wt cells (Fig. 1B). Again we also monitored the levels of 36B4 mRNA in the F9 Wt, RARα–/–, RARβ –/–2, and RARγ–/–cell lines. Similar levels of 36B4 mRNA were observed in all of the cell lines both in the presence and absence of RA (Fig. 1B).Hoxa1 mRNA levels in RARα–/– cells were similar to those seen in F9 Wt cells cultured in the presence or absence of RA (Fig. 1B) in agreement with previous reports (18Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result demonstrates that RARα is not required for expression of the Hoxa1 gene. Additionally in the presence of RA, RARβ2 mRNA levels were similar in F9 Wt and RARα–/– cells, demonstrating that RARα is not required for induction of RARβ2 by RA. However, in untreated RARα–/– cells, as compared with F9 Wt cells, ∼2.9-fold higher levels of RARβ2 transcripts (p value <0.0001) were expressed (Fig. 1B). This latter result indicates that in the absence of RA RARα may have a role in the repression of RARβ2 (30Hauksdottir H. Farboud B. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Levels of Cyp26A1 mRNA after RA treatment of F9 RARα–/– cells were ∼57% of the levels observed in F9 Wt cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that RARα has a role in the RA-induced expression of this gene.Previous reports have demonstrated that RARγ is required for the expression of both the Hoxa1 (18Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Cyp26A1 (27Abu-Abed S.S. Beckett B.R. Chiba H. Chithalen J.V. Jones G. Metzger D. Chambon P. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2409-2415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) genes in F9 Wt cells. Our results are in agreement with these reports as we did not observe expression of either Hoxa1 or Cyp26A1 mRNA in RA-treated F9 RARγ–/– cells (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas a >22-fold induction of these mRNAs was observed in F9 Wt cells. RA-induced expression of RARβ2 also was reduced in RARγ–/– cells (∼43% of F9 Wt) relative to F9 Wt cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, we concluded that RARγ has a prominent role in the regulation of Hoxa1 and Cyp26A1 and a lesser role in the induction of RARβ2 transcripts in response to RA.As expected, expression of RARβ2 mRNA was abrogated in RARβ –/–2 cells as RARβ2 transcripts detected in RARβ –/–2 cells were less than 1% of the levels observed in F9 Wt cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The low levels of RARβ2 transcripts detected in RARβ –/–2 cells may represent fusion transcripts generated through the RARβ2 RARE that remains intact in these cells. Additionally the RA-induced expression of Hoxa1 (∼28%) and Cyp26A1 (∼34%) transcripts was lower in F9 RARβ –/–2 cells relative to levels observed in F9 Wt cells (Fig. 1C), consistent with data from our laboratory (16Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The Association Patterns of RARγ and RXRα with the RAREs Regulating Expression of the Hoxa1 Gene in F9 Wt and F9 RARα, -β2, and -γ Null Cell Lines—We previously demonstrated that RARγ and RXRα, both in the presence and absence of RA, are associated with the RAREs that regulate expression of the Cyp26A1 (R1 and R2), Hoxa1, and RARβ2 genes in F9 Wt cells (25Gillespie R.F. Gudas L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 298-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with previous studies that have also demonstrated that RAR-RXR heterodimers are constitutively associated with RAREs (31Dilworth F.J. Chambon P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 32Pavri R. Lewis B. Kim T.K. Dilworth F.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. de Murcia G. Evans R. Chambon P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this study we wanted to determine whether the absence of each of the RAR isotypes in F9 cells would affect the association of RARγ and RXRα with these RAREs. Therefore, we monitored the association of RARγ and RXRα with the aforementioned RAREs through use of a two-step ChIP assay (33Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). F9 Wt and F9 RARα, -β2, and -γ null cell lines were cultured in the presence or absence of RA for 24 h and then subjected to the protein-protein cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate. Cells were then formaldehyde-fixed as in conventional ChIP assays, and soluble chromatin was prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Antibodies to RARγ and RXRα were used to immunoprecipitate protein-DNA complexes from soluble chromatin. Nonspecific rabbit IgG antibodies were also used as a negative control in the two-step ChIP assays.The anti-RARγ IgG used in the two-step ChIP assays was generated in our laboratory (see “Materials and Methods”). To determine the specificity of the anti-RARγ IgG, we prepared individual COS cell extracts from cells overexpressing each of the RAR isotypes. COS cell extract was also prepared from cells that were mock-transfected. The COS cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis against the anti-RARγ IgG. The anti-RARγ IgG specifically recognized antigen from COS cells overexpressing RARγ, and the positive signal was at the expected molecular mass for RARγ (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the anti-RARγ IgG specifically recognizes the RARγ isotype.The Hoxa1 RARE is located ∼2 kb downstream of the Hoxa1 gene, whereas the RARβ2 RARE is located ∼55 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2A). Cyp26A1 contains a RARE ∼70 bp upstream of the transcription start site denoted as R1 (23Loudig O. Babichuk C. White J. Abu-Abed S. Mueller C. Petkovich M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1483-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) as well as a more recently described RARE denoted as R2 (24Loudig O. Maclean G.A. Dore N.L. Luu L. Petkovich M. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) found ∼1950 bp upstream of R1 (Fig. 2A).

The stability of the HIF-1α subunit is regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In aerobic cells, O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α is required for binding of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein VHL, which then recruits the Elongin C ubiquitin-ligase complex. SSAT2 (spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase-2) binds to HIF-1α and promotes its ubiquitination/degradation by stabilizing the interaction of VHL and Elongin C. Treatment of cells with heat shock protein HSP90 inhibitors induces the degradation of HIF-1α even under hypoxic conditions. HSP90 competes with RACK1 for binding to HIF-1α, and HSP90 inhibition leads to increased binding of RACK1, which recruits the Elongin C ubiquitin-ligase complex to HIF-1α in an O2-independent manner. In this work, we demonstrate that SSAT1, which shares 46% amino acid identity with SSAT2, also binds to HIF-1α and promotes its ubiquitination/degradation. However, in contrast to SSAT2, SSAT1 acts by stabilizing the interaction of HIF-1α with RACK1. Thus, the paralogs SSAT1 and SSAT2 play complementary roles in promoting O2-independent and O2-dependent degradation of HIF-1α.

In this work, we demonstrate that SSAT1, which shares 46% amino acid identity with SSAT2, also binds to HIF-1α and promotes its ubiquitination/degradation. However, in contrast to SSAT2, SSAT1 acts by stabilizing the interaction of HIF-1α with RACK1. Thus, the paralogs SSAT1 and SSAT2 play complementary roles in promoting O2-independent and O2-dependent degradation of HIF-1α. The maintenance of oxygen homeostasis is a critical developmental and physiological imperative. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; 17-AAG, 17-allylaminogeldanamycin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; shSSAT1, SSAT1 short hairpin RNA; shSNC, scrambled negative control short hairpin RNA; shRACK1, RACK1 short hairpin RNA; WCL, whole cell lysate(s). plays a major role in regulating gene transcription in response to changes in O2 availability in all metazoan species. HIF-1 regulates the transcription of hundreds of genes in hypoxic human cells (1Manalo D.J. Rowan A. Lavoie T. Natarajan L. Kelly B.D. Ye S.Q. Garcia J.G. Semenza G.L.

The products of these genes include proteins such as erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, GLUT1 (glucose transporter-1), and lactate dehydrogenase A, which control erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, glucose uptake, and glycolysis, respectively.

HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein that consists of a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit and a highly regulated HIF-1α subunit (8Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

Three major pathways for regulation of HIF-1α protein half-life have been delineated, two of which involve ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The first pathway described is O2-dependent and involves binding of HIF-1α to the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein VHL, which recruits an E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex that includes Elongin C, Elongin B, cullin-2, and RBX1 (ring box protein-1) (14Maxwell P.H.

Binding of VHL to HIF-1α is dependent upon the hydroxylation of proline residue(s) 402 and/or 564 by the HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylase PHD2 (prolyl hydroxylase domain protein-2) (3Poellinger L.

A second pathway that is independent of prolyl hydroxylation and VHL has been described in which heat shock protein HSP90 inhibitors, such as geldanamycin and 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), induce the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α (21Isaacs J.S.

Willard M.T. Kaur B. Van Meir E.G. Simons J.W. Zhong H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2478-2482PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation of HIF-1α by HSP90 inhibitors contributes to the anti-angiogenic and anticancer activity of these compounds in xenograft models, and 17-AAG is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Loss of HSP90 binding to HIF-1α in cancer cells treated with 17-AAG leads to increased binding of RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase-1), which recruits Elongin C and its E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex to HIF-1α in an O2-independent manner (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, the Elongin C complex can be recruited to HIF-1α either by O2-dependent binding of VHL or by O2-independent, 17-AAG-inducible binding of RACK1. In both cases, the result is ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. A third pathway has been proposed to account for the degradation of HIF-1α in cells treated with immunophilins or histone deacetylase inhibitors based on recent studies suggesting that these agents induce degradation by an O2-independent mechanism that is also ubiquitin-independent (24Kong X.

The precision and speed of these responses appear to be due in part to the presence of multiple regulatory proteins that facilitate the interaction of HIF-1α with the hydroxylation and ubiquitination machinery. OS-9 (osteosarcoma protein-9) binds to both HIF-1α and PHD2 and is required for efficient prolyl hydroxylation (29Baek J.H. Mahon P.C. Oh J. Kelly B. Krishnamachary B. Pearson M. Chan D.A.

SSAT2 (spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase-2) binds to HIF-1α, VHL, and Elongin C and is required for efficient VHL-mediated ubiquitination (30Baek J.H. Liu Y.V. McDonald K.R. Wesley J.B.

Here, we report that the protein SSAT1 interacts with both HIF-1α and RACK1 and is required for RACK1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α in cells treated with 17-AAG.

For hypoxic exposures, cells were placed in a Billups-Rothenberg modular incubator chamber that was flushed with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2; sealed; and incubated at 37 °C. In Vitro Binding Assay Using Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene) were transformed with pGEX expression vectors and treated for 4 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell lysates were applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).

After 30 min of mixing, the beads were washed with PBS-T binding buffer. Proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography using Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Construction of Expression Vectors—The open reading frame of SSAT1 was amplified from cDNA prepared from human umbilical vein endothelial cell mRNA using specific primers based on the nucleotide sequence of GenBank™ accession number NM_002970 (supplemental Table S1). The PCR product was inserted into the pcDNA3.1(D)/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The coding sequence of SSAT1 was amplified with primers containing a SalI restriction enzyme site at the 5′-end and blunt 3′-end and ligated into the SalI and EcoRV sites of pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare). Transfection Assays—293 cells were seeded onto 48-well plates at 4 × 104 cells/well and transfected with plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, the cells were exposed to 20 or 1% O2 for 24 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were determined with a multiwell luminescence reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.). For p2.1 reporter assay, cells were cotransfected with 6 ng of control reporter pSV-Renilla; 56 ng of HIF-1 reporter p2.1 (31Semenza G.L. Jiang B.-H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P.

Unless indicated otherwise, 80 ng of FLAG-HIF-1α, 100 ng of SSAT1, 1 ng of PHD2, or 1 ng of FLAG-HIF-1α(P402A/P564A) expression vector was used. For immunoblot assays, 293 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/6-cm plate. The following day, the cells were transfected. After 24 h, the cells were exposed to 20 or 1% O2 with or without MG132 for 6 h and lysed in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), sodium orthovanadate, and sodium fluoride (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Assays—293 cells (3 × 106 cells/10-cm plate) were transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6. Cells were lysed with PBS-T. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using immunoglobulin G (Oncogene), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-hemagglutinin affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science), or anti-V5 agarose affinity gel (Sigma), followed by immunoblot assay using antibody against HIF-1α (33Zhong H.

Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Assays—The mammalian expression vector pSR.retro.GFP.Neo.circular.stuffer (OligoEngine) was used for expression of shRNA in 293 cells. The SSAT1 shRNA insert consisted of the 22-nucleotide sequence tgacccgtggattggcaagtta, corresponding to nucleotides 408–429 of SSAT1 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_002970), which was separated by a spacer (ttcaagaga) from the reverse complement of the same 22-nucleotide sequence. A scrambled negative control vector constructed using a 19-nucleotide sequence (acgcatgcatgcttgcttt) with no significant homology to any mammalian gene sequence served as a control. Oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into BglII- and HindIII-digested vector. 293 cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and lysed for RNA and protein isolation 24 h after transfection. The RACK1 shRNA was described previously (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) and treated with DNase. Five μg of total RNA was used for first-strand synthesis with the iScript cDNA synthesis system (Bio-Rad). cDNA was used for PCR analysis of SSAT1 (primers shown in supplemental Table S1) and GLUT1 mRNAs and 18 S rRNA. Real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Expression of SSAT1 or GLUT1 mRNA relative to 18 S rRNA was calculated based on the threshold cycle (CT) for amplification as 2–Δ(ΔCT), where ΔCT = CT(SSAT1) or CT(GLUT1)–CT(18 S). Site-directed Mutagenesis—PCR-based mutagenesis was performed using the primers shown in supplemental Table S1 and pcDNA3.1(D)/V5-His-SSAT1 as the template. The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 6 min for 18 cycles using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Subsequently, plasmid DNA was digested with 10 units of DpnI (Stratagene) for 1 h at 37°C before a 10-μl aliquot was transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.D. Differences between experiments were analyzed for statistical significance (p < 0.05) by analysis of variance or two-sample t test. A yeast two-hybrid screen using amino acid residues 17–299 of human HIF-1α as bait led to the identification of SSAT2 as a human protein that binds to HIF-1α, VHL, and Elongin C and is required for O2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α (30Baek J.H.

Because SSAT2 bears 46% amino acid identity to SSAT1, we tested whether the latter protein also regulates HIF-1α protein levels. Human 293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG epitope-tagged HIF-1α and either V5 epitope-tagged human SSAT1 or empty vector. Immunoblot assays revealed lower levels of FLAG-HIF-1α in cells coexpressing V5-SSAT1 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The reduction in FLAG-HIF-1α levels was similar to that obtained by cotransfection of vector encoding V5-SSAT2, even though much higher levels of V5-SSAT2 were achieved compared with V5-SSAT1 (Fig. 1A, middle panel). β-Actin protein levels were not affected by V5-SSAT1 or V5-SSAT2 (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To demonstrate that this reduction in HIF-1α protein levels was associated with reduced HIF-1-dependent gene transcription, cells were cotransfected with reporter gene p2.1, in which the expression of firefly luciferase is driven by a hypoxia response element from the ENO1 gene upstream of a basal SV40 promoter (31Semenza G.L. Jiang B.-H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar), and control plasmid pSV-Renilla, in which Renilla luciferase expression is driven by the SV40 promoter alone. Cotransfection of HIF-1α expression vector increased the ratio of firefly to Renilla activity by >4-fold (Fig. 1B). However, this HIF-1α-dependent induction of reporter gene activity was reduced by SSAT2 and eliminated by SSAT1 overexpression. We next analyzed the binding of in vitro translated SSAT1 to fusion proteins consisting of GST and different HIF-1α protein domains. SSAT1 bound weakly to HIF-1α residues 81–200, which encompass the PAS A-subdomain, and strongly to residues 201–329, which encompass the PAS B-subdomain (Fig. 1C). In contrast, SSAT2 bound strongly to residues 81–200 and did not bind to residues 201–329 (30Baek J.H. Liu Y.V. McDonald K.R. Wesley J.B. Hubbi M.E. Byun H. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23572-23580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether HIF-1α and SSAT1 interact in human cells, we cotransfected 293 cells with FLAG-HIF-1α expression vector and either V5-SSAT1 or empty vector. The cells were treated with MG132 to block the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. Compared with untreated cells, in which FLAG-HIF-1α levels were markedly lower when V5-SSAT2 was coexpressed (Fig. 1A, first and second lanes), FLAG-HIF-1α levels were equal in MG132-treated cells transfected with V5-SSAT2 or empty vector (Fig. 1D, upper right panel). In cells coexpressing FLAG-HIF-1α and V5-SSAT1, anti-V5 immunoprecipitates were found to contain FLAG-HIF-1α (Fig. 1D, left panel). The results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that SSAT1 interacts with and promotes the degradation of HIF-1α. To complement the SSAT1 gain-of-function studies described above and to determine whether endogenous SSAT1 is required to maintain low levels of HIF-1α under aerobic conditions, we transfected 293 cells with expression vector encoding an shRNA that targets SSAT1 mRNA for degradation (sh-SSAT1) or encoding a scrambled negative control shRNA (shSNC). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that endogenous SSAT1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in cells transfected with shSSAT1 compared with shSNC-transfected or control non-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Expression of shSSAT1 also modestly reduced the levels of coexpressed V5-SSAT1 protein (Fig. 2B, middle panel). The reduced expression of V5-SSAT1 in cells expressing shSSAT1 was associated with modestly increased FLAG-HIF-1α levels (Fig. 2B, upper panel). In contrast, β-actin protein levels were not affected by expression of V5-SSAT1 or shSSAT1 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Notably, transfection of expression vector encoding shSSAT1 increased the endogenous HIF-1α protein levels in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect the levels of HIF-1β or β-actin (Fig. 2C). In cells cotransfected with the HIF-1-dependent p2.1 and control pSV-Renilla reporter plasmids, shSSAT1 expression increased HIF-1-dependent luciferase activity by 2.5-fold relative to cells expressing shSNC (Fig. 2D). Compared with control non-transfected cells, expression of GLUT1 mRNA, which is encoded by a HIF-1 target gene, was significantly increased in cells expressing shSSAT1, but not in cells expressing shSNC (Fig. 2E). Thus, the gain-of-function (Fig. 1) and loss-of-function (Fig. 2) studies demonstrated that SSAT1 is a negative regulator of HIF-1α protein levels and HIF-1-dependent transcription in aerobic cells. Our recent study of SSAT2 revealed that the protein is required for VHL-dependent ubiquitination of HIF-1α in well oxygenated cells (30Baek J.H. Liu Y.V. McDonald K.R. Wesley J.B. Hubbi M.E. Byun H. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23572-23580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which is triggered by the PHD2-dependent hydroxylation of Pro402 and/or Pro564 of HIF-1α. To analyze whether SSAT1 is involved in the PHD2-VHL pathway, cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding either wild-type FLAG-HIF-1α or the hydroxylation-resistant P402A/P564A double mutant form of FLAG-HIF-1α and with PHD2, SSAT1, SSAT2, or empty vector. SSAT2, PHD2, or SSAT1 reduced or eliminated coexpression of wild-type FLAG-HIF-1α (Fig. 3A, third through fifth lanes). In contrast, SSAT1 (but not SSAT2 or PHD2) reduced the levels of FLAG-HIF-1α(P402A/P564A) (Fig. 3A, seventh through ninth lanes) despite the much lower levels of V5-SSAT1 compared with V5-SSAT2. Reporter gene transcriptional assays showed that whereas both SSAT1 and PHD2 inhibited p2.1 transcription mediated by wild-type FLAG-HIF-1α, only SSAT1 inhibited p2.1 transcription mediated by FLAG-HIF-1α(P402A/P564A) (Fig. 3B). Thus, SSAT1 shares with SSAT2 the ability to inhibit HIF-1α protein expression and HIF-1-dependent transcription. However, in marked contrast to SSAT2, SSAT1 mediates this effect by a mechanism that is independent of prolyl hydroxylation. Arg101 is conserved in all metazoan members of the SSAT family and is required for binding of acetyl-CoA and acetylation of spermine and spermidine as determined by both mutagenesis and structural analysis (35Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Lu L. Berkey K.A. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol.

The mutant SSAT1(R101K) protein was markedly impaired in its ability to promote HIF-1α degradation (Fig. 4A, upper panel) and to inhibit HIF-1-dependent transcription (Fig. 4B), despite the fact that it was expressed at higher levels than the wild-type protein (Fig. 4A, middle panel). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the catalytic activity of SSAT1 as an N-acetyltransferase is required for it to promote HIF-1α degradation. We recently described an alternative pathway for the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α that does not involve binding of VHL to prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-1α, but instead involves binding of HIF-1α to RACK1, which recruits the Elongin C ubiquitin-ligase complex (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Compared with expression of shSNC, that of either shSSAT1 or shRNA directed against RACK1 (shRACK1) resulted in FLAG-HIF-1α levels that were increased to a similar degree (Fig. 5, second through fourth lanes). Expression of V5-SSAT1 promoted the degradation of FLAG-HIF-1α, and this effect was counteracted by expression of shS-SAT1, as expected (Fig. 5, sixth lane). However, shRACK1 also blocked V5-SSAT1-mediated degradation of HIF-1α (Fig. 5, seventh lane), indicating that the effect of SSAT1 on HIF-1α is RACK1-dependent. To determine whether SSAT1 and RACK1 interact, purified GST or GST-RACK1 was incubated with lysates prepared from cells transfected with empty vector or V5-SSAT1 expression vector and pulled down by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads. Immunoblot assays revealed that SSAT1 interacted with GST-RACK1, but not with GST (Fig. 6A) or GST-Elongin C (Fig. 6B). RACK1 consists of six tryptophan- and aspartate-rich WD40 domains, and SSAT1 showed the strongest binding to a GST fusion protein containing WD40 domains 5 and 6 (Fig. 6C). Next, we investigated whether the R101K mutation, which eliminates the activity of SSAT1 as an inhibitor of HIF-1α expression, also affects the binding of SSAT1 to HIF-1α. GST-HIF-1α-(1–329) was incubated with in vitro translated wild-type SSAT1 or SSAT1(R101K) and then pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Remarkably, SSAT1(R101K) exhibited increased binding to GST-HIF-1α-(1–329) compared with wild-type SSAT1 (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that the inability of SSAT1(R101K) to negatively regulate HIF-1α is not due to the inability of the mutant protein to interact with HIF-1α. RACK1 competes with HSP90 for binding to the PAS A-subdomain of HIF-1α (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To determine whether SSAT1 affects this competition, GST-HIF-1α-(1–329) was incubated with lysates from cells transfected with empty vector or vector encoding wild-type SSAT1 or SSAT1(R101K). Expression of wild-type SSAT1 increased the binding of RACK1 and decreased the binding of HSP90 to GST-HIF-1α-(1–329) without changing the levels of RACK1 or HSP90 protein in the cell lysate (Fig. 7A). SSAT1(R101K) also induced the pulldown of RACK1, suggesting that SSAT1(R101K) can interact with HIF-1α (1–329) and RACK1. However, RACK1 recruited by SSAT1(R101K) did not displace HSP90 from HIF-1α (1–329). HSP90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG have anticancer effects and induce the degradation of HIF-1α by a mechanism that is independent of PHD2 and VHL activity (21Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mimnaugh E.G.

Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To determine whether 17-AAG-induced degradation of HIF-1α is dependent on SSAT1, cells were transfected with vector encoding shSNC or shSSAT1 and treated with vehicle or 17-AAG. Compared with cells expressing shSNC, HIF-1α levels were increased in cells expressing shSSAT1, and HIF-1α levels were reduced by 17-AAG in cells expressing shSNC, but not in cells expressing shSSAT1 (Fig. 7B), similar to results observed with shRACK1 (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, both SSAT1 and RACK1 are required for the degradation of HIF-1α induced by 17-AAG. We hypothesized that the increased interaction of RACK1 and HIF-1α in SSAT1-overexpressing cells should lead to increased ubiquitination of HIF-1α. To test this hypothesis, 293 cells were cotransfected with expression vector encoding FLAG-HIF-1α and empty vector or vector encoding wild-type SSAT1 or SSAT1(R101K) and treated with MG132 to block the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated HIF-1α. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot assay using anti-ubiquitin antibody. Wild-type SSAT1 increased the ubiquitination of HIF-1α, whereas SSAT1(R101K) had little effect (Fig. 8A), despite the fact that SSAT1(R101K) was expressed at higher levels than wild-type SSAT1 (Fig. 8B). Taken together with the data presented in the preceding figures, these results indicate that wild-type SSAT1 promotes the RACK1-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α. In this study, we have demonstrated by gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches that SSAT1 plays an essential role in the RACK1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α that is induced by treatment of cells with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG. SSAT1 interacts with both RACK1 and HIF-1α, thereby stabilizing the interaction between these two proteins, which is necessary for the ubiquitination of HIF-1α by the Elongin C ubiquitin-ligase complex that is recruited to HIF-1α by RACK1 (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In this and previous studies (29Baek J.H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 23572-23580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we have now identified three HIF-1α-binding proteins whose multivalent interactions are required for the efficient ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α: OS-9, SSAT2, and SSAT1 stabilize PHD2/HIF-1α, VHL/Elongin C, and HIF-1α/RACK1 interaction, respectively (Fig. 9). Whereas OS-9 and SSAT2 are required for O2/PHD2/VHL-dependent ubiquitination, SSAT1 is required for O2-independent and RACK1-dependent ubiquitination of HIF-1α in 17-AAG-treated cells. These studies have revealed the existence of multiprotein complexes that are devoted to the cooperative regulation of HIF-1α stability in response to changes in oxygen concentration and perhaps other physiological stimuli. It is remarkable that the human SSAT1 and SSAT2 proteins, which share 46% amino acid sequence identity and are clearly homologous, both interact with HIF-1α and both promote the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α, yet they do so by completely different and complementary molecular mechanisms. In particular, SSAT2 binds to the PAS A-subdomain of HIF-1α (residues 81–200) and promotes O2-dependent regulation, whereas SSAT1 binds to the PAS B-subdomain (residues 201–329) and promotes O2-independent regulation of HIF-1α. It remains to be determined whether the acetyltransferase activity of either SSAT1 or SSAT2 is required for their regulation of HIF-1α. The mutation of a critical arginine residue (R101K) in the acetyl-CoA-binding site of SSAT1 that disrupts its acetyltransferase activity also abrogated its ability to induce HIF-1α degradation. However, despite devoting considerable experimental effort to test the hypothesis that SSAT1 acetylates either HIF-1α or RACK1, we have not yet generated compelling data in support of this hypothesis. Based on these negative results, it is possible that, in addition to affecting acetyl-CoA binding, the R101K mutation has other unrelated effects on the conformation and/or function of SSAT1 that are more relevant to its ability to regulate HIF-1α. HIF-1 regulates genes that play important roles in several critical aspects of cancer biology, including angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy (38Chan D.A.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A promising therapeutic approach that results in inhibition of HIF-1α expression is the use of HSP90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG. HSP90 competes with RACK1 for binding to the PAS A-domain of HIF-1α. HSP90 inhibition leads to increased RACK1 binding and recruitment of the Elongin C ubiquitin-ligase complex that mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that the efficient interaction of RACK1 with HIF-1α requires SSAT1 and that 17-AAG-mediated degradation of HIF-1α is impaired when SSAT1 levels are reduced by RNA interference. In this and our previous study (23Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), we have delineated a more detailed mechanism of action by which 17-AAG induces HIF-1α degradation than for any other HSP90 client protein. Treatment of colon cancer cells with an inducer of SSAT1 expression has been shown recently to increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (44Allen W.L. McLean E.G. Boyer J. McCulla A. Wilson P.M. Coyle V. Longley D.B. Casero Jr., R.A. Johnston P.G. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HIF-1α-deficient cells manifest increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (45Unruh A. Ressel A. Mohamed H.G. Johnson R.S. Nadrowitz R. Richter E. Katschinski D.M. Wenger R.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3213-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). HIF-1 has been shown to regulate transcription of the ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes, which encode the MDR1 (multidrug resistance protein-1) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) multidrug transporters, respectively (46Comerford K.M. Wallace T.J. Karhausen J. Louis N.A. Montalto M.C. Colgan S.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3387-3394PubMed Google Scholar, 47Krishnamurthy P. Ross D.D. Nakanishi T. Bailey-Dell K. Zhou S. Mercer K.E.

Reduced HIF-1α levels may therefore contribute to the improved chemosensitivity associated with increased SSAT1 expression. Inducers of SSAT1 expression may have synergistic effects with HSP90 inhibitors in reducing HIF-1α levels and thereby increasing sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy.

Here, we have investigated the role of BCL-2 in BIK-induced cell death using Bcl-2+/+ and Bcl-2-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of BIK in Bcl-2-/- cells resulted in enhanced cell death compared to Bcl-2+/+ cells. In these cells, while caspase-8 was activated, there was no significant activation of caspase-9 and 3. There was no detectable mitochondrial to cytosolic release of cytochrome-c. However, there was significant redistribution of AIF from mitochondria to the nucleus. The extent of BIK-induced cell death was augmented by treatment with the pancaspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. The Bcl-2 null cells expressing BIK exhibited autophagic features such as cytosolic vacuoles, punctate distribution of LC3 and enhanced expression of Beclin-1. The survival of BIK-expressing Bcl-2-/- cells was enhanced in the presence of PI3 kinase inhibitors 3-methyladenine and Wortmannin and also by depletion of Atg5 and Beclin-1. Death of BIK-expressing Bcl-2-/- cells treated with zVAD-fmk was increased under caspase-8 depletion. Our results suggest enhanced expression of BIK in the Bcl-2 deficient cells leads to cell death with autophagic features and the extent of such cell death could be increased by inhibition of caspases."

U19/Eaf2, along with its homolog Eaf1, has been reported to regulate transcriptional elongation via interaction with the eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) family of proteins. To further explore the tumor-suppressive effects of U19/Eaf2, we constructed and characterized a murine U19/Eaf2-knockout model. Homozygous or heterozygous deletion of U19/Eaf2 resulted in high rates of lung adenocarcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. Within the mouse prostate, U19/Eaf2 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation and increased epithelial cell size. The knockout mice also exhibited cardiac cell hypertrophy. These data indicate a role for U19/Eaf2 in growth suppression and cell size control as well as argue for U19/Eaf2 as a novel tumor suppressor in multiple mouse tissues. The U19/Eaf2 knockout mouse also provides a unique animal model for three important cancers: lung adenocarcinoma, B-cell lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1995865956,"The regulated generation of prostaglandins from endothelial cells is critical to vascular function. Here we identify a novel mechanism for the regulation of endothelial cell prostaglandin generation. Cytosolic phospholipase A2-α (cPLA2α) cleaves phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner to yield free arachidonic acid and lysophospholipid. Arachidonic acid is then converted into prostaglandins by the action of cyclooxygenase enzymes and downstream synthases. By previously undefined mechanisms, nonconfluent endothelial cells generate greater levels of prostaglandins than confluent cells. Here we demonstrate that Ca2+-independent association of cPLA2α with the Golgi apparatus of confluent endothelial cells correlates with decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Golgi association blocks arachidonic acid release and prevents functional coupling between cPLA2α and COX-mediated prostaglandin synthesis. When inactivated at the Golgi apparatus of confluent endothelial cells, cPLA2α is associated with the phospholipid-binding protein annexin A1. Furthermore, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous annexin A1 significantly reverses the inhibitory effect of confluence on endothelial cell prostaglandin generation.

Upon membrane binding, cPLA2α preferentially cleaves phospholipids containing arachidonic acid (AA) at the sn-2 position to liberate free AA (4Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Consequently, cPLA2α is seen as the rate-limiting enzyme in receptor-mediated AA release (8Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).Ca2+ elevation can induce relocation of cPLA2α to the specific intracellular membranes in which the downstream AA-metabolizing cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are also located (2Hirabayashi T. Murayama T. Shimizu T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of COX that have been extensively characterized (COX-1 and -2) (9Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar), and more recently an alternative COX-1 splice variant, COX-3, has also been cloned (10Chandrasekharan N.V.

The spatiotemporal co-localization of cPLA2α with COX can couple these enzymes to facilitate efficient conversion of AA into prostaglandins (2Hirabayashi T. Murayama T. Shimizu T. Biol. Pharm.

Chimeric cPLA2α mutants specifically targeted to intracellular membranes in which COX does not reside do not couple with COX and drastically reduce prostaglandin production (11Murakami M. Das S. Kim Y. Cho W. Kudo I. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the subcellular targeting of cPLA2α to specific intracellular membranes is essential for the regulation of both AA and prostaglandin production. Despite this, the subcellular targeting of cPLA2α in endothelial cells and its functional coupling with downstream COX enzymes has received little attention.Release of prostaglandins by endothelial cells, the cells lining the luminal surface of all blood vessels, is essential to the control of vascular tone and thrombus formation (12Vane J.R.

Rev. 2004; 56: 387-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of endothelial prostaglandin generation is critical to the maintenance of normal vascular function. Nonconfluent endothelial cells generate much greater levels of AA and prostaglandin than confluent cells (14Evans C.E. Billington D. McEvoy F.A. Prostaglandins Leukot.

Despite this, the actual mechanism of this differential regulation of cPLA2α activity has not been defined.Inhibition of cPLA2α activity by the phospholipid-binding protein, annexin A1, and the resulting block in AA metabolite release is a mechanism by which glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory action (17Flower R.J.

Annexin A1 is known to inhibit cPLA2α activity upon interaction with the CalB domain of cPLA2α in vitro (20Kim S. Rhee H.J. Ko J. Kim H.G. Yang J.M. Choi E.C. Na D.S. J. Biol.

Cells were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with endothelial cell growth factor kit 2 (PromoCell). All cells were grown on 0.1% (w/v) gelatin-coated cultureware and were not used in excess of four passages. The following antibodies were purchased: anti-annexin A1 (ANEX 5E4/1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cPLA2α (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cPLA2α (ab9014; Abcam), anti-mannosidase II (Serotec Ltd.), anti-calreticulin (Stressgen), anti-vimentin (Sigma), anti-p11 (SWant), anti-COX-2 and anti-COX-2 (Cayman Chemical), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce), and Alexa-fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Anti-ERGIC-53 and rabbit anti-annexin A1 antibodies were provided by H. P. Hauri (Basel, Switzerland) and E. Solito (Imperial College, London), respectively. Anti-TGN46 antibodies were supplied by S. Ponnambalam (University of Leeds, UK). N-terminal and C-terminal GFP-tagged cPLA2α constructs were kind gifts from R. Williams (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK) and T. Hirabayashi (University of Tokyo), respectively. Arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (AACOCF3) and bromoenol lactone (BEL) were purchased from BioMol. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Invitrogen unless otherwise stated.Biochemistry—Lysate preparation and Western analysis were performed as described previously (16Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (20 μg of protein) were resolved for 60 min at 30 mA/gel on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels using a discontinuous buffer system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 3 h at 300 mA (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:500) at room temperature. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:3000) for 1 h, immunoreactive bands were visualized using a West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Images were captured on a Fuji Film Intelligent dark box II image reader. Band intensities were determined densitometrically using Aida (Advanced Image Data Analyzer) 2.11 software. For immunoprecipitations, confluent HUVECs were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1:250 protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice. The annexin A1 immunoprecipitations were performed in 0.5% CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% CHAPS, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2). cPLA2α was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-cPLA2α antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Supernatants were then incubated with protein G-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. Bead complexes were washed with ice-cold lysis buffer and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to immunoblotting. For subcellular fractionation, confluent endothelial cells were mechanically disrupted in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm CaCl2) in the presence or absence of 1 mm glutaraldehyde and fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient according to Ref. 26Dominguez M.

Interfaces were removed, diluted in homogenization media, and collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Isolated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Iodixanol gradients were performed essentially as described by Yang et al. (27Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), except a 10-30% gradient was utilized. Differential centrifugation enrichment of membrane fractions was performed as described previously by Lamour et al. (28Lamour N.F. Stahelin R.V. Wijesinghe D.S. Maceyka M. Wang E. Allegood J.C.

Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to the required level of confluence on 0.1% (w/v) gelatin-coated coverslips. Cells were then fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin in neutral buffered saline (HT50-1-128; Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C. Prior to fixation, some cells were stimulated for 1 min with 5 μm A23187 as previously (29Grewal S. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2303-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Grewal S. Smith J. Ponnambalam S. Walker J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All ensuing steps were performed at 25 °C. After permeabilization with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min, cells were refixed (5 min), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated in 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min. Following phosphate-buffered saline washes, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (v/v) donkey serum for 3 h. Cells were incubated overnight with primary antibody followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies. Finally, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in Fluoromount-G mounting medium (Southern Biotech).Microscopy and Quantitation—Deconvolution fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus IX-70 inverted fluorescence microscope (63 × 1.5 oil immersion lens) and DeltaVision deconvolution system (Applied Precision Inc.). Individual optical sections of 0.2 μm were generated from 15 iterative cycles of deconvolution. Quantification of co-localization was determined using the IMARIS software suite (Bitplane AG). Gray scale values below 10% of the maximum pixel intensity were eliminated as background. Co-localized pixels were expressed as percentages of the total pixels selected. Some images were captured using an inverted Zeiss LSM 510 META Axiovert 200M confocal microscope.Determination of Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentration—HUVECs cultured on glass bottom dishes were washed with HEPES/Tyrode's buffer and incubated with 2.5 μm Fluo3-AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were washed and then incubated with HEPES/Tyrode's buffer (plus 1 mm Ca2+) for 20 min. Cells were placed in a heated chamber (37 °C) above an Olympus IX-70 inverted fluorescence microscope. Fluctuations in cytosolic Ca2+ were monitored by acquisition of fluorescence images.AA Release—This technique was performed as previously (16Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were labeled for 24 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]AA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with 10 μm BEL for 30 min to inhibit background iPLA2 activity. Cells were then stimulated with 5 μm A23187 in serum-free media (plus 0.3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin). Aliquots of media and cell lysate were counted by liquid scintillation for radioactivity.Prostaglandin E2 Generation—HUVECs were cultured to the required cell density in 6-well culture dishes. Cells were washed and then in some cases incubated with 50 μm AACOCF3 and/or 10 μm BEL for 30 min prior to treatment with 5 μm A23187 in HEPES/Tyrode's buffer with 1 mm CaCl2 for 15 min. Aliquots of media were assayed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) content using a high sensitivity ELISA (Assay Designs).RNA Interference—HUVECs were transfected with either no siRNA (control), 50 nm nontargeting control siRNA (mock; D-001210-01; Dharmacon), or 50 nm annealed annexin A1 siRNA (siRNA; 593139; Ambion) for 4 h using the Lipo-fectamine2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were recovered for 48 h prior to lysis.RESULTSCytosolic Ca2+ Elevation Targets cPLA2α to Intracellular Membranes in Subconfluent Endothelial Cells—cPLA2α activity is greater in subconfluent endothelial cells than in quiescent, confluent endothelial cells (15Whatley R.E. Satoh K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that subconfluent and confluent endothelial cells (see supplemental Fig. 1) express equal amounts of cPLA2α (16Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that mechanisms other than control of cPLA2α expression are responsible for confluence-dependent changes in its activity. In response to elevated cytosolic Ca2+, cPLA2α is activated by relocation to intracellular membranes. Recruitment to specific membranes is required for the regulation of cPLA2α activity (2Hirabayashi T. Murayama T. Shimizu T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Murakami M. Das S. Kim Y. Cho W. Kudo I. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); however, the precise membranes to which cPLA2α relocates in primary endothelial cells have not been defined. Therefore, we investigated the Ca2+-induced relocation of cPLA2α.In HUVECs, cPLA2α was detectable as a 110 kDa band by Western blotting using a well characterized affinity-purified antibody specific to the C-terminal region of cPLA2α (16Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Grewal S. Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, the immunoreactivity was removed by preabsorption of the antibody with the antigenic peptide (supplemental Fig. 2A). By immunofluorescence microscopy, cPLA2α was present as both diffuse and structured pools throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of subconfluent HUVECs (supplemental Fig. 2B), similar to previous observations with endothelial cells and fibroblasts (16Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Bunt G. de Wit J. van den Bosch H. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2449-2459PubMed Google Scholar, 33Grewal S. Morrison E.E. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4533-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To study the relocation of cPLA2α in response to cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, we used the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. This agent is ideal for studying confluence-dependent changes in cPLA2α relocation, since A23187 raises cytosolic Ca2+ to similar levels in both subconfluent and confluent endothelial cells (supplemental Fig. 2C). Signaling mediated by other agonists that elevate cytosolic Ca2+ varies with endothelial cell density (34Grazia Lampugnani M. Zanetti A. Corada M. Takahashi T. Balconi G. Breviario F. Orsenigo F. Cattelino A. Kemler R. Daniel T.O. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 35Sorby M. Ostman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10963-10966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In subconfluent HUVECs, upon elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, cPLA2α relocated to the nuclear periphery and less disperse cytoplasmic structures (see supplemental Fig. 2). Relocation occurred rapidly (<1 min) and cPLA2α immunoreactivity co-distributed extensively with calreticulin and ERGIC-53 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2, D-E), consistent with translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) (36Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 37Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of this co-localization revealed a 2.5-fold increase in overlap between cPLA2α and calreticulin and a 2.3-fold increase in overlap between cPLA2α and ERGIC-53 upon A23187 treatment (Fig. 1A). A23187-induced relocation of cPLA2α to the ER and ERGIC promoted its interaction with membrane substrate, resulting in a 12-fold increase in AA release from subconfluent cells (Fig. 1B).cPLA2α Is Coupled to COX-1 and -2 in Subconfluent Endothelial Cells—AA may be converted into prostaglandin H2 by the action of the COX enzymes. Targeting of cPLA2α to the specific intracellular membranes in which COX enzymes are located can lead to the coupling of these enzymes to facilitate efficient conversion of AA into prostaglandins (2Hirabayashi T. Murayama T. Shimizu T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Murakami M. Das S. Kim Y. Cho W. Kudo I. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Functional coupling does not require the direct interaction of AA synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes but relies on both enzymes being in close apposition. Consequently, AA released by cPLA2α is statistically more likely to encounter the required downstream enzyme than if synthesized at a distant site. Despite the central importance of prostaglandins to numerous vascular processes, including angiogenesis (12Vane J.R. Anggard E.E. Botting R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar, 13Simmons D.L. Botting R.M. Hla T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 387-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), this functional coupling between AA release and prostaglandin synthesis has never been investigated in endothelial cells. We predicted that recruitment of cPLA2α to the ER of subconfluent HUVECs would promote functional coupling, since both COX-1 and -2 are located at the ER of endothelial cells (39Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 273: 9886-9893Google Scholar).Subconfluent cells were stimulated to elevate intracellular Ca2+, and the co-distribution of cPLA2α with COX-1 and -2 was assessed (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 2, F and G). Quantitation revealed a 3.2-fold increase in overlap between cPLA2α and COX-1 and a 2.3-fold increase between cPLA2α and COX-2 upon cytosolic Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 1C). We then assessed the ability of subconfluent HUVECs to generate PGE2, a major downstream product of both COX-1 and -2 activity (Fig. 1D). PGE2 plays a key role in a variety of key vascular processes, such as angiogenesis and the regulation of vascular tone (40Kamiyama M. Pozzi A. Yang L. DeBusk L.M. Breyer R.M. Lin P.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 41Tang L. Loutzenhiser K. Loutzenhiser R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prior to A23187 treatment, PGE2 generation was minimal (0.35 pg/1000 cells) but rose 24-fold upon cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Pretreatment of HUVECs with BEL, an inhibitor of iPLA2 activity (42Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), had no effect on Ca2+-induced PGE2 generation. This suggests that iPLA2-mediated AA release is not involved in PGE2 production in endothelial cells. Inhibition of cPLA2α with AACOCF3 (43Street I. Lin H.K. Laliberte F. Ghomashchi F. Wang Z. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Huang Z. Weeck P.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5935-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) inhibited PGE2 generation by 88% (Fig. 2D). Thus, Ca2+-induced PGE2 generation was almost entirely dependent on cPLA2α activity. The maximal capacity of the cells to produce PGE2 was assessed by incubating cells with excess exogenous AA. Exogenous AA reversed the inhibitory effect of AACOCF3 but did not elevate PGE2 generation any higher than that liberated by cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Thus, specific targeting of cPLA2α to the ER/ERGIC and co-localization with the COX enzymes appears to result in maximal conversion of AA into PGE2. This demonstrates coupling between these enzymes in endothelial cells and indicates that release of AA by cPLA2α is the rate-limiting step in PGE2 production in endothelial cells.FIGURE 2Sequestration of cPLA2α at the Golgi apparatus inhibits membrane recruitment. A, the localization of cPLA2α insubconfluent (sub-confl.) and confluent (confl.) HUVECs was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy.

Similar results were obtained with recombinant GFP-tagged cPLA2α (N-terminal and C-terminal linked constructs; Fig. 2B) and with a separate antibody targeted to the C terminus of cPLA2α (supplemental Fig. 3).

The enzyme catalyzing this reaction, termed tRNA A:34 deaminase, is the heterodimeric Tad2p/ADAT2·Tad3p/ADAT3 complex in eukaryotes. In budding yeast, deletion of each subunit is lethal, indicating that the wobble inosine tRNA modification is essential for viability; however, most of its physiological roles remain unknown. To identify novel cell cycle mutants in fission yeast, we isolated the tad3-1 mutant that is allelic to the tad3+ gene encoding a homolog of budding yeast Tad3p. Interestingly, the tad3-1 mutant cells principally exhibited cell cycle-specific phenotype, namely temperature-sensitive and irreversible cell cycle arrest both in G1 and G2. Further analyses revealed that in the tad3-1 mutant cells, the S257N mutation that occurred in the catalytically inactive Tad3 subunit affected its association with catalytically active Tad2 subunit, leading to an impairment in the A to I conversion at position 34 of tRNA. In tad3-1 mutant cells, the overexpression of the tad3+ gene completely suppressed the decreased tRNA inosine content. Notably, the overexpression of the tad2+ gene partially suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype and the decreased tRNA inosine content, indicating that the tad3-1 mutant phenotype is because of the insufficient I34 formation of tRNA.

There exist far fewer tRNA genes than the 61 codons specifying amino acids, hence many tRNAs must be capable of recognizing more than one codon. It has been known that inosine (I) occurs at position 34 (the first anticodon position or wobble position) of tRNA (1Holley R.W. Everett G.A. Madison J.T. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2122-2128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is believed that when present at the wobble position, inosine can pair degenerately with U, C, or adenosine, enabling a single tRNA to recognize up to three different codons (2Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). This modification occurs in eight cytoplasmic tRNAs in higher eukaryotes (seven in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in tRNAArg from prokaryotes and plant chloroplasts (3Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Inosine at the wobble position is formed by the hydrolytic deamination of a genomically encoded adenosine (A), and the enzyme catalyzing this reaction is termed tRNA A:34 deaminase. In budding yeast, it has been shown that tRNA A:34 deaminase is a heterodimer formed by the sequence-related subunits Tad2p and Tad3p, both of which contain cytidine deaminase motifs (C/H)XEXnPCXXC (where X denotes any amino acid, and n is any number of residues) (4Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). According to mechanistic and structural studies of bacterial and eukaryotic cytidine deaminases, the active site of these enzymes has a zinc ion tetrahedrally coordinated to either a histidine and two cysteine residues or three cysteine residues; the fourth ligand is a zinc-activated water. Proton shuttling during the hydrolytic deamination reaction is mediated by a conserved glutamate (5Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6Chung S.J. Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Xie K.

The absence of the essential glutamate residue in the putative Tad3p deaminase domain suggests that Tad3p is catalytically inactive and that Tad2p is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Each subunit is encoded by an essential gene (TAD2 and TAD3), indicating that I34 of tRNAs is an essential base modification for viability. However, most of its physiological roles remain unknown. In this study using fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we screened for mutants that showed temperature-sensitive growth arrest but did not accumulate phloxin B (a red dye staining dead cells), and we isolated a tad3-1 mutant that was allelic to the tad3+ gene encoding a homolog of budding yeast Tad3p. Surprisingly, the phenotypic characterizations of the tad3-1 mutant indicated that cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 was the principal outcome in the tad3 mutation. Further analyses revealed that in the tad3-1 mutant cells, the S257N mutation that occurred in Tad3 deaminase domain destabilized a Tad2·Tad3 enzyme complex, leading to a reduced activity of tRNA A:34 deaminase. These findings suggest that wobble inosine tRNA modification plays an important role in cell cycle progression.

Isolation of KP186 Strain—The KP186 strain was isolated in a screen of cells that had been mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine (8Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). Cells of HM123 strain were mutagenized with 300 μm nitrosoguanidine (Sigma) for 60 min (∼10% survival) as described previously. Mutants, in appropriate dilutions, were seeded onto YPD plates and incubated at 27 °C for 4 days. The plates were then replica-plated onto YPD plates containing 5 μg/ml phloxin B red dye, which accumulated in dead cells (10Kohli J. Hottinger H. Munz P. Strauss A. Thuriaux P. Genetics. 1977; 87: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated at 36 °C for 1–2 days. Mutants that showed temperature sensitivity but were not stained red by phloxin B were selected. The original mutants isolated were backcrossed three times to wild-type strains HM123 or HM528. Gene Cloning—To clone the mutated gene, KP186 cells were transformed with a fission yeast genomic DNA library constructed in the pDB248 vector and were grown at 27 °C. The Leu+ transformants were replica-plated onto YPD plates at 36 °C, and the plasmid DNA was recovered from the transformants that showed a plasmid-dependent rescue. By DNA sequencing, the suppressing plasmids fell into a single class that contained the tad3+ gene (SPAP27G11.04). To investigate the genetic relationship between the mutated gene and the tad3+ gene, linkage analysis was performed as follows. The tad3+ gene was subcloned into the pUC-derived plasmid containing budding yeast LEU2 gene. Using this construct, the LEU2 gene was integrated by homologous recombination into the tad3+ gene locus of the genome of KP207. The integrant was mated with KP186 strain, and the resultant diploid was sporulated. When the tetrads were dissected, only parental ditype tetrads were found, indicating that the mutated gene was tightly linked to the tad3+ gene locus. Microscopic Analysis—Techniques in fluorescence microscopy such as the localization of the GFP-tagged proteins were performed as described previously (11Kita A. Sugiura R. Shoji H. He Y. Deng L. Lu Y. Sio S.O. Takegawa K. Sakaue M. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2920-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcofluor staining was performed as described previously (11Kita A. Sugiura R. Shoji H. He Y. Deng L. Lu Y. Sio S.O. Takegawa K. Sakaue M. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2920-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FACS Analysis—Cells were collected by centrifugation and fixed in ethanol at 4 °C overnight. After washing with 1 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, the fixed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mm sodium citrate and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for at least 2 h. Before analysis, the cells were briefly sonicated and stained with propidium iodide at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. Ten thousand cells were collected with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and data were analyzed with Cell Quest 4.0 software. Nitrogen source starvation was done as described previously (12Saka Y. Yanagida M. Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in EMM medium to mid-log phase at 27 °C, washed four times with EMM without NH4Cl, and then cultured in EMM without NH4Cl at 27 °C for 36 h. The FACS analysis confirmed that the cells were arrested in the G1 phase. Arrested cells were released from the G1 block by switching them to YPD medium. Sequence Analysis of tRNAAla—Total RNA was isolated from cultures of cells grown to mid-log phase at 27 °C by the method of Kohrer and Domdey (13Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). RNA was further treated with RNase-free DNase. RT was performed using 1 μg of total RNA as a template with tRNAAla(AGC)-specific reverse primer (5′-CGC GGA TCC TGG ACA AGC CAG AAC TCG AAT C-3′). PCR was then performed using 1 μl of the RT reaction as a template with tRNAAla(AGC)-specific forward (5′-CGC GGA TCC GGG CAT GTG GTG TAG ATG GTT A-3′) and reverse primers. Controls included a negative control in which the RT reaction without RT was used as a template to test for DNA contamination in the RNA sample and a positive control for amplification in which the genomic DNA was used as a template. The PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene), and the individual clones were sequenced. Gene Expression—The full coding sequences of Tad2 and Tad3 were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from wild-type strain as a template. The PCR primers used were as follows: Tad2F (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG GCA GGA GAT AGT GTG AAA AG-3′) and Tad2R (5′-CGC GGA TCC TTA TTT GAA ACG AGA TAA ATC CAA AC-3′); Tad3F (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG GTG AAA ACT AAT ATT TCT AA-3′) and Tad3R (5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GAC ATG AAT ATT CTC CTT-3′). The Tad3S257N coding sequence was also amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA from KP186 strain as a template. These PCR fragments were ligated to the C terminus of GFP or GST and subcloned into the pREP1 expression vector, containing a thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (14Maundrell K. Gene. 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Expression was induced by the incubation of the cells in EMM lacking thiamine. To obtain cells expressing GFP-Tad2 from the chromosomally integrated gene, the fused gene was subcloned into the vector containing a nmt1 promoter and a ura4+ marker, and was integrated into the chromosome at the ura4+ gene locus of KP1248 cells as described (11Kita A. Sugiura R. Shoji H. He Y. Deng L. Lu Y. Sio S.O. Takegawa K. Sakaue M. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2920-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cheng H. Sugiura R. Wu W. Fujita M. Lu Y. Sio S.O. Kawai R. Takegawa K. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2963-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assay—Cells expressing GFP-Tad2 from the chromosomally integrated gene were transformed with pREP1-GST, pREP1-GST-Tad3, or pREP1-GST-Tad3S257N, and were cultured at 27 °C for 20 h in EMM without thiamine to induce the gene expression. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold homogenizing buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of the protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml phosphoramidon, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Glass beads were then added, and the cells were homogenized using a Mini-Beadbeater (BioSpec Products) at 5,000 rpm for 30 s, after which the tubes were placed on ice for 1 min. Homogenization and cooling were repeated three times, after which the glass beads and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. GST-fused proteins in the protein extracts were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP and -GST antibodies. Mass Spectrometry—Crude tRNA was isolated from cultures of cells grown to mid-log phase at 27 °C as described previously (16Noma A. Kirino Y. Ikeuchi Y. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2), and treated with 500 μl of neutral pH phenol/chloroform by shaking for 3 h at room temperature. RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation from the aqueous phase and then dissolved in sterile water. 1-μg aliquot of the RNA sample was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, and the gel staining with ethidium bromide confirmed that almost all of the RNA sample was from tRNA. To analyze RNA nucleosides, a 20-μg aliquot of the crude tRNA obtained from each strain was digested to nucleosides with nuclease P1 (Yamasa) and bacterial alkaline phosphatase derived from Escherichia coli strain C75 (BAP.C75, Takara) for 3 h at 37 °C and was analyzed by LC/MS using ion-trap MS as described previously (17Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Nucleosides were separated by an ODS reverse-phase column (Intertsil ODS3 5 μm, 2.1 × 250 mm, GL Science) using an HP1100 liquid chromatography system (Agilent). The solvent consisted of 0.1% acetonitrile in 5 mm NH4OAc (pH 5.3) (solvent A) and 60% acetonitrile in H2O (solvent B) in the following gradients: 1–35% B in 0–35 min, 35–99% B in 35–40 min, 99% B in 40–50 min, 99-1% B in 50–50.1 min, and 1% B in 50.1–60 min. The chromatographic effluent was directly conducted to the ESI source to ionize the separated nucleosides, which were analyzed on an LCQ DUO ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo-Electron). The mass spectrometer was operated with a spray voltage of 5 kV and a capillary temperature of 245 °C. The sheath gas flow rate was 95 arb, and auxiliary gas flow rate was 5 arb. Positive ions were scanned over a m/z range of 100–900. Isolation of KP186 Mutant—To identify novel temperature-sensitive cell cycle mutants in fission yeast, we screened for mutants that showed a temperature-sensitive growth arrest but did not accumulate phloxin B (a red dye that stains dead cells) at the restrictive temperature. An initial screen from 200,000 nitrosoguanidine-treated wild-type cells identified two complementation groups (data not shown). The mutant KP186, belonging to one of the two complementation groups, was selected to identify the mutated gene. KP186 mutant cells grew at 27 °C, but cells failed to grow at 33 °C or at a higher temperature (Fig. 1A). KP186 Mutant Cells Exhibited Temperature-sensitive Cell Cycle Arrest in G1 and G2—Next, we examined the phenotypic changes in the cells that were subjected to a temperature upshift. Wild-type and KP186 cells expressing Sad1-GFP to visualize spindle pole bodies (SPBs) were grown to mid-log phase at 27 °C in liquid YPD medium, and then each culture was divided into two portions. One portion was maintained at 27 °C, whereas the remaining portion was shifted to 36 °C for 8 h. The cells were collected and stained with Calcofluor to visualize septa (Fig. 1B). Two lines of evidence suggest that the KP186 phenotype is associated with cell cycle. First, even at 27 °C, KP186 cells were slightly longer than wild-type cells, and this cell elongation was more evident when temperature was upshifted to 36 °C (Fig. 1, B and C). Second, upon temperature upshift to 36 °C in KP186 cells, the frequency of mitotic cells characterized by duplicated SPBs and/or septa significantly decreased, whereas in wild-type cells, the frequency of mitotic cells remained unchanged (Fig. 1, B and D). The above-mentioned phenotype prompted us to check whether the KP186 mutant had a defect in cell cycle progression. FACS analysis showed that KP186 cells incubated at 36 °C in liquid YPD medium consistently showed post-replicative DNA content (Fig. 1E), confirming that KP186 cells arrested in the G2 phase at the restrictive temperature. When first arrested in the G1 phase at 27 °C by nitrogen starvation and then released from the G1 block at 36 °C, KP186 cells, unlike wild-type cells, could not initiate the S phase and remained arrested in the G1 phase (Fig. 1F). In addition, we found that the longer preincubated at the restrictive temperature of 36 °C, the more KP186 cells failed to grow when shifted back to 27 °C (Fig. 1G), suggesting that growth arrest induced by temperature upshift in KP186 cells was irreversible. These results showed that the temperature-sensitive phenotype of KP186 cells was because of the irreversible cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 at the restrictive temperature. KP186/tad3-1 Is a Novel Allele of the tad3+Gene Which Encodes a Non-catalytic Subunit of tRNA A:34 Deaminase—To clarify the mechanism of cell cycle arrest in KP186 cells, the mutated gene in KP186 strain was cloned by complementation of the temperature-sensitive growth arrest (Fig. 2A). Nucleotide sequencing of the cloned DNA fragment revealed that the mutated gene was SPAP27G11.04, which encoded a 315-amino acid homolog of budding yeast Tad3p, a catalytically inactive subunit of tRNA A:34 deaminase. Linkage analysis also indicated that the mutated gene was tightly linked to the SPAP27G11.04 locus (data not shown). Hence, we named this gene as tad3+ and the KP186 strain as the tad3-1 mutant. Sequence analysis of the genomic DNA from the tad3-1 mutant revealed that serine at 257 was mutated to asparagine by a G-to-A transition (S257N; AGT→AAT). This missense mutation is located in the evolutionarily conserved deaminase domain (Fig. 2B). The absence of the glutamate residue essential for catalysis in the Tad3 deaminase domain suggests that Tad3 is catalytically inactive. This raises the possibility that the mutation of Tad3 might indirectly affect the enzyme activity of tRNA A:34 deaminase. Impaired Conversion of A34 to I34 in tRNAAla from tad3-1Mutant—Although fission yeast uses four alanine codons GCU, GCC, GCG, and GCA, its genome encodes only three different tRNAAla genes with anticodons AGC, CGC, and TGC (Fig. 3A). This discrepancy implies that tRNA A:34 deaminase converts tRNAAla (AGC) into tRNAAla (IGC), which then pairs with and decodes an alanine codon GCC. Therefore we performed the sequence analysis of tRNAAla (AGC) as one of putative substrates of tRNA A:34 deaminase. With oligonucleotide primers specific for tRNAAla (AGC) (Fig. 3B), RT-PCR was performed on total RNA isolated from wild-type and tad3-1 mutant cells grown at 27 °C. The resultant cDNAs were subcloned, and 15 different clones derived from tad3-1 mutant cells as well as 15 clones from wild-type cells were sequenced. Because I pairs with C during reverse transcription, A to I deamination changes the sequence from A to G. All clones (100%) derived from wild-type cells contained guanosine at position 34 (G34), demonstrating that the genomically encoded A at this position was deaminated to I. On the other hand, 1 out of 15 (7%) clones derived from tad3-1 mutant cells carried guanosine at position 34, whereas the other 14 clones carried adenosine at position 34 (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that the enzyme activity of tRNA A:34 deaminase is indeed impaired in the tad3-1 mutant. Notably, the genomically encoded A at position 37 was consistently changed to T in both RT-PCR products from wild-type and from tad3-1 mutant cells (Fig. 3C). As has been described in budding yeast tRNAAla (18Gerber A. Grosjean H. Melcher T. Keller W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), this might be because A at position 37 is edited to N1-methylinosine (m1I), which base pairs with reduced specificity in the RT reaction. This finding suggests that A37 to m1I37 editing in tRNAAla is not impaired in the tad3-1 mutant. The tad3-1 Mutant Is Hypersensitive to Cycloheximide—As insufficient I34 formation of tRNA in the tad3-1 mutant may affect its decoding system and impair translation step, we then examined the effect of a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CYH) that mainly blocks the elongation process of translation (19Oleinick N.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) on tad3-1 mutant (Fig. 3E). At a low concentration of CYH (10 μg/ml), the growth of tad3-1 mutant was significantly inhibited as compared with that of wild-type cells. At a higher concentration of CYH (20 μg/ml), the growth inhibition of tad3-1 mutant was further exacerbated. These results suggest that translation process is indeed impaired in the tad3-1 mutant. Temperature Sensitivity of tad3-1 Mutant Is Suppressed by the Overexpression of the tad2+Gene Encoding a Catalytic Subunit of tRNA A:34 Deaminase—To further study the mechanism as to how the S257N mutation of non-catalytic Tad3 impairs the enzyme activity of tRNA A:34 deaminase, we performed a genetic screen for multicopy suppressors of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the tad3-1 mutant. This screen resulted in the identification of a single gene that suppressed the temperature sensitivity at 33 °C but not at 36 °C (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame SPBC16D10.10 encoding a 367-amino acid homolog of budding yeast Tad2p, the catalytic subunit of tRNA A:34 deaminase. We therefore named this suppressor gene as tad2+. Indeed, the C-terminal part of fission yeast Tad2 contains an evolutionarily conserved deaminase domain with a full consensus motif, suggesting that Tad2 is catalytically active (Fig. 4B). Given that budding yeast tRNA A:34 deaminase is a heterodimeric enzyme formed by Tad2p and Tad3p proteins (4Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it is possible that Tad2 and Tad3 form similar complex in fission yeast, and that the S257N mutation of Tad3 might affect its association with Tad2, thereby decreasing the amount of the Tad2·Tad3 enzyme complex in the tad3-1 mutant. S257N Mutation of Non-catalytic Tad3 Destabilizes a Tad2·Tad3 Complex—To test the above hypothesis, we investigated the effect of the S257N mutation of Tad3 on the Tad2-Tad3 interaction. Expression of GFP-tagged Tad2 or GST-tagged Tad3 suppressed the temperature sensitivity of tad3-1 mutant cells at 33 °C and at 36 °C, respectively, indicating that these fusion proteins were fully functional (Fig. 5A). In cells expressing GFP-Tad2 from the chromosomally integrated gene, GST, GST-Tad3, or GST-Tad3S257N was expressed from the harboring plasmid at 27 °C. The pull-down experiments showed that GFP-Tad2 associated with GST-Tad3 but not with GST, thus confirming the physical interaction between Tad2 and Tad3. On the other hand, the pull-down for GST-Tad3S257N consistently showed less amount of GFP-Tad2 protein than was seen in the pull-down for GST-Tad3 (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that Tad3S257N was indeed defective in its association with Tad2. This result suggests that the overexpression of Tad2 in the tad3-1 mutant cells may partially suppress the decreased level of the enzyme complex and result in the partial suppression of the temperature-sensitive phenotype. Consistently, the overexpression of GST-Tad3S257N partially but significantly suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the tad3-1 mutant (Fig. 5A). These results also suggest that serine at position 257 in the deaminase domain of Tad3 plays an important role in its interaction with Tad2. Suppression of the tad3-1 Mutant Phenotype Depends on the Recovery of the Wobble Inosine tRNA Modification—We next examined the relationship between the suppression of the tad3-1 mutant phenotype (Figs. 2A and 4A) and the extent of the wobble inosine tRNA modification (Fig. 6). Crude tRNA extracted from each transformant grown at 27 °C was analyzed by LC/MS to measure the tRNA inosine content. Consistent with the decreased wobble inosine modification of tRNAAla (AGC), tRNA inosine content in tad3-1 mutant cells was decreased to 36% as compared with that in wild-type cells. The overexpression of the tad3+ gene in tad3-1 mutant cells completely suppressed the decreased tRNA inosine content. On the other hand, the overexpression of the tad2+ gene in tad3-1 mutant cells partially suppressed the decreased tRNA inosine content. These findings suggest that the phenotype of tad3-1 mutant cells is because of the insufficient I34 formation of tRNA. In the present study, in an attempt to identify novel cell cycle mutants in fission yeast, we isolated the tad3-1 mutant that exhibited temperature-sensitive growth arrest in G1 and G2. Further analyses revealed that in the tad3-1 mutant cells, the S257N mutation that occurred in Tad3 deaminase domain destabilized a Tad2·Tad3 enzyme complex, leading to the reduced activity of tRNA A:34 deaminase. Furthermore, we confirmed that such phenotype of the tad3-1 mutant was suppressed by the recovery of the wobble inosine tRNA modification. These findings demonstrate that the wobble inosine tRNA modification is essential for cell cycle progression in the G1/S and G2/M transitions. This is the first report to link the wobble inosine tRNA modification to cell cycle progression. The tRNAs containing inosine at position 34 are major species, and all belong to the subset of amino acids represented by four codons (20Björk G.R. Söll D. Rajbhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C1995: 165-205Google Scholar). The architectural and functional significance of the base modification is not yet fully understood, however, it is believed that the modified nucleosides can influence the stability and structure of the tRNAs and thus improve the fidelity and efficiency of the tRNAs in decoding the genetic message (20Björk G.R. Söll D. Rajbhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C1995: 165-205Google Scholar, 21Curran J.F. Grosjean H. Benne B Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C1998: 493-516Google Scholar). According to Crickŉs wobble hypothesis(2Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), inosine at position 34 is believed to play a crucial role in protein synthesis by allowing alternative pairing with U, C, or A in the third position of appropriate codons in the mRNA. Moreover, inosine at position 34 in budding yeast tRNAIle has been shown to be a positive determinant for aminoacylation by isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (22Senger B. Auxilien S. Englisch U. Cramer F. Fasiolo F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8269-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that a defect in the I34 formation of the tRNA should impair protein synthesis at different steps and produce a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Surprisingly, the phenotypic characterizations in this study indicate that cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 is the principal outcome in the tad3 mutation. One possible explanation for this unexpected result is that the status of tRNA base modification might be monitored by a kind of cell cycle checkpoint, the activation of which might produce the cell cycle-specific phenotype of tad3-1 mutant. But this checkpoint hypothesis is unlikely based on the following data. First, to examine whether the cell cycle arrest of tad3-1 mutant is dependent on the DNA damage or replication checkpoint, we constructed tad3-1Δcds1 and tad3-1Δchk1 double mutants (KP3364 and KP3365, respectively). Neither of the double mutations broke the cell cycle block at the restrictive temperature, verifying that the tad3-1 mutant cells arrested independently of the DNA damage and replication checkpoints (data not shown). Second, from 10,000 nitrosoguanidine-treated tad3-1 mutant cells, we searched for mutants that grew at the restrictive temperature, but we failed to isolate such mutants (data not shown). Hence based on the above findings, it is more likely that the cell cycle genes could not be efficiently translated in the tad3-1 mutant cells at the restrictive temperature. As mentioned above, the decoding system by inosine-bearing tRNAs contributes to decrease the number of isoacceptor tRNAs and thus enables the efficient translation. Translation is the most energetically expensive process occurring in the exponentially growing cells, and therefore its efficiency is under stringent selective pressure (23Rocha E.P. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although no direct evidence has been presented, fission yeast might have in the process of evolution adopted the decoding system by inosine-bearing tRNAs toward cell cycle genes and have acquired the ability to grow faster by their efficient translation. The cell cycle-specific phenotype of tad3-1 mutant might reflect such a condition. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis and to better understand the cell cycle-specific phenotype of the tad3-1 mutant.

Our results further demonstrate that 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX)-derived, but not cyclooxygenase- or cytochrome P450-dependent epoxygenase-derived AA metabolites, are specifically required for SR-A-dependent adhesion. Because of their role in regulating actin polymerization and cell adhesion, Rac and Cdc42 activation were also examined and shown to be increased via an iPLA2- and LOX-dependent pathway. Together, our results identify a novel role for iPLA2-catalyzed AA release and its metabolism by 12/15-LOX in coupling SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion to Rac and Cdc42 activation. Cell adhesion to the substratum involves cell surface receptors that bind components of the extracellular matrix and initiate intracellular signaling cascades that regulate actin polymerization and focal adhesion formation (for review, see Refs. 1Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H.

In addition, proteoglycans that are up-regulated during inflammation, such as biglycan and decorin, are ligands for SR-A (10Santiago-Garcia J. Kodama T. Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

Macrophages isolated from transgenic mice overexpressing SR-A display increased spreading in culture and enhanced macrophage accumulation in carageenan-induced granulomas in vivo (11Daugherty A.

Furthermore, macrophage activation increases SR-A expression and SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion (12Haworth R. Platt N. Keshav S. Hughes D. Darley E. Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Kodama T. Gordon S. J.

Taken together these observations suggest an important role for SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion in various inflammatory processes characterized by macrophage activation and modification of the extracellular matrix. Macrophages respond to various physiological and pathological stimuli via the activation of intracellular signaling cascades including phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-catalyzed hydrolysis of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids (15Akiba S. Ohno S. Chiba M. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on their location and Ca2+ requirements for enzymatic activity, PLA2s can be classified into three groups: secretory PLA2s that are secreted from cells and require millimolar Ca2+, cytosolic (cPLA2 s) that require micromolar Ca2+, and Ca2+-independent (iPLA2s) that reside in the cytosol of resting cells but do not require Ca2+ for enzymatic activity (16Schaloske R.H. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1246-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Several members of the iPLA2 family are now recognized, and they are designated group VI PLA2 enzymes (17Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The first recognized and best characterized is the group VIA PLA2 (18Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S.

The free AA that is accessible to AA-metabolizing oxygenases is generally thought to be released by the action of either cPLA2 or iPLA2. Whether AA release is involved in regulating SR-A function is not yet known, but this possibility is suggested by the finding that acetylated low density lipoprotein promotes tumor necrosis factor α production in macrophages via a pathway that depends on Ca2+ and PLA2 activation, although the specific receptor mediating this response has not been identified (23Pollaud-Cherion C. Vandaele J. Quartulli F. Seguelas M.H. Decerprit J. Pipy B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, a role for specific PLA2 isoforms in regulating the calcium-independent SR-A adhesion has not been investigated. PLA2-derived AA is subsequently metabolized to produce a variety of biologically active eicosanoids. Enzymes that metabolize AA include cyclooxygenases (COX), which catalyze the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, lipoxygenases (LOX), which catalyze the production of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, lipoxins, and leukotrienes, and cytochrome P450-dependent epoxygenases (CytP450), which synthesize epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (24Natarajan R.

Although AA-derived metabolites are involved in intercellular signaling, recent evidence indicates that AA metabolites also participate in regulating intracellular signaling processes including those involved in actin polymerization (15Akiba S.

Activation of Rho-GTPases, including Rac and Cdc42, plays a key role in coordinating cell adhesion (30Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 31D'Souza-Schorey C. Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell.

Binding of cell surface receptors to the extracellular matrix promotes Rac and Cdc42 activation, which in turn activates additional signaling molecules that ultimately result in the projection of actin-containing fibers and changes in the cytoskeleton that are required for acquiring a spread morphology and firm cell adhesion. In contrast, Rho activation promotes fiber retraction and detachment that are characteristic of migrating cells (33Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Worthylake R.A. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13578-13584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that SR-A mediates macrophage spreading on modified protein (14Nikolic D.M. Cholewa J. Gass C. Gong M.C. Post S.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the potential involvement of Rac and Cdc42 in coupling surface SR-A binding to modified protein with increased macrophage adhesion has not been investigated. The aim of the current study was to determine the potential role for specific PLA2 isoforms and AA metabolites in regulating Rac and Cdc42 activation and SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion to modified protein. For this we used pharmacologic inhibitors of specific AA signaling pathways and macrophages isolated from mice lacking specific AA metabolic enzymes. Our results indicate that iPLA2-catalyzed release of AA and its subsequent metabolism by 12/15-LOX couples SR-A to Rac and Cdc42 activation and macrophage adhesion. Chemicals—Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (DMEM) with l-glutamine, DMEM with 25 mm HEPES without phenol red, and penicillin, streptomycin, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and human plasma fibronectin were purchased from Invitrogen. Ultra low attachment polystyrene 6-well culture plates were purchased from Costar (Corning, NY). SKF525A was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth, PA). AACOCF3 (arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone), bromoenol lactone (BEL, 6E-[bromoethylene]-tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one), cPLA2α inhibitor, MK-886 (3-[p-chlorobenzyl)-5-(isopropyl)-3-t-butylthioindol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethilpropanoic acid, Na), and indomethacin (1-(p-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indole-3-acetic acid) were purchased from Calbiochem. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and prostaglandin E2 enzyme-linked immunoassay kits were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Malondialdehyde bis(dimethyl acetal) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Malondialdehyde Modification of Bovine Serum Albumin—Malondialdehyde-modified BSA (MDA-BSA) was prepared using malondialdehyde bis(dimethyl acetal) as previously described (35Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Protein modification was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-MDA-specific antibody (Academy BioMedical Co., Inc; Houston, TX). Cell Isolation and Culture—Mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) were harvested from wild-type mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), SR-A–/– (University of Kentucky), iPLA2 β–/– mice (prepared and characterized elsewhere (36Bao S.

Daugherty A. Post S.R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 807-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animal care and use for all procedures was done according to protocols reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky. Cell Adhesion Assays—To assess cell spreading, MPM were plated (30,000 cells/well) into four-chambered LAB-TEK slides (Nalge Nunc International; Naperville, IL) precoated with either MDA-BSA or fibronectin and treated with inhibitors as described in the figure legends. Trypan blue exclusion was used to confirm that the treatments did not affect cell viability. After treatments, macrophages were gently washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then blocked with 1% BSA for 30 min before staining with Alexa-Fluor568-conjugated phalloidin and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR). Cells were mounted in Prolong® Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes), and random images of at least 25 cells from at least three independent experiments were digitally captured using a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope. Individual cells were outlined, and total cell area was quantified using Metamorph® software. Rac/Cdc42 Activation Assay—To examine Rac and Cdc42 activation during SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion, cells were treated as described in figure legend 5 and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC assay. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were incubated with the p21 binding domain of PAK1 fused to glutathione S-transferase beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Thep 21 binding domain of PAK binds the GTP-bound (active) form of Rac and Cdc42 but not the GDP-bound state (41Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase-PAK beads were isolated, and the amount of GTP-bound (active) Rac and Cdc42 was quantified by immunoblotting isolated proteins with Rac1 and Cdc42-specific antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. Images were digitally captured and quantified using an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 4000MM. The amount of GTP-bound Rac was normalized to the total amount of Rac or Cdc42 detected in each cell lysate. Statistical Analysis—Experiments were repeated at least three times, and significance among treatment groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance with appropriate post hoc tests using GraphPad Prism. Values with p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. SR-A-mediated Macrophage Adhesion Requires PLA2-mediated AA Release—Macrophages respond to various stimuli via activation of intracellular signaling cascades including the PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of AA from membrane phospholipids. Therefore, we examined the potential role for AA in regulating SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion to MDA-BSA. Malondialdehyde-modified proteins are SR-A ligands and have been previously used to study SR-A function (35Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 42Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether PLA2-mediated AA release plays a role in SR-A-dependent adhesion, peritoneal macrophages isolated from SR-A+/+ or SR-A–/– mice were pretreated with AACOCF3 (30 μm), an inhibitor of cPLA2 and iPLA2, before plating on MDA-BSA-coated slides. After 2 h, macrophage morphology was assessed by staining polymerized actin (F actin) with fluorescently conjugated phalloidin. Consistent with our previous report (14Nikolic D.M. Cholewa J. Gass C. Gong M.C. Post S.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), control (SR-A+/+) macrophages that were allowed to adhere to MDA-BSA for 2 h exhibited enhanced spreading compared with SR-A–/– macrophages (Fig. 1). Importantly, SR-A+/+ and SR-A–/– macrophages spread to the same extent when allowed to adhere to an integrin ligand (14Nikolic D.M. Cholewa J. Gass C. Gong M.C. Post S.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Like SR-A–/– macrophages, macrophages treated with AACOCF3 remained rounded when allowed to adhere to MDA-BSA, which indicates that PLA2 activation is required for SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion. The inhibitory effect of AACOCF3 on macrophage spreading was significantly reversed adding exogenous AA (10 μm), which confirms that AA is required for SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion. Maximal reversal of the effects of PLA2 inhibition was achieved by adding exogenous AA at a concentration of 10 μm, and no further reversal occurred at higher AA concentrations (data not shown). SR-A-mediated Macrophage Adhesion Requires Calcium-independent PLA2-mediated Arachidonic Acid Release—To examine the potential involvement of different PLA2 enzymes in SR-A-mediated adhesion, macrophages were pretreated with BEL, a suicide substrate inhibitor of iPLA2 (43Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or with a specific pyrrolidine inhibitor of cPLA2α (44Seno K. Okuno T. Nishi K. Murakami Y. Watanabe F. Matsuura T. Wada M. Fujii Y. Yamada M. Ogawa T. Okada T. Hashizume H. Kii M. Hara S. Hagishita S. Nakamoto S. Yamada K. Chikazawa Y. Ueno M. Teshirogi I. Ono T. Ohtani M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and then plated on MDA-BSA (Fig. 2). Like macrophages treated with AACOCF3, macrophages treated with BEL (3.0 μm; 30 min) before plating on MDA-BSA remained rounded compared with untreated control macrophages. Furthermore, adding exogenous AA (10 μm) restored SR-A-mediated macrophage spreading after iPLA2 inhibition with BEL. The specific requirement for iPLA2β activity was confirmed using macrophages isolated from iPLA2β–/– mice, which exhibited significantly less spreading on MDA-BSA than did untreated iPLA2 β+/+ control macrophages. The spreading of iPLA2β–/– macrophages plated on MDA-BSA was increased by adding exogenous AA (data not shown). In contrast to the effect of inhibiting iPLA2, treating macrophages with the pyrrolidine cPLA2 inhibitor at a concentration (5 μm) that abolishes calcium-mediated prostaglandin formation (data not shown and Ref. 44Seno K. Okuno T. Nishi K. Murakami Y. Watanabe F. Matsuura T. Wada M. Fujii Y. Yamada M. Ogawa T. Okada T. Hashizume H. Kii M. Hara S. Hagishita S. Nakamoto S. Yamada K. Chikazawa Y. Ueno M. Teshirogi I. Ono T. Ohtani M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) had no effect on SR-A-mediated cell spreading. This result indicates that cPLA2 activity is not required for SR-A-mediated cell adhesion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that iPLA2β-catalyzed AA release is specifically required for SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion to modified protein. SR-A-mediated Macrophage Adhesion Requires 12/15-LOX-derived AA Metabolites—To examine the potential role of AA metabolism in SR-A-mediated adhesion, SR-A+/+ macrophages were pretreated with NDGA, an inhibitor of both 12/15-LOX and 5-LOX enzymes, and the ability of macrophages to spread on MDA-BSA was assessed. Pretreatment with NDGA abolished macrophage spreading on MDA-BSA (Fig. 3). The addition of exogenous AA (10 μm) did not restore the spreading of NDGA-treated macrophages plated on MDA-BSA, which indicates that LOX-derived AA metabolites rather than AA itself are required for SR-A-dependent cell adhesion/spreading. The inhibition of SR-A-mediated macrophage spreading by NDGA suggests a role for LOX-derived products in that process. To determine the specific LOX enzyme(s) required for SR-A-mediated adhesion, we used macrophages isolated from 12/15-LOX–/– mice or from 5-LOX–/– mice or macrophages pretreated with the specific 5-LOX inhibitor MK-866 (Fig. 3). Macrophages isolated from 12/15-LOX–/– mice showed diminished ability to spread on MDA-BSA, which indicates that 12/15-LOX activity is required. In contrast, macrophages that were isolated from 5-LOX–/– mice or treated with the selective 5-LOX inhibitor (MK-886) at a concentration (5 μm) previously shown to inhibit macrophage production of leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (45Peters-Golden M. Feyssa A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 1993; 264: 438-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) spread normally on MDA-BSA. This finding indicates that SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion does not require 5-LOX-derived AA metabolites. In addition to the LOX pathway, CytP450 and COX isoenzymes catalyze the metabolism of AA to biologically active compounds (46Needleman P. Truk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowith J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the potential role for a CytP450 pathway, cells were treated with an inhibitor of CytP450 (SKF525A) at a concentration (10 μm) that inhibits epoxyeicosatrienoic acid production (47Rosolowsky M. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1993; 264: 327-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the ability of cells to spread was assessed. Treating macrophages with SKF525A (Fig. 3) did not affect SR-A-dependent macrophage spreading. To examine the potential involvement of the COX pathway, macrophages were treated with a nonselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 (indomethacin) at a concentration (10 μm) that inhibits prostaglandin production in macrophages (48Zamora R. Bult H. Herman A.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 349: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 49Yamada M. Niki H. Yamashita M. Mue S. Ohuchi K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 1005-1012PubMed Google Scholar). Treating macrophages with indomethacin also failed to affect SR-A-dependent spreading (Fig. 3). Taken together, the data in Fig. 3 indicate that 12/15-LOX-derived products of AA are specifically required for SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion but that AA metabolites produced by CytP450 or COX are not. LOX Metabolism of iPLA2-derived AA Couples SR-A to Rac and Cdc42 Activation—The Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 are important regulators of actin polymerization and formation of the cytoskeletal structures (e.g. lamellipodia and filopodia) involved in cell adhesion. To investigate whether Rac and Cdc42 are activated by SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion to modified protein, macrophages were plated for various intervals on MDA-BSA, and cell lysates were then prepared. The active forms of Rac and Cdc42 were isolated from cell lysates using a fusion protein that binds only the active, GTP-bound form of these GTPases. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, Rac and Cdc42 were both rapidly activated in macrophages that adhere to MDA-BSA. Activation increased significantly after 10 min of adhesion to MDA-BSA and tended to remain above basal after 120 min. Importantly, neither Rac nor Cdc42 activation was detected in SR-A–/– macrophages plated on MDA-BSA (Fig. 4B), which confirms that Rac and Cdc42 activation is SR-A-dependent. To determine whether iPLA2-catalyzed AA release and subsequent metabolism by LOX are required for SR-A-dependent Rac activation, cells were pretreated with inhibitors of iPLA2 or of LOX before assessing Rac activation. Pretreating macrophages with inhibitors of iPLA2 (AACOCF3 or BEL) or LOX (NDGA) prevented activation of both Rac and Cdc42 during SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion/spreading (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results indicate that the Rac and Cdc42 activation during SR-A-dependent macrophage adhesion requires metabolism of iPLA2-derived AA by LOX. Specific roles for intracellular signaling cascades in regulating SR-A function continue to be elucidated (14Nikolic D.M. Cholewa J. Gass C. Gong M.C. Post S.R. Am. J. Physiol.

In the current study we examined the potential role for PLA2-catalyzed AA release and subsequent AA metabolism in SR-A-mediated cell adhesion using pharmacological inhibitors and macrophages isolated from genetically modified mice lacking iPLA2β or specific AA oxygenases. Both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent PLA2 enzymes are involved in intracellular signaling in macrophages (55Teslenko V. Rogers M. Lefkowith J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 56Lefkowith J.B. Lennartz M.R. Rogers M. Morrison A.R. Brown E.J. J.

We found that AACOCF3, an inhibitor of both cPLA2 and iPLA2, abolished SR-A-mediated macrophage spreading on modified protein. Using a specific pyrrolidine cPLA2α inhibitor and the specific iPLA2 inhibitor (BEL) and macrophages isolated from iPLA2 β–/– mice, we further show that iPLA2β activity is specifically required for SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion/spreading. PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids produces a free fatty acid (e.g. AA) and a 2-lysophospholipid, each of which can have biologic activity. The ability of exogenous AA to restore SR-A-mediated spreading to iPLA2 β–/– macrophages or to macrophages treated with BEL confirms that AA is an important mediator of SR-A-mediated macrophage adhesion. Intracellular AA can be rapidly metabolized to bioactive eicosanoids by various oxygenases, including those of the LOX, COX, and CytP450 families. Inhibition of LOX with NDGA abolished macrophage spreading on MDA-BSA, but neither the COX inhibitor indomethacin nor the CytP450 inhibitor SKF525A affected macrophage spreading. These findings suggest that AA metabolites produced by LOX are specifically required for SR-A-mediated adhesion/spreading. A specific requirement for 12/15-LOX activity was demonstrated using macrophages isolated from 12/15-LOX–/– mice, in which SR-A-mediated spreading was abolished. In contrast, macrophages isolated from 5-LOX–/– mice spread normally as did macrophages isolated from wild-type mice and treated with the 5-LOX inhibitor MK-866. These data indicate that 5-LOX is not involved in SR-A-mediated macrophage spreading. Exogenous AA failed to restore spreading to wild-type macrophages in which 12/15-LOX was inhibited by NDGA or to macrophages from 12/15-LOX–/– mice, which confirms that a metabolite of AA produced by 12/15-LOX rather than AA itself is required for the spreading response. Activation of Rac and Cdc42, members of the Rho-like GTPase family, coordinates changes in cell morphology during cell adhesion by promoting assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton (30Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 31D'Souza-Schorey C. Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell.

Like other G proteins, activation of Rac and Cdc42 requires GDP/GTP exchange, which is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Several nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been identified, and mechanisms that regulate these GEFs continue to be elucidated (for review, see Refs. 58Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar and 59Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). In addition to nucleotide exchange factors, RhoGTPases are regulated by interactions with guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (for review, see Refs. 60DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar and 61Dransart E. Olofsson B. Cherfils J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ability of AA metabolites to regulate Rac and Cdc42 has been suggested previously (62Chuang T.H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, it has been reported that AA promotes Rac and Cdc42 activation in a COX-2-dependent manner (63Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that various biologically active lipids, including AA, can disrupt the interaction of Rac with Rac-guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (62Chuang T.H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulating Rac/Cdc42 activation, other studies have demonstrated that Rac activation promotes cPLA2-catalyzed AA release (65Woo C.-H. Kim B.-C. Kim K.-W. Yoo M.-H. Eom Y.-W. Choi E.-J. Sun Na D. Kim J.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 66Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.-G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The findings that Rac activation may either precede or follow AA release suggests a complex relationship between RhoGTPase activation and AA release. To our knowledge ours is the first study to demonstrate that 12/15-LOX metabolism of AA released by iPLA2 mediates Rac or Cdc42 activation. Thus, our findings identify a novel pathway for regulating Rac and Cdc42 activation. Diverse chronic inflammatory diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer disease are characterized by modifications of extracellular matrix components. Such modifications result in formation of SR-A ligands, and SR-A may contribute to macrophage accumulation at specific inflammatory sites. For example, SR-A recognizes glycated proteins formed as a result of the hyperglycemia accompanying diabetes (7el Khoury J. Thomas C.A. Loike J.D. Hickman S.E. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10197-10200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that SR-A contributes to enhanced glomerular macrophage accumulation in diabetic animals suggests a role for SR-A in diabetes-induced complications, such as nephropathy (67Horiuchi S. Unno Y. Usui H. Shikata K. Takaki K. Koito W. Sakamoto Y.-I. Nagai R. Makino K. Sasao A. Wada J.U.N. Makino H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1043: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, extracellular matrix proteoglycans that are up-regulated in atherosclerotic plaques are adhesion substrates for SR-A, which suggests that SR-A may contribute to macrophage adhesion and retention in atherosclerotic lesions (10Santiago-Garcia J. Kodama T. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6942-6946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An additional role for SR-A in Alzheimer disease is suggested by the finding that SR-A mediates adhesion of microglia to β-amyloid fibril-coated surfaces (6El Khoury J. Hickman S.E. Thomas C.A. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J.D. Nature. 1996; 382: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Accumulation of SR-A ligands at sites where macrophage accumulate suggests that SR-A-mediated adhesion may participate in chronic inflammatory diseases. Macrophage expression of both SR-A and 12/15-LOX can be altered during chronic inflammation, such as that associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes (68Fukuhara-Takaki K. Sakai M. Sakamoto Y.-I.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 3297-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Changes in SR-A and 12/15-LOX expression can have important effects on the inflammatory process. For example, the involvement of 12/15-LOX in lipid peroxidation, cytokine expression, and monocyte recruitment indicates that 12/15-LOX-derived metabolites are proinflammatory (73Cyrus T. Pratico D.

Thus, inhibiting SR-A or components of its downstream adhesion signaling pathway, including iPLA2β and 12/15-LOX, might be therapeutically beneficial in chronic inflammatory diseases. Overall, our results identify a novel role for iPLA2β and 12/15-LOX in coupling SR-A to Rac and Cdc42 activation and macrophage adhesion. An implication of our results is that SR-A-mediated adhesion might promote inflammation by increasing macrophage retention at sites of extracellular matrix modification and by activating signaling pathways in which AA and its metabolites participate.

https://openalex.org/W2027209802,"PII is an important signal protein for regulation of nitrogen metabolism in bacteria and plants. We constructed a mutant of glnB, encoding PII, in a heterocystous cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, with a cre-loxP system. The mutant (MP2α) grew more slowly than the wild type under all nitrogen regimens. It excreted a large amount of ammonium when grown on nitrate due to altered activities of glutamine synthetase and nitrate reductase. MP2α had a low nitrogenase activity but was able to form heterocysts under diazotrophic conditions, suggesting that PII is not required for heterocyst differentiation. Analysis of the PII with mass spectroscopy found tyrosine nitration at Tyr-51 under diazotrophic conditions while no phosphorylation at Ser-49 was detected. The strains 51F and 49A, which have PII with mutations of Y51F and S49A, respectively, were constructed to analyze the functions of the two key residues on the T-loop. Like MP2α, they had low nitrogenase activity and grew slowly under diazotrophic conditions. 49A was also impaired in nitrate uptake and formed heterocysts in the presence of nitrate. The up-regulation of ntcA after nitrogen step-down, which was present in the wild type, was not observed in 51F and 49A. While our results showed that the Ser-49 residue is important to the function of PII in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, evidence from the PII pattern of the wild type and 49A in non-denaturing gel electrophoresis suggested that Ser-49 is not modified. The possible physiological roles of tyrosine nitration of PII are discussed. PII is an important signal protein for regulation of nitrogen metabolism in bacteria and plants.

Cyanobacteria are a large group of prokaryotes that carry out oxygenic photosynthetic electron transport that provides reducing power for carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Many cyanobacteria can assimilate different forms of combined nitrogen from their environment. Certain cyanobacteria can also carry out nitrogen fixation. The nitrogen metabolism in cyanobacteria is transcriptionally controlled by NtcA, a transcription factor that belongs to the Crp transcription factor superfamily (1Herrero A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Valladares A. Flores E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Frias J.E. Flores E. Herrero A. Mol.

Another important regulator of nitrogen metabolism in cyanobacteria is PII (4Tsinoremas N.F. Castets A.M. Harrison M.A. Allen J.F. Tandeau de Marsac N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PII proteins are widespread in prokaryotes and plants, and they interact with a number of target proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism (6Arcondeguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). PII proteins function as a sensor of cellular concentration of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) 2The abbreviations used are: 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; 2-DE, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; FT-MS, Fourier transformation mass spectroscopy. 2The abbreviations used are: 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; 2-DE, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; FT-MS, Fourier transformation mass spectroscopy.

Segal A. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2949-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial PII, encoded by glnB, has been studied extensively in unicellular cyanobacteria (4Tsinoremas N.F. Castets A.M. Harrison M.A. Allen J.F. Tandeau de Marsac N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

It has been shown that cyanobacterial PII also functions as a sensor of the intracellular level of 2-OG and binds 2-OG and ATP in a synergistic fashion (12Forchhammer K. Hedler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In unicellular cyanobacteria, except for Prochlorococcus marina (13Panlnska K.A. Laloui W. Bedu S. Luiseaux-de Goer S. Castets A.M. Rippka R. Tandeau de Marsac N. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), evidence from radioisotope labeling and site-directed mutagenesis reveals that PII could be phosphorylated at the position of Ser-49 (14Forchhammer K.

Immunoblotting after non-denaturing gel electrophoresis of cellular proteins shows that the level of phosphorylation of PII proteins correlates with the status of nitrogen limitation (14Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the Ser-49, which is located at the T-loop of PII, is critical to the regulation of the interaction of PII with its targeting proteins (16Heinrich A. Maheswaran M.

Although PII functions as a sensor of the cellular level of 2-OG, which is a signal of heterocyst differentiation (24Laurent S. Chen H. Bédu S. Ziarelli F. Peng L. Zhang C.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The nature of PII modification in heterocystous cyanobacteria is not certain either. The PII pattern of immunoblotting after non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, which could indicate a covalent modification, did not change according to the nitrogen regimens (25Hanson T.E.

However, our evidence shows that PII from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is not modified at Ser-49, whereas a tyrosine nitration at Tyr-51 was identified.

Zhao J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The procedure for glnB deletion with the cre-loxP (28Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) system is as follows. A fragment upstream of the glnB gene was amplified with PCR using primers PUU and PUL (the sequences of these and other primers used in this study are provided in supplemental Table S1) that contain the loxP sequence. The fragment was inserted into pET3d (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 185: 60-89Crossref Scopus (5981) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pET3dx. An erythromycin cartridge was then inserted into pET-3dx, generating pET3dglnBup, which was transformed into the wild type of Anabaena 7120. The transformants were allowed to grow until all chromosomes contained the loxP sequence upstream of the glnB gene, and the strain was named MI-up. A fragment downstream of the glnB gene was amplified with PCR using primers PDU and PDL and digested with BglII and XbaI. The fragment was then inserted into pET3dx, which was digested with the same enzymes. The resultant plasmid was digested with BglII and BamHI, and the generated fragment was inserted into plasmid pBBR-1 (32Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop R.M. Peterson K.M. Gene. 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) that was digested with the same enzymes. A streptomycin cartridge was inserted into the resultant plasmid, generating pBBRglnB-down, which was then transformed into the strain MI-up. The transformants were treated as above. The resultant strain (MI-ud) contained two loxP sequences in the same direction flanking the glnB gene. The homozygous nature of the loxP was confirmed by PCR. The strain MI-ud was then transformed with pRL-25C containing a cre gene under control of the petE promoter (33Ghassemian M. Wong B. Ferreira F. Markley J.L. Straus N.A. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Buikema W.J. Haselkorn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The resultant strain was incubated with 2 μm copper in BG11 medium to induce cre expression, which led to deletion of the sequence between the two loxP sequences (28Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), including glnB. The complete absence of glnB was confirmed by Southern hybridization performed according to Huang et al. (35Huang X. Dong X. Zhao J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4848-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to confirm the deletion of glnB. The templates for probes used in Southern hybridization were synthesized with PCR. Probe 1 was obtained with primers 1U and 1L, and probe 2 was obtained with primers 2U and 2L. The probes were labeled with the random primer extension method. Complement of MP2α with glnB was achieved by transformation of MP2α with pAM505 (36Yoon H.S. Golden J.W. Science. 1998; 282: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) containing different glnB genes. Site-specific mutagenesis of the glnB gene for construction of mutant glnB encoding PII with S49A, Y51F mutations was performed according to Huang et al. (35Huang X. Dong X. Zhao J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4848-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using the primers provided in supplemental Table S1. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Electrophoresis and Mass Spectroscopy—In two-dimensional electrophoretical (2-DE) separation of total soluble proteins from Anabaena 7120, the first dimension for isoelectric focusing was carried out with pre-made gel strips (pH 3-10) from GE Healthcare. The second-dimensional electrophoresis was performed with gels that were 25 cm (width) by 20 cm (length). Proteins after the second-dimensional electrophoresis were either transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for immunoblotting according to Zhao et al. (30Zhao Y. Shi Y. Zhao W. Huang X. Wang D. Brown N. Brand J.J. Zhao J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or stained with Coomassie blue. The pI value of a protein spot was estimated by its position in gel. Calculation of pI of a protein according to its amino acid composition was performed using DNAsis (Hitachi, Beijing, China). The protein spots of interest were extracted from the gels after staining and digested in-gel with trypsin. The generated tryptic peptides were analyzed first with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) to determine their identities. The tryptic peptides from identified PII digestion were then separated with a nano-liquid chromatography system (Micro-Tech Scientific, Vista, CA). The column was 0.15 × 15 mm packed with C18 resin. Buffer A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B was 95% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were eluted during a period of 120 min with a linear gradient from 1 to 50% buffer B at a flow-rate of 0.4 μl·min-1 before they were injected into a coupled Fourier transformation ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS) (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany). The instrument was set to acquire a 0.2-s MS scan from 100 to 2000 Da and a 2-s MS/MS scan of selected precursor in a cycle. MS and MS/MS peaks were picked using the FT-MS algorithm with a signal to noise ratio above 4. The generated MS data were analyzed with the software Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd., London) using the data base of NCBI-nr (060604). Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed according to Forchhammer and Tandeau de Marsac (14Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), followed by electrophoretical transfer of the proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane before detection of PII with anti-PII antibodies. Biochemical Assays—Nitrogenase activity was performed according to Zhao et al. (37Zhao W. Guo Q. Zhao J. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nitrate uptake was measured with a nitrate electrode (Fisher Scientific) that has a sensitivity range of 7.0 μm to 1.0 m. Nitrate reductase activity was measured according to Herrero et al. (38Herrero A. Flores E. Guerrero M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamine synthetase activity was measured according to Orr et al. (39Orr J. Keefer L.M. Keim P. Nguyen T.D. Wellems T. Heinrikson R.L. Haselkorn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13091-13098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excretion of ammonium by Anabaena 7120 was assayed according to the method of Solorzano (40Solorzano L. Limnol. Oceanogr. 1969; 14: 799-801Crossref Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR of ntcA was performed using primers PntcaU and PntcaL according to Huang et al. (35Huang X. Dong X. Zhao J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4848-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with 16 S rRNA as a control. Construction of glnB Mutant of Anabaena 7120—In an attempt to construct a glnB mutant in Anabaena 7120, we first used the SacB-based method (41Cai Y.P. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) but only obtained a meridiploid. 3Y. Zhang and J. Zhao, unpublished results. Because of the success of using the cre-loxP system in constructing conditional mutants in various organisms (42Ghosh K. Van Duyne G.D. Methods. 2002; 28: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we developed a genetic system based on cre-loxP for Anabaena 7120. A detailed outline of the cre-loxP system in mutant construction of the cyanobacteria is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. We successfully obtained a mutant lacking glnB with this system, and it was confirmed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 1, B and C). When the total genome DNA was digested with HincII and hybridized with probe 1 (Fig. 1A), the DNA from the wild type contained a 0.7-kb fragment that hybridized with the probe while the DNA from the mutant had a hybridization band at 2.7 kb (Fig. 1C) as expected from the construction (Fig. 1, A and B). When total DNA was digested with EcoRV and MluI and hybridized with probe 2, which contains glnB, the DNA from the wild type had a band at the expected position of 1.48 kb whereas no fragment hybridized with the probe in the mutant (Fig. 1C), confirming that the glnB is deleted in the mutant. Immunoblotting also revealed that PII was absent in the mutant ( Fig. 1D). We named the mutant MP2α.FIGURE 1Analysis of a glnB mutant of Anabaena 7120 (MP2α) with Southern hybridization and immunoblotting. A, physical map of a DNA fragment containing glnB and its adjacent area of Anabaena 7120. Physical map of the same chromosomal area in MP2α is shown below the physical map of WT.

To study whether Ser-49 was modified in Anabaena 7120, we transformed MP2α with glnB-s49a, which encodes a PII with a S49A mutation, on a low copy shuttle vector pAM505. The strain generated was named 49A. We then performed non-denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting to detect the PII pattern, which indicates the status of PII modification in response to different nitrogen regimens (14Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), in Anabaena 7120 and Synechocystis 6803. One major band was detected in Synechocystis 6803 cells grown with ammonium, whereas there were four bands when the cells were incubated in growth medium without combined nitrogen for 10 h (Fig. 2A). No such pattern change was detected in the wild type and 49A of Anabaena 7120 (Fig. 2, B and C) in response to different nitrogen regimens as immunoblotting showed that there were four bands in these strains under all nitrogen regimens. In heterocysts, there were a major band and a minor band of PII. The major band had a mobility similar to that of the most mobile band of the wild type (Fig. 2D). PII Modification in Anabaena 7120—Because different results of PII modification were reported in different heterocystous cyanobacteria, we investigated the modification of PII in Anabaena 7120. Immunoblotting was performed after 2-DE, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Three protein forms were detected in the wild type Anabaena 7120 grown with ammonium (Fig. 3A), nitrate (Fig. 3B), or under diazotrophic condition (Fig. 3C). The positions of these three protein forms in the two-dimensional gels were identical, and their pI values were 5.7, 7.4, and 9.0. The pI value of 9.0 was close to the calculated value (pI = 9.13) based on the amino acid composition of PII from Anabaena 7120. The spot with pI of 5.7 had a molecular mass that was ∼2 kDa smaller than that of the other two protein forms. The protein form with a pI of 7.4 was a minor protein and it accounted for only ∼10% of total PII. Heterocysts contained only one form of PII, and it had a pI of 9.0 and a molecular mass of intact PII (Fig. 3D). We also analyzed PII of Synechocystis 6803 by 2-DE. One PII with a pI of 7.3, which was close to the calculated pI value (7.20), was detected when the cells were grown in the presence of ammonium (Fig. 3E) while several protein spots with more acidic pI values and a spot with a more basic pI (9.1) were detected when the cells were deprived of combined nitrogen for 10 h (Fig. 3F). We further investigated PII modification with mass spectroscopy. Total soluble proteins of Anabaena 7120 and Synechocystis 6803 were separated with 2-DE, and the PII spots according to the immunoblotting results in Fig. 3 were digested in-gel with trypsin and extracted. The tryptic peptides were separated with nano-liquid chromatography before analysis with FT-MS. We found that PII from Anabaena 7120 grown with molecular nitrogen and the PII from isolated heterocysts had a modification of Tyr-51 nitration because nitrotyrosine was unambiguously detected at that position. Tandem MS detected four different ions that could only be generated from a nitrotyrosine due to an addition of the NO2 group to Tyr-51 (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2). We found no phosphopeptide from Anabaena 7120 PII protein even though we identified nearly all tryptic peptides of the PII (see supplemental Table S2). The protein corresponding to spot 2 in Fig. 3C was more acidic than the calculated pI value of the wild type PII. However, we found no phosphopeptide in this spot. The protein corresponding to spot 1 in Fig. 1A was a truncated PII of Anabaena 7120, and it had a deletion of 19 amino acid residues from its N terminus ( supplemental Table S2). In Synechocystis 6803, a phosphopeptide was detected with FT-MS in spot 2 of the gel from the cells grown in the absence of combined nitrogen (Fig. 3F) while the same peptide was not phosphorylated in PII from Synechocystis 6803 grown with ammonium (data not shown). Characterization of MP2α and glnB Mutant Genes—To investigate the significance of Tyr-51 modification, we constructed glnB-y51f, which encodes a PII with an Y51F mutation. Complement of MP2α with a wild type glnB or glnB-y51f generated strains termed MP2c and 51F, respectively. An attempt to complement MP2α with a mutant glnB encoding the PII lacking the N-terminal 19 residues has not been successful.3 We measured growth rates of Anabaena 7120 strains under different nitrogen regimens, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 (also see supplemental Fig. S3). Under the three nitrogen regimens tested, the growth of MP2α was approximately half as fast as that of the wild type. Complement of MP2α with wild type glnB gene (MP2c) fully restored the growth rates, demonstrating that the slow growth of MP2α was due to the lack of glnB. Another phenotype of MP2α was that it excreted ammonium when grown with nitrate (Fig. 5D). Complement of MP2α with the wild type and mutant glnB genes completely stopped the ammonium excretion. The importance of Ser-49 was demonstrated by the growth curves since replacement of Ser-49 with Ala led to an incomplete complement of MP2α. Compared with MP2α, 49A grew more slowly under the nitrate regimen. Both 51F and 49A grew slowly under diazotrophic condition, and their growth rates were similar to that of MP2α under the same condition (Fig. 5C). Heterocyst differentiation in MP2α appeared normal 24 h after nitrogen step-down (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that heterocyst formation does not require PII. Examination of other strains showed that 49A formed heterocysts when grown with nitrate (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6Heterocyst formation in mutants of Anabaena 7120. A, heterocyst differentiation was normal in MP2α under a nitrogen deprivation condition. B, heterocyst formation in 49A grown with nitrate. Arrows indicate heterocysts. Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Heterocyst formation in 49A and the excretion of ammonium in MP2α under the nitrate regimen suggested that the nitrogen metabolism in these strains was disturbed. Because of the importance of ntcA in nitrogen control, we measured the expression of ntcA in these strains with quantitative PCR (Fig. 7A). The expression of ntcA in the wild type increased more than 2-fold when the cells were subjected to nitrogen step-down for 12 h, and this up-regulation was not observed in 51F and 49A. The glutamine synthetase activity in MP2α grown with nitrate was only 35% of that of the wild type whereas it was abnormally high when grown with ammonium (Fig. 7B). Because the levels of glnA mRNA were similar in all strains (Fig. 7C), the low glutamine synthetase activity of MP2α grown with nitrate was likely due to a decreased enzymatic activity rather than a reduced amount of glutamine synthetase under this condition. Under the nitrate regimen, nitrate reductase activity in MP2α was three times that in the wild type (Fig. 7D). The nitrate uptake activity in 49A was only half that of the wild type (Fig. 7E), suggesting that nitrogen supply could be a limiting factor in 49A when grown with nitrate. We also measured nitrogenase activities with filaments 40 h after nitrogen step-down and found that the nitrogenase activities in MP2α, 49A, and 51F were only 38, 37, and 34% of that in the wild type, respectively (Fig. 7F). PII is the only component of the proteobacterial PII signaling system that is found in cyanobacteria (43Meeks J.C. Elhai J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 94-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In some unicellular cyanobacteria, PII is phosphorylated at Ser-49 and not uridylylated at Tyr-51 as in proteobacteria (5Forchhammer K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A previous attempt at construction of a glnB (encoding PII) mutant in heterocystous cyanobacteria was not successful (25Hanson T.E. Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Meeks J.C. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Laurent S. Forchhammer K. Gonzalez L. Heulin T. Zhang C.-C. Bedu S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The questions concerning the roles of PII in heterocyst differentiation and functions therefore remained unanswered. In this study, we constructed a glnB mutant (MP2α) of Anabaena 7120 by the cre-loxP system (28Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One possible reason for us to be able to obtain a glnB mutant in Anabaena 7120 through the cre-loxP system is that the loxP sequence is first inserted on both sides of the target gene and induction of cre expression occurs only after the target gene with flanking loxP sequence becomes homozygous. Because the cre-loxP system is very efficient (28Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), it is possible that the target gene is deleted on all chromosomes within a short time and the chance for formation of a meridiploid is reduced. We found the cre-loxP system very useful based on our success in mutant construction, including deletion of a 22-kb-large fragment, in Anabaena 7120. The glnB mutant of Anabaena 7120 makes it possible to study the physiological significance of PII and PII modification. The phenotypes of MP2α and several other mutants support that PII interacts with a variety of proteins and regulates their functions (5Forchhammer K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Arcondeguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 7Nifa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Leigh J.A. Dodsworth J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 349-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For example, PII in Anabaena 7120 probably regulates both glutamine synthetase and nitrate reductase, and the low glutamine synthetase activity and high nitrate reductase activity are likely responsible for the excretion of ammonium in MP2α grown with nitrate. The mutation of S49A of PII leads to a partial inhibition of nitrate uptake, which in turn results in heterocyst formation in 49A in the presence of nitrate (Fig. 6). The nitrogenase activity is low in 49A and 51F, suggesting that both Ser-49 and Try-51 are important residues at the T-loop of the PII from Anabaena 7120. These two residues are also important to the up-regulation of ntcA expression when combined nitrogen is deprived (Fig. 7), implying that they could participate in regulation of gene expression controlled by NtcA (44Paz-Yepes J. Flores E. Herrero A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Aldehni F.M. Sauer J. Spielhaupter C. Schmid R. Forchhammer K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2582-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 46Espinosa J. Forchhammer K. Burillo S. Contreras A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for seryl phosphorylation in PII of Anabaena 7120 with mass spectroscopic study. Similar to Nostoc punctiforme (25Hanson T.E. Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Meeks J.C. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Anabaena 7120 does not show any PII pattern change in non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). More evidence for the lack of phosphorylation of PII comes from the results of 2-DE that show that the patterns of protein spots in these gels are unchanged under different nitrogen regimens. Further evidence for the lack of phosphorylation of Ser-49 is that our S49 mutant shows the same PII pattern as that of the wild type, indicating that the pattern of PII could not be due to a modification of Ser-49. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser-49 in PII of Synechocystis 6803 is identified under nitrogen-limiting conditions (Fig. 4). This result provides biochemical evidence that PII in Synechocystis 6803 could be phosphorylated. It also suggests that it is unlikely that the lack of phosphopeptides in PII from Anabaena 7120 was due to loss of a phosphate group during the sample preparation procedure. The lack of Ser-49 modification in PII of Anabaena 7120 reported here is different from the results reported by Laurent et al. (26Laurent S. Forchhammer K. Gonzalez L. Heulin T. Zhang C.-C. Bedu S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), who showed the PII pattern detected by immunoblotting changed according to nitrogen regimens. The reason for the discrepancy is not known at the moment. It is noticed that Laurent et al. (26Laurent S. Forchhammer K. Gonzalez L. Heulin T. Zhang C.-C. Bedu S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) used wild type Anabaena 7120 for construction of their mutant strain S49A whereas our 49A is constructed in a strain with a glnB-less background. The PII pattern of Anabaena 7120 in non-denaturing gel could be due to a different combination of the full-length PII and the truncated PII in PII trimer formation because tyrosine nitration does not change the pI value of the modified protein. The PII form with pI of 7.4 in Anabaena 7120 (Fig. 3) only accounted for less than 10% of total PII and would be unlikely to influence the PII pattern in non-denaturing gel significantly. Tyrosine nitration at Tyr-51 of PII is detected in Anabaena 7120 under diazotrophic conditions. Usually, tyrosine nitration occurs through oxidation of tyrosine either by peroxynitrite or heme-based peroxidase (48Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4003-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). It has been noted that deprivation of combined nitrogen created an oxidative environment in heterocystous cyanobacteria (49Liu Y. Zhou R. Zhao J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 50Hunsucker S.W. Klage K. Slaughter K.S. Potts M. Helm R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 317: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This could lead to formation of nitrotyrosine at Tyr-51. Protein nitration has been shown to occur in animal tissues such as the cardiovascular system under oxidative stress, and its physiological significance has been recognized (51Peluffo G. Radi R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Addition of a -NO2 at tyrosine adds a bulky group to the phenolic ring and could lower the pKa of the OH group of the tyrosine. This could lead to a change of protein conformation (48Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4003-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). In analyzing proteins from isolated heterocysts by native gel electrophoresis, we observed a minor PII band and a major PII band. On the other hand, only one spot of PII was observed in isolated heterocysts in 2-DE. We speculate that the minor PII band in the native gel could be the PII with tyrosine nitration. Incubation with SDS results in loss of conformation of the two PII forms, and therefore only one spot was observed in 2-DE. Both gain of function (52Cassina A. Hodara R. Souza J. Thomson L. Castro L. Ischiropoulos H. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and loss of function (53MacMillan-Chow L.A. Crow J.P. Kerby J.D. Beckman J.S. Thompson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11853-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) have been reported in proteins due to tyrosine nitration. In Anabaena 7120, PII nitration is unlikely to be involved in loss of function because that would require all PII or nearly all PII to be nitrated. Another possibility is that tyrosine nitration of PII in heterocysts leads to a gain of function. The growth of 51F with nitrate is faster than MP2α, suggesting that the gene glnB-y51f is functional and able to complement the mutant under the nitrate regimen. However, the gene glnB-y51f is unable to complement MP2α under diazotrophic conditions, indicating Tyr-51 is important for nitrogen fixation. It is well established that PII in proteobacteria is uridylylated at Tyr-51 under a nitrogen-limiting condition (7Nifa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Leigh J.A. Dodsworth J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 349-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Tyr-51 is located on the T-loop of PII, and this loop is critical to the binding of 2-OG (36Yoon H.S. Golden J.W. Science. 1998; 282: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Modification of Tyr-51 by uridylylation has an effect of reinforcing the signal of no combined nitrogen (7Nifa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Leigh J.A. Dodsworth J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 349-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Addition of an electrophilic -NO2 group at Tyr-51 could have a similar effect as uridylylation except that the modification is irreversible. This kind of modification, however, might be suitable for heterocyst functions. Heterocysts are terminally differentiated cells, and there is plenty of combined nitrogen in heterocysts because of nitrogen fixation. Although glutamate synthase is absent in heterocysts (47Martin-Figueroa E. Navarro F. Florencio F.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 55Thomas J. Meeks J.C. Wolk C.P. Shaffer P.W. Austin S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aminotransferases are active in heterocysts (55Thomas J. Meeks J.C. Wolk C.P. Shaffer P.W. Austin S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could lead to less availability of 2-OG. A PII with a Tyr-51 nitration could amplify a signal of 2-OG so that heterocysts can carry out nitrogen fixation and ammonium assimilation in the presence of ammonium and glutamine. On the other hand, it is also possible that the nitrotyrosine formed under diazotrophic condition is a passive modification resulting from oxidative stress and senescence of heterocysts. The inability for glnB-y51f to complement MP2α could reflect a fact that the hydroxyl group of Try-51 is critical to PII function and therefore a Phe residue could not replace Tyr-51. Further study is needed to fully understand the physiological significance of tyrosine modification of PII of Anabaena 7120. Although our study shows that PII is critical to heterocyst function, the formation of heterocysts and the presence of a normal pattern of heterocysts in MP2α demonstrate that heterocyst differentiation does not depend on PII. The process of cell differentiation and the function of the differentiated cells are therefore separated. Download .pdf (3.4 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2103485912,"The correlation between glioma grade and angiogenesis suggests that antiangiogenic therapies are potentially therapeutically effective for these tumors. However, to achieve tumor suppression, antiangiogenic therapies need to be administered daily using high systemic quantities. We designed a biodegradable polymeric device that overcomes those barriers by providing sustained local delivery of a C-terminal fragment of platelet factor 4 (PF-4/CTF), an antiangiogenic agent. Fluorescent-labeled microspheres composed of poly lactic-coglycolic acid (PLGA) were loaded with rhodamine-labeled PF-4/CTF and formulated to release their contents over time. Fluorescent labeling enabled the correlation between the in vitro to the in vivo kinetic and release studies. PF-4/CTF microspheres were injected into established intracranial human glioma tumors in nude mice. Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess the therapeutic response. Tumor size, microvessel density, proliferation, and apoptosis rate were measured by histological analysis. Intracranially, the microspheres were located throughout the tumor bed and continuously released PF-4/CTF during the entire experimental period. MRI and histological studies showed that a single injection of microspheres containing PF-4/CTF caused a 65.2% and 72% reduction in tumor volume, respectively, with a significant decrease in angiogenesis and an increase in apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that polymeric microspheres are an effective therapeutic approach for delivering antiangiogenic agents that result in the inhibition of glioma tumor growth."

To resolve the effects of these exosites on the initial Michaelis docking step and the subsequent acylation and conformational change steps of antithrombin-protease reactions, we compared the reactions of catalytically inactive S195A and active proteases with site-specific fluorophore-labeled antithrombins that allow monitoring of these reaction steps. Heparin bound to N,N′-dimethyl-N-(acetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-3-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (NBD)-fluorophore-labeled antithrombins and accelerated the reactions of the labeled inhibitor with thrombin and factor Xa similar to wild type. Equilibrium binding of NBD-labeled antithrombins to S195A proteases showed that exosites generated by conformationally activating antithrombin with a heparin pentasaccharide enhanced the affinity of the serpin for S195A factor Xa minimally 100-fold. Moreover, additional bridging exosites provided by a hexadecasaccharide heparin activator enhanced antithrombin affinity for both S195A factor Xa and thrombin at least 1000-fold. Rapid kinetic studies showed that these exosite-mediated enhancements in Michaelis complex affinity resulted from increases in kon and decreases in koff and caused antithrombin-protease reactions to become diffusion-controlled. Competitive binding and kinetic studies with exosite mutant antithrombins showed that Tyr-253 was a critical mediator of exosite interactions with S195A factor Xa; that Glu-255, Glu-237, and Arg-399 made more modest contributions to these interactions; and that exosite interactions reduced koff for the Michaelis complex interaction. Together these results show that exosites generated by heparin activation of antithrombin function both to promote the formation of an initial antithrombin-protease Michaelis complex and to favor the subsequent acylation of this complex.

The serpin family protein protease inhibitor, antithrombin, together with its glycosaminoglycan activator, heparin, are the principal anticoagulant regulators of blood coagulation cascade proteases (1Björk I.

Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Antithrombin inhibits its target coagulation proteases like other serpins by trapping the enzymes in stable acyl-intermediate complexes (3Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W.

These reactions are slow in the absence of heparin but are accelerated several thousandfold by the polysaccharide activator to reach a physiologically significant diffusion-limited rate (5Olson S.T.

The acceleration results from heparin binding to antithrombin through a sequence-specific pentasaccharide site and inducing an activating conformational change in the serpin (6Choay J. Petitou M.

Additional saccharides neighboring the pentasaccharide also provide a bridging site for binding the protease and promoting its interaction with antithrombin in a ternary heparin-antithrombin-protease complex (9Olson S.T.

Antithrombin like other serpins binds its target proteases through a reactive center loop that contains a substrate recognition sequence for target proteases (1Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C.

Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of free and heparin pentasaccharide-complexed antithrombin have shown that this reactive loop is partially buried in β-sheet A in the unactivated serpin and is expelled from the sheet and thereby made more accessible to an attacking protease when heparin binds and conformationally activates the protein (14Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 15Skinner R. Abrahams J.-P. Whisstock J.C.

It was initially thought that this increased accessibility of the serpin reactive loop to protease in the heparin-complexed serpin was the principal basis for the activating effect of heparin (14Jin L.

However, mutagenesis studies subsequently demonstrated that the ability of the protease to recognize and bind the reactive loop was minimally dependent on the expulsion of the reactive loop from sheet A. Rather the main determinants of the heparin-enhanced reactivity of antithrombin with its target proteases were shown to reside in exosites outside the loop (18Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M.

We recently mapped the exosites on heparin-activated antithrombin that specifically interact with factor Xa and factor IXa by mutagenesis studies (24Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Izaguirre G. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two residues on strand 3 of sheet C, Tyr-253 and Glu-255, which are highly conserved in all vertebrate antithrombins (26Backovic M. Gettins P.G.W. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were implicated as exosites that promote antithrombin reactions with factor Xa and factor IXa. More recently, a structure of the ternary heparin pentasaccharide-antithrombin-S195A factor Xa Michaelis complex was reported that has confirmed the importance of these exosite residues and suggested other exosite residues that make contact with factor Xa in the complex (27Johnson D.J.D. Li W. Adams T.E. Huntington J.A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover this structure confirmed that the factor Xa autolysis loop constitutes the complementary exosite on the enzyme that interacts with the antithrombin exosite in agreement with prior factor Xa mutagenesis studies (28Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Manithody C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two structures of ternary heparin-antithrombin-S195A thrombin Michaelis complexes involving a full-length bridging heparin have additionally demonstrated the role of bridging exosites on the extended heparin chain in binding the protease through a complementary basic exosite and thereby promoting the binding of heparin-complexed antithrombin to protease in the complex (10Dementiev A. Petitou M. Herbert J.-M. Gettins P.G.W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Li W. Johnson D.J.D. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although the role of exosites in mediating the rate-enhancing effects of heparin on antithrombin-protease reactions is reasonably well established, this role has been inferred solely from kinetic analyses of heparin effects on bimolecular association rate constants for antithrombin-protease reactions that reflect multiple steps in the serpin-protease reaction pathway (2Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 24Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol.

To resolve the effects of heparin on Michaelis complex formation, acylation, and conformational change steps in the reaction, we analyzed the reactions of antithrombin with both catalytically inactive S195A proteases and active proteases by equilibrium binding and rapid kinetic approaches using site-specific fluorophore-labeled antithrombins as probes. This enabled us to quantitatively assess the extent to which heparin-generated exosites promote antithrombin-protease Michaelis complexes, to evaluate the relative contribution of implicated exosite residues in antithrombin to this promotion, and to elucidate how exosite interactions influence acylation and conformational change steps in the reaction. Proteins—Antithrombin was purified from human plasma as described previously (30Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).

Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Analytical chromatography of labeled antithrombins on a Hi-Trap heparin column showed that the protein bound to the column with high affinity and was eluted at a salt concentration similar to that of unlabeled antithrombin. Experimental Conditions—Experiments were done in a physiologic ionic strength (I 0.15) buffer consisting of 100 mm Hepes, 93.5 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, at 25 °C unless otherwise specified. Stoichiometries of Antithrombin-Protease Reactions—Thrombin or factor Xa at fixed concentrations ranging from ∼50 to 200 nm were incubated with varying concentrations of antithrombin from substoichiometric to a severalfold molar excess over protease in the absence or presence of heparin at levels stoichiometric with antithrombin for a time sufficient to yield >90% completion of the reaction. Residual enzyme activity was then determined by adding 100 μm S2238 for thrombin or 100 μm Spectrozyme FXa for factor Xa, both containing 100 μg/ml Polybrene. Plots of residual enzyme activity versus the molar ratio of inhibitor/enzyme were fit by linear regression, and the stoichiometry was obtained from the abscissa intercept (30Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Association Rate Constants for Antithrombin-Protease Reactions—Antithrombin was mixed with protease in the absence or presence of catalytic levels of heparin with the inhibitor concentration kept minimally at a 5-fold molar excess over that required to achieve stoichiometric inhibition of the protease. Identical reaction mixtures were quenched at varying times by dilution into substrate, and residual enzyme activity was measured from the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis. Inactivation progress curves were fit by a single exponential function with a zero end point to obtain observed pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs). Second order association rate constants were obtained from the slope of plots of kobsversus the antithrombin concentration in the absence of heparin or of kobsversus the heparin concentration when heparin was present. The latter plots required correction for the fraction of added heparin that was bound to antithrombin based on measured KD values for antithrombin-heparin interactions (30Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 31Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Emission Spectra—Emission spectra of P7-NBD-antithrombin and P2′-NBD-antithrombin (100-200 nm) in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide or hexadecasaccharide heparins and in the absence or presence of S195A or active thrombin or factor Xa were measured on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer from 500 to 650 nm in 5-nm steps. Spectra were repeated at least twice to ensure reproducibility and averaged. Corrections were made for buffer background and dilution. The effects of heparin and protein binding to the labeled antithrombins on the NBD fluorescence were assessed by titrations of these components into the labeled antithrombins monitored by fluorescence changes at the peak wavelength or by addition of levels shown to be saturating followed by recording the spectrum. In cases where incomplete saturation of antithrombin complexes with added ligands was achieved, the spectrum of fully complexed antithrombin was obtained by correcting the spectrum for residual uncomplexed inhibitor using the KD and maximal fluorescence change determined from independent titrations of the interactions. Binding Studies—Equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of pentasaccharide or hexadecasaccharide heparins to antithrombin were measured by titrating heparin into solutions of antithrombin at 50-100 nm and monitoring the changes in protein fluorescence emission at 340 nm when excited at 280 nm. Fluorescence changes were fit to the quadratic equilibrium binding equation with KD, the binding stoichiometry, and maximal fluorescence change as the fitted parameters (30Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Binding of S195A factor Xa or S195A thrombin to fluorescent labeled antithrombins was done by titrating protease into the labeled antithrombin (100-200 nm) in the absence or presence of pentasaccharide or hexadecasaccharide heparins and monitoring the changes in fluorescence at 540 nm (excitation at 480 nm). Fluorescence changes were fit to the quadratic equilibrium binding equation either assuming a binding stoichiometry of 1 or allowing the stoichiometry to be fit as a parameter along with the KD and maximal fluorescence change. Binding of unlabeled wild-type and variant recombinant antithrombins to S195A factor Xa was measured by competitive binding titrations in which the unlabeled antithrombin was titrated into a solution of ternary NBD-antithrombin-heparin-S195A factor Xa complex in the presence of heparin levels sufficient to saturate the added antithrombin. Binding of the unlabeled antithrombin-heparin complex to S195A factor Xa was analyzed by monitoring the decreases in fluorescence due to displacement of the labeled antithrombin-heparin binary complex from the ternary complex with S195A factor Xa. Binding of plasma-derived antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complexes to S195A thrombin was also studied by competitive binding titrations in which antithrombin was titrated into a solution of thrombin plus the active site fluorescence probe, DAPA, in the absence or presence of pentasaccharide or hexadecasaccharide heparins at levels sufficient to saturate the added antithrombin. Binding of the free or heparin-complexed serpin to S195A thrombin was analyzed from the decrease in fluorescence (excitation at 280 nm, emission at 530 nm) due to displacement of the probe from the thrombin active site. Concentrations of antithrombin-heparin complexes were calculated based on measured KD values for complex formation (5Olson S.T. Swanson R. Raub-Segall E. Bedsted T. Sadri M. Petitou M. Herault J.-P.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Fluorescence changes were fit by the cubic equation for competitive binding to obtain the KD and the stoichiometry for the binding of antithrombin and antithrombin-heparin complexes to S195A thrombin as well as of antithrombin-heparin complexes to S195A factor Xa (39Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Independent analyses of the binding of DAPA to S195A thrombin or thrombin or of P7-NBD-antithrombin-heparin complex to S195A factor Xa were done to fix the KD and stoichiometry for these interactions. Rapid Kinetic Studies—Rapid kinetic studies of antithrombin-protease reactions or of thrombin-DAPA interactions were done with an Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow instrument under pseudo-first order conditions in which the molar concentration of one of the reacting components was maintained at least 5-fold greater than that of the other. For reactions of NBD-labeled antithrombin with proteases, the concentration of protease was varied in molar excess over that of the inhibitor, and reactions were monitored from NBD fluorescence changes using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission filter with a 520-nm cut-on wavelength. The kinetics of plasma antithrombin reactions with active thrombin and factor Xa were studied using peptide fluorogenic substrates to report the rate of protease inhibition. For these studies, the inhibitor concentration was varied in molar excess over that of the protease, and protease inhibition was monitored from changes in 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) fluorescence due to hydrolysis of 5 μm tosyl-GPR-AMC in reactions with thrombin and of 25-50 μm Boc-IEGR-AMC in reactions with factor Xa using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission filter with a 420 nm cut-on. In most cases, NBD fluorescence changes were fit by a single exponential approach to a final end point fluorescence, and AMC fluorescence changes were fit by a single expone"
https://openalex.org/W1976378506,"The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) in caspase-3 activation and cell death was investigated in DT40 chicken B-lymphocytes stably expressing various IP3R constructs. Both full-length type-I IP3R and a truncated construct corresponding to the caspase-3 cleaved “channel-only” fragment were able to support staurosporine (STS)-induced caspase-3 activation and cell death even when the IP3R construct harbored a mutation that inactivates the pore of the Ca2+ channel (D2550A). However, a full-length wild-type IP3R did not promote caspase-3 activation when the 159-amino acid cytosol-exposed C-terminal tail was deleted. STS caused an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ in DT40 cells expressing wild-type or pore-dead IP3R mutants. However, in the latter case all the Ca2+ increase originated from Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. Caspase-3 activation of pore-dead DT40 cells was also more sensitive to extracellular Ca2+ chelation when compared with wild-type cells. STS-mediated release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization could also be observed in DT40 cells lacking IP3Rs or containing the pore-dead mutant. We conclude that nonfunctional IP3Rs can sustain apoptosis in DT40 lymphocytes, because they facilitate Ca2+ entry mechanisms across the plasma membrane. Although the intrinsic ion-channel function of IP3Rs is dispensable for apoptosis induced by STS, the C-terminal tail of IP3Rs appears to be essential, possibly reflecting key protein-protein interactions with this domain.

Apoptosis is an essential process required for normal development and tissue homeostasis and can be activated by diverse stimuli, including cytotoxic drugs, DNA damage, irradiation, withdrawal of growth factors, and activation of death receptors by ligands such as tumor necrosis factor or Fas. A requirement for elevated levels of Ca2+ has been implicated in many of these models of apoptosis (1Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 2Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Ferrari D. Chami M. Szabadkai G. Magalhaes P.J. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), phospholipase-A2 (5Taketo M.M. Sonoshita M. Biochim. Biophys.

Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar) are known to be stimulated by Ca2+. However, the exact steps in apoptotic cascades that are affected by Ca2+ and the mechanisms resulting in the perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis are poorly understood. Elevations of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) are achieved in cells by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores and/or enhancement of Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) 2The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHAPS, (3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; Cyt c, cytochrome c; aa, amino acid(s); Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; STS, staurosporine; HA, hemagglutinin; TKO, triple knock-out; CO, channel-only; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester). 2The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHAPS, (3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; Cyt c, cytochrome c; aa, amino acid(s); Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; STS, staurosporine; HA, hemagglutinin; TKO, triple knock-out; CO, channel-only; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester). are a family of three intracellular Ca2+-release channels, mainly located in the ER membrane, which are primarily responsible for the agonist-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. A number of different experimental approaches have implicated IP3Rs as pro-apoptotic regulators. The targeted deletion of all three IP3R isoforms in the chicken DT-40 lymphocyte cell line renders the cells more resistant to apoptotic stimuli induced by anti-IgM or staurosporine (STS) (7Sugawara H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) IP3R isoforms has been shown to confer resistance to various apoptotic stimuli in Jurkat T-cell lines. A selective role for the type-III IP3R in apoptosis was also reported in a study using small interference RNA to suppress expression of individual IP3R isoforms (11Mendes C.C. Gomes D.A. Thompson M. Souto N.C. Goes T.S. Goes A.M. Rodrigues M.A. Gomez M.V. Nathanson M.H. Leite M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40892-40900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, mice deficient in both type-II and III IP3R isoforms do not show defects in developmental apoptosis suggesting the presence of significant redundancy in the requirement for individual IP3R isoforms (12Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis involves the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the initiation of a cascade of events that ultimately leads to the activation of caspase-3. Although the exact transport pathway utilized for Cyt c release during apoptosis or necrosis is controversial, it is well established that enhanced accumulation of Ca2+ by the mitochondria sensitizes the Cyt c release pathway to stimulation by apoptotic agents (3Hajnoczky G. Davies E. Madesh M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 13Szabadkai G. Rizzuto R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The close proximity of ER to mitochondria suggests that the Ca2+ channel function of IP3Rs could be important in modulating the kinetics and sensitivity of apoptotic pathways (3Hajnoczky G. Davies E.

Further evidence for the pro-apoptotic role of IP3Rs is indicated by the finding that a number of key components of apoptotic cascades appear to interact with and regulate IP3R function. The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been shown to bind IP3Rs, but the studies differ as to whether this results is an inhibition or activation of IP3R channel activity (15Chen R.

Mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines obtained from Bax/Bak double knock-out mice show an increased phosphorylation of the IP3R and an enhanced Ca2+ leak across the ER membrane (17Oakes S.A. Scorrano L. Opferman J.T. Bassik M.C. Nishino M. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to the effect of unrestrained Bcl-2 on IP3Rs (17Oakes S.A. Scorrano L. Opferman J.T. Bassik M.C. Nishino M. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cyt c released from the mitochondria has been found to bind and activate IP3Rs by decreasing the feedback inhibition of these channels by Ca2+ (22Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Finally, IP3Rs have been found to be substrates for the important anti-apoptotic regulatory protein Akt kinase (23Khan M.T. Wagner L. Yule D.I. Bhanumathy C.D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3731-3737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The highly conserved phosphorylation site for Akt kinase, as well as the binding sites for Bcl-xL and Cyt c, are all localized to the short, cytosol-exposed C-terminal tail of the receptor (16White C.

With the exception of Akt kinase phosphorylation, a common feature of all the aforementioned modes of IP3R regulation during apoptotic signaling is that they are considered to modulate the Ca2+ channel function of the intact or caspase-cleaved IP3R ion channel. To better understand the role of IP3Rs in regulating apoptosis we have examined the effect of introducing an ion channel-defective IP3R mutant into the IP3R DT-40 triple knock-out lymphocytes. Surprisingly, this cell line continued to respond to cytotoxic apoptotic stimuli in a similar manner as wild-type DT-40 cells. Our studies reveal an ion-channel independent role of IP3Rs in apoptosis, which may involve protein-protein interactions, possibly with the C-terminal tail of the receptor.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The splice variants used in this study were SI(-), SII(+), and SIII(-). The channel-only (aa 1892–2749) portion of IP3R was generated using PCR. The forward and reverse primers used were 5′-TCGAATTCCCACCATGCGGGATGCCCCATCCCGAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTATGGTTTCTAGATTCGCG-3′. These primers encoded EcoR1/XbaI sites (underlined), which were utilized to clone the PCR product into similarly digested pcDNA 3.1 vector. The product was confirmed by automated sequencing (Nucleic acid Facility, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The S2681A and S2681E point mutants in full-length IP3R were constructed as described earlier (23Khan M.T. Wagner L. Yule D.I. Bhanumathy C.D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol.

Cells and Stable Transfection—DT40 cells (wild-type and triple knock-out (TKO) of IP3R isoforms) were a kind Gift of Dr. T. Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi, Japan). Stable DT40 cells expressing the rat type I IP3R were a gift from Dr. Kevin Foskett (University of Pennsylvania, PA). DT40 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The stable cell lines expressing various IP3R mutants were prepared by electroporation of 0.5 ml of DT40 TKO cells (106 cells/ml) with 40 μg of XbaI linearized DNA using a Gene pulsar apparatus (Bio-Rad, 340 V and 950 microfarads). The cells were grown in 30 ml of RPMI for 24 h and were then serially diluted in a volume of 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000 in RPMI containing 1.5 mg/ml G418. The diluted cells were transferred to 96-well plates and incubated for 1–2 weeks in a CO2-incubator at 37 °C. Positive clones were identified by screening for expression of IP3Rs by immunoblotting. Measurement of Caspase Activation in DT40 Cells—For fluorometric assays, DT40 cells were collected and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA. Lysates containing 10 μg of protein were incubated with 25 μm DEVD-aminomethyl coumarin as substrate for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence of the aminomethyl coumarin product was measured at 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelength. Flow cytometry detection of caspase-3 was carried out according to manufacturer's instructions using a caspase-3 reagent (FLICA, Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). After apoptosis induction, the DT40 cells were analyzed on a Flow cytometer with 488 nm excitation using 530 nm band pass and 670 nm long pass emission filters. Cell Viability Assays—The assay using CellTitre 96 Aqueous One reagent from Promega was done as described by the manufacturer with some modifications. Briefly, 0.5 × 106 DT40 cells were grown in 1 ml of media (in 24-well plates). The cells were treated with STS for 6 h, 20 μl of CellTitre reagent was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. For a blank, 20 μl of CellTitre reagent was added to 1 ml of RPMI media. The supernatants were transferred in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged on a microcentrifuge for 2 min. The supernatant was read at 490 nm against the media blank. Measurement of [Ca2+]i in DT40 Cells—Changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] in individual DT40 cells plated on coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine was measured by digital imaging fluorescence microscopy as previously described (28Wagner L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cells were loaded with Fura-2 by incubating with 2 μm Fura-2AM in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 (10 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 6 mm glucose, and 1 mm glutamine) for 20 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with the same buffer for 10 min to de-esterify Fura-2 and were transferred to a chamber with 1 ml of HEPES buffer and mounted onto the stage of an inverted microscope thermostatically maintained at 37 °C. Fluorescence images with a 4-s delay were recorded alternately at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm with an emission wavelength of 460–600 nm using a charge-coupled device imaging system. Changes in cytosolic calcium were measured in response to STS or anti-IgM in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium and are expressed as the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence at 340 nm and 380 nm (F340/F380). Typically 50–60 cells were monitored per experiment, and traces represent the average of three different experiments. Cyt c Release, Annexin V Assays, and Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Cyt c release into the cytosol was measured in DT40 cells after fractionation using the Apoalert cell fractionation kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Western blotting of lysates was carried out on 15% SDS-PAGE gels with immunoblotting for Cyt c using a monoclonal Ab from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) was added together with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml), and staining was analyzed on a flow cytometer. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed using the MitoProbe™ DiIC1 (5Taketo M.M. Sonoshita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) assay kit as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). The stain intensity decreases when reagents disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential. The cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer with 633 nm excitation using emission filters for far red (658 nm). Histograms were analyzed using WinMDI Software. STS-induced Caspase-3 Activation and Cell Death in DT40 Cell Lines Containing Functional and Non-functional IP3Rs—DT40 cells containing a targeted deletion of all 3IP3R isoforms (TKO) were transfected with a number of IP3R mutants and stable cells lines were established. Fig. 1A shows the basic architecture of IP3 receptors with an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, a C-terminal channel domain, and an intervening regulatory domain. Fig. 1B shows a detail of the 159-amino acid C-terminal tail of the receptor that projects into the cytosol together with the binding sites for known proteins that interact with this region. The location of the deletion mutants (channel only, 1TM, tail-less) and point mutants (Asp-2550 and Ser-2618) used in this study are also indicated in the figure. Fig. 2A shows the expression of these mutant constructs detected by immunoblotting with an Ab to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the type-I IP3R (CT-1) or, in the case of the tail-less mutants, with a C-terminal HA tag Ab. The mutants encoding the caspase-3-cleaved fragment, referred to as “channel-only” (CO) mutants (8Assefa Z. Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Nadif K.N. Vermassen E. Goris J. Missiaen L. Callewaert G.

These could correspond to glycosylated and non-glycosylated bands (cf. Refs. 21Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem.

In initial experiments we measured the time course of cell death induced by 0.5 μm STS in wild-type and TKO cells and found that the biggest differences were evident at earlier time points (<6 h) (data not shown). The time course of caspase-3 activation over this period is shown in Fig. 2B. In agreement with published data (8Assefa Z. Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Nadif K.N. Vermassen E. Goris J. Missiaen L. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43227-43236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), caspase-3 activation was substantially slowed in TKO cells. However, 80% of the caspase-3 activation of wild-type cells could be rescued by the D2550A IP3R pore mutant, which has previously been shown to inactivate the channel (30Boehning D. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13509-13512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The absence of Ca2+ mobilization in response to cross-linking of cell surface IgM receptors with anti-IgM Ab in D2550A cells is shown in Fig. 2B (inset). Several other studies have confirmed that this mutant is functionally inactive (31Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Kiselyov K. Boehning D. Barrow R.K. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Data on caspase-3 activation in several additional mutant cell lines is summarized in Fig. 2C and corresponding measurements of cell viability are shown in Fig. 2D. The wild-type DT40 cells contain three chicken IP3R isoforms, whereas the mutant cells contain only one IP3R isoform made in the background of the rat type-I IP3R. For comparison, we have also used a stable DT40 cell line expressing the wild-type rat type-I IP3R as a control (kindly given by Kevin Foskett). These cells showed a somewhat higher caspase-3 activation, but their cell death response was the same as wild-type DT40 cells.FIGURE 2STS-induced changes in caspase-3 activity and cell viability in mutant IP3R DT40 cell lines. A, immunoblots of cell lysates prepared from the indicated DT40 cell lines. The reason why the CO constructs express as a doublet is not known but may be due to differential glycosylation. B, a time course of caspase-3 activation in the indicated DT40 cell lines in response to 0.5 μm STS measured fluorometrically in cell lysates. The inset shows cytosolic free Ca2+ changes measured in WT and D2550A Fura-2-loaded cells in response to 5 μg/ml α-IgM. C, the cumulative data of caspase-3 activation in response to 0.5 μm STS for 6 h measured in the indicated cell lines and expressed relative to the activation in WT cells. Data are mean ± S.E. (n = 3–6). *, p < 0.05 relative to WT cells. In Panel D, conditions were as described in C except that cell viability was measured with a Promega 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay kit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two non-functional IP3R mutants have previously been shown to support STS and anti-IgM induced apoptosis in DT40 cells (8Assefa Z. Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Nadif K.N. Vermassen E. Goris J. Missiaen L. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43227-43236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One of these mutants was deleted in the N-terminal 225 amino acids corresponding to the suppressor domain (Fig. 1A). The other was the CO mutant encoding the C-terminal fragment formed from the receptor after caspase-3 cleavage. The results were interpreted as indicating that the caspase-3-cleaved fragment from both inactive mutants could still induce aCa2+ leak from the ER that was necessary for sustaining apoptosis (8Assefa Z. Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Nadif K.N. Vermassen E. Goris J. Missiaen L. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43227-43236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In agreement with this previous study, the cells expressing the CO mutant were sensitive to STS-induced cell death (Fig. 2, C and D). However, the same result was obtained with the CO mutant encoding the pore inactivating D2550A mutant. It is possible that the CO mutant when functioning in an ER Ca2+ leak pathway has completely different pore architecture than a full-length wild-type receptor. Nevertheless, the data also raise the possibility that full-length receptors (or their caspase-3-cleaved fragments) do not contribute directly to ER Ca2+ leak pathways and that they have some other role in regulating apoptosis. The 1TM construct (amino acids 2253–2749) encodes the segment of the receptor that contains the C-terminal channel domain. This construct was also able to support STS-induced caspase-3 activation and cell death (Fig. 2, C and D) indicating that the large segment of the receptor from the caspase-3 cleavage site at amino acids 1892–2253 is not required for apoptosis. However, deletion of 141 or 159 amino acids of the C-terminal cytosolic tail from full-length receptors was sufficient to suppress caspase-3 activation and cell death to the levels observed in TKO cells (Fig. 2, C and D). In independent experiments we have established that the TL-5 and TL-6 mutants are functionally inactive as IP3-gated channels (27Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because channel-inactive mutants (e.g. D2550A or CO) can still support cell death, this implies that the C-terminal tail has a unique function in regulating apoptosis induced by STS. Similar findings were made when using anti-IgM as an inducer of apoptosis, notably, caspase-3 activation was supported by the D2550A pore-inactive full-length IP3R or the D2550A CO mutant but not the IP3R lacking the C-terminal tail (supplemental Fig. S1). We have previously shown that IP3Rs are phosphorylated by Akt kinase in the C-terminal tail at serine 2618 without altering IP3-dependent channel activity (23Khan M.T. Wagner L. Yule D.I. Bhanumathy C.D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3731-3737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The functional role of this phosphorylation is unknown. However, we noted that the ability of IP3Rs to support STS-induced caspase-3 activation was enhanced when the Akt phosphorylation site was inactivated by mutation to alanine (S2618A) as compared with a phosphomimic mutant (S2618E). It was suggested that perhaps important functional responses to Akt kinase phosphorylation could"

https://openalex.org/W2043372853,"When nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates and α-amanitin are added to a human RNA polymerase II elongation complex simultaneously, the reaction becomes stalled in the core of the bond synthesis mechanism. The mode of stalling is influenced by NTP substrates at the active site and at downstream sites and by transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) and TFIIS. NTP substrates templated at i+2, i+3, and i+4 downstream DNA sites can reverse the previously stable binding of an NTP loaded at the i+1 substrate site. Deoxy-(d)NTPs and NDPs (nucleoside diphosphates) do not substitute for NTPs at the i+2 and i+3 positions (considered together) or the i+4, i+5, and i+6 positions (considered together). The mode of stalling is altered by changing the number of downstream template sites that are accurately occupied by NTPs and by changing NTP concentration. In the presence of the translocation blocker α-amanitin, a steady state condition is established in which RNA polymerase II stably loads an NTP substrate at i+1 and forms a phosphodiester bond but cannot rapidly complete bond synthesis by releasing pyrophosphate. These observations support a role for incoming NTP substrates in stimulating translocation; results appear inconsistent with the secondary pore being the sole route of NTP entry for human RNA polymerase II, and results indicate mechanisms of dynamic error avoidance and error correction during rapid RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086726185,"GpIbalpha, a subunit of the von Willebrand factor receptor, functions during blood clotting to promote platelet adhesion and activation. GpIbalpha is widely expressed, is positively regulated by c-Myc and is essential for the promotion of c-Myc-mediated chromosomal instability. We now show that GpIbalpha is also a classical oncoprotein in which its deregulated expression leads to transformation, reduced growth factor requirements, increased resistance to apoptosis, and, in primary cells, p53-dependent senescence. Finally, GpIbalpha also promotes double-stranded DNA breaks, and induces profound nuclear dysmorphology, indicating that, in addition to its direct transforming function, it displays genotoxicity at several distinct levels. These findings identify novel functions for GpIbalpha and pathways through which c-Myc mediates transformation and global genomic destabilization."
