https://openalex.org/W2065613337,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, the microtubule-associated protein tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular plaques, respectively. Tau deposits are furthermore found in a significant number of frontotemporal dementia cases. These diseases are characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, the loss of intellectual capabilities and behavioral changes. Unfortunately, the currently available therapies are limited to symptomatic relief. While active immunization against Aβ has shown efficacy in both various AD mouse models and patients with AD, immunization against pathogenic tau has only recently been shown to prevent pathology in young tau transgenic mice. However, if translated to humans, diagnosis and treatment would be routinely done when symptoms are overt, meaning that the histopathological changes have already progressed. Therefore, we used active immunization to target pathogenic tau in 4, 8, and 18 months-old P301L tau transgenic pR5 mice that have an onset of NFT pathology at 6 months of age. In all age groups, NFT pathology was significantly reduced in treated compared to control pR5 mice. Similarly, phosphorylation of tau at pathological sites was reduced. In addition, increased astrocytosis was found in the oldest treated group. Taken together, our data suggests that tau-targeted immunization slows the progression of NFT pathology in mice, with practical implications for human patients."
https://openalex.org/W1964113973,"Radiation therapy treatment of breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease or childhood cancers expose the heart to high local radiation doses, causing an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the survivors decades after the treatment. The mechanisms that underlie the radiation damage remain poorly understood so far. Previous data show that impairment of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is directly linked to the development of cardiovascular disease.In this study, the radiation-induced in vivo effects on cardiac mitochondrial proteome and function were investigated. C57BL/6N mice were exposed to local irradiation of the heart with doses of 0.2 Gy or 2 Gy (X-ray, 200 kV) at the age of eight weeks, the control mice were sham-irradiated. After four weeks the cardiac mitochondria were isolated and tested for proteomic and functional alterations. Two complementary proteomics approaches using both peptide and protein quantification strategies showed radiation-induced deregulation of 25 proteins in total. Three main biological categories were affected: the oxidative phophorylation, the pyruvate metabolism, and the cytoskeletal structure. The mitochondria exposed to high-dose irradiation showed functional impairment reflected as partial deactivation of Complex I (32%) and Complex III (11%), decreased succinate-driven respiratory capacity (13%), increased level of reactive oxygen species and enhanced oxidation of mitochondrial proteins. The changes in the pyruvate metabolism and structural proteins were seen with both low and high radiation doses.This is the first study showing the biological alterations in the murine heart mitochondria several weeks after the exposure to low- and high-dose of ionizing radiation. Our results show that doses, equivalent to a single dose in radiotherapy, cause long-lasting changes in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and mitochondria-associated cytoskeleton. This prompts us to propose that these first pathological changes lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease after radiation exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1986046884,"Optimizing the in vivo stability of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers is of critical importance to cancer diagnosis. In the case of 64Cu-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in vivo behavior and biodistribution is critically dependent on the performance of the bifunctional chelator used to conjugate the mAb to the radiolabel. This study compared the in vivo characteristics of 64Cu-labeled TRC105 (a chimeric mAb that binds to both human and murine CD105), through two commonly used chelators: 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that chelator conjugation of TRC105 did not affect its CD105 binding affinity or specificity. PET imaging and biodistribution studies in 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice revealed that 64Cu-NOTA-TRC105 exhibited better stability than 64Cu-DOTA-TRC105 in vivo, which resulted in significantly lower liver uptake without compromising the tumor targeting efficiency. In conclusion, this study confirmed that NOTA is a superior chelator to DOTA for PET imaging with 64Cu-labeled TRC105."
https://openalex.org/W2124335213,"Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants have high morbidity and mortality, frequently due to invasive infections from bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The microbial communities present in the gastrointestinal tracts of preterm infants may serve as a reservoir for invasive organisms and remain poorly characterized. We used deep pyrosequencing to examine the gut-associated microbiome of 11 ELBW infants in the first postnatal month, with a first time determination of the eukaryote microbiota such as fungi and nematodes, including bacteria and viruses that have not been previously described. Among the fungi observed, Candida sp. and Clavispora sp. dominated the sequences, but a range of environmental molds were also observed. Surprisingly, seventy-one percent of the infant fecal samples tested contained ribosomal sequences corresponding to the parasitic organism Trichinella. Ribosomal DNA sequences for the roundworm symbiont Xenorhabdus accompanied these sequences in the infant with the greatest proportion of Trichinella sequences. When examining ribosomal DNA sequences in aggregate, Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus were the most abundant bacterial taxa in a low diversity bacterial community (mean Shannon-Weaver Index of 1.02±0.69), with relatively little change within individual infants through time. To supplement the ribosomal sequence data, shotgun sequencing was performed on DNA from multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of total fecal genomic DNA from two infants. In addition to the organisms mentioned previously, the metagenome also revealed sequences for gram positive and gram negative bacteriophages, as well as human adenovirus C. Together, these data reveal surprising eukaryotic and viral microbial diversity in ELBW enteric microbiota dominated bytypes of bacteria known to cause invasive disease in these infants."
https://openalex.org/W2052824044,"Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is considered to be overfished, but the status of its populations has been debated, partly because of uncertainties regarding the effects of mixing on fishing grounds. A better understanding of spatial structure and mixing may help fisheries managers to successfully rebuild populations to sustainable levels while maximizing catches. We formulate a new seasonally and spatially explicit fisheries model that is fitted to conventional and electronic tag data, historic catch-at-age reconstructions, and otolith microchemistry stock-composition data to improve the capacity to assess past, current, and future population sizes of Atlantic bluefin tuna. We apply the model to estimate spatial and temporal mixing of the eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) populations, and to reconstruct abundances from 1950 to 2008. We show that western and eastern populations have been reduced to 17% and 33%, respectively, of 1950 spawning stock biomass levels. Overfishing to below the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield occurred in the 1960s and the late 1990s for western and eastern populations, respectively. The model predicts that mixing depends on season, ontogeny, and location, and is highest in the western Atlantic. Assuming that future catches are zero, western and eastern populations are predicted to recover to levels at maximum sustainable yield by 2025 and 2015, respectively. However, the western population will not recover with catches of 1750 and 12,900 tonnes (the “rebuilding quotas”) in the western and eastern Atlantic, respectively, with or without closures in the Gulf of Mexico. If future catches are double the rebuilding quotas, then rebuilding of both populations will be compromised. If fishing were to continue in the eastern Atlantic at the unregulated levels of 2007, both stocks would continue to decline. Since populations mix on North Atlantic foraging grounds, successful rebuilding policies will benefit from trans-Atlantic cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2065138462,"Angelman syndrome (AS), a genetic disorder occurring in approximately one in every 15,000 births, is characterized by severe mental retardation, seizures, difficulty speaking and ataxia. The gene responsible for AS was discovered to be UBE3A and encodes for E6-AP, an ubiquitin ligase. A unique feature of this gene is that it undergoes maternal imprinting in a neuron-specific manner. In the majority of AS cases, there is a mutation or deletion in the maternally inherited UBE3A gene, although other cases are the result of uniparental disomy or mismethylation of the maternal gene. While most human disorders characterized by severe mental retardation involve abnormalities in brain structure, no gross anatomical changes are associated with AS. However, we have determined that abnormal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulation is seen in the maternal UBE3A deletion AS mouse model and is responsible for the major phenotypes. Specifically, there is an increased αCaMKII phosphorylation at the autophosphorylation sites Thr286 and Thr305/306, resulting in an overall decrease in CaMKII activity. CaMKII is not produced until after birth, indicating that the deficits associated with AS are not the result of developmental abnormalities. The present studies are focused on exploring the potential to rescue the learning and memory deficits in the adult AS mouse model through the use of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to increase neuronal UBE3A expression. These studies show that increasing the levels of E6-AP in the brain using an exogenous vector can improve the cognitive deficits associated with AS. Specifically, the associative learning deficit was ameliorated in the treated AS mice compared to the control AS mice, indicating that therapeutic intervention may be possible in older AS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2087362844,"Giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii or GFP), is the most economically important freshwater crustacean species. However, as little is known about its genome, 454 pyrosequencing of cDNA was undertaken to characterise its transcriptome and identify genes important for growth.A collection of 787,731 sequence reads (244.37 Mb) obtained from 454 pyrosequencing analysis of cDNA prepared from muscle, ovary and testis tissues taken from 18 adult prawns was assembled into 123,534 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Of these, 46% of the 8,411 contigs and 19% of 115,123 singletons possessed high similarity to sequences in the GenBank non-redundant database, with most significant (E value < 1e(-5)) contig (80%) and singleton (84%) matches occurring with crustacean and insect sequences. KEGG analysis of the contig open reading frames identified putative members of several biological pathways potentially important for growth. The top InterProScan domains detected included RNA recognition motifs, serine/threonine-protein kinase-like domains, actin-like families, and zinc finger domains. Transcripts derived from genes such as actin, myosin heavy and light chain, tropomyosin and troponin with fundamental roles in muscle development and construction were abundant. Amongst the contigs, 834 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1198 indels and 658 simple sequence repeats motifs were also identified.The M. rosenbergii transcriptome data reported here should provide an invaluable resource for improving our understanding of this species' genome structure and biology. The data will also instruct future functional studies to manipulate or select for genes influencing growth that should find practical applications in aquaculture breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2156197349,"The primary objective was to assess the effect of MVC intensification on latently infected CD4(+) T cells in chronically HIV-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.We performed an open-label pilot phase II clinical trial involving chronically HIV-1-infected patients receiving stable antiretroviral therapy whose regimen was intensified with 48 weeks of maraviroc therapy. We analyzed the latent reservoir, the residual viremia and episomal 2LTR DNA to examine the relationship between these measures and the HIV-1 latent reservoir, immune activation, lymphocyte subsets (including effector and central memory T cells), and markers associated with bacterial translocation.Overall a non significant reduction in the size of the latent reservoir was found (p = 0.068). A mean reduction of 1.82 IUPM was observed in 4 patients with detectable latent reservoir at baseline after 48 weeks of intensification. No effect on plasma residual viremia was observed. Unexpectedly, all the patients had detectable 2LTR DNA circles at week 24, while none of them showed those circles at the end of the study. No changes were detected in CD4(+) or CD8(+) counts, although a significant decrease was found in the proportion of HLA-DR(+)/CD38(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. LPS and sCD14 levels increased.Intensification with MVC was associated with a trend to a decrease in the size of the latent HIV-1 reservoir in memory T cells. No impact on residual viremia was detected. Additional studies with larger samples are needed to confirm the results.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00795444."
https://openalex.org/W1980344447,"There is a long-standing debate on the extent of vicariance and long-distance dispersal events to explain the current distribution of organisms, especially in those with small diaspores potentially prone to long-distance dispersal. Age estimates of clades play a crucial role in evaluating the impact of these processes. The aim of this study is to understand the evolutionary history of the largest clade of macrolichens, the parmelioid lichens (Parmeliaceae, Lecanoromycetes, Ascomycota) by dating the origin of the group and its major lineages. They have a worldwide distribution with centers of distribution in the Neo- and Paleotropics, and semi-arid subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using DNA sequences of nuLSU and mtSSU rDNA, and the protein-coding RPB1 gene. The three DNA regions had different evolutionary rates: RPB1 gave a rate two to four times higher than nuLSU and mtSSU. Divergence times of the major clades were estimated with partitioned BEAST analyses allowing different rates for each DNA region and using a relaxed clock model. Three calibrations points were used to date the tree: an inferred age at the stem of Lecanoromycetes, and two dated fossils: Parmelia in the parmelioid group, and Alectoria. Palaeoclimatic conditions and the palaeogeological area cladogram were compared to the dated phylogeny of parmelioid. The parmelioid group diversified around the K/T boundary, and the major clades diverged during the Eocene and Oligocene. The radiation of the genera occurred through globally changing climatic condition of the early Oligocene, Miocene and early Pliocene. The estimated divergence times are consistent with long-distance dispersal events being the major factor to explain the biogeographical distribution patterns of Southern Hemisphere parmelioids, especially for Africa-Australia disjunctions, because the sequential break-up of Gondwana started much earlier than the origin of these clades. However, our data cannot reject vicariance to explain South America-Australia disjunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2024388233,"Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with tuberculous meningitis but the long-term outcome of the disease is unknown.Vietnamese adults and adolescents with tuberculous meningitis recruited to a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive dexamethasone were followed-up at five years, to determine the effect of dexamethasone on long-term survival and neurological disability.545 patients were randomised to receive either dexamethasone (274 patients) or placebo (271 patients). 50 patients (9.2%) were lost to follow-up at five years. In all patients two-year survival, probabilities tended to be higher in the dexamethasone arm (0.63 versus 0.55; p = 0.07) but five-year survival rates were similar (0.54 versus 0.51, p = 0.51) in both groups. In patients with grade 1 TBM, but not with grade 2 or grade 3 TBM, the benefit of dexamethasone treatment tended to persist over time (five-year survival probabilities 0.69 versus 0.55, p = 0.07) but there was no conclusive evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity by TBM grade (p = 0.36). The dexamethasone group had a similar proportion of severely disabled patients among survivors at five years as the placebo group (17/128, 13.2% vs. 17/116, 14.7%) and there was no significant association between dexamethasone treatment and disability status at five years (p = 0.32).Adjunctive dexamethasone appears to improve the probability of survival in patients with TBM, until at least two years of follow-up. We could not demonstrate a five-year survival benefit of dexamethasone treatment which may be confined to patients with grade 1 TBM.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01317654."
https://openalex.org/W2017283877,"Hemorrhage is a clinically important manifestation of viperid snakebite envenomings, and is induced by snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs). Hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic SVMPs hydrolyze some basement membrane (BM) and associated extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Nevertheless, only hemorrhagic SVMPs are able to disrupt microvessels; the mechanisms behind this functional difference remain largely unknown. We compared the proteolytic activity of the hemorrhagic P-I SVMP BaP1, from the venom of Bothrops asper, and the non-hemorrhagic P-I SVMP leucurolysin-a (leuc-a), from the venom of Bothrops leucurus, on several substrates in vitro and in vivo, focusing on BM proteins. When incubated with Matrigel, a soluble extract of BM, both enzymes hydrolyzed laminin, nidogen and perlecan, albeit BaP1 did it at a faster rate. Type IV collagen was readily digested by BaP1 while leuc-a only induced a slight hydrolysis. Degradation of BM proteins in vivo was studied in mouse gastrocnemius muscle. Western blot analysis of muscle tissue homogenates showed a similar degradation of laminin chains by both enzymes, whereas nidogen was cleaved to a higher extent by BaP1, and perlecan and type IV collagen were readily digested by BaP1 but not by leuc-a. Immunohistochemistry of muscle tissue samples showed a decrease in the immunostaining of type IV collagen after injection of BaP1, but not by leuc-a. Proteomic analysis by LC/MS/MS of exudates collected from injected muscle revealed higher amounts of perlecan, and types VI and XV collagens, in exudates from BaP1-injected tissue. The differences in the hemorrhagic activity of these SVMPs could be explained by their variable ability to degrade key BM and associated ECM substrates in vivo, particularly perlecan and several non-fibrillar collagens, which play a mechanical stabilizing role in microvessel structure. These results underscore the key role played by these ECM components in the mechanical stability of microvessels."
https://openalex.org/W2053344734,"Phosphorylation is an important posttranslational modification of proteins in living cells and primarily serves regulatory purposes. Several methods were employed for isolating phosphopeptides from proteolytically digested plasma membranes of Arabidopsis thaliana.

Phosphosites were almost exclusively (9 of 10) in the terminal regulatory domains of the pumps. The AHA2 isoform was subsequently expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The plant protein was phosphorylated at multiple sites in yeast, and surprisingly, seven of nine of the phosphosites identified in AHA2 were identical in the plant and fungal systems even though none of the target sequences in AHA2 show homology to proteins of the fungal host.

https://openalex.org/W2066337536,"Map-based cloning and fine mapping to find genes of interest and marker assisted selection (MAS) requires good genetic maps with reproducible markers. In this study, we saturated the linkage map of the intra-gene pool population of common bean DOR364×BAT477 (DB) by evaluating 2,706 molecular markers including SSR, SNP, and gene-based markers. On average the polymorphism rate was 7.7% due to the narrow genetic base between the parents. The DB linkage map consisted of 291 markers with a total map length of 1,788 cM. A consensus map was built using the core mapping populations derived from inter-gene pool crosses: DOR364×G19833 (DG) and BAT93×JALO EEP558 (BJ). The consensus map consisted of a total of 1,010 markers mapped, with a total map length of 2,041 cM across 11 linkage groups. On average, each linkage group on the consensus map contained 91 markers of which 83% were single copy markers. Finally, a synteny analysis was carried out using our highly saturated consensus maps compared with the soybean pseudo-chromosome assembly. A total of 772 marker sequences were compared with the soybean genome. A total of 44 syntenic blocks were identified. The linkage group Pv6 presented the most diverse pattern of synteny with seven syntenic blocks, and Pv9 showed the most consistent relations with soybean with just two syntenic blocks. Additionally, a co-linear analysis using common bean transcript map information against soybean coding sequences (CDS) revealed the relationship with 787 soybean genes. The common bean consensus map has allowed us to map a larger number of markers, to obtain a more complete coverage of the common bean genome. Our results, combined with synteny relationships provide tools to increase marker density in selected genomic regions to identify closely linked polymorphic markers for indirect selection, fine mapping or for positional cloning."
https://openalex.org/W2159771450,"Locally initiated RNA interference (RNAi) has the potential for spatial propagation, inducing posttranscriptional gene silencing in distant cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans, systemic RNAi requires a phylogenetically conserved transmembrane channel, SID-1. Here, we show that a human SID-1 orthologue, SIDT1, facilitates rapid, contact-dependent, bidirectional small RNA transfer between human cells, resulting in target-specific non-cell-autonomous RNAi. Intercellular small RNA transfer can be both homotypic and heterotypic. We show SIDT1-mediated intercellular transfer of microRNA-21 to be a driver of resistance to the nucleoside analog gemcitabine in human adenocarcinoma cells. Documentation of a SIDT1-dependent small RNA transfer mechanism and the associated phenotypic effects on chemoresistance in human cancer cells raises the possibility that conserved systemic RNAi pathways contribute to the acquisition of drug resistance. Mediators of non-cell-autonomous RNAi may be tractable targets for novel therapies aimed at improving the efficacy of current cytotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2085456980,"Aim To assess the performance of automated disease detection in diabetic retinopathy screening using two field mydriatic photography. Methods Images from 8,271 sequential patient screening episodes from a South London diabetic retinopathy screening service were processed by the Medalytix iGrading™ automated grading system. For each screening episode macular-centred and disc-centred images of both eyes were acquired and independently graded according to the English national grading scheme. Where discrepancies were found between the automated result and original manual grade, internal and external arbitration was used to determine the final study grades. Two versions of the software were used: one that detected microaneurysms alone, and one that detected blot haemorrhages and exudates in addition to microaneurysms. Results for each version were calculated once using both fields and once using the macula-centred field alone. Results Of the 8,271 episodes, 346 (4.2%) were considered unassessable. Referable disease was detected in 587 episodes (7.1%). The sensitivity of the automated system for detecting unassessable images ranged from 97.4% to 99.1% depending on configuration. The sensitivity of the automated system for referable episodes ranged from 98.3% to 99.3%. All the episodes that included proliferative or pre-proliferative retinopathy were detected by the automated system regardless of configuration (192/192, 95% confidence interval 98.0% to 100%). If implemented as the first step in grading, the automated system would have reduced the manual grading effort by between 2,183 and 3,147 patient episodes (26.4% to 38.1%). Conclusion Automated grading can safely reduce the workload of manual grading using two field, mydriatic photography in a routine screening service."
https://openalex.org/W2167294589,"Ploidy varies tremendously within and between species, yet the factors that influence when or why ploidy variants are adaptive remains poorly understood. Our previous work found that diploid individuals repeatedly arose within ten replicate haploid populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in each case we witnessed diploid takeover within ~1800 asexual generations of batch culture evolution in the lab. The character that allowed diploids to rise in frequency within haploid populations remains unknown. Here we present a number of experiments conducted with the goal to determine what this trait (or traits) might have been. Experiments were conducted both by sampling a small number of colonies from the stocks frozen every two weeks (~ 93 generations) during the original experiment, as well through sampling a larger number of colonies at the two time points where polymorphism for ploidy was most prevalent. Surprisingly, none of our fitness component measures (lag phase, growth rate, biomass production) indicated an advantage to diploidy. Similarly, competition assays against a common competitor and direct competition between haploid and diploid colonies isolated from the same time point failed to indicate a diploid advantage. Furthermore, we uncovered a tremendous amount of trait variation among colonies of the same ploidy level. Only late-appearing diploids showed a competitive advantage over haploids, indicating that the fitness advantage that allowed eventual takeover was not diploidy per se but an attribute of a subset of diploid lineages. Nevertheless, the initial rise in diploids to intermediate frequency cannot be explained by any of the fitness measures used; we suggest that the resolution to this mystery is negative frequency-dependent selection, which is ignored in the standard fitness measures used."
https://openalex.org/W2118663502,"Background Forecasting the consequences of accelerating rates of changes in biodiversity for ecosystem functioning requires a mechanistic understanding of the relationships between the structure of biological communities and variation in plant functional characteristics. So far, experimental data of how plant species diversity influences the investment of individual plants in direct chemical defences against herbivores and pathogens is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings We used Plantago lanceolata as a model species in experimental grasslands differing in species richness and composition (Jena Experiment) to investigate foliar concentrations of the iridoid glycosides (IG), catalpol and its biosynthetic precursor aucubin. Total IG and aucubin concentrations decreased, while catalpol concentrations increased with increasing plant diversity in terms of species or functional group richness. Negative plant diversity effects on total IG and aucubin concentrations correlated with increasing specific leaf area of P. lanceolata, suggesting that greater allocation to light acquisition reduced the investment into these carbon-based defence components. In contrast, increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations best explained increasing concentrations of the biosynthetically more advanced IG, catalpol. Observed levels of leaf damage explained a significant proportion of variation in total IG and aucubin concentrations, but did not account for variance in catalpol concentrations. Conclusions/Significance Our results clearly show that plants growing in communities of varying species richness and composition differ in their defensive chemistry, which may modulate plant susceptibility to enemy attack and consequently their interactions with higher trophic level organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1990108397,"Species interactions play a critical role in biological invasions. For example, exotic plant and microbe mutualists can facilitate each other's spread as they co-invade novel ranges. Environmental context may influence the effect of mutualisms on invasions in heterogeneous environments, however these effects are poorly understood. We examined the mutualism between the legume, Medicago polymorpha, and the rhizobium, Ensifer medicae, which have both invaded California grasslands. Many of these invaded grasslands are composed of a patchwork of harsh serpentine and relatively benign non-serpentine soils. We grew legume genotypes collected from serpentine or non-serpentine soil in both types of soil in combination with rhizobium genotypes from serpentine or non-serpentine soils and in the absence of rhizobia. Legumes invested more strongly in the mutualism in the home soil type and trends in fitness suggested that this ecotypic divergence was adaptive. Serpentine legumes had greater allocation to symbiotic root nodules in serpentine soil than did non-serpentine legumes and non-serpentine legumes had greater allocation to nodules in non-serpentine soil than did serpentine legumes. Therefore, this invasive legume has undergone the rapid evolution of divergence for soil-specific investment in the mutualism. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the mutualism was less beneficial for legumes grown on the stressful serpentine soil than on the non-serpentine soil, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of serpentine on the benefits derived from the interaction. The soil-specific ability to allocate to a robust microbial mutualism may be a critical, and previously overlooked, adaptation for plants adapting to heterogeneous environments during invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1987167556,"Background Because mitochondria play an essential role in energy metabolism, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis, sequence variation in the mitochondrial genome has been postulated to be a contributing factor to the etiology of multifactorial age-related diseases, including cancer. The aim of the present study was to compare the frequencies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups as well as control region (CR) polymorphisms of patients with malignant melanoma (n = 351) versus those of healthy controls (n = 1598) in Middle Europe. Methodology and Principal Findings Using primer extension analysis and DNA sequencing, we identified all nine major European mitochondrial haplogroups and known CR polymorphisms. The frequencies of the major mitochondrial haplogroups did not differ significantly between patients and control subjects, whereas the frequencies of the one another linked CR polymorphisms A16183C, T16189C, C16192T, C16270T and T195C were significantly higher in patients with melanoma compared to the controls. Regarding clinical characteristics of the patient cohort, none of the nine major European haplogroups was associated with either Breslow thickness or distant metastasis. The CR polymorphisms A302CC-insertion and T310C-insertion were significantly associated with mean Breslow thickness, whereas the CR polymorphism T16519C was associated with metastasis. Conclusions and Significance Our results suggest that mtDNA variations could be involved in melanoma etiology and pathogenesis, although the functional consequence of CR polymorphisms remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1968635626,"Background Evidence suggests that elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) in midlife is associated with increased risk for cognitive impairment later in life. There is mixed evidence regarding the effects of late life elevated SBP or PP on cognitive function, and limited information on the role of female gender. Methods/Principal Findings Effects of SBPand PPon cognitive abilities at baseline and over a 9-year period were evaluated in 337 non-demented community-dwelling female participants over age 70 in the Women's Health and Aging Study II using logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Participants aged 76–80 years with SBP≥160 mmHg or PP≥84 mmHg showed increased incidence of impairment on Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT, Part B), a measure of executive function, over time when compared to the control group that included participants with normal and pre-hypertensive SBP (<120 and 120–139 mmHg) or participants with low PP (<68 mmHg) (HR = 5.05 [95%CI = 1.42, 18.04], [HR = 5.12 [95%CI = 1.11; 23.62], respectively). Participants aged 70–75 years with PP≥71 mmHg had at least a two-fold higher incidence of impairment on HVLT-I, a measure of verbal learning, over time when compared to participants with low PP (<68 mmHg) (HR = 2.44 [95%CI = 1.11, 5.39]). Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that elevated SBP or PP in older non-demented women increases risk for late-life cognitive impairment and that PP could be used when assessing the risk for impairment in cognitive abilities. These results warrant further, larger studies to evaluate possible effects of elevated blood pressure in normal cognitive aging."

In the heart, activation of K(ACh) mediates the vagal (parasympathetic) negative chronotropic effect on heart rate. Yet, the effect of cholesterol on K(ACh) is unknown. Here we show that cholesterol plays a critical role in modulating K(ACh) currents (I(K,ACh)) in atrial cardiomyocytes. Specifically, cholesterol enrichment of rabbit atrial cardiomyocytes led to enhanced channel activity while cholesterol depletion suppressed I(K,ACh). Moreover, a high-cholesterol diet resulted in up to 3-fold increase in I(K,ACh) in rodents. In accordance, elevated currents were observed in Xenopus oocytes expressing the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 heteromer that underlies I(K,ACh). Furthermore, our data suggest that cholesterol affects I(K,ACh) via a mechanism which is independent of both PI(4,5)P(2) and Gβγ. Interestingly, the effect of cholesterol on I(K,ACh) is opposite to its effect on I(K1) in atrial myocytes. The latter are suppressed by cholesterol enrichment and by high-cholesterol diet, and facilitated following cholesterol depletion. These findings establish that cholesterol plays a critical role in modulating I(K,ACh) in atrial cardiomyocytes via a mechanism independent of the channel's major modulators."
https://openalex.org/W1981589354,"Background Most Yersinia pestis strains are known to express a capsule-like antigen, fraction 1 (F1). F1 is encoded by the caf1 gene located on the large 100-kb pFra plasmid, which is found in Y. pestis but not in closely related species such as Yersinia enterocolytica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In order to find antibodies specifically binding to Y. pestis we screened a large single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library using purified F1 antigen as a selection target. Different forms of the selected antibodies were used to establish assays for recombinant F1 antigen and Y. pestis detection. Methods Phage antibody panning was performed against F1 in an automated fashion using the Kingfisher magnetic bead system. Selected scFvs were screened for F1-binding specificity by one-step alkaline phosphatase enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and assayed for binding to recombinant antigen and/or Y. pestis by flow cytometry and whole-cell ELISA. Results Seven of the eight selected scFvs were shown to specifically bind both recombinant F1 and a panel of F1-positive Yersinia cells. The majority of the soluble scFvs were found to be difficult to purify, unstable and prone to cross-reactivity with F1-negative Yersinia strains, whereas phage displayed scFvs were found to be easy to purify/label and remarkably stable. Furthermore direct fluorescent labeling of phage displaying scFv allowed for an easy one-step flow cytometry assay. Slight cross-reactivity was observed when fixed cells were used in ELISA. Conclusions Our high throughput methods of selection and screening allowed for time and cost effective discovery of seven scFvs specifically binding Y. pestis F1 antigen. We describe implementation of different methods for phage-based immunoassay. Based on the success of these methods and the proven stability of phage, we indicate that the use of phage-displayed, rather than phage-free proteins, might generally overcome the shortcomings of scFv antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2098604972,"RNA interference (RNAi) of virus-specific genes offers the possibility of developing a new anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV) therapy. Recent studies have revealed that siRNAs can induce an innate immune response in vitro and in vivo. Here, HBVx (HBx) mRNA expression and HBV replication were significantly inhibited, followed by the enhancement of expression of type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-stimulated genes (ISG15 and ISG56) and proinflammatory cytokines after HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with chemically synthesized HBx-siRNAs. Transfection with HBx-siRNAs also significantly increased expression of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) in HepG2.2.15 cells, followed by activation of downstream signaling events such as eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2-α). In PKR-over-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells, HBx-siRNAs exerted more potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication and greater production of type I IFNs. By contrast, the inhibitory effect of HBx-siRNAs on HBV replication was attenuated when PKR was inhibited or silenced, demonstrating that HBx-siRNAs greatly promoted PKR activation, leading to the higher production of type I IFN. Therefore, we concluded that PKR is involved in the innate immune effects mediated by HBx-siRNAs and further contributes to HBV inhibition. The bifunctional siRNAs with both gene silencing and innate immune activation properties may represent a new potential strategy for treatment of HBV."
https://openalex.org/W1968528072,"Background Live vaccines have distinct safety profiles, potentially causing systemic reactions one to 2 weeks after administration. In the province of Ontario, Canada, live MMR vaccine is currently recommended at age 12 months and 18 months. Methods Using the self-controlled case series design we examined 271,495 12 month vaccinations and 184,312 18 month vaccinations to examine the relative incidence of the composite endpoint of emergency room visits or hospital admissions in consecutive one day intervals following vaccination. These were compared to a control period 20 to 28 days later. In a post-hoc analysis we examined the reasons for emergency room visits and the average acuity score at presentation for children during the at-risk period following the 12 month vaccine. Results Four to 12 days post 12 month vaccination, children had a 1.33 (1.29–1.38) increased relative incidence of the combined endpoint compared to the control period, or at least one event during the risk interval for every 168 children vaccinated. Ten to 12 days post 18 month vaccination, the relative incidence was 1.25 (95%, 1.17–1.33) which represented at least one excess event for every 730 children vaccinated. The primary reason for increased events was statistically significant elevations in emergency room visits following all vaccinations. There were non-significant increases in hospital admissions. There were an additional 20 febrile seizures for every 100,000 vaccinated at 12 months. Conclusions There are significantly elevated risks of primarily emergency room visits approximately one to two weeks following 12 and 18 month vaccination. Future studies should examine whether these events could be predicted or prevented."
https://openalex.org/W2050304682,"Pkd2L1 (also called TRPP3) is a non-selective cation channel permeable to Ca(2+), Na(+), and K(+) and is activated by Ca(2+). It is also part of an acid-triggered off-response cation channel complex. We previously reported roles of the Pkd2L1 C-terminal fragments in its channel function, but the role of the N terminus remains unclear. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that the Pkd2L1 N terminus interacts with the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffolding/anchoring protein implicated in various cellular functions. This interaction requires the last two Trp-Asp (WD) motifs of RACK1 and fragment Ala(19)-Pro(45) of Pkd2L1. The interaction was confirmed by GST pulldown, blot overlay, and co-immunoprecipitation assays. By (45)Ca tracer uptake and two-microelectrode voltage clamp electrophysiology, we found that in Xenopus oocytes with RACK1 overexpression Pkd2L1 channel activity is abolished or substantially reduced. Combining with oocyte surface biotinylation experiments, we demonstrated that RACK1 inhibits the function of Pkd2L1 channel on the plasma membrane in addition to reducing its total and plasma membrane expression. Overexpressing Pkd2L1 N- or C-terminal fragments as potential blocking peptides for the Pkd2L1-RACK1 interaction, we found that Pkd2L1 N-terminal fragment Met(1)-Pro(45), but not Ile(40)-Ile(97) or C-terminal fragments, abolishes the inhibition of Pkd2L1 channel by overexpressed and oocyte-native RACK1 likely through disrupting the Pkd2L1-RACK1 association. Taken together, our study demonstrated that RACK1 inhibits Pkd2L1 channel function through binding to domain Met(1)-Pro(45) of Pkd2L1. Thus, Pkd2L1 is a novel target channel whose function is regulated by the versatile scaffolding protein RACK1."

https://openalex.org/W1973943659,"For proteins, the mechanical properties of the folded state are directly related to function, which generally entails conformational motion. Through sub-Angstrom resolution measurements of the AC mechanical susceptibility of a globular protein we describe a new fundamental materials property of the folded state. For increasing amplitude of the forcing, there is a reversible transition from elastic to viscoelastic response. At fixed frequency, the amplitude of the deformation is piecewise linear in the force, with different slopes in the elastic and viscoelastic regimes. Effectively, the protein softens beyond a yield point defined by this transition. We propose that ligand induced conformational changes generally operate in this viscoelastic regime, and that this is a universal property of the folded state."
https://openalex.org/W1991488007,"Immunocontraception has been widely used as a management tool to reduce population growth in captive as well as wild populations of various fauna. We model the use of an individual-based rotational immunocontraception plan on a wild elephant, Loxodonta africana, population and quantify the social and reproductive advantages of this method of implementation using adaptive management. The use of immunocontraception on an individual, rotational basis stretches the inter-calving interval for each individual female elephant to a management-determined interval, preventing exposing females to unlimited long-term immunocontraception use (which may have as yet undocumented negative effects). Such rotational immunocontraception can effectively lower population growth rates, age the population, and alter the age structure. Furthermore, such structured intervention can simulate natural process such as predation or episodic catastrophic events (e.g., drought), which regulates calf recruitment within an abnormally structured population. A rotational immunocontraception plan is a feasible and useful elephant population management tool, especially in a small, enclosed conservation area. Such approaches should be considered for other long-lived, social species in enclosed areas where the long-term consequences of consistent contraception may be unknown."

Schistosomes are digenetic trematodes (flukes) that cycle between a mammalian host and a fresh water molluscan intermediate host. Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. hematobium are the three main etiological agents of human schistosomiasis, a widespread parasitic infection that affects an estimated 207 million individuals (1.WHO Schistosomiasis Fact Sheet #115. 2010; Google Scholar). 15,000 deaths per year are attributed to schistosome infection and humans lose 1.7 million disability-adjusted life years, a mark of the high disease burden caused by these parasites (2.WHO World Health Report 2004: Changing History. 2004; : 93-157Google Scholar). Infected individuals are treated with praziquantel (Biltricide), which is only effective against early larvae (schistosomules) and adult worms (3.Gönnert R. Andrews P.

A summary of the efficacy of praziquantel against schistosomes in animal experiments and notes on its mode of action.Arzneimittelforschung. 1981; 31: 538-541PubMed Google Scholar). If left untreated, the disease can progress and persist in human hosts for decades (5.Cook G.C. Bryceson A.D. Lancet. 1988; 1: 127Abstract PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), even in the face of a host strong immune response. Mammalian S. mansoni infection begins with larval degradation of extracellular matrix and cell-cell contacts in the epidermis and dermis, followed by breach of the vascular endothelium, migration of the schistosomula to the lungs, prolonged residence of adults in the hepatic portal system, and egg passage through the intestinal wall (see Fig. 2a). Proteomic analysis of S. mansoni larval secretions has identified several parasite proteins that could function in host immune evasion and/or promotion of parasite survival (6.Knudsen G.M.

One class of proteins that was identified and whose role in the pathobiology of S. mansoni has yet to be elucidated is that of a superfamily of macromolecular serine protease inhibitors (serpins). 2The abbreviations used are:serpinserine/cysteine protease inhibitorSmSrpQS. mansoni serpin QSmCES. mansoni cercarial elastaseZbenzyloxycarbonylZ-AAPF-CMKZ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketoneZ-AAPL-CMKZ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-chloromethyl ketoneZ-AAPV-CMKZ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketoneqPCRquantitative PCR. serine/cysteine protease inhibitor S. mansoni serpin Q S. mansoni cercarial elastase benzyloxycarbonyl Z-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketone Z-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-chloromethyl ketone Z-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone quantitative PCR. Serpins are a structurally conserved family of macromolecular inhibitors of cysteine and serine proteases that are found in virtually all biological systems (reviewed in Ref. 11.Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Viral inhibition of inflammation. Cowpox virus encodes an inhibitor of the interleukin-1 β converting enzyme.Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Their structure characteristically contains 8–9 α-helices and 3 β-sheets (supplemental Fig. S1b). Serine protease inhibition occurs by the serpin irreversibly binding to the active site serine and forming a covalent complex with the protease (supplemental Fig. S1c). In mammals, serpins are involved in the regulation of proteases in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, apoptosis, development, and inflammation. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, an intracellular serpin, Srp6, was shown to be vital for worm survival during various stresses by preventing lysosomal protease injury to the worm (10.Luke C.J. Pak S.C. Askew Y.S. Naviglia T.L. Askew D.J. Nobar S.M. Vetica A.C. Long O.S. Watkins S.C. Stolz D.B. Barstead R.J. Moulder G.L. Bromme D. Silverman G.A. An intracellular serpin regulates necrosis by inhibiting the induction and sequelae of lysosomal injury.Cell. 2007; 130: 1108-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additionally, serpins have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. For example, cowpox virus serpin, CrmA, is involved in dampening the host inflammatory response by inhibiting IL-1β converting enzyme (11.Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A.

Cowpox virus encodes an inhibitor of the interleukin-1 β converting enzyme.Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Several serpins have been characterized in parasites. One serpin identified in Clonorchis sinensis, CsSERPIN, is localized in the reproductive glands of the liver fluke (13.Kang J.M. Sohn W.M.

CsSERPIN has strong chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (13.Kang J.M. Sohn W.M. Ju J.W. Kim T.S. Na B.K.

The cognate protease and biological function of these parasitic serpins remains largely speculative. Here we present evidence that the complete clone 8 protein, hereafter called SmSrpQ (Smp_062080), is a serpin involved in regulating the activity of a parasite-derived protease within the host. S. mansoni (Puerto Rican isolate) specimens were maintained in the laboratory by using Biomphalaria glabrata as the intermediate snail host and golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) as the mammalian host. Cercariae were harvested from B. glabrata by light induction and washed according to a previously published protocol (17.Lim K.C. Sun E. Bahgat M. Bucks D. Guy R. Hinz R.S. Cullander C. McKerrow J.H. Blockage of skin invasion by schistosome cercariae by serine protease inhibitors.Am. J. Trop Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cercariae used for schistosomula production were washed twice in RPMI and mechanically sheared using a 22-gauge needle to remove their tails. They were then cultured for 24–48 h in Basch Schistosoma culture medium 169 with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin to produce schistosomula. Eggs were collected from three hamster livers and harvested as previously described (18.Browne H.G. Thomas J.I. A method for isolating pure, viable schistosome eggs from host tissues.J. Parasitol. 1963; 49: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in which livers were homogenized in 2× saline solution and the eggs were cleared of mammalian tissue. Miracidia were hatched from the eggs by slowly removing the saline solution and replacing it with hypotonic solution. Lung schistosomula were dissected from hamster lungs, and adult worms were perfused from hamster livers 3 days and 6 weeks post infection, respectively. Cercarial/egg/adult/snail hepatopancreatic lysates were prepared by freeze/thawing parasites or snail tissue once in an ethanol/dry ice bath followed by homogenization and sonication using the Sonifer 250 (Branson) at 30% output for 30 s. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min in the Centrifuge 5415D (Eppendorf, Germany), and supernatants were collected. Total RNA samples were collected by homogenizing and sonicating tissue/parasites in TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA was resuspended in water, and treated with 5 units of DNase I (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then heat-inactivated and cleaned using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Concentrations of final total RNA samples were determined using NanoDrop 3300 (Thermo Scientific). For quantitative PCRs and cloning, cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction using oligo(dT) and 50 ng of total RNA per reaction. Control reactions containing no reverse transcriptase were also carried out. cDNA reactions were diluted 1:4, and 5 μl/reaction was used for subsequent qPCR reactions. All qPCR reactions were carried out using a Roche Light Cycler 480 SYBR green master mix and the Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR system. Primers were designed to amplify a 250-bp fragment with an amplification program 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s and 30 s at 72 °C (forward primer: 5′-GGT TTT ATG GAG ATA TAG TAG AAG AAA AAC AGA GTC ATT CG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GGT TGA TAG TGA TTG AGA CGA AAA GAG TTC TTG ATT TTT TC-3′). Reactions were also carried out in triplicate with cytochrome oxidase (forward primer: 5′-TAC GGT TGG TGG TGT CAC AG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ACG GCC ATC ACC ATA CTA GC-3′) as an internal standard. For Northern blots, 5 μg of total RNA was denatured in formaldehyde, and formamide was then loaded onto a 1.1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and run for 90 min at 72 V. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to a polyvinylidene membrane (Bio-Rad) and cross-linked to the membrane using Stratalinker (Stratagene). 32P-labeled DNA probes were generated using a RediPrime II DNA labeling kit (GE Life Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 4× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate. cDNA from cercariae, prepared as described above, was used to subclone SmSrpQ into pET28a+ for Escherichia coli overexpression using forward primer 5′-GAG CTC ATG GAT GTA TTA CAA TCC CTT AAA AC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCG GCC GCT TAA TAT TGA TCT ATT GGA TTT G-3′. The amplicon was first cloned into TOPO-TA pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), digested with SacI and NotI, and directionally ligated to pET28a+ (Novagen). Plasmids were used to transform Xjb (DE3), an autolysing E. coli strain (Zymo Research). Induction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction. Inclusion bodies were collected and solubilized in 6 m guanidine solution (6 m guanidine, 100 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Hexa-His-tagged SmSrpQ was bound to Ni2+-agarose beads (immobilized metal affinity chromatography), washed with 8 m urea buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole), and eluted with 8 m urea solution with 500 mm imidazole. Purified protein was excised from SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry or used for the immunization of 8-week-old BALB/c mice. Pre-bleeds were collected, and mice received two boosts every 4 weeks. Excised protein gel slices were homogenized in PBS, and TiterMax Gold (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an adjuvant. Rabbit anti-SmCE antibodies were previously generated (19.Salter J.P. Choe Y. Albrecht H. Franklin C. Lim K.C. Craik C.S. McKerrow J.H.

Samples were boiled under reducing conditions, resolved by SDS-PAGE analysis, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were blocked overnight with 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.25% Tween 20). Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mouse anti-SmSrpQ antibodies (1:2000) or rabbit anti-SmCE antibodies (1:2000), washed with TBS-T, and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (GE Life Science, 1:2000). Membranes were extensively washed and visualized with ECL Western detection reagents (GE Life Science). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (20.Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal.

Freshly collected cercariae were transformed into schistosomula in RPMI by passing the larvae through a 22-gauge needle 10 times, and tails were removed. Schistosomula were cultured in 4 ml of schistosomula culture media containing 2% BSA at 37 °C. After each incubation period of either 30 min or 1 h, the parasites were removed washed, gently centrifuged, transferred into fresh media, and visually inspected under a microscope to ensure viability and intact morphology. At each time point all media were collected, including the wash media. Plates were scraped as previously described (6.Knudsen G.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Lim K.C. Hansell E. McKerrow J.H.

These were collected and pooled with the media. 1 mm PMSF was added to prevent proteolytic cleavage of proteins. Samples were lyophilized and resuspended in water for Western blot analysis. Parasites were fixed overnight in cold acetone at −20 °C then air-dried as previously described (21.Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Schistosoma mansoni proteases Sm31 (cathepsin B) and Sm32 (legumain) are expressed in the cecum and protonephridia of cercariae.J.

Primary antibody was diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4.0 °C, followed by three 4-h washes in wash buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100); secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Alexa Fluor) was diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer, incubated overnight, and washed extensively. Images were taken using the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. All confocal images were taken with the gain and offset values set from negative controls using pre-bleed serum to ensure a low background signal. Human skin sections were removed from the abdomen of a recently deceased human male in accordance with Internal Review Board-approved necroscopy practices. Skin samples were washed with RPMI, and the subcutaneous fat was removed. Cercarial infection was carried out by placing skin sections over warm RPMI-filled wells as previously described (17.Lim K.C. Sun E. Bahgat M. Bucks D. Guy R. Hinz R.S. Cullander C. McKerrow J.H. Blockage of skin invasion by schistosome cercariae by serine protease inhibitors.Am. J. Trop Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and placing the infective cercariae over the skin. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, skin sections were removed and fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Fluorescence staining was carried out by blocking the sections in 20% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. Antibodies were diluted in PBS with 2% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 and incubated for 2 h. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor) were diluted 1:250 and incubated for 1 h. Slides were mounted in Vectamount with DAPI (Vectashield). Images were taken using the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Reactions were carried out using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the pET28a+SmSrpQ plasmid was linearized downstream of the SmSrpQ ORF using NotI, and the transcription/translation reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. A similar pET28a+ clone of human α1-antitrypsin was constructed and used as a positive control. Inhibition reactions were generally performed in 20 mm Tris, 25 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at room temperature. Cercarial lysate was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with Z-AAPF-CMK, Z-AAPL-CMK, Z-AAPV-CMK, E-64, or PMSF prior to incubation with 35S-SmSrpQ for 10 min at room temperature. CMK inhibitors were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA), whereas PMSF was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The full-length amino acid sequence of clone 8 was completed and renamed SmSrpQ. The predicted P1-P1′ reactive center loop specificity was determined to be Leu-Ser based on the alignment with α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 1, triangle). qPCR analysis revealed that SmSrpQ is expressed in the late schistosome sporocysts when cercariae are completing development in the intermediate snail host, and in aquatic free-swimming cercariae. Transcript levels remained high in cercariae-derived schistosomula after 24 h of in vitro culturing (Fig. 2b). These life stages correspond to the early skin invasion stages of infection (Fig. 2a). Peak transcript levels were seen in the cercarial stage. There was less transcript signal in early daughter sporocysts. Because sporocyst RNA samples were isolated from snail hepatopancreas, these samples contained high amounts of snail RNA as well as parasite-derived RNA. To verify this expression profile especially in the life stages where snail RNA might mask the qPCR signal of schistosome transcripts, Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig. 2c). DNA probes detected peak transcripts in late sporocysts. Transcripts were also detected in cercariae and daughter sporocysts. SmSrpQ was not detected in adult worms. Northern blot analysis also did not detect any expression in egg/miracidia total RNA extracts. The amino acid sequence of SmSrpQ contains all the components necessary to function as an inhibitory serpin (22.Quezada L.A. McKerrow J.H. Schistosome serine protease inhibitors. Parasite defense or homeostasis?.An Acad. Bras. Cienc. 2011; 83: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To confirm its ability to act as a suicide substrate inhibitor and form a complex with proteases, radiolabeled His6-tagged SmSrpQ (supplemental Fig. S1a) was produced using a cell-free transcription/translation reaction. The reaction yielded the expected 49-kDa-tagged serpin protein (Fig. 3a). The recombinant serpin formed a complex with a component of the cercarial lysate, producing a product of ∼68 kDa (Fig. 3a, black arrow). This complex formed under all three temperatures tested. A lower molecular weight band was also detected consistent with the cleaved serpin (Fig. 3a, double arrow). 35S-SmSrpQ only bound to a protease species found in the late sporocyst and cercaria stages. 35S-SmSrpQ did not bind to any components of the lysate from early daughter sporocysts, uninfected snail, or adult worms (Fig. 3b). 35S-SmSrpQ was not able to form a complex with neutrophil elastase and chymotrypsin (Fig. 3c). In contrast, 35S-α1-antitrypsin was able to form a complex with chymotrypsin and neutrophil elastase under the same conditions (Fig. 3c, black arrow). When these reactions were carried out for longer and under more physiological conditions, 35S-SmSrpQ was still unable to complex with neutrophil elastase and chymotrypsin (Fig. 3d). 35S-SmSrpQ was also unable to form an SDS-stable complex with pancreatic elastase, cathepsin G, and recombinant human chymase (data not shown). To confirm that the serpin-protease complex was formed via the enzyme active site, the crude cercarial lysate was preincubated with PMSF, a small molecule chemical inhibitor that irreversibly modifies the active site serine of serine hydrolases (Fig. 4). At 400, 200, and 100 μm PMSF uncleaved 35S-SmSrpQ (double arrow, lanes 3, 4, and 5, respectively) was detected. In the methanol control (lane 2), where both cleaved and complexed 35S-SmSrpQ are seen, the presence of uncleaved serpin correlated with a corresponding decrease in the amount of complex detected (black arrow), as evidenced by a decrease in band intensity. To examine the active site P1 specificity of the serpin-targeted protease, the lysate was preincubated with tetrapeptide chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inhibitors, and the formation of the serpin-protease complex was assessed. Complex formation was highly sensitive to Z-AAPF-CMK. 25 μm Z-AAPF-CMK reduced the level of complex formation to 61% of the band intensity seen in the DMSO control reaction (Fig. 4b). Z-AAPL-CMK also had an effect at 200 μm and 100 μm, whereas preincubation with Z-AAPV-CMK had no effect on complex formation (Fig. 4c). The predicted specificity of the reactive center loop of SmSrpQ, the sensitivity to PMSF, and the specific effects of the CMK inhibitors were all consistent with the previously reported biochemical characteristics of SmCE (23.Salter J.P. Lim K.C. Hansell E. Hsieh I. McKerrow J.H. Schistosome invasion of human skin and degradation of dermal elastin are mediated by a single serine protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38667-38673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); SmCE is the major protease found in larval stages. To confirm the presence of a protein complex between endogenous SmCE and SmSrpQ, Western blots were performed on the crude lysates from different life stages. The lysates were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min to allow a complex to form. Western blots of uninfected snails and adults detected no SmSrpQ (Fig. 5a, lanes 1 and 5, respectively). Although, SmSrpQ protein (double arrow) was detected in the daughter sporocysts, no complex (black arrow) was seen. Late sporocysts and cercarial lysates contained both unbound SmSrpQ and complexed serpin (Fig. 5a, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). The size of the complex was approximately the same size and in the same life stages as the 68-kDa complex detected with the in vitro translated 35S-SmSrpQ. Protein levels of SmSrpQ were higher in the cercarial stage than in late sporocysts. Daughter sporocysts exclusively contained the higher molecular weight, inactive zymogen of SmCE (Fig. 5b, black star). The activated, lower molecular weight SmCE protein (Fig. 5b, open arrowhead) was found in the lysates of late sporocysts and cercariae. SmCE has been observed to form a dimer under certain conditions, which would account for the 50-kDa central band observed with the α-SmCE antibody in the cercarial lysate (Fig. 5b, lane 4). The higher molecular weight band corresponding to a complex between SmCE and SmSrpQ was detected in late sporocysts and cercarial lysate (Fig. 5b, black arrow). Given that SmCE and SmSrpQ are produced by the parasite at similar time points and SmCE appears to be active in late sporocysts and cercariae, the question was raised: does SmSrpQ prevent parasitic tissue damage from SmCE activity within the parasite? To address this question, localization studies of the SmSprQ and SmCE in cercariae, 24-h schistosomula, and 3-day-old lung stage schistosomula were performed to identify the location and any interaction of SmSrpQ and SmCE. S. mansoni larvae contained several secretory glands that release material onto and into the host during skin invasion: the post-acetabular glands, the pre-acetabular glands, and the head glands (Fig. 6a). Factors needed for parasite binding and penetration are packaged in acetabular secretory granules and exit from extended cellular processes called ducts. These cell processes extend along the body of the larva to allow release of secretions into the environment at the head of the parasite (24.Dorsey C.H. Cousin C.E. Lewis F.A. Stirewalt M.A. Ultrastructure of the Schistosoma mansoni cercaria.Micron. 2002; 33: 279-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Confocal images show that SmSrpQ was located in the post-acetabular glands and their corresponding ducts, in one set of pre-acetabular glands, and the head gland of the cercaria (Fig. 6b, red). In 24-h schistosomula, residual SmSrpQ is seen in similar regions of the parasite (Fig. 6c, red) except that no serpin protein was detected in the head gland. In the cercaria SmCE was located in a separate set of pre-acetabular glands and their corresponding ducts (Fig. 6b, blue). In the 24-h schistosomula, SmCE was found as residual protein in the pre-acetabular glands (Fig. 6c, blue). SmCE was neither detected in the head gland nor in the post-acetabular glands. Lung stage schistosomula isolated from infected hamsters had virtually no SmSrpQ and Sm"
https://openalex.org/W2150153762,"Demonstrating and quantifying the respective roles of social interactions and external stimuli governing fish dynamics is key to understanding fish spatial distribution. If seminal studies have contributed to our understanding of fish spatial organization in schools, little experimental information is available on fish in their natural environment, where aggregations often occur in the presence of spatial heterogeneities. Here, we applied novel modeling approaches coupled to accurate acoustic tracking for studying the dynamics of a group of gregarious fish in a heterogeneous environment. To this purpose, we acoustically tracked with submeter resolution the positions of twelve small pelagic fish (Selar crumenophthalmus) in the presence of an anchored floating object, constituting a point of attraction for several fish species. We constructed a field-based model for aggregated-fish dynamics, deriving effective interactions for both social and external stimuli from experiments. We tuned the model parameters that best fit the experimental data and quantified the importance of social interactions in the aggregation, providing an explanation for the spatial structure of fish aggregations found around floating objects. Our results can be generalized to other gregarious species and contexts as long as it is possible to observe the fine-scale movements of a subset of individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2165410345,"In insects and crustaceans, the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) occurs in many different isoforms. These are produced by mutually exclusive alternative splicing of dozens of tandem duplicated exons coding for parts or whole immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of the Dscam protein. This diversity plays a role in the development of the nervous system and also in the immune system. Structural analysis of the protein suggested candidate epitopes where binding to pathogens could occur. These epitopes are coded by regions of the duplicated exons and are therefore diverse within individuals. Here we apply molecular population genetics and molecular evolution analyses using Daphnia magna and several Drosophila species to investigate the potential role of natural selection in the divergence between orthologs of these duplicated exons among species, as well as between paralogous exons within species. We found no evidence for a role of positive selection in the divergence of these paralogous exons. However, the power of this test was low, and the fact that no signs of gene conversion between paralogous exons were found suggests that paralog diversity may nonetheless be maintained by selection. The analysis of orthologous exons in Drosophila and in Daphnia revealed an excess of non-synonymous polymorphisms in the epitopes putatively involved in pathogen binding. This may be a sign of balancing selection. Indeed, in Dr. melanogaster the same derived non-synonymous alleles segregate in several populations around the world. Yet other hallmarks of balancing selection were not found. Hence, we cannot rule out that the excess of non-synonymous polymorphisms is caused by segregating slightly deleterious alleles, thus potentially indicating reduced selective constraints in the putative pathogen binding epitopes of Dscam."
https://openalex.org/W2054715502,"Campylobacter successfully colonizes broiler chickens, but little is known about the longer term natural history of colonization, since most flocks are slaughtered at an immature age. In this study, the prevalence and genetic diversity of Campylobacter colonizing a single free-range broiler breeder flock was investigated over the course of a year. The age of the flock was the most important factor in determining both the prevalence and diversity of Campylobacter over time. There was no correlation with season, temperature, the amount of rain and sunshine, or the dynamics of colonization amongst geographically and temporally matched broiler flocks. The higher prevalence rates coincided with the age at which broiler chickens are typically slaughtered, but then in the absence of bio-security or other intervention methods, and despite changes in flock management, the prevalence fell to significantly lower levels for the remainder of the study. The genetic diversity of Campylobacter increased as the flock aged, implying that genotypes were accumulated within the flock and may persist for a long time. A better understanding of the ecology of Campylobacter within commercial chicken flocks will allow the design of more effective farm-based interventions."

Selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias are included in the Cochrane ROB tool. It is important to know how this specific tool for assessing ROB has been applied since its release. Our objectives were to evaluate whether and to what extent the new Cochrane ROB tool has been used in Chinese journal papers of acupuncture.We searched CBM, TCM database, CJFD, CSJD, and the Wanfang Database from inception to March 2011. Two reviewers independently selected SRs that primarily focused on acupuncture and moxibustion, from which the data was extracted and analyzed.A total of 836 SRs were identified from the search, of which, 105 were included and four are awaiting assessment. Thirty-six of the 105 SRs were published before release of the Cochrane ROB tool (up to 2009). Most used the Cochrane Handbook 4.2 or Jadad's scale for risk or quality assessment. From 2009 to March 2011 69 SRs were identified. While ""risk of bias"" was reported for approximately two-thirds of SRs, only two SRs mentioned use of a ""risk of bias tool"" in their assessment. Only 5.8% (4/69) of reviews reported information on all six domains which are involved in the ROB tool. A risk of bias graph/summary figure was provided in 2.9% (2/69) of reviews. Most SRs gave information about sequence generation, allocation concealment, blindness, and incomplete outcome data, however, few reviews (5.8%; 4/69) described selective reporting or other potential sources of bias.The Cochrane ""risk of bias"" tool has not been used in all SRs/MAs of acupuncture published in Chinese Journals after 2008.

https://openalex.org/W2121863840,"Spatial Independent Component Analysis (ICA) decomposes the time by space functional MRI (fMRI) matrix into a set of 1-D basis time courses and their associated 3-D spatial maps that are optimized for mutual independence. When applied to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI), ICA produces several spatial independent components (ICs) that seem to have biological relevance - the so-called resting state networks (RSNs). The ICA problem is well posed when the true data generating process follows a linear mixture of ICs model in terms of the identifiability of the mixing matrix. However, the contrast function used for promoting mutual independence in ICA is dependent on the finite amount of observed data and is potentially non-convex with multiple local minima. Hence, each run of ICA could produce potentially different IC estimates even for the same data. One technique to deal with this run-to-run variability of ICA was proposed by Yang et al. (2008) in their algorithm RAICAR which allows for the selection of only those ICs that have a high run-to-run reproducibility. We propose an enhancement to the original RAICAR algorithm that enables us to assign reproducibility p-values to each IC and allows for an objective assessment of both within subject and across subjects reproducibility. We call the resulting algorithm RAICAR-N (N stands for null hypothesis test), and we have applied it to publicly available human rsfMRI data (http://www.nitrc.org). Our reproducibility analyses indicated that many of the published RSNs in rsfMRI literature are highly reproducible. However, we found several other RSNs that are highly reproducible but not frequently listed in the literature."

We engineered the first selective CXCR1 agonists on the basis of residue substitutions in the conserved ELR triad and CXC motif of CXCL8. Our data reveal that the molecular mechanisms of activation of CXCR1 and CXCR2 are distinct: the N-loop of CXCL8 is the major determinant for CXCR1 activation, whereas the N-terminus of CXCL8 (ELR and CXC) is essential for CXCR2 activation. We also found that activation of CXCR1 cross-desensitized CXCR2 responses in human neutrophils co-expressing both receptors, indicating that these novel CXCR1 agonists represent a new class of anti-inflammatory agents. Further, these selective CXCR1 agonists will aid at elucidating the functional significance of CXCR1 in vivo under pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2008464613,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of free-ranging and captive cervids in North America. In this study we established a rodent model for CWD in Syrian golden hamsters that resemble key features of the disease in cervids including cachexia and infection of cardiac muscle. Following one to three serial passages of CWD from white-tailed deer into transgenic mice expressing the hamster prion protein gene, CWD was subsequently passaged into Syrian golden hamsters. In one passage line there were preclinical changes in locomotor activity and a loss of body mass prior to onset of subtle neurological symptoms around 340 days. The clinical symptoms included a prominent wasting disease, similar to cachexia, with a prolonged duration. Other features of CWD in hamsters that were similar to cervid CWD included the brain distribution of the disease-specific isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, prion infection of the central and peripheral neuroendocrine system, and PrPSc deposition in cardiac muscle. There was also prominent PrPSc deposition in the nasal mucosa on the edge of the olfactory sensory epithelium with the lumen of the nasal airway that could have implications for CWD shedding into nasal secretions and disease transmission. Since the mechanism of wasting disease in prion diseases is unknown this hamster CWD model could provide a means to investigate the physiological basis of cachexia, which we propose is due to a prion-induced endocrinopathy. This prion disease phenotype has not been described in hamsters and we designate it as the ‘wasting’ or WST strain of hamster CWD."
https://openalex.org/W2050726798,"Repression and activation of gene transcription involves multiprotein complexes that modify chromatin structure. The integration of these complexes at regulatory sites can be assisted by co-factors that link them to DNA-bound transcriptional regulators. In humans, one such co-factor is the herpes simplex virus host-cell factor 1 (HCF-1), which is implicated in both activation and repression of transcription. We show here that disruption of the gene encoding the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of HCF-1, dHCF, leads to a pleiotropic phenotype involving lethality, sterility, small size, apoptosis, and morphological defects. In Drosophila, repressed and activated transcriptional states of cell fate-determining genes are maintained throughout development by Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) genes, respectively. dHCF mutant flies display morphological phenotypes typical of TrxG mutants and dHCF interacts genetically with both PcG and TrxG genes. Thus, dHCF inactivation enhances the mutant phenotypes of the Pc PcG as well as brm and mor TrxG genes, suggesting that dHCF possesses Enhancer of TrxG and PcG (ETP) properties. Additionally, dHCF interacts with the previously established ETP gene skd. These pleiotropic phenotypes are consistent with broad roles for dHCF in both activation and repression of transcription during fly development."
https://openalex.org/W2093268687,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a highly conserved metallopeptidase. In mammals, the somatic isoform governs blood pressure whereas the germinal isoform (tACE) is required for fertility. In Ecdysozoans, ACE-like enzymes are implicated in reproduction. Despite ACE orthologues being present from bacteria to humans, their function(s) remain(s) unknown in distant organisms such as Lophotrochozoans. In silico analysis of an oyster (Crassostrea gigas) EST library suggested the presence of an ACE orthologue in molluscs. Primer walking and 5′-RACE revealed that the 1.9 kb cDNA encodes CgACE, a 632 amino acid protein displaying a conserved single active site and a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, thus resembling human tACE, as supported by molecular modelling. FRET activity assays and Maldi-TOF spectrometry indicated that CgACE is a functional dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase which is active on Angiotensin I and sensitive to ACE inhibitors and chloride ion concentration. Immunocytochemistry revealed that, as its human counterpart, recombinant CgACE is synthesised as a transmembrane enzyme. RT-qPCR, in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry shed light on a tissue, and development stage, specific expression pattern for CgACE, which is increased in the gonad during spermatogenesis. The use of ACE inhibitors in vivo indicates that the dipeptidase activity of CgACE is crucial for the oyster fertilization. Our study demonstrates that a transmembrane active ACE is present in the oyster Crassostrea gigas, and for the first time ascribes a functional role for ACE in Lophotrochozoans. Its biological function in reproduction is conserved from molluscs to humans, a finding of particular evolutionary interest especially since oysters represent the most important aquaculture resource worldwide."

Cells grown in the presence of pellicin grew 1.5 times faster than untreated cells. Interestingly, growth in pellicin also caused G. xylinus cells to elongate. Measurement of cellulose synthesis in vitro showed that cellulose synthase activity was not directly inhibited by pellicin. Rather, when cellulose synthase activity was measured in cells that were pre-treated with the compound, the rate of cellulose synthesis increased eight-fold over that observed for untreated cells. This phenomenon was also apparent in the rapid production of cellulose when cells grown in the presence of pellicin were washed and transferred to media lacking the inhibitor. The rate at which cellulose was produced could not be accounted for by growth of the organism. Pellicin was not detected when intracellular contents were analyzed. Furthermore, it was found that pellicin exerts its effect extracellularly by interfering with the crystallization of pre-cellulosic tactoidal aggregates. This interference of the crystallization process resulted in enhanced production of cellulose II as evidenced by the ratio of acid insoluble to acid soluble product in in vitro assays and confirmed in vivo by scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. The relative crystallinity index, RCI, of pellicle produced by untreated G. xylinus cultures was 70% while pellicin-grown cultures had RCI of 38%. Mercerized pellicle of untreated cells had RCI of 42%, which further confirms the mechanism of action of pellicin as an inhibitor of the cellulose I crystallization process. Pellicin is a useful tool for the study of cellulose biosynthesis in G. xylinus."
https://openalex.org/W2026603306,"Synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs) are a family of cell adhesion molecules involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Of the five family members, only SALM1, -2, and -3 contain a cytoplasmic C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. We have found that SALM1 is unique among the SALMs because deletion of its PDZ-binding motif (SALM1ΔPDZ) blocks its surface expression in heterologous cells. When expressed in hippocampal neurons, SALM1ΔPDZ had decreased surface expression in dendrites and the cell soma but not in axons, suggesting that the PDZ-binding domain may influence cellular trafficking of SALMs to specific neuronal locations. Endoglycosidase H digestion assays indicated that SALM1ΔPDZ is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in heterologous cells. However, when the entire C-terminal tail of SALM1 was deleted, SALM1 was detected on the cell surface. Using serial deletions, we identified a region of SALM1 that contains a putative dileucine ER retention motif, which is not present in the other SALMs. Mutation of this DXXXLL motif allowed SALM1 to leave the ER and enhanced its surface expression in heterologous cells and neurons. An increase in the number of protrusions at the dendrites and cell body was observed when this SALM1 mutant was expressed in hippocampal neurons. With electron microscopy, these protrusions appeared to be irregular, enlarged spines and filopodia. Thus, enrichment of SALM1 on the cell surface affects dendritic arborization, and intracellular motifs regulate its dendritic versus axonal localization."
https://openalex.org/W1972152052,"Pom2 is predicted to be a dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK) related to Pom1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. DYRKs share a kinase domain capable of catalyzing autophosphorylation on tyrosine and exogenous phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. Here we show that Pom2 is functionally different from the well-characterized Pom1, although they share 55% identity in the kinase domain and the Pom2 kinase domain functionally complements that of Pom1. Pom2 localizes to mitochondria throughout the cell cycle and to the contractile ring during late stages of cytokinesis. Overexpression but not deletion of pom2 results in severe defects in cytokinesis, indicating that Pom2 might share an overlapping function with other proteins in regulating cytokinesis. Gain and loss of function analyses reveal that Pom2 is required for maintaining mitochondrial morphology independently of microtubules. Intriguingly, most meiotic pom2Δ cells form aberrant asci with meiotic and/or forespore membrane formation defects. Taken together, Pom2 is a novel DYRK kinase involved in regulating cytokinesis, mitochondrial morphology, meiosis, and sporulation in fission yeast."

This study characterized the partitioning (par) system of this plasmid. The fragment that significantly increased the retaining stability of plasmids in Myxococcus cells in the absence of selective antibiotics contained three open reading frames (ORFs) pMF1.21-pMF1.23 (parCAB). The pMF1.22 ORF (parA) is homologous to members of the parA ATPase family, with the highest similarity (56%) to the Sphingobium japonicum ParA-like protein, while the other two ORFs had no homologs in GenBank. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the pMF1.23 (parB) product is a DNA-binding protein of iteron DNA sequences, while the product of pMF1.21 (parC) has no binding activity but is able to enhance the DNA-binding activity of ParB to iterons. The ParB protein autogenously repressed the expression of the par genes, consistent with the type Ib par pattern, while the ParC protein has less repressive activity. The ParB-binding iteron sequences are distributed not only near the partitioning gene loci but also along pMF1. These results indicate that the pMF1 par system has novel structural and functional characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2080092516,"Protists have traditionally been identified by cultivation and classified taxonomically based on their cellular morphologies and behavior. In the past decade, however, many novel protist taxa have been identified using cultivation independent ssu rRNA sequence surveys. New rRNA “phylotypes” from uncultivated eukaryotes have no connection to the wealth of prior morphological descriptions of protists. To link phylogenetically informative sequences with taxonomically informative morphological descriptions, we demonstrate several methods for combining whole cell rRNA-targeted fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with cytoskeletal or organellar immunostaining. Either eukaryote or ciliate-specific ssu rRNA probes were combined with an anti-α-tubulin antibody or phalloidin, a common actin stain, to define cytoskeletal features of uncultivated protists in several environmental samples. The eukaryote ssu rRNA probe was also combined with Mitotracker® or a hydrogenosomal-specific anti-Hsp70 antibody to localize mitochondria and hydrogenosomes, respectively, in uncultivated protists from different environments. Using rRNA probes in combination with immunostaining, we linked ssu rRNA phylotypes with microtubule structure to describe flagellate and ciliate morphology in three diverse environments, and linked Naegleria spp. to their amoeboid morphology using actin staining in hay infusion samples. We also linked uncultivated ciliates to morphologically similar Colpoda-like ciliates using tubulin immunostaining with a ciliate-specific rRNA probe. Combining rRNA-targeted FISH with cytoskeletal immunostaining or stains targeting specific organelles provides a fast, efficient, high throughput method for linking genetic sequences with morphological features in uncultivated protists. When linked to phylotype, morphological descriptions of protists can both complement and vet the increasing number of sequences from uncultivated protists, including those of novel lineages, identified in diverse environments."
https://openalex.org/W1995238730,"Linkage disequilibrium study represents a major issue in statistical genetics as it plays a fundamental role in gene mapping and helps us to learn more about human history. The linkage disequilibrium complex structure makes its exploratory data analysis essential yet challenging. Visualization methods, such as the triangular heat map implemented in Haploview, provide simple and useful tools to help understand complex genetic patterns, but remain insufficient to fully describe them. Probabilistic graphical models have been widely recognized as a powerful formalism allowing a concise and accurate modeling of dependences between variables. In this paper, we propose a method for short-range, long-range and chromosome-wide linkage disequilibrium visualization using forests of hierarchical latent class models. Thanks to its hierarchical nature, our method is shown to provide a compact view of both pairwise and multilocus linkage disequilibrium spatial structures for the geneticist. Besides, a multilocus linkage disequilibrium measure has been designed to evaluate linkage disequilibrium in hierarchy clusters. To learn the proposed model, a new scalable algorithm is presented. It constrains the dependence scope, relying on physical positions, and is able to deal with more than one hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms. The proposed algorithm is fast and does not require phase genotypic data."

Studies on SSBs from the prototype, Escherichia coli (EcoSSB) and, an important human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtuSSB) had shown that despite significant variations in their quaternary structures, the DNA binding and oligomerization properties of the two are similar. Here, we used the X-ray crystal structure data of the two SSBs to design a series of chimeric proteins (mβ1, mβ1′β2, mβ1–β5, mβ1–β6 and mβ4–β5) by transplanting β1, β1′β2, β1–β5, β1–β6 and β4–β5 regions, respectively of the N-terminal (DNA binding) domain of MtuSSB for the corresponding sequences in EcoSSB. In addition, mβ1′β2ESWR SSB was generated by mutating the MtuSSB specific ‘PRIY’ sequence in the β2 strand of mβ1′β2 SSB to EcoSSB specific ‘ESWR’ sequence. Biochemical characterization revealed that except for mβ1 SSB, all chimeras and a control construct lacking the C-terminal domain (ΔC SSB) bound DNA in modes corresponding to limited and unlimited modes of binding. However, the DNA on MtuSSB may follow a different path than the EcoSSB. Structural probing by protease digestion revealed that unlike other SSBs used, mβ1 SSB was also hypersensitive to chymotrypsin treatment. Further, to check for their biological activities, we developed a sensitive assay, and observed that mβ1–β6, MtuSSB, mβ1′β2 and mβ1–β5 SSBs complemented E. coli Δssb in a dose dependent manner. Complementation by the mβ1–β5 SSB was poor. In contrast, mβ1′β2ESWR SSB complemented E. coli as well as EcoSSB. The inefficiently functioning SSBs resulted in an elongated cell/filamentation phenotype of E. coli. Taken together, our observations suggest that specific interactions within the DNA binding domain of the homotetrameric SSBs are crucial for their biological function."
https://openalex.org/W1982763078,"Identifying emerging viral pathogens and characterizing their transmission is essential to developing effective public health measures in response to an epidemic. Phylogenetics, though currently the most popular tool used to characterize the likely host of a virus, can be ambiguous when studying species very distant to known species and when there is very little reliable sequence information available in the early stages of the outbreak of disease. Motivated by an existing framework for representing biological sequence information, we learn sparse, tree-structured models, built from decision rules based on subsequences, to predict viral hosts from protein sequence data using popular discriminative machine learning tools. Furthermore, the predictive motifs robustly selected by the learning algorithm are found to show strong host-specificity and occur in highly conserved regions of the viral proteome."
https://openalex.org/W2045601694,"Hypoxia and acidity are two main microenvironmental factors intimately associated with solid tumors and play critical roles in tumor growth and metastasis. The experimental results of Helmlinger and colleagues (Nature Medicine 3, 177, 1997) provide evidence of a lack of correlation between these factors on the micrometer scale in vivo and further show that the distribution of pH and pO(2) are heterogeneous. Here, using computational simulations, grounded in these experimental results, we show that the lack of correlation between pH and pO(2) and the heterogeneity in their shapes are related to the heterogeneous concentration of buffers and oxygen in the blood vessels, further amplified by the network of blood vessels and the cell metabolism. We also demonstrate that, although the judicious administration of anti-angiogenesis agents (normalization process) in tumors may lead to recovery of the correlation between hypoxia and acidity, it may not normalize the pH throughout the whole tumor. However, an increase in the buffering capacity inside the blood vessels does appear to increase the extracellular pH throughout the whole tumor. Based on these results, we propose that the application of anti-angiogenic agents and at the same time increasing the buffering capacity of the tumor extracellular environment may be the most efficient way of normalizing the tumor microenvironment. As a by-product of our simulation we show that the recently observed lack of correlation between glucose consumption and hypoxia in cells which rely on respiration is related to the inhomogeneous consumption of glucose to oxygen concentration. We also demonstrate that this lack of correlation in cells which rely on glycolysis could be related to the heterogeneous concentration of oxygen inside the blood vessels."

We analyze the method for different jitter-noise-combinations, using quantitative criteria to measure the achievement by the method. A phase diagram shows the remarkable potential of this method even under very unfavorable conditions of noise and jitter. Moreover, we provide a novel and compact analytical derivation of the upper and lower bounds on the number of steps observable in the ideal noiseless case, as a function of pattern length and embedding dimension. The quantitative measure developed combined with the ideal bounds can serve as guiding lines for determining potential periodicity in noisy data."
https://openalex.org/W2156505469,"Our manuscript presents a novel approach to protein structure analyses. We have organized an 8-dimensional data cube with protein 3D-structural information from 8706 high-resolution non-redundant protein-chains with the aim of identifying packing rules at the amino acid pair level. The cube contains information about amino acid type, solvent accessibility, spatial and sequence distance, secondary structure and sequence length. We are able to pose structural queries to the data cube using program ProPack. The response is a 1, 2 or 3D graph. Whereas the response is of a statistical nature, the user can obtain an instant list of all PDB-structures where such pair is found. The user may select a particular structure, which is displayed highlighting the pair in question. The user may pose millions of different queries and for each one he will receive the answer in a few seconds. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the data cube as well as the programs, we have selected well known structural features, disulphide bridges and salt bridges, where we illustrate how the queries are posed, and how answers are given. Motifs involving cysteines such as disulphide bridges, zinc-fingers and iron-sulfur clusters are clearly identified and differentiated. ProPack also reveals that whereas pairs of Lys residues virtually never appear in close spatial proximity, pairs of Arg are abundant and appear at close spatial distance, contrasting the belief that electrostatic repulsion would prevent this juxtaposition and that Arg-Lys is perceived as a conservative mutation. The presented programs can find and visualize novel packing preferences in proteins structures allowing the user to unravel correlations between pairs of amino acids. The new tools allow the user to view statistical information and visualize instantly the structures that underpin the statistical information, which is far from trivial with most other SW tools for protein structure analysis."
